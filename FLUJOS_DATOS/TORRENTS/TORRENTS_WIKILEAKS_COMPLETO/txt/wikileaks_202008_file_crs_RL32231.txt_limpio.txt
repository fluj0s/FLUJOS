and options updated may 5 2004 garrine p laney analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress racial profiling issues and federal legislative proposals and options summary in recent years racial profiling has drawn the attention of state and federal governments in this report racial profiling is defined as the practice of targeting individuals for police or security interdiction detention or other disparate treatment based primarily on their race or ethnicity in the belief that certain minority groups are more likely to engage in unlawful behavior assertions that law enforcement personnel at all levels unfairly target certain racial and ethnic groups particularly but not exclusively for traffic stops and searches have raised concerns about violations of the constitution major debate on racial profiling centers on whether the practice should be prohibited entirely and whether data on traffic stops and searches should be collected to determine if the practice is occurring this report analyzes the debate and focuses on legislative proposals on racial profiling before congress number of bills relating to racial profiling have been introduced in the 108th congress and have been referred to their respective committees of jurisdiction hres 515 hr 2364 title ii hr 3847 s 16 title v s 2112 and s 2132 some of these proposals include revisions or parts of proposals introduced during the 107th congress also this report analyzes legislative proposals that were introduced in the 107th congress they were varied and included provisions that would have defined racial profiling prohibited the practice required study of statistical data andor report of traffic stops set data collection standards established penalties for noncompliance furnished funding for grants provided for education and training and held law enforcement personnel legally accountable for engaging in racial profiling both the senate subcommittee on the constitution federalism and property rights and the house committee on government reform held hearings on racial profiling during the 107th congress there has been some recent presidential involvement on the issue of racial profiling on june 18 2003 president george w bush issued guidelines to bar federal agents from using race or ethnicity in routine investigations the guidelines however exempt investigations of terrorism and other national security concerns in 2001 the president instructed the attorney general to review the role of race in the decision of federal law enforcement authorities to conduct stops and searches to work with congress on procedures for data collection and to cooperate with state and local law enforcement to assess the extent and content of those procedures two federal agencies the bureau of justice statistics and the general accounting office have researched and published their findings on aspects of racial profiling the major recommendations for determining if racial profiling is occurring are to collect data on stops and searches by law enforcement officers and to use technology as an aid in detecting the practice the collection of data is controversial leading to questions about what to collect how to collect it who is to analyze it where the data would be housed and for how long what the collection of statistics would accomplish and whether its collection is an invasion of privacy this report will be updated when legislative activity occurs contents background 1 policy questions 2 how should

selected provisions 26 racial profiling issues and federal legislative proposals and options background there are many definitions of racial profiling for this report racial profiling is defined as the practice of targeting individuals for police or security interdiction detention or other disparate treatment based primarily on their race or ethnicity in the belief that certain minority groups are more likely to engage in unlawful behavior1 for years members of africanamerican and hispanic communities have complained that they were victims of profiling the circumstances under which profiling may occur vary for example allegations of racial profiling have been aimed at security personnel of department stores who suspect african american shoppers of stealing traditionally however accusations of racial profiling have resulted from encounters at traffic stops and have been directed at local and state police the impetus for police traffic stops and searches may be the perception that members of certain minority groups are more likely to be engaged in the illicit drug trade in searching for illicit drugs us customs agents and border patrol officers have been charged with racial profiling as well2 with the racial and ethnic makeup of the nation changing and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 other groups such as arab americans muslims and asian americans have joined the call for an end to racial profiling anecdotal accounts of racial profiling have been the basis for most complaints against the practice individuals reportedly have been subjected to racial profiling while walking shopping and driving sometimes black individuals are stopped and questioned by police if in the perception of the police these individuals are walking in the wrong neighborhood ie white neighborhood or uppermiddle class neighborhood3 other points of contact with law enforcement personnel that lead to allegations of racial profiling are airports and border points of entry more often however charges of racial profiling occur when person is driving vehicle and the driver or passengers of car based on the judgment of law enforcement personnel 1 charles dale

provisions relating to racial profiling4 s 16 daschle an omnibus civil rights bill includes provisions that would express sense of the senate that congress enact legislation banning racial profiling and requiring law enforcement at the federal state and local levels to prevent the practice hr 2364 engel among other provisions would amend provisions of the immigration and nationality act by establishing visa fairness commission to collect data on racial profiling by american embassies and us border and immigration inspectors because number of bills that were introduced in the 107th congress offered variety of approaches to addressing racial profiling this report provides detailed analysis of them some of these legislative proposals were directed specifically at certain federal agencies others at state law enforcement officials this report examines racial profiling and legislative proposals that affect law enforcement efforts5 policy questions racial profiling is complex and controversial issue in addressing the matter of racial profiling whether practiced at the state and local levels or in federal agencies to combat illicit drug activity or terrorism congress is faced with number of questions some of these questions are listed here followed by more detailed section on arguments on racial profiling how should profiling be defined there are many definitions of profiling with federal agencies states local jurisdictions and citizens all offering their own definitions some are more comprehensive than others racial profiling may be defined as all law enforcement activities that are initiated solely on the basis of race while another definition may focus only on the context of vehicle stops the term racial profiling can overemphasize race leaving out ethnicity gender or other considerations as factors that influence law enforcement action is racial profiling common or an exceptional practice studies that have attempted to measure the extent of racial profiling have been for the most part methodologically flawed while some studies have shown that minorities are disproportionately subjected to traffic stops and searches general accounting office gao report concluded that the studies did not distinguish between the 4 racial profiling is sometimes referred to as profiling and ethnic profiling 5 for fuller discussion of the action of state legislatures on racial profiling see crs report rl31950 racial profiling and traffic stops in the states selected issues and legislative approaches by sula p richardson for literature on racial profiling see crs report rs20954 racial profiling bibliographyinbrief by tangela g roe for legal issues see crs report rl31130 racial profiling legal and constitutional issues by charles v dale crs3 seriousness of traffic violations nor did the analyses provide information on which traffic violations if any were more likely to result in stop6 gao suggests that analyses examine whether different groups may have been at different levels of risk for being stopped because their rates andor severity of violating traffic laws differed in other words some racialethnic groups may commit more traffic violations such as speeding tailgating or having faulty equipment than other groups should data on stops and searches be collected supporters of data collection maintain that it can help determine if racial profiling is occurring can assist law enforcement agencies in becoming more effective in identifying problems and can indicate to the community level of commitment to unbiased policing opponents of data collection believe that it is not cost effective in addition they warn that it can harm relations between police and the community because despite the limitations of data collection there may be public perception that conclusions drawn from analyses of these data are valid sometimes law enforcement personnel and departments are unfairly disparaged based on data collection studies some feel the nature and extent of racial profiling cannot be determined by using social science methods who should be held accountable when racial profiling is practiced and how some feel that ultimately the head of an agency or department is responsible for establishing policies and procedures not staff in this view the top administrator must set the cultural tone of the agency in word and action checks and balances and review system can be established to ensure that laws policies and procedures relating to racial profiling are carried out at all levels in an acceptable fashion they suggest that those who violate established rules of operation should be provided training should be monitored in the future and if they continue to disregard official policy and procedure then they should be discharged from service others believe that to eliminate racial profiling there should be more severe consequences for individuals who practice it as well as their supervisors they want law enforcement agents and managers subject to civil suit opponents of lawsuits believe this is not good way to solve the problem they predict it will exacerbate tensions between police and minority communities and will cause valuable resources to be used defending law enforcement rather than battling crime should technology be used as tool in eliminating racial profiling it is generally accepted that technology can play an important role in identifying and eliminating racial profiling concerns however have been expressed about the sole reliance on technological devices to record traffic stop and passenger search occurrences some argue that the use of audiovideo technological devices invades the privacy of citizens 6 us general accounting office racial profiling limited data available on motorist stops gao report ggd0041 mar 2000 crs4 what data should be collected elements suggested for documentation in data collection include race ethnicity location of the traffic stop reasons for the stop searches conducted if any consent of vehicle occupants to the search identification and confiscation of contraband and action taken by law enforcement such as an arrest or issuance of ticket in addition at issue is uniform data collection on traffic stops some feel it is sufficient to collect data only on certain law enforcement actions eg arrests and issuance of tickets others argue that in order to accurately assess racial profiling data on all traffic stops must be recorded who will analyze the data collected the same data can yield very different interpretations depending upon who analyzes it some suggest that the collected data be analyzed not by affected law enforcement departments or agencies but by an outside group or persons with recognized training in statistics design and data analysis in this view objective analysts would more likely be associated with college or university or an independent social science research firm how should collected data be used some question the need and appropriateness for the mass collection of racial and ethnic data their data collection concerns are citizen privacy access to the material protection of the identity of individuals and law enforcement agents and maintenance storage and final disposition of the data who will provide funds for the cost of purchasing maintaining and storing technological equipment and data collected video technological devices are expensive they are costly to purchase require maintenance and need to be stored who will bear the cost of acquiring and maintaining this equipment is federal racial profiling legislation needed many argue that racial profiling is largely state and local problem and believe there is good reason for ordering federal law enforcement agencies to record the race and origin of everybody they question search or arrest they point to the current activity on racial profiling at both the state and local levels as an adequate response to the problem to the extent that there is problem7 some believe that law enforcement personnel are more than capable of correcting racial profiling and want to do so further they claim that not enough is known about the issue for congress to offer broad solutions that affect states and localities others question whether even at the federal level legislation is needed to eliminate racial profiling in the executive branch maintaining that if federal agency is engaging in the practice agency administrators can handle the problem by ordering an investigation and taking corrective action as needed supporters of federal action respond by pointing out that there are many approaches to correcting racial profiling and that this creates problem when comparative studies of different jurisdictions and agencies are made to determine the nationwide extent of the practice gao reported difficulty in determining whether race had been primary factor in motorist stops because the studies it examined had 7 see crs report rl31950 racial profiling and traffic stops in the states selected issues and legislative approaches by sula p richardson crs5 methodological limitations that subjected conclusions drawn from this data to serious challenge trying to compare studies was like comparing apples and nuts because of problems with data components others argue that states and localities use different strategies and policies to address racial profiling consequently an individuals protection against this unconstitutional practice varies depending upon the jurisdiction in which the stop or profiling incident happens according to this argument provisions of the constitution should uniformly protect citizens against racial profiling in all areas of the united states and federal legislation would ensure that this occurs further federal legislation requiring uniform data collection standards could offer comprehensive response to racial profiling and would allow more valid comparison of studies of racial profiling in different jurisdictions or agencies to be conducted8 arguments on racial profiling law enforcement has been accused of practicing racial profiling in the pursuit of two major goals to prevent illicit drug activity and to stop terrorists in the debate on the appropriateness of profiling some make distinction between the two according to polls conducted since 1999 the vast majority of americans disapprove of racial profiling when traffic stops are involved9 when questioned about racial profiling to identify terrorists however their response was quite different majority of americans polled approved of racial profiling to intercept terrorists because the terrorist attackers of september 11 2001 were identified as arabs many have asked for increased scrutiny of them majority of americans polled favored requiring arabs including those who are us citizens to undergo special more intensive security checks before boarding us airplanes nearly 50 of persons responding to one poll reportedly would support requiring arabs including those who are us citizens to carry special id10 according to another national poll of june 2002 conducted by opinion dynamics 54 percent of respondents approved of using racial profiling to screen arabmale airline passengers while 34 percent disapproved of the practice more recent national poll conducted between october 21 and november 25 2002 by cornell university indicated that 68 percent of respondents supported racial profiling as tool to fight terrorism11 some argue that an increased scrutiny of arabs is justified because the public safety issue should be the major factor in deciding whether to profile any group according to this view when practiced politely and respectfully racial profiling may be vital component 8 for

united states 63 were born in this country their appearance can vary from blond hair white skin and blue eyes to dark hair dark skin and brown eyes although they are often perceived as muslims the majority of arab americans are reportedly christian of the estimated 6 million muslims in the united states the largest group is african american not arab according to the economist magazine13 concern about terrorism also has prompted calls for profiling persons entering this country from specific geographic region of the world ie persons whose national origin is the middle east proponents of this practice argue that the lack of technological means to detect bombs and long delays caused by searching the luggage of passengers make effective screening nearly impossible also it is argued that were policy of profiling by national origin in place on september 11 2001 all 19 of the terrorists might have been intercepted those who oppose this strategy point out that muslims and people of middle eastern descent have migrated to countries around the world terrorists of middle eastern background could come from germany france or any country outside of the middle eastern region in addition the largest population of muslims about 200 million lives in indonesia they suggest that in searching for terrorists the emphasis should be on suspicious behavior14 some believe that racial profiling has been shown to be ineffective when used to identify persons involved in illicit drug activities in support of their argument they offer an orlando sentinel investigation of vehicle stops on an interstate highway in florida while nearly 70 of motorists stopped were black or hispanic only 5 of the drivers on that highway were minorities of the 1000 stops police made nine resulted in traffic ticket as another example they point to the new york attorney generals report that found stopandfrisk tactics on minorities were less likely to lead to arrests than stops of whites15 critics of using racial profiling to combat illicit drugs argue that despite rising rates of arrest and incarceration and record drug seizures drugs are more available than ever they also point to the difficulty in visibly discerning race or ethnicity16 12 stuart taylor jr the case for using racial profiling at airports national journal sept 22 2001 p 2877 13 the economist arabamericans suddenly visible sept 22

16 david borden executive director drug reform coordination network profiling and the drug war crs7 many civil rights advocates charge that racial profiling violates individuals constitutional rights specifically the fourth protects against unreasonable searches and seizures fifth protects against discrimination by federal law enforcement officers that is based on race ethnicity or national origin and the fourteenth amendment provides security and equal protection of the laws17 spokesmen for various law enforcement groups have commented on the practice of racial profiling recognizing the central and difficult position that law enforcement officers occupy in balancing individual rights and public safety in basic enforcement the international association of chiefs of police iacp states that if officers are perceived as biased in their actions it can foster mistrust and suspicion among some members of the public according to the iacp those persons who mistrust law enforcement officers often believe that police officers violate rather than protect their civil rights iacp states that although this perception is inaccurate it damages efforts to reduce crime because law enforcement agencies need community support to solve crimes therefore to build confidence in law enforcement the iacp opposes biased enforcement practices18 the national organization of black law enforcement executives noble another law enforcement group opposes racial profiling whether it is used to fight illicit drugs or terrorism on the grounds that it threatens our democratic way of life pointing to historical abuses that have occurred under the umbrella of national security for example the internment of japaneseamericans in world war ii spokesman for noble rejects justification of the practice on those grounds arguing further that people not race or ethnicity commit crime he questions linking an entire group of people to crime based on the behavior of few of that race or ethnicity he uses the following example blacks are responsible for 80 of reported crime in town but that doesnt mean that 80 of blacks commit crime more likely 5 of the towns black population is responsible for the high crime rate in addition he states that fear is the driving force behind demands for ethnic and racial profiling whether it is fear of crime and violence or fear of another terrorist attack and that bias prejudice and racism only add fuel to the fire of fear19 noble believes that over the past few years law enforcement has lost the respect and confidence of the public and that the heroic response of public safety officers to the terrorist attacks offers second chance to restore that trust and achieve national unity therefore it maintains that we should learn from our historical mistakes and be creative in addressing national challenges the fraternal order of police fop opposes the practice of stopping someone based solely on race because it is wrong to believe person is criminal based on 17 for legal analysis of the issue of racial profiling see crs report rl31130 racial profiling legal and constitutional issues by charles v dale 18 bruce d glasscock

skin according to spokesman for fop racism is never legitimate law enforcement tool20 he also states that statistically minorities have greater chance of being crime victims because crimes occur more frequently in areas with large minority population good policing means going after criminals and patrolling areas where crimes are committed this is good police work not racism21 collection of traffic stop data collecting data that might help in evaluating the relationship between race and traffic stops by law enforcement officers has been offered as the primary way of determining whether racial profiling is practiced but analyzing data on the nature character and demographics of law enforcement practices to determine racial profiling is very complex major problem with data collection is how to analyze data once collected since there are national datacollection standards or guidelines there is agreement on what racial profiling is or how to measure it for instance if blacks comprise 15 of citys population but 20 of the traffic stops is that evidence of racial profiling what if traffic stops for them were 30 should the number of searches conducted at traffic stops be recorded not only what information is collected but where it is collected is relevant should residential populations or driving populations be used are the population data used current census data may be 10 years old and may poorly reflect the changing populations in urban areas with increased mobility and immigration data collected in an urban area with dense poor minority population with few car owners will likely result in very different findings than data collected on an interstate highway where the driving population is likely to be more diverse the same data can result in divergent interpretations the challenge according to harvard law school professor margo schlanger is that legally it is very difficult to use statistics to determine police officers motivation officers can respond to statistics revealing that high percentage of blacks is indeed stopped and searched by saying that there are just more blacks who do suspicious things statistics alone cannot prove intentional discrimination22 when first proposed the international association of chiefs of police and the grand lodge fraternal order of police opposed the collection of data three police chiefs charged the methodology was flawed that was used in an aclu report which 20 steve young national vice president fraternal order of police testimony before the us senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on

practices and lessons learned us department of justice nov 2000 crs9 found their departments practiced racial profiling23 some groups deny that racial profiling occurs stating that police are using professional crimestopping methods others express concerns that the trafficstop data proposals would burden already overworked police forces and would run counter to police training efforts to teach officers not to consider race24 another argument of opponents is that resources might be better used fighting racially biased policing and the perceptions thereof rather than collecting data25 in 1999 the executive director of the fraternal order of police said it collecting data shortcuts meaningful dialogue between the police and the community if anything it exacerbates the gulf26 some oppose the federal governments mass collection of racial and ethnic data without good reason27 on the grounds that it is an invasion of privacy proponents of this view state that when police stop people because of racial or ethnic characteristics and not what they have done it is both wrong and bad police work to them the objective of wanting to do something about racial profiling is too vague to merit intrusion in our shrinking zone of privacy28 they also question the ultimate use of these data by 2000 however the international association of chiefs of police had joined other groups such as noble in support of legislation requiring collection of traffic stop data noble supports data collection citing the following reasons to build trust between law enforcement and minority communities to identify and stop inappropriate police conduct to improve police productivity by enabling police to use the most effective stopandsearch practices by assessing and studying the types of stops time spent on them and the results of such stops to reenforce to officers that racial profiling is not consistent with effective policing and with equal protection under the law to identify practices that some officers may be using subconsciously and to assist law enforcement departments in developing strategic ways to use the power at their disposal29 23 finn bullers three chiefs criticize aclus

2001 p 7 crs10 yet many police remain uncomfortable with data collection they fear that statistics fuel allegations of racism without offering clear solutions30 recognizing the complexity of data collection and the potential to abuse interpretation of statistics the international association of chiefs of police issued another statement in 2001 qualifying its endorsement of data collection the association will only support data collection legislation that ensures that an impartial and scientifically sound methodology will be used for evaluating collected data31 while some governmental agencies and private groups have collected data that suggest minorities are disproportionately the subject of routine traffic stops many law enforcement organizations challenge these findings to demonstrate how law enforcement results can be misinterpreted fop representative steven young cited an experience of the arlington county virginia police department in response to demands from the black community for increased enforcement against drug dealers in arlington county the police instituted aggressive motorvehicle checks and other actions to make dealers uncomfortable in the neighborhood their efforts however resulted in increased arrests of minorities and ironically left the police department vulnerable to accusations of disproportionately arresting minorities he argued that to use statistical data without an adequately sophisticated benchmark for analysis is bad policy32 efforts to rely on comprehensive data rather than anecdotal accounts to determine if racial profiling occurs in federal state or local law enforcement have proved troubling primarily because the lack of uniform data components makes the validity of comparing different studies questionable both of two federally sponsored studies conducted by the bureau of justice statistics bjs of the department of justice doj and the united states general accounting office gao found limitations in data components bureau of justice statistics study in 1999 the bureau of justice statistics conducted national survey of 193 million people aged 16 and older the survey examined how often and under what circumstances contact and traffic stops between police and us residents occurred key data elements included the number of licensed drivers vehicle stops and searches and race or ethnicity in the survey police searched the driver the vehicle or both for drugs alcohol stolen property or other evidence of criminal wrongdoing published in february 2001 the survey indicated that blacks were

enforcement officers used racial profiling the survey only provided data on how often people were stopped it did not address the question of whether blacks were more likely than whites to violate

on motorist stops on march 13 2000 gao reported that it found comprehensive source of information that could be used to determine if race had been primary factor in motorist stops problem associated with traffic data analysis is the small number of locations studied only five quantitative analyses were available and according to gao they were methodologically flawed gao stated that these analyses failed to provide conclusive empirical data from social science standpoint35 to determine the extent to which racial profiling may have occurred that is while the analyses included data on the relative proportion of minorities stopped on roadway gao believes that is only part of the information needed to assess the extent of racial profiling that may have occurred the best of the studies that gao analyzed determined the race of motorists at risk of being stopped and collected information on the number of travelers and traffic violations on specific roads but even this study did not distinguish between the gravity of different traffic violations these analyses did not provide information on which traffic violations if any were more likely to result in stop gao suggests that analyses fully examine the question of whether different groups may have been at different levels of risk for being stopped because they differed in their rates andor the severity of traffic law violations that is were some groups more likely than others to commit certain traffic violations such as speeding tailgating failing to give signal when changing lanes driving without license or without proper vehicle registration and equipment violations such consideration might determine if minority groups are stopped at the same rate that they violate traffic laws and if so might suggest that group members were stopped for particular traffic violations rather than for race or ethnicity36 despite these limitations gao found that in the studies it reviewed africanamerican and other minority motorists were proportionately more likely than whites to be stopped on the roadways studied37 34 us department of justice bureau of justice statistics contacts between police and the public findings from the 1999 national survey by patrick langan et bjs statisticians washington feb 2001 p 12 35 according to gao basic social science research principle is that studies rule out plausible alternative explanations for findings gao found that available research on racial profiling of motorists did not sufficiently rule out factors other than race to account for differences in stops see

issue of racial profiling has attracted the attention of both the clinton and bush administrations in 1999 the clinton administration determined that systematic collection of statistics on traffic stops that tracked the race ethnicity and gender of individuals stopped or searched by law enforcement was needed to establish where problems exist and to develop solutions therefore on june 9 1999 president clinton issued memorandum to the secretary of the treasury the attorney general and the secretary of the interior instructing them to design and implement such plan within 120 days they were to provide the president with information on departmental training programs policies and practices on using race ethnicity and gender in law enforcement activities after year each department was to submit to the attorney general summary of the information collected including complaints lodged by civilians claiming bias by law enforcement based on race ethnicity or gender how complaints were investigated and resolved and the results of any investigations in consultation with agency heads the attorney general was to report to the president on an evaluation of the field tests plan to broaden the data collection system and recommendation on providing the fair administration of law enforcement to all in response to the directive richard j gallo president of the federal law enforcement officers association stated that federal agencies do not do traffic stops38 clearly some federal agencies such as the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms of the department of the treasury and the federal bureau of investigation of doj do address criminal conspiracies and are concerned with longterm investigations rather than spot enforcement aware that most police work is performed by state and local agencies and not the federal government president clinton also urged state and local law enforcement agencies to collect data and analyze the results to determine if racial profiling was occurring39 the bush administration has not released reports on statistics on traffic stops that were completed during the clinton administration on february 27 2001 president george w bush issued memorandum to the attorney general directing him to review the role of race in the decision of federal law enforcement authorities to conduct stops searches and other investigative procedures further the president instructed the attorney general to develop in concert with congress procedures for collecting any relevant data from federal law enforcement agencies and in cooperation with state and local law enforcement to assess the extent and nature of those procedures40 38 steven holmes clinton orders investigation on possible racial profiling new york times june

the end racial profiling act of 2001 but further action was taken on it the bills contained provisions that would have defined racial profiling prohibited the practice established standards that would have included report on racial profiling required collection of data required study of statistical data provided for civil suits provided for complaint process required training and protected the privacy of individuals because of the variety and comprehensiveness of legislation on racial profiling that was proposed in the 107th congress following are selected provisions and the bills that contained them for tabular presentation of this information see table 4 definition the four racial profiling bills that specifically would have defined the term were hr 1907 racial profiling prohibition act of 2001 hr 2074s 989 end racial profiling act of 2001 and s 799 reasonable search standards act all of these bills would have prohibited law enforcement officer from relying solely on

whether the driver was engaged in criminal behavior that justified the search whether any items were seized including money or contraband whether warning or citation was made whether an arrest was made and why and whether immigration status was questioned or an inquiry was made to the immigration and naturalization service the attorney general would have designated what agency would have received this data hr 1778 contained data collection provisions similar to s 19 except that it would have required the data to include whether any occupant of the vehicle was turned over to immigration officials both bills would have required the attorney general after performing an initial analysis of existing trafficstops data on racial profiling to use the above data provided by law enforcement agencies to conduct nationwide study of police stops for traffic violations not later than 120 days after enactment of this legislation the attorney general would have been required to

and portable computer systems developing and acquiring early warning systems that enable the officers engaged in or likely to engage in racial profiling or other misconduct to be identified establishing procedures for receiving and responding responsibly to complaints of misconduct by law enforcement officers and installing management systems that would hold supervisors accountable for the actions of their subordinates state and federal policy requirements to eliminate racial profiling under provisions of hr 2074s 989 any state or governmental unit that applied for funding under covered federal program would have had to certify that program participants had effective policies and procedures to eliminate racial profiling and to stop practices that encouraged racial profiling policies and procedures that would have been established for state and federal law enforcement agencies would have included prohibiting racial profiling collecting data on routine investigatory activities so that determination can be made if law enforcement officers are practicing racial profiling and submitting that data to the attorney general establishing independent procedures for

results of the search and whether warning citation or arrest occurred as result of the stop noncompliance under provisions of hr 2074s 989 if the attorney general determined that state was not complying with provisions to eliminate racial profiling the attorney general could have withheld all or part of certain federal grants until compliance was established the bill would have provided opportunities for private party to report grantee that violated antiracial profiling provisions measures such as hr 965 and hr 1907 would have used federal funds for highways under the interstate system and the national highway system to ensure that provisions prohibiting racial profiling were adopted and that standards were enforced maximum of 10 of funds apportioned to state could have been withheld for noncompliance states funds would have been held for three fiscal years before lapsing accountability to receive funding under covered grant hr 2074s 989 would have required federal state or governmental unit to have procedures for disciplining law enforcement agents who use racial profiling although the specific disciplinary procedures were not outlined in the bill standards several bills would have required either the attorney general or the commissioner of the us customs service to submit report summarizing data collected on routine investigatory activities bills also would have required federal agencies and states to establish standards for the collection of data and to review the effectiveness of procedures used to end the practice of racial profiling collection of data some legislative proposals were directed at federal agencies and others at states in requiring racial profiling data collection both hr 1996 and s 799 would have required the commissioner of us customs to conduct annually study on detentions and searches of persons by the agencys personnel during the preceding calendar year that would have included the race gender and citizenship of travelers searched the type of search conducted and the results of the search hr 2074s 989 would have required the attorney general to establish standards for the collection of data later than six months after passage of the act including standards for setting benchmarks against which collected data could be measured specifically the data collected would have included stops searches seizures and arrests to determine if law enforcement agencies were practicing racial profiling and to monitor the effectiveness of policies and procedures established to eliminate the practice crs21 both s 19

naturalization service was made on car passengers whether the vehicle was searched and if permission was requested for the search whether warning or citation was issued whether anyone was arrested any alleged criminal behavior by the driver that justified the search any items seized including contraband or money and the duration of the stop hr 1778 also would have required comparison of the number of stops made within 25 miles of the united statesmexican border with the number of stops made within 25 miles of the united statescanadian border in order to have federal funds fully apportioned to state for use on federalaid highways hr 1907 would have required the state to maintain and allow public inspection of statistical information on every motor vehicle stop made by law enforcement agent on federalaid highway reports hr 2074s 989 provided that not later than two years after the enactment of the act and then annually the attorney general would have had to submit report to congress on racial profiling by federal state and local law enforcement agencies that would have summarized data collected on routine investigatory activities also the report would have included information on the status of racial profiling policies and procedures implemented by federal and state law enforcement agencies hr 1996 and s 799 would have required similar information from the us customs service as noted earlier in addition the commissioner of customs would have been required to submit report to congress by march 31 of each year on the results of the study conducted the preceding calendar year civil suits only hr 2074s 989 would have permitted victim of racial profiling to seek injunctive relief from the practice by filing civil suit against the government employing law enforcement agent practicing racial profiling an agent of such unit and any supervisor of the agent the suit could have been filed in either state court or in district court of the united states if routine investigatory activities of law enforcement officers in jurisdiction had disparate impact on racial or ethnic minorities that would have been prima facie evidence of racial profiling further if the plaintiff prevailed in the lawsuit the plaintiff could have received reasonable reimbursement for attorney and expert fees crs22 complaints hr 2074s 989 would have provided funding for best practices development grants to support establishment of independent procedures at both the state and federal levels for receiving investigating and responding to complaints of racial profiling by law enforcement officers bill provisions would have provided funding to establish system for disciplining law enforcement agents who practice racial profiling and at the state level their supervisors but did not state what the disciplinary measures should be education and training bills that would have provided for training for law enforcement agents at the federal andor state levels were hr 1996 hr 2074s 989 s 799 and s 2114 hr 1996 would have required customs service inspectors and officials to have periodic training on procedures for detaining and searching travelers without the use of racial profiling s 799 would have required review of why customs service personnel conducted certain searches the results of the searches conducted and the effectiveness of the searches in detecting contraband hr 2074s 989 would have required that law enforcement officers receive training both to prevent racial profiling and to improve their interaction with the public s 2114 would have authorized the attorney general to establish in consultation with law enforcement agencies and civil rights groups education and awareness programs on racial profiling and the negative effects of the practice on individuals and law enforcement the purposes of the programs would have been to encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to stop racial profiling and to assist them in developing and maintaining adequate policies and procedures to do so this bill would have provided for evaluation of best practices of programs privacy bills containing provisions that would have protected the identity of any individual or law enforcement officer involved in traffic stop include hr 1778 and hr 2074s 989 s 19 and hr 1907 would have provided for the protection only of the identity of the driver of car stopped congressional hearings 108th congress to date hearing has been held on racial profiling in the 108th congress 107th congress senate subcommittee on the constitution federalism and property rights the senate subcommittee on the constitution federalism and property rights of the judiciary committee on august 1 2001 held hearing on s 989 the end racial profiling act of 2001 some witnesses for example david harris law professor university of toledo college of law testified in support of the bills provisions that would have required doj study of traffic stops would have required data collection and training and would have offered grants to law enforcement agencies to them these just continued state and local law enforcement cooperative efforts to enhance public safety other witnesses including reuben m greenberg chief of police charleston south carolina police department crs23 expressed concerns about certain provisions of the bill they questioned whether the legislation would interfere in an area that states and localities are currently and legitimately addressing some opposed mandatory data collection and provisions that would deny funds to states and localities that do not comply with federal mandates representing the grand lodge fraternal order of police steve young opposed provisions that would have used statistical data against law enforcement officers and agencies in court young believed that the bill rather than repairing the bonds of trust and respect between law enforcement and minority communities would widen them because it presumed that racist tactics are commonly used by police departments according to him the definition of racial profiling was too broad because unless there was an eyewitness or specific description of suspects race or ethnicity law enforcement officer could never use race as factor in an investigation43 house committee on government reform on july 19 2001 the house government reform committee held hearing that focused on technology as tool to eliminate racial profiling44 witnesses identified advantages and disadvantages of using the two major visual technologies analog and digital in traffic stops these surveillance systems are often mounted in the grill on the dash or on the roof of car with recorder placed in the trunk similar to the home vhs video cassette recorder the analog video simply records an image on tape and the tapes are kept for certain period of time and then either discarded or reused with digital technology the recorded image is converted into digital file and recorded on either tape flash memory cards hard drives cd roms or dvd discs the advantages of video technologies are they provide an objective documentation of events that the camera can see and hear the material can be reviewed by supervisors and researchers and they can influence in positive way the behavior of citizen and law enforcement officer video tapes also can be used as teaching tool for law enforcement officers disadvantage of using video technologies is that if relied upon solely to detect racial profiling the device usually sees less than the officer can cameras may not show what precipitated the stop before filming began the purchase price 3000 5000 per video camera and maintenance of equipment are expensive maintenance is expensive because of the number of tapes used typically six patrol cars use over 500 tapes each month of storage facilities that would be needed and of the review of videos that supervisor would have to conduct many systems are improperly installed and poorly maintained resulting in poor audio and image quality most installations allow the operator to rerecord which could result in tampering finally privacy concerns are raised in using technological devices 43 testimony of steve young national vice president of the grand lodge fraternal order of police in the us senate subcommittee on the constitution federalism and property rights
