crs specialist joseph cant or originally coauthored this reportcampaign finance legisl ation and activity in the 109th congress summary during the 109th congress 51 bills were introduced to change the nations campaign finance laws primar ily under titles 2 and 26 of the us code these bills 43 in the house and 8 in the senate sought to change the current system including tightening perceived loopholes two of those bills passed the house but bill passed both chambers therefore statutory changes occurred in federal campaign finance law during the 109th congress although the 109th congress chose not to enact campaign finance legislation congress nonetheless considered dozens of bills addressing wide variety of topics in summarizing that legislation this re port identifies 14 major topics categories addressed in the bills these categories are diverse ranging from changing individual contribution limits to regulatin g independent expenditures although some bills called for increased regulati on others proposed less regulation hence legislative activity during the 109th congress reflected longstanding debate in campaign finance policy over extending regulation of campaign finance practices versus limiting the reach of such regulation the most prominent legislation introduced during the 109th congress and that which advanced farthest through the legislative process focused on political organizations operating under section 527 of the internal revenue code but outside federal election law sponsors of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra offered bills to require that 527s as these organizations are popularly known involved in federal elections comply fully with federal election law the senate rules and adminis tration committee reported such measure s 1053 in may 2005 but further action occurred in the senate the house administration committee reported two 527 bills with starkly different approaches hr 513 the 527 reform act of 2005 th counterpart to s 1053 and hr 1316 which sought to address the 527 issue i ndirectly by loosening restrictions on funding sources per mitted under federa l campaign finance law in april 2006 the house passed hr 513 as amended but th senate took action on the bill legislation proposing 527 reform ter became component of the 109th congress debate over lobbying reform the text of hr 513 was eventually incorporated into the house republican lead erships lobbying and ethics reform bill hr 4975 which passed the house in may 2006 the senatepassed lobbying bill did not contain the 527 provisions di sagreement between the two chambers on the 527 issue reportedly contributed to ne ither lobbying reform nor 527 regulation legislation being enacted during the 109th congress this report1 will not be updated because it refl ects the complete record of 109th congress proposals and activity in this area it may be used to provide basis for legislation that could be offered in the 110th

senate hr 1316 sought to address the 527 issue indirectly by loosening restrictions on funding sources within feca by so doing proponents maintained that because more money could be directed to regulated sources there would be fewer incentives for political money to flow to 527 groups operating outside the feca framework on june 9 2005 house administration voted to report hr 1316 favorably as ame nded and it was re ported on june 223 on june 29 2005 the committee held markup of h r 513 and ordered it reported as amended to reflect the sponsors changes without recommendation4 this set

administration committee in addition it included the same provision as was included in the housepasse d version of hr 513 to remove the political party coordinated expenditure limits prior to house passage of hr 4975 nother amendment unrelated to 527s was included in the bill by the house rules committee to allow leadership pacs funds to be transferred without limitation to national party co mmittees as is the case with funds in candidates pr incipal campaign committees7 on may 3 2006 the house passed by vote of 217213 hr 4975 the lobbying accountability and transparency act of 2006 which included th text of hr 513 shaysmeehan as well as the amendments on leadership pa cs and party coordi nated expenditures8 after passing hr 4975 the house subs tituted it for the text of s 2349 the

contributed to the 109th congress enacting neither lobby reform nor 527 regulation legislation party coordinated expenditures party coordinated expenditures refer to expenditures made by political party in coordination with candidates campaign they have been subject to limits since the 1974 feca am endments codified in 2 usc 441ad the limits are relatively high compared with the 5000 limit on contributions most party committees may give directly to candidate campaigns in 2006 for example parties could make up to 79200 in coordinated expenditure s in support of househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33836crs4 9 the 79200 figure assumes that state pa rty committees authorize national party committees to make coordinated expenditures on their behalf which they are permitted by law to do the limit for national or state party is 39600 meaning that if state party authorizes national party to make coordina ted expenditures on its behalf the total limit would be 79200 these limits are addressed in the calculating 2006 coordinated party expenditure limits section of the following fec document which is apparently untitled at httpwwwfecgovpdf441ad2006pdf 10 the 158400 figure assumes that state party committees authorize national party committees to make coordinated expenditures on their behalf for states with the smallest populations the coordinated expenditure limit fo r state party committee or national party committee is 79200 the cumula tive limit if state party committees authorize national party committees on their beha lf would be therefore 158400 11 see democratic party totals in nationa l party federal financial activity through the end of the election cycle accompanying federal election commission party financial activity

the supreme court ruling in colorado republican federal campaign committee v fec 518 us 604 1996 wh ich permitted parties to make independent expenditu res on behalf of their ca ndidates the importance of coordinated expenditures has been diminished the prospect of unlimited independent expenditures has been increasin gly appealing to the parties and it has become common for parties to make both independent expenditu res and coordinated expenditures for the same candidates albeit from at least nominally different departments of party committee in 2004 democratic part committees federal state and local made 331 million in coordinated expend itures and 1765 million in independent expenditures to promote their federal candidates11 by contrast republican party committees made 291 millio n in coordinated expenditures and 880 million in independent expenditures12 as of this writing data for the complete 2006 cycle were not yet available as enacted the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra contained provision to require party to choos between making either independent expenditures or coordinate d expenditures but not both for one of its nominees this however was one of two bcra provi sions struck down by the supreme court in mcconnell v fec 549 us 932003 hence although abolishing the limit on coordinated expenditures would appear to allow the parties to spend unlimited amounts on behalf of their candidates thr ough independent expenditures they already have that right albeit through expenditure s that are technically made without any coordination with the favored candida supporters of removing the limits on coordinated expenditure s assert that doing so woul d largely signal acceptance of campaign reality and allow parties to reinforce their direct

contrast soft money refers to funds raised and spent outside the federal election regulatory framework but which may have at least an indirect impact on federal electionsmajor reforms proposed by category as explained previously campaign finance bills introduced in the 109th congress covered wide range of topics although many of the bills at first appear to have had little in common all the bills focused on major campaign finance issues this section of the report is organized into 14 subsections encompassing the 13 major areas of proposed changes in campaign finance regulation found in 109th congress bills the 14th subsection miscella neous includes provisions outside that framework these are the same categories listed in table 1 each subsection contains brief introductory statement bout proposed changes followed by listing of bills containing those proposed changes later in this report bills are listed by number followed by detailed summaries of all major provisions contained in each bill and any action taken on them in this section bills are listed accordin g to what appears to have been the primary nature and goal of particular provision many provisions however had multiple purposes for example bill that would have raised the limit on an individuals contributions to political parties would have empowered both the individual and the political party such pr ovision would be listed here under individual because it would have most directly affected what an individual might do although the parties would have benefitted as well categorization and ordering of bills in this report is solely for the purpose of organization and does not reflect any judgement by crs as to the relative impor tance or merit of the bills themselves the first six categories can be examined in the context of hard money since they pertain to types of activity that ar fully regulated under federal election law which specifies prohibited sources sets limits on permitted contributions and requires disclosure20 the six hard money categories are shown on the checklist in table 1 under larger heading hard money with the first four individuals pacs parties and ca ndidates further grouped to re flect the principal sources of campaign receipts the fifth category deals with instate or indistrict requirements for campaign receipts while the sixt h addresses indepe ndent expenditures the eighth and ninth categories c over provisions that dealt with soft money those activities largely or fully outside the framework of federal election law which have been major focus of reform efforts in recent years the eighth category contains provisions relating to party soft money which was largely addressed in bcra but where some issues remain the ninth category focuses on nonparty soft money activities of unions corporations and taxexempt organizations particularly 527 organizations in federal elections it also deals with electionrelated issue advocacy which is closely relate d to activities of 527s and other outside groups the seventh category coordina tion has applicability to both hard and soft money activities and is so designatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33836crs13 category 10 addresses propos als for public financing or benefits and spending limits in congressional elections the 11th category labeled fec addresses proposals to improve enforcement and disclosure by the

the irs much debate has ensued since 2004 as to whet her their electionre lated activities should require full regulation unde r federal election law21 in large measure what has been fu eling the issue over 527s and other tax exempt organizations has been the practice of electionrelated issue advocacy prior to bcras enactment some observers b ecame concerned about communications that promoted political issues in reference to candidates but which by avoiding specific election advocacy language eg elect jone s or defeat smith were not subject to regulation under federal election law these i ssue advocacy communications contrasted with those that explicitly promoted the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates class of co mmunications known as express advocacy since the courts had generally construed express advocacy communications in narrow sense ie using explicit phras advocating election or defeat communications that may have been perceived as constituting thinly veiled
