warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285global climate change lowering cost estimates through emissions trading some dynamics and pitfalls summary major element in the debate about global climate change has been how t minimize costs by selecting the most economically efficient strategies to reduc greenhouse gases with the negotiation of the kyoto protocol internationa l emissions trading has become focal point of attention indeed the administration believes that the goals of the kyoto protocol can not be achieved without effective emissions trading international emissions trading is one of four flexibilit mechanisms contained in the kyoto protocol article 17 review of ex isting cost analyses of us compliance with the kyoto protocol indicates consensus that the potential for international emission trading to reduce us compliance cost under the k yoto protocol is substantial and indisputable however whether the potential for international emissions trading can be turned into fact i s more problematic this analysis suggests that implementing international emission s trading under kyoto would represent uncharted territory for us environmenta l policy first an international emissions trading scheme has to function very efficiently to achieve the savings projected by analyses for example the administration s analysis relies on an unprecedented amount of international trading to achieve th substantial cost reduct ion it projects under its most aggressive scenario 8288 of the us reduction requirement would be bought from foreign sources th magnitude of transactions not only raises questions of its feasibility but also ma conflict with the intent of the kyoto protocol which states that internationa l emissions trading is to be supplemental to domestic actions second besides the amount of trading estimated th sources of these reductions raise additional questions for example according to an analysis by charles rive r associates half the estimated savings from international emissions trading woul d come either from socalled hot air credits that countries of the former soviet union have available because of their economic difficulties or from transactions with third world countries that are not required to participate in the program third while the us acid rain emiss ions trading program is cited as model for international carbon trading in fact unlike an international carbon trading program the acid rain program does not have to operate particularly efficiently to achiev substant ial cost savings the simplest trades those between companys ow n plants achieve the greatest cost savings under the acid rain program thus th us acid rain emissions trading program provides little guidance to any futur international carbon trading program the

climate change lowering cost estimates through emissions trading some dynamics and pitfalls overview importance of emission trading to kyoto compliance united states concerns about implementing the kyoto protocol focus on three interlinked issues 1 the considerable uncertainty and risk of substantial cost from carbon dioxide co abatement 2 the competitive impacts of compliance bot h 2 domestically and internationally and 3 the comprehensiveness of the protocol s scope in particular the exclusion of third world countries from any co reductio n 2 program these implementation concerns along with perceived scientifi c1 uncertainty have prevented any serious effort by the administration to seek senate ratification of the kyoto protocol removal of any one of the three interlinked issues might significantly improve the prospects for approval of the kyoto protocol or some other regime to contro l greenhouse gas emissions for example if the cost of kyoto compliance could b shown to be not as burdensome as some have suggested the competitive impac t would be weakened and the concern about comprehensiveness would lessen such concerns along with scie ntific doubt would not be eliminated however they would be attenuated such task would not be easy estimates of costs to reduce co emissions vary2 greatly and focus attention on an estimators basic view about the problem and the future rather than on simple t echnical differences in economic assumptions some2 of these lenses through which people view the problem and their effects on cos t analysis are summarized in table 1 based on these perspectives the cost f complying with kyoto can appear to range from none or indeed positiv benefit to an estimate so high as to potentially bank rupt the economy for example the american petroleum institute in summarizing the results of several studie s concludes that kyoto compliance would require heavy taxes or high carbon permit prices to be achieved resul ting in sharp

the reductio n requirements of kyoto none of the perspectives on4 which these analysis are based is inherently more right or correct than another rather they overlap and to varying degrees complement and conflict with each other people hold to each of th lenses to some degree the uncertainties about the risk of global climate change and the critical impacts of differing assumptions about th nature of the problem effectively preclude predictions of the ultimate costs f reducing greenhouse gases as result attention has focused on how to minimize costs by selecting the most economically efficient strategies to reduce co emission s with the negotiation of the 2 kyoto protocol the mechanism that has become the centerpiece of this attention is emissions trading indeed ja net yellen chair of the president council of economic advisors has stated that the promis of kyoto can not be achieved without effective emissions trading 5 emissions tradin g is one of four flexibility mechanisms contained in the kyoto protocol article 17 under the kyoto protocol developed countries are give n6 greenhouse gas emissions budgets for the compliance period 20082012 based on percentage of their 1990 or 1995 emissions levels depending on the particula r greenhouse gas if country determined that it would exceed its emissions limi t during the compliance period emissions trading would permit it to purchase emissions reduction s ie credits from another country that determined it would hav e7 achieve d more emissions reductions than necessary to comply with emission s trading cou ntries that can make relatively inexpensive emissions reductions have an incentive to reduce emissions below the level require d by the kyoto protocol and sell the extra credits to other countries whose emissions control costs are morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs3 table 1 climate change perspectives and policy parameters approach problem mitigation program costsseriousness of risk in developing technology is

vironmental values seen as trivializing that economics can the issue not readily quantify and monetizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs4 although called nnex 1 countries in reference to annex 1 of the framework convention8 on climate change fccc the correct reference is to annex b of the kyoto protocol the lists of countries in annex 1 and annex b are very similar but not identical crs uses the common usage term annex 1 in this report article 17 kyoto protocol9 the montreal protocol is an international environmental treaty designed to protect th e10 stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the global production of ozonedepleting chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbonsexpensive thus both the seller and the buyer would have lower costs by virtue of the sellers profit and the buyers savings this mechanism however comes with significant restrictions under the kyoto protocol first emissions trading is restricted to countries that have legally binding greenhouse gas emission limitations commonly called annex 1 parties onl developed industrialized countri are included this restriction also applies to two8 of the other three mechanisms bubbles and joint implem entation projects only the clean development mechanism cdm can be employed for transactions betwee n annex 1 countries and countries without legally binding requirements ie developing countries the specifics of this mechanism are yet to be defined second restriction to trading is the requirement that it be supplemental t domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitations an d reduction commitments however the protocol is vague as to wha t9 supplemental means and the term is subject to continuing negotiation some parties have suggested third restriction on trading with respect to how reductions are accomplished specifically some have argued th at trading be restricted to transactions where the t raded carbon credits are the result of explicit controls that reduce greenhouse gases and not because of economic downturns or other event s separate from the protocol this issue aris as several countries of the former soviet union are projected to have sizeable amounts of credits available for sale because of current economic diffic ulties proponents of trading restrictions argue that such hot air reductions would have occurred anyway and would weaken the protocol s targets these concerns are heightened by the failure of russia and seven othe r members of the former soviet union countries to comply with the montrea l protoco l because of economic difficulties the same difficulties that woul d10 create the hot air credits however the kyoto protocol places restriction on the means countries may use to comply with reduction requirements thus this position may be difficult to sustain in negotiation because trading is central feature of costs analyses of the kyoto protocol this paper analyzes some of the dynamics an d pitfalls of carbon trading based on various analyses done on us compliance with the kyoto protocol as the analysi s conducted by the administration has become the focus of much of the cost debate it receives special emphasis

dynamics of trading several attempts have been made to estimate the cost of us compliance with the terms of the kyoto protocol seventeen estimates by eight different organizations are shown in figure 1 in terms of the discussion in table 1 these estimates are the11 result of topdown analyses although some have more aggressive assumption s about market penetration rates for new more energy efficient technologies tha n others several bottomup technologyoriented analyses of potential carbo n reductions under various scenarios have been conducted however these analyses rely on assumed availability and penetration of various energyefficient and w carbon technologies not international emissions tra ding to achieve their cost savings and so are not reviewed here indeed recently released bottomup analysi s12 conduct ed by the tellus institute expresses concern that the flexibility mechanism s contained in t he kyoto protocol could threaten environmental integrity and result in misguided policies that could actually increase costs in the long term 13 most analyses of the kyoto protocol either exclude emissions trading or limi t trading to the developed countries covered b the protocol annex 1 countries the latter assumption is consistent with the intent and language of the protocol developing countries participation in emission trading is restricted to clea n

efficienc improvement rate than cra second the administration assumes higher elasticity f substitution between coal and natural gas these more aggressive assumptions by th administration are consistent with its technological view of kyoto implementation fo r more on that view see table 1figure 1reduce the projected costs of us compliance with the kyoto protocol th promise of international emissions trading appears to be indisputable based n existing analyses to examine this little further two organizations conducted cost analyses for three different trading scenarios those estimates calculated by the administration and by cha rles river associates cra are provided in figure 2 as indicated moving from trading posture to an annex 1 trading posture lowered the cos t estimates by 60 cra to 68 administration according to these analyses if the kyoto protocol permitted full glo bal trading the costs would be lowered by 83 cra to 88 administration these analyses agree on the potential cos t reductions presented by emissions trading potential that increases as the pool f potential participants increase thi s agreement on tradings effect on costs is evident despite the significant disagreement on what the actual compliance costs under th kyoto protocol might be15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs7 figure 2 another important dynamic with respect to trading illustrated in figure 2 is the importan ce of hot air credits to reducing costs as noted earlier hot air credits is rather pejorative term used to describe potentially large pool of co credits2 available from the former soviet union this pool of perhaps 200 million metric tons of carbon according to doe estimates results from the substantial reduction i n economic activity in the for mer soviet union since 1990 the baseyear for the kyoto protocol if these credits are dumped on t he market during the fiveyear compliance period 20082012 credit prices would be depressed reducing compliance costs as indicated in the cra analysis likewise without the availability of these credits the cost of us compliance under kyoto could be substantially higher this substantial cost savings projected under the cra analysis illustrates wh the administration opposes any restriction on hot air credits an increase in th available pool of credit for sale would tend to reduce the p rice of credits in the trading market for country like the united states which is projected to be very active in the trading market lower credit prices would translate into lower compliance costs all else being equal indeed the lower cost estimates of the administrations analysis is partially the result of trading system that is assumed to be very free and unconstrained i nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs8 figure 3essence the administration assumes the trading system will work very well indeed just how well is indicated by f igure 3 in order to gain the 68 cost reduction from emission trading between annex 1 countries discussed above 61 of the necessary carbon credits must be bought from other annex 1 countries in order to gain th 88 reducti ons in costs from global trading 82 of the necessary carbon credit s must be bought from other countries in maximum trading scenario developed by the administration up to 88 of carbon credits would be purchased from othe r countries this scale of potential trading may put any resulting us implementatio n strategy in conflict with restrictions contained in the kyoto protocol and with th negotiating position of other parties to the protocol as noted earlier according to the protocol international emissions trading is to be supplemental implementation tool to domestic efforts according to the latest european union position supplemental means more than 50 if the european standard was adopted i n negotiation the estimated savings from trading would be substantially reduced two conclusions emerge from this r eview first there is little debate among the analyses that emission trading could reduce us compliance cost under kyoto indeed the percentage reductions resulting from increased trading do not diffe rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs9 for further discussion see larry b parker robert d poling and john l moore clean16 air act allowance trading 21 environmental law 4 1991 pp 20232068 greatly rathe r the dispute is over how well such program would work second it is the assumption of the administrations analysis that trading will work extremely well resulting in substantially l ower costs for the united states this possibility may be difficult to achieve given restrictions contained within the kyoto protocol th negotiating position of some of the other parties and the sources from which many of the credits are projected to come moreover current efforts to devise workable trading system suggest that it will be difficult and lengthy process at best implementation pitfalls comparison with acid rain the importance of trading to cost estimates and the scope to which it i s employed by the administration in its analysis has direct parallel in any existin g environmental program the closest example of such trading program is the acid rain program under title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments however significa nt differences between acid rain and possible global warming limit th usefulness of title iv as an analogy for an international carbon trading system for example the acid rain program involves up to 3000 new and existing electri c generating facilities that contribute twothirds of the countrys sulfur dioxide so 2 and onethir d of its nitrogen oxide nox emissions the two primary precursors of acid rain this concentration of sources makes the logistics of emissions tradin g manage able and enforceable however co emissions are not so concentrated 2 although over 95 of the co generated comes from fossil fuel combustion onl 2 about 33 comes from electricity generation transportation accounts for abou t 33 direct residential and commercial use about 12 nd direct industrial use about 20 thus small dispersed sources in these other areas are far more important i n controlling co emissions than they are in controlling so emissions this create s 2 2 significant administrative and enforcement problems for an international emission s trading program if it attempts to be comprehensive these concerns multiply as the global nature of the program is considered along with the number of greenhous gases that would be included in it in addition to the substantive differences in the problems the trading dynamics of national so trading and international co trading are different as indicated b 2 2 figure 4 the largest projected saving from emission trading under the so program2 is from permitting relatively simple and uncomplicated trading between utilitys own facilities an additional ten percent can be gained by permitting intrastate trading however expanding the boundaries of the trading to inte rstate trading does not result in as dramatic cost reductions as for intracompany trading for implementatio n policy this is very significant as it suggests that the so trading program does t 2 have to work very efficiently to achieve large proportion of the economic benefits that have been estimated given the increasing regulatory and administrativ complexity of expanding the scope f trading to regional levels the trading dynamics suggest that such complexity can be avoided at little loss of economic efficiency16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs10 figure 4 however although the positive effects of trading have been borne out in the first few years of the so program it is not necessarily harbinger of the potential cost 2 savings from an international carbon trading program first the baselines fo r measuring cost savings are different for the acid rain program unitbyuni t allocation of reduction with absolutely trading is the baseline from which cos t savings from trading are measure d for carbon trading program the baseline is an interstate or intracountry trading scenario from which cost savings fro m international trading is measured thus the maximum trading scenario estimate d under the acid rain program intersta trading is the baseline scenario for measuring the effect of intercountry tra ding under carbon trading in essence the trading scenario of the carbon trading prog ram is the interstate trading scenario of the acid rain program thus the scope of international carbon trading is well beyond that of the title iv program second the tr ading dynamic under the so program discussed above contrasts2 strongly with that projected under an international carbon trading program s indicated in figure 5 under an international carbon trading program only half th anticipated savings from trading occur in transactions between developed annex 1 countries about fifth of the savings projected by charles river associates is the result of hot air credits finally about quarter to third of the anticipated savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs11 indeed it is not clear that developing countries can participate in the cdm unless the y17 assume reduction obligations for more on the cdm see united nations developmen t programme issues options the clean development mechanism united nation s publications 1998figure 5results from transactions wit h countries not currently covered by the protocol thus about half the total savings fro m trading would come from sources whose credits are either contested in some quarters or from countries who are not required t participate in the reduction program at all17 conclusion the potential for international emission trading to reduce us compliance cost under the kyoto protocol is substantia l and indisputable whether that potential can be turned into fact is more problematic the analysis presented here suggests tha t implementing international emissions tra ding under kyoto would represent uncharted territory for us environmental policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs12 for further information on the projected us reduction requirement under the kyot o18 protocol see larry parker and john blodgett global climate change reducin g greenhouse gases how much from what baseline crs report 98235 enr march 11 1998 for example see council of economic advisors economic report of the president us19 govt print off february 1997 pp 208213first an international emissions trading scheme has to function very efficiently to achieve the savings projected by analyses for example the administration s analysis relies on an unprecedented amount of international trading to achieve th substanti cost reduction its projects under its most aggressive trading scenario 8288 of the us r eduction requirement would be bought from foreign sources resulting in dom estic co reductions of only 66 to 99 million metric tons compared2 with an estimated 550 million metric tons if all reduction were achieve d domestically even restricting trading to annex 1 countries results in 61 of th e18 country s reduction requirement coming from foreign sources the magnitude f transactions n ot only raises questions of its feasibility but may also conflict with the intent of the kyoto protocol and with the positions of some other countries which states that international emissions trading is to be supplemental to domestic actions second besides the amount of trading estimated th sources of these reductions raise additional questions for example according to analysis by charles rive r associates half the estimated savings from international emissions trading woul d come from either hot air credits from the former s oviet union or from transactions with third world countries that are not required to participate in the program trading with these sources does not have the certainty that trading with most annex 1 countri would have in terms of monitoring enforcement and integrity f transactions with respect to the former soviet union current problems wit h achieving compliance with the montreal protocol far simpler international treaty does not bode well for the kyoto protocol that economic difficulties ar proffered by these c ountries as grounds for noncompliance and nonenforcement of the montreal protocol is particularly disturbing as those same difficulties are th source of the hot air credits the situation may be more uncertain with third world transactions s developing countries generally have neither the incentive of binding obligation under the protocol nor the infrastructure to monitor enforce and protect the integrity of transactions in addition there may be complications resulting from the kyot protocol itself as currently written transactions with third world countries are to be funneled through clean development mechanism an institution whose rol and parameters have yet to be wo rked out how much this middle man mechanism would affect trades is unclear third the situation with international carbon tr ading is not analogous to the acid rain program often cited as model the acid rain program involves domesti c19 trading in one pollutant from about 3000 relatively large stationary sources as such it has been administratively manageable enforceable and successful the kyot protocol involves 6 pollutants millions of small medium and large sources an dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30285crs13 international trading the max imum trading scenario under the acid rain program interstate trading is the baseline for international tra ding under the kyoto protocol while electric generating facilities the focus of the acid rain trading program account for twothirds of us sulfur dioxide emission they account for only 29 of the six greenhouse gases emitted in the us mostly carbon dioxide other mor dispersed energy uses such as transportation make up most of the rest add th international scope of carbon trading to this mix and it is clear that implementation challenges would be on different level than that encountered with the acid rai n program level to which the implementation of the acid rain program provides little guidance besides questions raise d by the scale of carbon trading the trading dynamics of carbon trading differ from those of the acid rain program unlike an internationa l carbon trading program that mus t operate very efficiently to achieve much of its cost savings the aci d rain program does not have to do so the simplest trades those between companys ow n plants achieve the greatest cost savings under the acid rain program not interstate trades between unassociated parties that there hav been relatively few interstates trades so far under the acid rain program means once again that the program provides little guidance to any future international carbo n trading program in short to expect trading to reduce costs by the 8090 suggested by some analyses seems at the current time to be unreali stic indeed the complexity presented by international emissions trading suggest that alternatives may deserve hearing
