jobs while also meeting infrastructure needs this report is an overview of policy issues associated with the approach of using infrastructure as mechanism for economic stimulus when most people think about infrastructure they probably have in mind systems that are publicly provided and are important to the productive capacity of the nations economy today policymakers define the term more broadly to in clude both publicly and privately owned systems and facilities and categories that vary considerably in the degree of historic federal investment in building or rebuilding physical structures rela tively new dimension in todays context is the notion of coupling public works with investments in environmentally friendly systems that incorporate renewable technologies or energy efficiencycalled green infrastructure academics economists and policymakers debate two issues concerning the contribution of infrastructure investment to the economy one is the effects of infrastructure investment on productivity and growth including job creation the second related issue is the role of infrastructure spending which is typically longterm activity as shortterm mechanism to stimulate faltering economy research conducted over time has resulted in general consensus that there can be positive returns on productivity of investing in infrastructure many experts now argue that infrastructure spending could be an important source of stimulating labor demand and enhancing us productivity through investments in roads bridges water systems etc still some analysts are cautious about the effectiveness of th is type of fiscal stimulus because of one key issue timing by definition the goal of stimulus spending is to get money into the economy swiftly but that objective can conflict with the reality of building infrastructure projects that typically are multiyear efforts with slow initial spendout spending advocates counter that because the current recession is expected to be of long duration projects with extended timeframes can still contribute to the economys recovery and that investments that improve longterm productivity are preferable to options that focus on consumption as stimulus tool the overriding question in debating infrastructure spending as part of economic stimulus is what will the stimulus buy two important considerations are will the proposal produce stimulus quickly and will it produce significant amount of stimulus relative to its budgetary cost because of the urgency of responding to the recession stakeholder groups have been preparing lists of projects that are ready to go but the criteria for developing these lists are largely unknown there is tension between the goal of funding activities that will create jobs quickly and the desire to invest in projects that will have sustained value that contributes to us productivity critical issue for all levels of government is ensuring accountability for funds that will be spent through stimulus program to assure the public that decisions involving public dollars are made quickly yet with transparency efficiency and sufficient accountability this report will not track legislative developments other crs reports referenced here will do so

levels of government are debating wide range of options for addressing the nations faltering economic conditions one option that is receiving attention is accelerated investments in the nations public infrastructurethat is highways mass transit airports water supply and wastewater dams locks canals passenger rail and other facilitiesin order to create jobs while also promoting longterm economic growth this report presents policy issues associated with using infrastructure as mechanism for economic stimulus it begins with two contextual aspects of this discussion what is the current economic condition and how to define infrastructure the report then reviews the role of infrastructure investment in economic growth generally and in contributing to stimulating faltering economy it discusses key issues such as setting priorities resource and governance and the possible role of green infrastructure as part of economic stimulus finally it includes an appendix with descriptions of number of infrastructure categories that have recently been mentioned for inclusion in economic stimulus legislation in the 111 th congress

economic recovery has intensified recently in response to economic indicators showing significant and continuing deterioration of the national economy in the third quarter of 2008 real gross domestic product gdp the economys total output of goods and services fell by 05 and the december 2008 blue chip economic indicators consensus forecast was for real gdp to decline by 11 for all of 2009 and for the unemployment rate to reach 81 by the end of 2009 1 in november the unemployment rate stood at 15year high of 67 further on december 1 the nonpartisan national bureau of economic research officially declared that the us economy has been in recession since december 2007 recession is defined as broad contraction of the economy not confined to one sector the economy reportedly lost jobs every month in 2008 for total of 19 million for the year fiscal problems are affecting all levels of government in december the national association of state budget officers and the national governors association reported significant weakening of fiscal conditions in nearly every state and budget gaps for the current fiscal year of approximately 30 billion in addition to more than 12 billion that has already been cut from state budgets states face growing expenditure pressures as the economy deteriorates including increased funding of public assistance programs such as medi caid states also face longterm issues such as funding pensions and maintaining and repairing infrastructure 2 local governments also are dealing with fiscal pressures september survey by the national league of cities found that city finance officers expect revenue from property sales and income taxes to decrease by 43 in 2008 the survey also found that 79 of cities expect their finances 1 blue chip economic

and effects on city revenue3 consequently cities are laying off workers raising fees closing municipal facilities such as libraries and cancelling or postponing projects much of the public responsibility to build operate and maintain infrastructure resides with localities cities and states that normally rely on the bond market to finance longterm projects recently have found that market less accessible as fallout from financial turmoil on wall street meaning that it is more difficult to borrow money municipal bonds if they can be sold are lately commanding higher interest rate yields making it more costly for states and cities to borrow these higher rates are causing officials to scale back delay or cancel projects as result of these conditions states which under their constitutions are not permitted to operate in deficit and cities are increasingly looking to the federal government for assistance on range of policies and projects organizations representing states and municipalities have issued agenda documents with both policy and shortterm and longterm assistance recommendations for congress and the administration including infrastructure health care reform housing benefit programs for individuals budget relief and help in accessing capital and governance 4 the concept of countering the effect of recessions with legislation to spur job creation through increased spending on public works infrastructure is not new in recent decades congress has done so on several occasions for example in 1983 pl 988 and 1993 pl 10350 congress appropriated funds to number of existing federal infrastructure and public works programs in hopes that projects and job creation would be stimulated quickly 5 at least two factors are new this time one is the severity of the economic downturn reportedly the worst in 50 years6 which is widely expected to be of long duration not short another is the fact that the current debate about jobcreating stimulus program is merging with discussion among infrastructure advocates that has been ongoing for years about the need for investment to address problems of aging and deteriorating public works these infrastructure problems have been increasingly recognized by policymakers and the public at large 7 it is argued that the us investments in public infrastructure have declined significantly in recent decades to the point that this country is underinvesting in its critical assets and is failing to construct new facilities or adequately maintain existing systems the perception that current investment levels are inadequate is in part supported by data which show that relative to gdp infrastructure spending has declined about 20 from 306 in 1959 to 240 of gdp in 2004 during this same period spending has shifted from predominantly on capital 63 in 1959 compared with 46 in 2004 3 michael pagano and christopher w hoene city fiscal conditions in 2008 national league of cities research brief on americas

dollars during the presidential campaign candidate barack obama pledged to invest in rebuilding the nations infrastructure especially transportation systems in order to create jobs9 since november presidentelect obama has highlighted immediate investments in infrastructure projects as key element of his plans to revitalize the economy the obamabiden emergency plan would make 25 billion immediately available in jobs and growth fund to help ensure that inprogr ess and fasttracked infrastructure projects are not sidelined and to ensure that schools can meet their energy costs and undertake key repairs starting this fall this increased investment is necessary to stem growing budget pressures on infrastructure projects in addition in an environment where we may face elevated unemployment levels well into 2009 making an aggressive investment in urgent highpriority infrastructure will serve as triple win generating capital deployment and job creation to boost our economy in

roads airports or water supply when they refer to infrastructure having in mind the types of systems or facilities that are publicly provided and are important to the productive capacity of the nations economy but some analysts argue that such conception is too narrow accordingly the term might be defined more broadly to also include spending by the private sector such as by private utilities that provide electricity or natural gas in addition other types of public investment such as public buildings may not add directly to the productive capacity of the economy but do represent assets in the nations capital stock the current discussion includes single definition of infrastructure or list of categories or types of infrastructure that might receive assistance as part of economic stimulus and ultimately it will be defined by those who are responsible for crafting the legislation the lack of definition is not unlike infrastructure discussions that have occurred in the past see the box what is infrastructure below today policymakers and stakeholder groups appear inclined to define the term broadly to include facilities and categories that vary considerably in the degree of historic federal investment in building or rebuilding physical structures eg highways compared with public schools and systems that have long history of combined public and private ownership

information on the levels of government or the private sector that typically are responsible for infrastructure indeed today there is considerable blurring between public and private infrastructure raising more frequent questions about what should be the role of government including the federal government in providing infrastructure services in part this is due to increasing reliance on the private sectors through contract operations full ownership and other arrangementsto provide functions and services that typically are thought of as public examples include prisons passenger rail and postal services and mail delivery relatively new dimension in todays context is the notion of coupling public works with investments in environmentally friendly systems that incorporate renewable technologies or energy efficiencycalled green infrastructure see discussion below the appendix to this report provides descriptions of number of infrastructure categories that have recently been

issues concerning the contribution of infrastructure investment to the economy one is the general issue of the effects of infrastructure spending and investment on productivity and growth the second related issue is the role of infrastructure spending including shortterm job creation as countercyclical tool in stimulating faltering economy

infrastructure influence productivity and growth has long interested academics one economist describes the issue as follows the argument is simple infrastructure is public good that produces positive externalities for production the provision of adequate infrastructure is necessary condition for private firms to be productive even if infrastructure is also provided for its amenity value ie for its direct utility value to individuals it is obvious that it plays central role in generating external effects that fundamentally alter the capacity of the economy to produce goods and services just imagine an economy without roads or telephones to think about the impact that infrastructure has on productivity 11 few would argue that infrastructure isnt important to economic activity but important in what precise ways and to what degree eg new constr uction or maintenance of existing systems are questions that have interested researchers thus public roads are important but by themselves they dont produce anything yet they are linked in complex ways to economic growth 11 francisco rodriguez have collapses in infrastructure spending led to crosscountry divergence in per

transporting goods and people mitigating congestion etc academic interest in the issue of economic payoff associated with public infrastructure spending was motivated in part by recognition of declines in public investment in the early 1970s and declines in economic productivity growth at about the same time the question for researchers was whether there was linkage or causality between public investments and economic productivity and consequently whether underinvestment in infrastructure helped to explain the slowdown in productivity growth research reported in the late 1980s found that there are very large returns on investment from infrastructure spending and by implication argued that part of the us productivity slump in the 1970s and 1980s was due to shortfall of investing in infrastructure some of this early work found that 10 rise in the public capital stock would raise multifactor productivity meaning changes in economic output resulting from the combination of labor capital materials fuels and purchased services by almost 4 12 this was very high estimate and as such was very controversial subsequent investigations by others found that the initial results were highly sensitive to numerous factors such as minor changes in data or time period or sectors of the economy that were analyzed during the 1990s further research on this issue modified the methodology used to analyze the economic effects of investing in public infrastructure and either affirmed or challenged the findings of the initial work although not all s ubsequent studies found growthenhancing effect of public capital general consensus has developed over time that there are positive returns on investment in public infrastructure but that the impact is less than was first reported 13 some of this research suggests that investments in energy infrastructure have the greatest impact on long term private employment and investment followed by mass transit and water and sewer another important conclusion of more recent research is that both the average return and range of return to the economy vary based on the type of infrastructure and the amount of infrastructure already in place in other words the larger the existing stock and the better its efficient use and current quality the lower will be the impact of new infrastructure also the effect of new public investment will crucially depend on the extent to wh ich spending aims to alleviate bottlenecks in the existing network of infrastructure systems and facilities14

has focused its efforts at direct job creation by increasing federal expenditures on public works15 when congress has considered raising spending on infrastructure to help stimulate flagging economy how many jobs will be created is commonly asked question although all spending increases labor demand through direct and multiplier effects the nature and number of jobs varies in the first round job creation estimates often are based on inputoutput io models of the economy these models show for example the dollar value of concrete produced by the nonmetallic mineral product manufacturing industry and the dollar value of steel produced by the primary metal manufacturing industry that are used by the construction industry to produce its various final outputs eg bridges roads the output requirements from each intermediate and final goods industry must then be converted to employment requirements thus job creation estimates reflect employment directly and indirectly dependent onsupported by demand for an industrys products induced jobs that is the number of jobs that result from purchases of goods and services made by those in direct and indire ct jobs may be included as well estimates of induced jobs are considered tenuous however 16 job creation estimates vary from one source to another depending in part on industry definition data sources and time period the federal highway administration fhwa is the source of the most widely cited estimate of jobs supported by federal highway investments according to the fhwas latest update in 2007 an expenditure of 1 billion on highway construction without state match of 250 million could support 27822 direct indirect and induced jobs the fhwa analysis is careful to observe that it addresses jobs supported by highway investments not jobs created 17 alternatively an employment requirements table that the us bureau of labor statistics bls makes publicly available for use by researcher s which differs from that used by the fhwa and does not include induced jobs suggests that in 2007 13860 jobs were directly and indirectly dependent on 1 billion of spending in the construction industry ie construction of buildings heavy and civil engineering construction including highways and specialty trade contractors18 the 13860 direct and indirect jobs per 1 billion of total construction expenditures in 2007 is somewhat more than the 11768 direct and indirect jobs estimate of the fhwa for each 1 billion of highway expenditures in 2006 another example of an infrastructure job creation estimate is provided by crs analysis based on the us bureau of economic analysis re gional inputoutput modeling system rims ii and the bls employment requirements table desc ribed above it suggests that between 81217 and 126231 direct and indirect jobs might be created for each 1 million spent on water reuse activities such as title xvi projects carried out by the department of the interior which provide supplemental water supplies by reclaiming and reusing wastewater and naturally impaired ground and surface water within the utility sector the water sewage and other systems industry is the proxy in this analysis for water reuse infrastructure activities unlike the bls and fhwa models rims ii provides state estimates of job creation see table 1 through its use of regional data 15 for information see crs report

since mid2008 there have been increasing calls for congress and the administration to address the nations significant economic difficulties through variety of policy approaches19 on the one hand some argue that economic stabilization can best be achieved through monetary policy ie the federal reserves ability to adjust interest rates coupled with automatic fiscal stabilizers20 others support fiscal stimulus and policymakers are debating range of options for doing so in february 2008 congress and the administrati on agreed to legislation pl 110185 that prominently included tax rebates for individuals as means of stimulating the ailing economy effects of that legislation on the economy are not yet fully known21 under discussion now is second stimulus package and in that connection many others now advocate using direct fiscal stimulus through combination of shortterm infrastructure investments state fiscal relief and expanded unemployment insurance and food stamps wide range of expertsincluding economists who generally differ in their economic policy views such as martin feldstein 22 and paul krugman23contend that because neither consumers nor businesses are spending massive infusion of government spending is needed quickly to energize economic activity infrastructure investment it is argued will be an important source of stimulating labor demand which is lacking in the current labor market and enhancing us productivity through long neglected investments in roads bridges water systems etc24 somewhat ironically the nations economic downturn presents an opportunity according to this view to stimulate the economy by spending on projects to address unmet infrastructure needs these needs are presented in the finding of the american society of civil engineers asce that the condition of the nations infrastructure merits letter grade of d and that us funding needs total 16 trillion asce reported the condition of dozen categories of infrastructure including roads

since reported need as high as 268 billion25 while there is growing momentum for more infrast ructure investment some analysts are cautious about the effectiveness of this type of fiscal stimulus because of one key issue timing this concern was described in testimony by the director of the congressional budget office the timing of fiscal stimulus is critical if the policies do not generate additional spending when the economy is in phase of very slow growth or recession they will provide little help to the economy when it is needed poor ly timed policies may do harm by aggravating inflationary pressures and needlessly increasing federal debt if they stimulate the economy after it has already started to recover for federal purchases of goods and services such as infrastructure spending the primary issue in targeting the spending is that of timing because many infrastructure projects may take years to complete spending on those projects cannot easily be timed to provide stimulus during recessions which are typically relatively short lived 26 by definition the goal of stimulus spending is to get money into the economy swiftly but that objective conflicts with the reality of building infrastructure projects that typically are multiyear efforts with slow initial spendout cbo notes th at public works projects are likely to involve expenditures that take long time to get underway and also are spread out over long time even those that are on the shelf generally take time to inject money into the economy for major infrastructure such as highway construction and water resource projects the initial rate of spending can be 25 or less of the funding provided in given year 27 based on cbo information the national governors association reported spendout rates for several infrastructure categories about 68 of highway and 45 of transit obligations spend out over the first two years of project about 19 of airport obligations spend out in the first year and another 42 in year two about 24 of drinking water and wastewater obligations are expended over two years and 54 over three years28 economist mark zandi who favors fiscal stimulus package that includes increased infrastructure spending also cautions that it takes substantial amount of time for funds to flow to builders contractors and the broader economy even if the funds are only used to finance 25

to know just when the projects will get underway and the money spent29 advocates of infrastructure spending have two responses to this concern first they point out that because economists now expect the current recession to be of long duration longer than 12 months projects with extended timeframes can still contribute to the economys recovery which is likely to be twoyear undertaking thus the general concern about timing is less relevant compared with previous shorter recessions they say second because every major infrastructure category has significant backlogs of projects that are ready to go except for funding advocates are confident that large amounts of actual construction work can begin quickly see discussion below ready to go projects some economists contend that public infrastructure investments stimulate economic growth only if the impact of the infrastructure outweighs the adverse effects of higher taxes that are needed to finance the investment or if it outweighs the advers effects of spending cuts in other areas such as properly maintaining existing public works system s higher deficits that result from stimulus spending slow economic growth in the long run it is sometimes said because government borrowing crowds out private investment 30 critics of this view say that this concern is valid in nonrecessionary times when the economy is working at full capacity because under those circumstances government spending just changes the mix of jobs with change in the overall quantity or quality of labor according to this view government spending in recession affects resources and labor that are idle and it does not fully displace private investment other economists say that if federal assistance merely provides fiscal relief by paying for spending that would have occurred anywaythat is if federal dollars merely substitute for or replace local dollars invested in the same activityit provides economic stimulus in response state and local public officials say that that is not the case in todays economy because of the current recessionary pressures that they face states and cities have been cancelling infrastructure projects another way of describing th is situation could be to say that what is under discussion is really not entirely about stimulus but it is better termed holding state and local governments harmless in order to encourage them to carry out projects that they couldnt otherwise do because of budget shortfalls g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 funding infrastructure is longterm investment not quickfix spending that should lead to something durable useful and financially productive the longterm nature of such investments can be at odds with the stimulus goal of quickly injecting money into the economy thus the

traditionally setting priorities for infrastructure spending is based on combination of factors estimates of funding needs are one factor that is commonly used as measure of the dimension of problem and to support spending on some activities relative to others as in funding needs for x are much greater than for therefore society should spend more heavily on x in the infrastructure context funding needs estimates try to identify the level of investment that is required to meet defined level of quality or service essentially this depiction of need is an engineering concept it differs from the concept of ready to go projects discussed below which is being used in connection with stimulus proposals it also differs from economists conception that the appropriate level of new infrastructure investment or the optimal stock of public capital infrastructure for society is determined by calculating the amount of infrastructure for which social marginal benefits just equal marginal costs the last comprehensive national infrastructure needs assessment was conducted by the national council on public works improvement that was created by the public works improvement act of 1984 pl 98501 the council reported in 1988 that government outlays for public works capital totaled about 45 billion in 1985 and that commitment to improve the nations infrastructure could require an increase of up to 100 percent in the amount of capital the nation invests each year 31 this estimate of future needs by the council may have been imprecise because of the inherent difficulties of needs assessments something its report discusses in detail32 it is worth highlighting few of these key difficulties as cautionary note when attempting to interpret infrastructure needs assessments discussed in the appendix to this report and elsewhere one of the major difficulties in any needs assessment is defining what constitutes need relative concept that is likely to generate good deal of disagreement for this reason some needs assessments are anchored to benchmark such as current provision in terms of physical condition andor performance this current level of provision may be judged to be too high by some and too low by others but nonetheless it provides basis for comparison as future spending needs can be estimated in terms of maintaining or improving the current condition and performance of the infrastructure system needs estimates in highway and public transit are calculated in this way by the us department of transportation dot the environmental protection agency epa similarly estimates total us funding needs for wastewater treatment facilities epa defines need as project with associated costs that addresses water quality or public health problem existing as of january 1 2004 33 other federal agencies estimate the funding necessar to bring the current infrastructure system to state of good repair the resulting funding estimate is sometimes referred to as the infrastructure 31

current condition of infrastructure and calculating repair costs the needs estimate is affected by judgments about what constitutes state of good repair it is worth noting too that needs assessment are often conducted by organizations with vested interest in the outcome this is most obviously concern when needs assessment is conducted by an advocacy group but may also occur with government agencies second major difficulty with needs assessments is estimating future conditions especially consumer demand for services that infrastructure provides to begin with estimating demand is difficult because it is based on host of assumptions such as the rate of population and economic growth typically the longer the time period over which conditions are forecast the harder it is to accurately predict them particularly hard to predict and thus the effect they have on infrastructure needs are structural changes in the economy and technological change in addition however consumer demand can vary enormously depending on how service is financed and priced as well as other public policy decisions including regulation and conservation for example highway infrastructure is primarily financed by fuels and other taxes that provide vague signal or signal at all about the total cost of driving particularly the external costs such as the fuel and time wasted in congested conditions highway tolls on the other hand particularly those that fluctuate in line with congestion prov ide direct price signal for trip on certain facility at certain time of the day pricing highway infrastructure in this way has been found to reduce travel demand thereby affecting infrastructure need 34 consumer demand can sometimes be met without infrastructure spending for example water supply needs can be reduced by employing water conservation methods finally it is worth mentioning that the need for public funding to supply infrastructure including federal support may often be an open question because the roles of the public and private sector can and do shift over time even within the public sector the roles of federal state and local governments change and these shifting intergovernmental relationships may even affect the assessments of infrastructure needs third major difficulty with infrastructure needs assessments is that needs estimates for individual elements of public infrastructure are rarely comparable some assessments include only capital spending others include both capital and operation and maintenance om spending some estimates of need are developed for the purposes of shortterm fiscally constrained spending plans while others are developed to assess longterm needs based on current system condition and performance future demand and the effects of pursuing different policy options some needs assessments are for public sector spending by all levels of government while others focus only on federal spending furthermore needs estimates are rarely directly comparable because of differing underl ying assumptions such as those about economic and population growth based on when the assessment is being done and for what purpose needs surveys are likely to be conducted at different times thus will be expressed in different years dollars comparing dollar estimates of infrastructure needs from different assessments is difficult many estimates are prepared in nominal dollars for the reference year while others particularly multiyear estimates are sometimes prepared in constant dollars for base year 34 see us department of

nominal dollar estimates it should not be assumed that dollar estimates for the same year are necessarily comparable because of major differences in coverage and methodology individual needs assessments cannot be added together to provide single estimate of future public infrastructure needs despite the political desire to do so moreover as needs assessments are typically prepared separately there may be instances where need for type of infrastructure is included in more than one estimate resulting in double counting and other instances of omission resulting in undercounting as separately estimated these assessments also ignore competitive and complementary situations in which spending levels in one area may affect needs in another for example in the case of transportation infrastructure an improved freight rail line might reduce the need to improve the highway system to accommodate truck traffic

for highway public transit airport passenger rail amtrak wastewater and drinking water water resources and public school modernizationrenovation programs hr 7110 under the legislation which failed in the senate most of the funding was to go to projects that could award contracts based on bids within certain number of days of enactment generally 120 days because of the urgency of responding to the economic downturn emphasis has been on projects that could move to construction in 90 or 120 days which are often referred to as shovel ready or ready to go projects in an effort to support arguments for generous spending levels in new stimulus bill interest groups have come forward recently with lists and estimates of ready to go projects these lists are fluid and evolving in november the national governors association identified 43 billion in shovel ready projects for roads 189 billion transit 8 billion passenger rail 05 billion wastewater 92 billion and drinking water projects 60 billion this estimate was essentially compilation of information from other organizations 35 in middecember the us conference of mayors identified 63 billion in ready to go projects in more than 400 cities this list included nearly 9000 projects for highways 246 billion transit 88 billion airports 45 billion passenger rail 11 billion wastewater and drinking water 189 billion and schools 48 billion36 the list was 30 bigger in dollars than an estimate from this group released 10 days earlier state and local water agencies have reportedly identified from 9 to 20 billion in wastewater

officials identified more than 5100 road and highway projects totaling 64 billion and the association of public transit officials identified more than 700 transit projects totaling 122 billion that are shovel ready38 the american public works association identified more than 3600 ready to go projects in 43 states totaling 154 billion for roads water supply and wastewater and other local public works 39 it is difficult to know what to make of such esti mates since the criteria used to develop them are largely unknown generally the term ready to go is being used to refer to projects that lack funding but otherwise have been designed engineered and have cleared environmental permitting and other requirements such as necessary land acquisition and are ready to proceed but that is not standardized definition found in law regulation or technical guidance arguably it is in the interest of those that are developing the lists to present estimates that demonstrate significant needs some projects may have permits but sponsors might lack easements to or ownership of land in question experts point out that unless project has already been bid timeconsuming process even with all permits in hand it still may not be able to proceed in 90 or 120 days without recognized methodology for vetting them the true status of the projects that stakeholder groups have identified is uncertain many of the ready to go lists include estimates of job creation that is expected to result from the identified projects for example the conference of mayors says that 790910 jobs will be created from the infrastructure projects on its middecember list the methodology for deriving these estimates is often unstated but in many cases is based on that used by the fhwa discussed above two additional issues are apparent one is whether spending undertaken as part of stimulus program will represent investment in longterm asse ts for society some of the lists prepared by stakeholder groups identify projects with some description for example the conference of mayors list but others only identify statebystate project totals critics contend that lists of ready to go projects are likely to include many with marginal value such as projects with plans that have been backlogged for some time because they lack sufficient merit but for which there now is an opportunity to get funding under stimulus program the majority of actual funding decisions will be made by state and local officials with responsibility for determining priorities proponents believe that citizens will hold public officials accountable for the quality of projects second issue related to the first concerns the tension between funding activities that will create jobs quickly and the desire to invest in projects th at will have sustained value this also relates to the issue of timing discussed previously critics worry that projects will be small and wont solve continued members asked to contact congress on drinking

additional infrastructure spending noted if additional infrastructure is worthwhile it should be constructed such determinations are most likely to be accurate however when they are made without the haste associated with an attempt to respond to economic weakness40 proponents of new stimulus program can be expected to try to balance the dual objectives of spending money quickly and investing for the longterm some types of public jobs programs may support jobs that have little longterm impact such as hiring workers to sweep streets or rake leaves sometimes called make work projects that involve substantial new construction are slower to complete and to impact jobs but often have political appeal because of high visibility to the public some infrastructure such as highway resurfacing and minor road repairs or replacement of pumps and compressors at water facilities does benefit the value of the nations capital assets and can be done more quickly than new construction likewise acquiring new clean fuel buses or rehabilitating transit stations can occur more rapidly than extending collector sewer lines into unsewered communities many public officials are hoping that there will be room in an emerging stimulus program for both shortterm and longterm infrastructure projects

two additional issues are important in considering how infrastructure stimulus spending is done one is whether there will be adequate labor and other resources available to supply activities on the scale that some now contemplate the other is how policymakers will ensure accountability for federal funds that will be spent currently the state of the us economy is such that there is excess capacity of both labor and materials for infrastructure projects large number of workers are unemployed especially in the construction sector which reported 121 unemployment rate in november 2008 41 it is widely believed that large number of those workers many of whom had been employed in residential construction could be employed on infrastructure construction projects but how transferable those skills are to infrastructure projects is an open question there is unlikely to be total substitutability that is unemployment will not disappear it is possible however that some skills or expertise could become scarce as result of increased demand due to greater construction activity in multiple sectors the same is true regarding materials used in construction industry officials believe that supplies of materials such as concrete and steel and equipment such as pipes and valves are adequate to meet additional demand or will be available when needed as with labor however it is an open question whether greatly increased demand across multiple sectors will lead to some scarcities resource issues also encompass the capacity of government to oversee projects that will be undertaken through stimulus program some stakeholder groups advocate stimulus program in which funds are directly disbursed by the federal government in the form of grants to project sponsors this would differ from the current practice of most infrastructure assistance programs 40 alan viard resident scholar american enterprise institute testimony before the us house committee on ways and means hearing on

select qualified projects and distribute monies locally some local government groups contend that state agencies are slow to make decisions and award funds thus frustrating the goal of stimulating economic activity quickly unsurprisingly states prefer that stimulus funds be allocated and distributed according to established selection and delivery mechanisms that include criteria for project priorities and eligibilities and contain fiscal safeguards such as auditing requirements altering such procedures would be highly disruptive states say 42 if stimulus program were to feature direct federal grants federal agencies would face significant additional grants management responsibilities for which most are likely to be unprepared another concern of some stakeholder groups is with programmatic and other requirements that typically apply to receipt of federal assistance these range from programspecific planning mandates procurement rules and setasides for purposes such as assisting economically disadvantaged communities to crosscutting requirements dealing with variety of environmental social economic and other issues such as compliance with the clean air act civil rights act of 1964 and the davisbacon act these crosscutting requirements promote and regulate national policy goals such as equal employment opportunity or protection of endangered species some groups contend that it would be appropriate to suspend these requirements in order to facilitate project spending but not all are likely to support doing so waiving existing rules and policies that govern financial assistance programs could be seen as undercutting the numerous policy objectives that the requirements are intended to meet further projects that are considered ready to go in terms of planning design etc arguably have already complied with all or most of these requirements so waiving them may not affect project timing state match requirements present different issue according to some groups they propose that congress temporarily waive requirements in some programs that states must match percentage of the federal funds that they receive with nonfederal money for example the federal programs that provide assistance for highways drinking water projects and wastewater treatment plant construction require 20 state match to ensure that states have fiscal investment in projects and to enlarge the available pool of funds that can be disbursed to localities 43 because state budgets already are severely pressed by the recession many argue that they do not have the fiscal resources for this type of match especially if stimulus program provides much larger amount of funds than states have recently been receiving44 the overriding governance issue for all levels of government is ensuring accountability for funds that will be spent through stimulus program the amounts of federal dollars committed to such program are likely to be enormous some advocates are proposing 850 billion or more in total stimulus to include as much as 350 billion for infrastructure and other direct spending making it particularly important for the public to be assured that decisions involving public 42 epa states weigh easing srf rules to speed stimulus spending inside epa december 19 2008 43 the state match also benefits jobs for example the fhwa employment impacts estimates discussed on page 7 indicate that if states are required to include 20 match then 1 billion in federal funds supports 34779 direct and indirect jobs or 6979 more jobs than if state match is required 44 the clean water acts wastewater assistance program provides an example fy2008 funding for this program totaled 689 million it was allocated among the states by formula if state was allocated 50 million of the total it was required to provide 10 million match hr 7110 110 th congress would have prov ided 65 billion in fy2009 supplemental funds for the clean water act program the same state that r eceived 50 million in fy2008 would have received 470775500 under hr 7110 and would be required to provide 20 match totaling 94155100

electricity ie wind and solar home weatherization and development and implementation of next generation vehicles46 the concept that he and others advocate is broadly speaking to couple growing the economy and creating jobs with investments that will pr omote clean energy and environmental protection several interest groups have stepped forward with proposals for inclusion in stimulus package among these the center for american progress cap public policy and research think tank has recommended green investment projects totaling 100 billion as part of strategy for green recovery47 also the apollo alliance coalition of labor environmental business and community leaders has proposed 10year 500 billion program to create five million green jobs48 several questions arise concerning these proposals first what exactly is green infrastructure the term is less precisely defined than is traditional infrastructure see page 8 which some green advocates now refer to as gray infrastructure it has been defined as strategically planned and managed networks of natural lands working landscapes and other open spaces that conserve ecosystem values and functions and provide associated benefits to human populations including natural elements such as wetlands and grasslands49 for example it describes the management of stormwater runoff through the use of natural systems or engineered systems that mimic natural systems to treat polluted runoff before it reaches streams or lakes but in the current context of economic stimulus the term extends more broadly to include support for constructing the manufacturing infrastructure to develop and commercialize various technologies that are more energy efficient eg advanced vehicle batteries or more environmentally friendly eg investments in renewable energy sources and the electricity grid to transmit and distribute clean energy particular attention has been given to mass transit projects that can decrease energy consumption and reduce global warming pollution and other projects such as retrofitting schools and public buildings to use clean energy 45 building americas future applauds presidentelect obamas commitment to

enough to help stimulate the economy out of the current recession that is are there ready to go green projects as previously discussed the key to stimulus spendi ng is to get funds moving quickly into the economy however many of the proposals by green economy proponents were not conceived for the purpose of quickly stabilizing or increasing the number of jobs in the nation or in industries particularly hard hit by the current recession studies like that of cap recommend categories of projects to create green jobs such as full funding of federal energyefficiency programs which can start stimulating the economy relatively rapidly and others such as new authorization for grants to states to support manufacturing plant retooling to produce clean and energyefficient technologies that are less fastacting eighty percent of caps recommended funding would be for less fastacting programs 50 critics say that the types of green projects under discussion are pricey and would do little to stimulate the economy quickly but proponents contend that green investments represent downpayment on longterm economic growth and should be done even over somewhat longer time period one environmental advocacy group american rivers reportedly has identified 194 waterrelated green infrastructure projects totaling 11 billion that are ready to go within six to nine months the types of projects include installing green roofs raingardens and permeable pavement that can reduce the need for new wastewater treatment plants and stormwater and sewer pipes restoring wetlands and natural floodplains and planting urban forests 51 final question is what is the job creation potential of green infrastructureinvestments although all stimulative spending ultimately increases labor demand the first round effects vary by the type of spending this question is addres sed in recent crs report according to the crs analysis52 estimating the number of jobs dependent upon green infrastructure activities presents greater challenge than estimates related to infrastructure projects as traditionally defined the basis for most data collection by us statistical agencies is the north american industry classification system naics it currently does not identify separately socalled green industries eg those that utilize renewable resources to produce their outputs or those that manufacture goods which minimize energy use wi thin naics the electric utility industry is disaggregated into hydroelectric fossil fuel nuclear and other power generation transmission and distribution such renewable sources of ener gy production as wind solar and biomass are not uniquely recognized they are included in the other category if harnessing the wind to produce electricity and plant material to produce biofuel requires substantially different mix of inputs than relying on coal and gasoline for example the conventional inputoutput io model does not seem wellsuited as basis for estimating the number of jobs supported by these green activities similarly within naics the building construction industry does not have unique category for green retrofitting eg installing additional insulation fluorescent lighting or energyefficient heating and airconditioning systems retrofitting likely requires combination of inputs from supplier industries that differs from the mix for the toptobottom construction of buildings once again making use of conventional io models problematic 50 will straw and michael ettlinger how to spend 350 billion in first year of stimul us and recovery center for american

the recession by linda levine httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40107g22g145g142g561g20g152g149g142g561g152g143g561g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g25g152g155g148g156g561g11g151

it is dealt with is not described in analyses of green job creation according to the crs report the cap study mentioned above does address the problem the researchers explain that because the us government surveys and accounts that are used to construct the inputoutput tables do not specifically recognize wind solar biomass building retrofitting or new mass transit as industries in their own right they created synthetic indust ries by combining parts of industries for which data are available the researchers provided an example in the case of the biomass industry they constructed it by combining the farming forestry wood products and refining industries then they assigned relative weights to each of these industries in terms of their contributions to producing biomass products53 as discussed in crs report r40080 job loss and infrastructure job creation during the recession further complicating the matter is the context and manner in which estimates of green jobs generally are presented studies often deve lop employment projections based on differing sets of assumptions and time horizons for example some attempt to estimate the number of direct and indirect jobs 10 or more years in the future that are supported by an assumed increase in the demand for energy that is met by an assumed shift during the projection period from coal to wind and geothermal power generation some reports also include induced employment see infrastructure job creation above but this is not always made clear in addition some analyses relate to particular state their results may not be generalizeable to other areas because state economies have different mixes of industries and may not be able to provide any or all of the inputs for particular green output the analyses also may express job estimates per unit of power generated by renewable resources and saved by increased demand for energyefficient products and equipment rather than per dollar of investment in green activities and the assumptions and methodologies underlying the job creation estimates often are not clearly articulated which makes thoughtful review of the results very difficult for these reasons policymakers considering which if any green infrastructure programs to fund to create and preserve jobs in the near term to mitigate the recessions impact on us workers may not find helpful many green economy studies 53 robert pollin heidi garrettpeltier and james heintz et green recovery program to create good jobs and start building lowcarbon economy center for american progress washington dc

highways are owned and operated by state and local governments 204 and 765 respectively only 31 of highway mileage is federally owned and almost all of this mileage is in national parks national forests military bases and other federal facilities just over 75 of us highways are in rural areas but these highways carry only 359 of total traffic as measured by vehicle miles traveled vmt and of this rural total almost half is on rural interstate highways and other major arterial highways conversely the much smaller urban highway system carries fully 641 of all traffic with urban interstates alone accounting for 154 of the total the us highway system has almost 600000 bridges again state and local governments own and operate almost all of the bridges in the us system as is the case for the highway system relatively small number of bridges carry the bulk of national traffic interstate highway bridges and bridges on arterial highways carry almost 90 of average daily traffic adt with urban interstate bridges alone carrying almost 35 of adt

transportation community that us highway and bridge infrastructure is in need of considerable investment in the years ahead largely to accommodate future growth in passenger and especially freight traf fic this need exists in spite of the fact that increased federal state and local spending over the last decade and half has according to the department of transportation generally resulted in measurable improvement to the condition and performance of much of the nations highway and bridge system this improvement has been particularly notable for bridges where the number of structurally deficient bridges was cut almost in half between 1990 and 2007 according to 2007 report by congressionally established commission spending on surface transportation by all levels of government needs to average somewhere between 145 billion and 276 billion per year depending on whether the goal is to maintain the existing system at high level or expand the system to facilitate system growth 56 this compares with expenditure of 68 billion on surface transportation nationwide in 2007 it should be pointed out however that there are other estimates of need that are considerably below the levels espoused by the surface commission g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g561 the federally operated state administered federalaid highway program is the major conduit for federal funding of surface transportation infrastructure fy2009 authorizations for this program amount to almost 42 billion the majority of funding in the federalaid program is provided through seven formula programs also referred to as apportioned programs among these is separate bridge program because of transferability and flexibility provisions in the program states have considerable leeway in spending funds for various types of surface transportation 54 prepared by john w fischer specialist in transportation policy 55 us department of transportation federal highway administration

building and repairing highway and bridge infrastructure is often seen as way to put people and assets to work constructively and to create economically valuable assets during recessionary period the principal argument against infrastructure spending is that it tends to be counter cyclical meaning that the slow spending nature of many large infrastructure projects is such that the benefit to the economy does not arrive in full measure until after the recession is largely over for example large bridge and highway construction projects often take multiple years to plan and construct transportation industry groups counter this argument in part by pointing out that there is an existing backlog of projects in the states that are ready to go and could put people and assets to work in short order the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto the principal interest group for this sector has compiled list of over 5200 projects that it believes could be started quickly creating significant number of new jobs in the process 58 according to aashto and others focusing on these projects would make significant dent in the existing national backlog of projects that could not be constructed for many years if their funding was to rely on the current federalaid highway program

result in building the most important infrastructure and will not necessarily build it in the places most impacted by the ongoing recession 59 for example utah is identified as having the largest share of projects in the aashto ready to go list yet unemployment is below the national average in that state there also are concerns that there are insufficient re sources labor management equipment materials etc to allow for speedy spending of stimulus fu nds an additional concern is that many states have announced cutbacks in infrastructure spending due to their own budget problems as result the extent to which stimulus spending might serve as substitute for foregone state spending is unclear thus raising questions about whether the stimulus will provide the levels of infrastructure improvement and jobs that are expected by proponents g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g348g342g561 public transit infrastructure includes the track stations vehicles and associated facilities and equipment

government spending over the past decade transit service provision has grown and the condition and performance of transit systems have generally improved nevertheless in its most recent assessment of transit needs the department of transportation estimated that the capital cost to maintain the current condition and operational performance of transit systems in the united states from 2005 through 2024 is 25 more annually than is currently being spent by all levels of government in 2004 transit capital spending by all levels of government was 126 billion 32 less than the 158 billion that dot

mayors report published in middecember 726 ready to go transit projects worth 88 billion were identified64 general criticism of surface transportation infrastructure funding as economic stimulus is that it tends to spend out slowly and it is thought that transit funding generally tends to spend out more slowly than highway funding another issue is that many ready to go projects identified by apta and the conference of mayors are for bus and rail vehicle purchases manufacturing that is dominated by foreign companies thus despite domestic content requirements for foreign made vehicles bought using federal funds some transit capital spending may not create as many jobs in the united states as hoped 65 some might also question the historic bias in the federal transit program toward capital rather than operating expenditures when research suggests that operating expenses tends to create more jobs more quickly66 another issue is whether federal spending will merely replace rather than supplement state and local level spending reducing the effectiveness of stimulus spending final issue is whether large increase in transit spending will improve transit service where it is most needed and encourage new ridership or alternatively will result in little used facilities that require longterm government support

industry expenses has continued to rise fares and other operating revenue now cover only about 30 of industry costs long term issue for the transit industry therefore will be how to improve service and attract new riders without requiring substantially more s upport from federal state and local government in terms of federal support for transit one of the biggest challenges over the next few years will be the amount of funding available from the highway trust fund the mass transit account of the highway trust fund is the source of approximately 80 of federal transit program monies with the remaining 20 drawn from the general f und of the us treasury although the transit account is in somewhat better financial shape than the highway account it is clear that current revenue into the transit account will not sustain fta programs and activities at current levels g3g146g155g153g152g155g157g156g348g349g561 civil aviation public infrastructure is composed mostly of airports and air

expected to increase because air traffic is expected to grow significantly over the next few decades faa forecasts that revenue passenger enplanements will grow from 765 million in 2007 to 1293 million in 2025 an average annual increase of 30 74 estimating infrastructure needs however presents number of difficulties predicting the future is difficult and although the faa has reasonably good record for accuracy in its activity forecasts the faa itself has pointed out that since the events of 911 the instability of the industry has led to larger errors in the agencys shortterm forecasts75 the recent unpredictability of fuel prices major component of aviation business costs also brings degree of uncertainty to aviation forecasts in addition the issue of quality versus quantity arises when considering airport stimulus spending approximately 73 of all airline enplanements takes place at the nations 35 busiest airports obviously anything that can be done to increase capacity and decrease delays at these airports has significantly greater impact on national aviation connectivity than is the case at noncongested airports in recent years the faa has tried to emphasize funding infrastructure projects at these airports as part of its operational evolution plan oep public discussions of airport stimulus spending thus far make it unclear whether andor how prioritization of funding requests from national benefit perspective will be part of the decisionmaking process for the distribution of additional aip assistance

infrastructure was built over 100 years ago and much of its equipment is over 30 years old due to perennial financial problems amtrak has regularly deferred investments in maintaining its infrastructure it now has an estimated 56 billion backlog in deferred maintenance this estimate does not include the cost of major improvement projects speed and reliability are two key features of modern intercity passenger rail service neither of which amtrak is able to offer in many other countries electrified trains run on dedicated routes offering gentle curves and intersections where roads cross railways at the same level at grade crossings this permits average speeds between stations of 125 miles per hour mph or more with top speeds of 175 mph or more and good ontime performance amtraks only high speed electrified line the nec still follows the alignment laid out over century ago and still has curves and several atgrade crossings that restrict speeds as result the average speed of amtraks highspeed acela service even between washington dc and new york city where there are grade crossings is around 80 mph in the rest of the country amtrak operates over freight rail lines where amtraks maximum speed is generally limited to more than 79 mph although federal law provides that amtrak is to be given operating priority over freight trains amtrak nevertheless experiences many delays due to freight rail operations as well as breakdowns of amtraks aging equipment amtraks systemwide ontime performance ratio was 71 in fy2008 even on its flagship acela route on the nec where amtrak controls the operations of all trains ontime performance was only 85 77 amtrak maintains transcontinental network with service in 47 states but it only captures measurable share of intercity travel in handful of relatively short corridors about 39 of amtraks ridership occurs on the nec while another 46 of ridership occurs on relatively short distance corridors in other parts of the country nationally amtrak captures 08 of intercity trips over 100 miles less than half the market share of intercity bus service which captures 21 78 amtrak has been successful in competing with air passenger service between two city pairs in the nec slightly more people ride amtrak than fly between washington dc and new york city 56 to 44 while slightly fewer ride the train than fly between new york city and boston 41 to 5979 however amtrak captures only 5 of the airrail travel market between washington dc and boston even though amtrak has been competitive with the airlines between many city pairs along the nec its real competitor is the automobile for trips between 50 and 499 miles one way amtrak and the airlines combined capture only 24 of the market while personal

continued to lose money offering that service as result since its creation in 1970 amtrak has relied on federal assistance to support its operations in recent years congress has provided around 13 billion annually to support amtrak the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2008 pl 110432 authorized significant increases in amtrak funding about 24 billion per year through fy2013 congress also directed the dot to issue request for proposals from the private sector for the development of highspeed rail in 11 federally designated corridors because there is dedicated user fee mechanism to raise revenue for rail investments as there is for other transportation modes amtrak must compete with other funding priorities from the general treasury there is guarantee that congress will appropriate funding at levels close to the amount that it authorized in the recently enacted authorization bill

while the federal highway administration has attempted to evaluate road building as an economic stimulus tool by estimating resulting job creation and the timing of federal outlays similar analysis specific to the rail sector is not available however some of the factors applicable to road building would appear equally applicable to the rail sector winter weather would delay some projects in the northern half of the country and it is likely that rail maintenance projects could get underway sooner than could new constr uction projects on some routes amtrak receives financial support from state governments so their approval of projects in some cases would be necessary since amtrak runs on track owned by the freight railroads for most of its routes cooperation from the host freight railroad is necessary regulatory approval of upgrades to freight rail infrastructure is not required but negotiation with the freight railroad is necessary because amtrak operates over their busiest corridors the issue of publiclyfunded improvements to private property may also arise railroad union work rules could be another factor affecting the jobs impact of funding rail improvements also the transparency of amtraks account keeping has been an important issue for congress in the past congress may seek to ensure that any economic stimulus funding for amtrak is directed towards jobinducing projects rather than servicing its debt for instance g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g20g138g146g149g155g152g138g141g561g21g142g140g157g152g155g561 since intercity passenger rail service is likely to require operating subsidies in all but the most densely populated corridors meeting certain conditions policymakers might consider the long term public financial commitment that is associated with investments in intercity passenger rail rail can compete with the automobile for trips that are uncomfortably long to drive and where road congestion is problem parking is concern at the destination city gas prices are relatively high and the destination city has an extensive public transit system thus for most city destinations it may be difficult for passenger rail service to match the automobiles flexibility intercity passenger rail can be time competitive with the airlines for trips less than about 350 miles because this is not sufficient distance for the air mode to exploit its speed advantage 81 where large cities are approximately this far apart and there are important intermediate cities on 81 train stations are typically located downtown while airports are located on the city fringe and security screening is more time consuming for air passengers

and accompanied by calls to invest in improved hydroelectric facilities and new locks to reduce outages and improve efficiency the federal agencies neither estimate their future infrastructure investment needs nor conduct national systematic needs assessments instead they undertake activities pursuant to congressional direction the backlog of active federal water resources construction projects that have been authorized by congress but have not been completed is roughly 70 billion and the backlog of deferred maintenance roughly 4 billion for reclamation and corps activities

developed in patchwork fashion over decades and interconnected to support system reliability and limited volume of bulk power sales the role of the grid has changed with the partial deregulation of the power market over the past 30 years the grid is now being used to carry large volume of wholesale power sales and serves as key element in maintaining competitive power prices in many parts of the nation this new role for the grid combined with low investment since the 1970s has led to concerns that the grid is overstressed and will ultimately fail to operate reliably and serve its new marketenabling function in addition to the stress of traditional generators connecting to the grid expanding the grid to reach remote areas suitable for developing wind and solar power is an emerging issue both for reliability concerns and concerns over who will construct the needed transmission an overriding issue for both generation and transmission is how the nation may respond to climate change policies the future emphasis on renewables and other green generating technologies or carbon sequestration would require large investment in the transmission system the demand centers for electricity are in some cases relatively far from renewable resources or areas that would be geologically favorable for carbon sequestration renewable power is currently more costly than coal and natural gasfired generation so incentives or mandates would be required to meet department of energy s july 2008 proposed goal of generating 20 electricity from wind by 2030 103 in general electric generation capacity will have to expand to meet future growth the current financial cris is will probably slow demand growth but it will also reduce investment in new power plants and create additional uncertainty about the future balance of electricity supply and demand the two issues of transmission capacity adequacy and reliability and expansion of generating capacity generally and renewable power in particular impact proposals for an extensive grid modernization program these modernization proposals take two forms one is the smart grid an umbrella term for series of technologies that would create an intelligent autobalancing of supply and demand selfmonitoring grid that integrates variety of energy sources with minimal human intervention 104 in addition to upgrading the existing grid second proposal is to expand the existing grid with new ultrahigh voltage backbone system that would allow renewable power in remote locations to be efficiently moved

sector these include production tax credits currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2009 for wind and some other renewable power sources tax credits for certain renewable and clean coal technologies loan guarantees for nuclear and other low carbon technologies and incentive rates for new transmission projects that meet certain criteria the current and future effectiveness of these programs has been debated for example although the loan guarantee program was created by the energy policy act of 2005 three years later the department of energy has still issued guaran tees the production tax credits have often been used in complex financial transactions to develop new wind farms but in recession the opportunities to conduct these transactions may contract 106

as noted above the potential investment requirements for the power sector may range into the trillions of dollars most of these privatesector investments would go into complex longlived privately owned and operated infrastructure which requires significant upfront planning accordingly there may be question of how much shortterm stimulus versus longterm benefits would result from power sector investments some larger concepts will require much more development before specific facilities can be built such as the ultrahigh voltage backbone grid certain smart grid technologies are perhaps ready for wide scale deployment such as advanced electric meters but there is currently smart grid template ready for national rollout 107 utilities do have many transmission projects planned and these could perhaps be accelerated or expanded with federal incentives108 in the west additional federal investment for bpa and wapa transmission expansion could provide means for spurring wind and solar generation development however most of these transmission projects would still require lengthy several year siting approval from each state in which the transmission line would be built

g21g157g146g150g158g149g158g156g561 the fbf provides capital for construction and renovation projects that typically range from several million to hundreds of millions of dollars when viewed as potential mechanisms for economic stimulus it may be noted that construction and renovation projects may not be distributed widely or equitably across states and calities in recent years fbf funding has been concentrated in relatively small number of projects in fy2008 for example 722 million was appropriated for six renovation projects and 531 million was appropriated for 11 new construction projects 123 fbf funding may be geographically concentrated as well the geographic concentration of construction funds is consequence of congressional infrastructure priorities eight of the 11 new construction projects funded in fy2008 were land ports of entry all of which were necessarily located in states that bordered mexico or canada124 the geographic concentration of fbf funds also occurs because cities with the largest existing federal presence are more likely to receive funding for workspace renovation expansion or consolidation three of the six fbf renovation projects that congress funded in fy2008 for example were in the district of columbia 125

an ongoing challenge for the federal building construction and renovation sector is to secure adequate funding to meet homeland security needs improve space and security at federal courthouses and reduce the backlog of federal buildings in need of repair the fbf does not now have the resources to meet all of those needs and there may be discussions in the future about restructuring the fbf to increase its available capital g4g155g152g138g141g139g138g151g141g343g344g348g561 broadband infrastructure refers to networks of deployed telecommunications equipment and technologies necessary to

satellite128 data from the fcc129 the pew internet and american life project130 and the us government accountability office gao131 indicate that broadband infrastructure is most lacking in rural and lowerincome areas in which there is less economic incentive for companie s to invest in such infrastructure even in areas where broadband infrastructure is present demand for those services may lag because of factors such as households inability to afford computers or broadband service it is difficult to estimate with any degree of precision the amount of funding that would be necessary to deploy ubiquitous broadband infrastructure throughout the united states broadband can refer to complex array of technologies speeds and capacities each with its own set of costs and benefits additionally the state of broadband data in the united states is incomplete and policymakers do not yet have clear or complete picture of where broadband is and is not deployed nor is there agreement

to be effective for economic recovery any federal broadband infrastructure program must induce incremental broadband investment beyond that whic h would be undertaken absent the program it is difficult to estimate precisely the impact of broadband infrastructure spending on employment according to the communications workers of am erica every 5 billion invested in broadband deployment would create 97500 direct jobs in the telecommunications information technology and computer sectors and indirectly lead to 25 million new jobs throughout the economy 134 june 2007 report from the brookings institution found that for every one percentage point increase in broadband penetration in state employment is projected to increase by 02 to 03 per year135 additionally many point to successful broadband deployments in other nations and argue that comparable broadband infrastructure is essential for future us economic competitiveness

assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment in addition to loans loan guarantees and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment wide array of policy instruments are available to policymakers including tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment demandside incentives such as assistance to low income families for purchasing computers governmentbacked broadband bonds regulatory and deregulatory measures and spectrum policy to spur rollout of wireless broadband services in assessing stimulus incentives for broadband deployment congress will likely consider the appropriate mix of broadband deployment incentives to create jobs in the short and long term the extent to which incentives should target nextgeneration
