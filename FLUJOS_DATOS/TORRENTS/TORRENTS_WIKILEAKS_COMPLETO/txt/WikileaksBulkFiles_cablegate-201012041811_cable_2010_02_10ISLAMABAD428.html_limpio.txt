president zardari ref islamabad 399 classified by ambassador anne w patterson for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary in february 16 meeting with president zardari senator kerry said that india was very open to constructive talks with pakistan and urged pakistan to reach an agreement with india on counter terrorism zardari said with us support talks could move forward he said he doubted broad talks with the taliban were possible specific regional efforts might succeed pakistan was fighting militants in pakistan on shoestring budget but zardari said that he was committed to finding ways to undermine the pull towards militancy in pakistani society kerry said that the gop needed to rebuild conflictaffected areas to cement military gains against the insurgency kerry encouraged zardari to develop trade agreements with pakistans neighbors and agreed to zardaris request to build consensus for liberalizing us trade with pakistan zardari lamented that he was casualty of the world recession and requested us support to relieve imf conditions on the pakistani economy he said he needed deal with the united states to strengthen his political position end summary encouraging an indopak agreement 2 c senator john kerry opened the february 16 meeting with president asif ali zardari by referring to his recent talks with indian pm manmohan singh and pakistani pm yousuf raza gilani reftel kerry said singh was very open to negotiation with pakistan starting with the upcoming discussions between pakistan and indias foreign secretaries kerry said that cooperation on counter terrorism with the indians could lead to indian compromises on key pakistani issues such as kashmir and water use in subsequent meetings kerry encouraged the gop to come up with specific offers to which the goi could respond 3 c zardari agreed dialogue is the only way forward however he justified continued suspicion of india citing recent confirmation that there was indian involvement in the mumbai attacks he claimed india had increased its military spending 30 percent this year and described this as direct threat to pakistan when kerry pointed out the chinese threat to india zardari responded that indian tanks cannot operate in the chinese border region and could only be intended for an attack on pakistan india has 4700 tanks he explained while pakistan has only 2600 capability creates fear he added 4 c kerry said zardari should put his concerns on the negotiating table as there was real opportunity for productive conversation between india and pakistan now you could arrive at surprising consensus of mutual understanding zardari conceded that singh deserved respect but said he was not confident about the rest of the indian government zardaris take on afghanistan and iran 5 c kerry asked zardari what affect president obamas announcement of us drawdown date had had on the possibility of success in afghanistan zardari answered that it had given boost to those fighting against the united states but that they live in illusion zardari doubted that the us would actually leave afghanistan in two and half years adding that one can afford that kerry asked if dialogue with the taliban was possible zardari gave qualified yes in specific regions like quetta dialogue might be possible but on larger scale it was not kerry asked to what degree events in iran have an impact in pakistan zardari said iran needs to be engaged and recounted his visit to iran as an emissary of the free world pakistans fight against militants islamabad 00000428 002 of 003 6 c kerry noted that with the december mosque bombing in rawalpindi pakistani terrorism had changed he asked if pakistan was going to commit to doing whatever it takes to get rid of extremism zardari replied that he was thinking of the future and what will win people away from extremism in ten or fifteen years he added however that he was fighting war on shoestring budget 7 c kerry said the gop needed to rebuild the conflictaffected areas as soon as possible he explained that new roads power plants and health clinics need to go in quickly or any progress made in vanquishing the militants and extremists would be lost zardari agreed but added that the war went beyond these areas he explained that when us soldier leaves afghanistan he longer fears for his life when pakistani soldier leaves the conflict areas however he has to worry that militants might target him in his home in punjab or sindh trade not aid 8 c zardari complained that reconstruction opportunity zones rozs were too confined and requested broader trade concessions for pakistan kerry said that given the increase in troops in afghanistan and the subsequent increased us demand on pakistan he would see if greater trading concessions for pakistan as whole could be included in an upcoming security package 9 c kerry warned however that his ability to push for liberalized trade agreement between pakistan and the us was directly tied to pakistans democratic stability and continued cooperation in supporting afghanistan and defeating terrorists every time there is hiccough in pakistans support kerry explained congress waivers on giving pakistan additional concessions or aid as pakistan was new democracy zardari said there would naturally be many hiccoughs but added message understood kerry said that pakistan also needed to create trade agreements with its neighbors which would let the pakistani public know that the gop was committed to real economic improvement pakistan nuclear assistance 10 s kerry said that the lingering aq khan network remained an albatross around pakistans neck pakistans ability to reach new security arrangement with india and the increased strength of pakistans democratic institutions would be necessary conditions for the us to consider civilian nuclear assistance to pakistan something for the people of pakistan 11 c zardari expressed his gratitude for us assistance to pakistan he opined that he was casualty of the world recession and needed something to give his people as all they had since he came to power were price increases zardari requested that the usg weigh in with the imf against further electricity tariff increases another increase he warned would result in riots in the streets however zardari promised to broaden the tax base and implement valueadded tax vat as required by the imf standby arrangement 12 c zardari said poverty uncertainty and the lack of educational and employment opportunities undermined pakistans potential as well as his political standing zardari said he needs deal to show his people that he has something to offer them and that assistance and trade concessions were prerequisites to be able to think about india 13 u this cable was drafted after senator kerry
