19772006 3 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl338391 these factors include increased incidence of di vided partisan control of the senate and the presidency increased disagreement among sena tors over nominees and rising attention to judicial nominations by interest groups see eg nancy scherer scoring points politicians activists and the lower federal court appointment process palo alto ca stanford university press 2005 and sarah binder and forest maltzman senatorial delay in confirming federal court judges 19471998 american journal of political science vol 46 1 january 2002returns and resubmissions of nominees to the us courts of appeals and district courts 19772006 introduction over the past 30 years the average time between presidential nomination and confirmation for persons nominated by the pr esident to lower court judgeships ie the us courts of appeals and district courts has increased steadily scholars and other observers have argued that several factors have contributed to this change1 one component of the increase in time to confirmation has been an increase in the number of senate returns of judicial nominations to the president all nominations including judicial nominations considered by the senate can be returned to the president in two cases after the adjournment sine die of congress or during recess of 30 or more days if the senate has not agreed by unanimous consent to carry nominations through the recess the pres ident usually renominates the person whose nomination was returned this report provides an overv iew of renominations that occur in the context of the process of appointing judges to what may amount to life tenure positions on the us courts of appeals and district cour ts the report then provides data on the number of returned and resubmitted minations between 1977 and 2006 covering the terms of presidents carter reagan george hw bush clinton and the first three congresses of presiden t george w bush this report first reviews the nomination process assessing how renominations fit into that process the report then summarizes trends in renominati ons between 1977 and 2006 with particular attention to the senate judiciary committees practice of holding or not holding hearings for renominated individuals finally the report analyzes the confirmation rates of renominated individuals compar ed with those who are nominated only one time throughout this report attention will be ca lled to the unique experience of the 107th congress where majority control of the senate shifted during the first session one of the consequences of that shift was the return of all of president bushs pending judicial nominees at the beginning of an intrasession recess in august 2001 one of the central considerations in this report is the difference between nominees and nominations each nominee to judgeship may receive several nominationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33839crs2 2 in the first congress there was some dispute as to how the senate was to carry out its constitutional function the senate agreed at that time to do so by voice vote see joseph harris the advice and consent of the senate st udy of confirmation of appointments by the united states senate new york greenwood press 1988 pp 3739 3 article iii section 1 of the us cons titution established the supreme court and such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish appointees to these courts hold their offices during g ood behaviour and their compensation may not be diminished while they hold their office j udges on article i courts also called legislative courts are appointed by the president are confirmed by the senate and serve for fixed term the territorial and commonwealth courts as well as the court of appeals for the armed forces the us tax court the court of appeals for veterans claims and the court of federal claims are all article i courts in this report judges nominated to the territorial and commonwealth courts are included in statis tical calculations those nominated to the other article i courts are not in cluded in statistical calculations 4 senators have usually exempted from unanimous consent one or more pending nominations and have only rarely insisted on the return of all pending nominations see crs report rl31980 senate consideration of presid ential nominations committee and floor procedure by elizabeth rybicki 5 the senates august recess has lasted at least 30 days every year since 1996 between 1977 and 1995 nine august recesses lasted fewer than 30 days in

resubmissions and confirmation of judicial nominees the constitutional provisions governin g appointment nd confirmation of federal judges are straightforward accord ing to article ii section 2 of the us constitution the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public nisters and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provi ded for and which sh all be established by law when the senate has consented to nomination it has done so in the form of vote on the presidents nominee2 this procedure applies to article iii judges as well as article i judges3 senate consideration of minee is driven by senate rules one such rule rule xxxi provides in part that nomina tions pending before the senate shall be returned to the president if the senate ad journs or takes recess of more than 30 days the rule may be set aside if the nate agrees to do so by unanimous consent but failure to waive the rule usually by senator objecting to proposed unanimous consent agreement returns pending nominations to the president when the senate takes recess4 the senates august recess tends to last longer than 30 days5 and the recess between sessions of congress may also last more than 30 days in addition to returns that may occur during recess of the sena nominations are returned to the president if nominee has not been confirmed or rejected by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33839crs3 6 the president may also renominate individuals whose nominations were rejected or withdrawn though this was not done with nomina tion to the us district courts or courts of appeals in the time frame covered by this report in 1844 president tyler renominated john c spencer to the supreme court after his nomination had been rejected by the senate the second spencer nomination was withdrawn by president tyler on the same day it was made see crs report rl33225 supreme court nominations 17892006 actions by the senate the judiciary committee and the president by denis steven rutkus and maureen bearden 7 roger l gregory originally nominated to the fourth circu it court of appeals by president clinton was confirmed once he was nominated by president george w bush as result he is considered one of president clintons 25 unsuccessful nominees see appendix 1 senate or withdrawn by the president by the end of congress presidents may resubmit nominations on which the senate did not take action in previous congress6 resubmissions are important to understa nding how long judicial nominees wait for senate confirmation on might consider the exam ple of priscilla r owen nominated to the fifth circuit court of app eals by president george w bush judge owen was confirmed by th senate on may 25 2005 on nomination submitted to the senate on february 14 2005 pe riod of 100 days from nomination to confirmation as appendix 1 indicates however judge owen was first nominated to the fifth circuit on may 1 2001 and he r confirmation after she was nominated fourth time did not come until 1477 days af ter her original nomination the three earlier nominations of judge owen were each returned by the senate during the august recess in 2001 and at the end of both the 107th and 108th congresses respectively resubmissions are also relevant to presidents success rate on judicial confirmations to take recent exampl president clinton made 105 nominations to the circuit courts of appeals 65 of which were confirmed one might conclude then that 62 of president clintons cour ts of appeals nomina tions were successful however president clinton nominated 90 i ndividuals to the courts of appeals of whom 65 were confirmed conf irmation success rate of 727 i n n administration if one calcula tes the percentage of conf irmations using the number of nominations as the denominator one w ill likely calculate lower success rate than if one uses the number of nominees as the denominator returned nominations patterns in returned nominations table 1 outlines how many nominations were returned by congre ss between 1977 and 2006 the columns in the table

congressesseveral patterns emerge from table 1 first the overwhelming majority of returns of nominations occur at the end of congress intrasession and intersession returns are less common if one excludes the 107th congress for reasons discussed below 38 nominations have been retu rned during congress since 1977 compared with 310 returned at the end of congress second the four congresses during wh ich the senate returned the most nominations were the 102nd 55 nominations returned the 106th 42 the 107th congress 71 and the 109th congress 50 forty of the 71 returns in the 107th congress occurred during the august recess fo llowing transfer in party control of the senate the 102nd and 106th congresses represent the final congresses coinciding with the presidencies of george hw bush and william clinton respectively one might interpret these numbers as suggesting that the senate when controlled by the opposite party of the presid ent may attempt to wait out president whose party the opposition hopes to see end its run in the white house but the evidence to support such conclusion is mixed the number of returns in the 104th and 108th congresses the end of the first terms of president clinton and president george w bush respectively is not much greater than for congresses that did not lead up to presidential election furtherm ore more nominations were returned to the president at the end of president reagans first term the 98th congress 24 nominations than at the end of his second term the 100th congress 17 nominations third returns have disproportionately affected nominees to the courts of appeals between 1977 and 2006 1437 nominati ons were made to district court positions of which 243 169 were return ed for the courts of appeals 461 nominations were made of wh ich 145 315 were returned8 fourth the number of returns has trende d upward particularly during the last eight congresses 102nd to 109th president george w bush has the greatest number of returned nominations per congress with 147 returns over three congresses an average of 49 nominations per congress if one excludes the 40 intrasession returns during the 107th congress the average is 357 return s per congress higher than the average number of returns per congress fo r president clinton 263 and president george hw bush 30 all three of t hose averages are higher than the average number of returns per congress for presid ent reagan 138 and president carter 105 figure 1 plots the trends in number of retu rns per congress counting all types of returns intrasession interse ssion and end of congress as figure 1 indicates in every congress from the 103rd 19931994 through the 107th 20012002 the number of courts of appeals nominations returned increased with dropoff in the 108th congress the number of returns of c ourts of appeals nominations in the 109th congress was the secondhighest in the past 30 years with the exception of the 105th congress similar pattern can be observed for district court nominations though thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33839crs6 9 to simplify table 2 the first session of each congre ss was not broken up into quartersnumber of district court nominations returned in the 109th congress 28 was the thirdhighest number since 1977 possible explanations for returns as suggested above analysis of table 1 and figure 1 makes clear that returns of nominations have generally increased over time and particular instances of high numbers of returns generally coincided with periods of divi ded party control of the pres idency and the senate but divided party control of th senate and presidency also existed during the 100th through 102nd congresses and the 101st congress 1989 1990 d the lowest number of returns of any congress since the 97th 19811982 furthermore in the absence of divided party control in the 108th and 109th congresses nominees were returned with some frequency another explanation for the generally increasing frequency of returns may be related to timing in particular the president may have made nominations too late in congress for the senate to have given fu ll consideration to the nominee if the timing of nomination contributed to th likelihood of return the nominations made later in congress would have been more likely to be returned to the president than those made earlier in congress this possibility can be evaluated by breaking each congress down into five periods specifically the first session roughly speaking the first year of any congress and then each of the quarters of the second session of each congress to see if the number of nominations returned increased in each period9 table 2 focuses on the first nomination of each individual to judgeship by the president and excludes those nominations

and the likelihood of return of nomination of the 1437 district court nd 461 courts of app eals nominations made between 1977 and 2006 1269 district court minations and 332 courts of appeals nominations met these criteria the nominations were assigned to one of the five time periods on the basis of the date th nomination was received by the senate table 2 presents information on when nomination was submitted to the senate and the percentage of nominations returned to the president as the data in table 2 indicate 50 of nominations made to the district courts in the first session of congress were re turned to the president while 404 of nominations made in the third quarter j uly 1september 30 of the second session of congress and 741 of the nominations made in the fourth quarter october 1 december 31 were returned this pattern suggests that one of the factors influencing the number of district court nominations returned to the president was the time in congress when the president made nomination this pattern is also found in nominations to the courts of app eals but the increase over time is somewhat less pronounced 160 of nominati ons made in the first session were returned at the end of congress while 306 of nominati ons made in the third quarter of the second session and 800 of the nominations made in the fourth quarter of the second session were returned the overall relationship between timing of nomination and probability of return may help explain why some nominati ons are returned while others are not but does not aid in understanding why the numbe r of returned nominations has increased over the past 30 years if however more recent presidents have made more of their nominations near the end of congress then the senate may be returning more nominations simply because the president is nominating more individuals to judgeships later in congress table 3 reports the percentage of nominees who received their first nominations in the last six months of congress to somewhat greater degree than 30 years ago presidents are nominating individuals to the district courts late in congress and the senate is returning those nominations with greater frequency pres ident george w bush 189 of first nominations subm itted in the last six months of congress submitted greater percentage of nominations to district court judgeships than any other president in the past 30 years followed by presidents reag an and clinton both at 168 as the second column of table 3 indicates greater percentage of president george w bushs endofcongress nominations have been returned by the senate than any other presidents in the last 30 years the incr eased percentage of nominations made late in congress and the increased percentage of those nominations returned during president george w bushs tenure may explain the increase in returns but may themselves be explained by still other factors httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33839 crs8 table 2 number of

renominations have occurred 10 times since 197712 table 4 and figure 2 track renominations of district court and courts of appeal s nominees by president and congress the patterns observed in returned minations appear to some degree in renominations whereas returns were most common at the end of presidents term renominations were least common during the first congress of president because individuals whose nominations were return ed in the last congress of predecessor were unlikely candidates for renomination this is particularly noticeable when partisan control of the presidency

data and there has been marked increase over time in the number of renominations these two patterns clearly flow from the increase in returned nominations but some specific data may prove illustrative of the 1437 total nominations to district court positions between 1977 and 2006 136 or 94 were renominations of the 461 total nominations to the courts of appeals over that same time period 103 or 223

per congress fo r each president president carter resubmitted judicial nomination an average of two times per congress president reagan resubmitted judi cial nomination an average of 95 times per congress president george hw bush did so seven times per congress and president clinton averaged 133 judicial renominations per congress if one does not count the 40 nominations returned by the senate in august 2001 and resubmitted the next month president george w bush has averaged 297 renominations per congress for his first three congresses15 figure 2 tracks this rise by congress for district court and courts of appeals nominations that were resubmitted as figure 2 indicates greater number of renominations have certainly occurred over the last three congresses but the 104th 105th and 106th congresses all saw more renominations than most other congresses the clear exception being the considerable number of renominations to district court judgeships in the 99th congress 19851986 which followed the return of 17 nominations to district court judgeships in the 98th congress 19831984 beyond the second nomination several nominees to the district courts and courts of appeals were renominat ed more than once between 1977 and 2006 table 5 reports the number of times each indi vidual was nominated to particular position as table 5 indicates courts of appeals minees were more likely to have multiple nominations than district cour t nominees 127 of 1301 98 district court nominees were nominated more than once while 70 of 358 196 courts of appeals nominees were nominated

resubmissions and confirmation previous sections of this report have focused on nate practice with returns patterns in presidential resubmissions nd how renominated individuals were treated by the senate judiciary committee this section examines how renominated judicial nominees ultimately fared before the senate relative to other judicial nominees if returns and renominations tend to indicate controversial nomina tions then one might expect that fewer judicial nominees who received multiple nominations were confirmed than those who were nominated only once on the other hand there is some evidence that returns particularly of district court nominations are necessitated by the senate not finding time in its schedule to confirm nominees on their initial nominations if returns and renominations are driven largely by the senate calendar and by extension the time the vacancy occurs and the time the president takes to fill vacancies with nominees then renominated individuals s hould be confirmed at nearly the same rate as individuals who are nominated only once table 8 presents the percentage of nominees confirmed by the number of times they were nominated during the 1977 2006 period district judges who were nominated only once were confirmed 902 of the time on the first nomination of those district judges who were renomin ated 881 were conf irmed on the second nomination and 889 of those who receive d three nominations were confirmed on the third nomination therefore the da ta indicate that fo r district judges renominations and returns that necessitate the presidents renomination do not appear to diminish substantially the probability that the nominee will eventually be confirmed the same cannot be said for nominees to the courts of appeals examination of table 8 reveals that 865 of the nominees who were nominated only once were confirmed23 that number fell to 783 for s econd nominations and to 556 for third nominations furthermore of the five individuals who received four nominations two 400 were confirmed therefore the data indicate that nominees to the courts of appeals faced declining probability of confirmation the more often their

feature of the judicial nomination and confirmation process this report chronicles the uneven rise of renominations in the judicial nomination process be tween 1977 and 2006 and assesses the senate handling of hearings for judicial nominees whose nominations have been resubmitted as well as the ultimate prospects for confirmation for nominees whose nominations were returned and resubmitted at least one time two important trends emerge from this analysis first returns by the senate and renominations by the president have grown over the past 30 year s within that overall growth senate returns of nominations are most common in the final congress of presidents term before the 107th congress the two congresses with the most returned nominations were the 102nd congress when democrats controlled the senate and president george hw bush was ending what would be his only term as president and the 106th congress when republicans controlled the senate and president clinton was ending his second term second there is an important distincti on between the path of nominees to the us district courts and the us courts of appeals nominees to the courts of appeals were more likely to have their nominations returned by the senate were more likely to be renominated more than once though less likely to be renominated by president of different political party than district court nominees were more likely to have second hearings if they received hearings on their first nominations and were less likely to be confirmed on their s econd and subsequent nominations than nominees to the district courts these tr ends reflect an incr easing controversy over courts of appeals nominees the difference in the treatment of district court nominees and courts of appeals nominees has beco more pronounced in the last 30 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33839 crs20 appendix 1 us courts of appeals nominees with resubmitted nominations 95th congress 109th congress 19772006 nominees name circuit
