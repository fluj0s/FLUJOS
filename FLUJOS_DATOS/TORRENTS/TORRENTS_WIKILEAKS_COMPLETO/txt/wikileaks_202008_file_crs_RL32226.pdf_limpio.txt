year the congressional r eauthorization debate focused largely on money issues there was an expectation within the highway community that new reauthorization legislation should contain significantly higher funding levels then existing legislation large source of new revenue for these trust fund financed programs became available however the american jobs creation act of 2004 october 22 2004 pl 108357 however provided for modest increases in revenue primarily as result of changes in gasohol taxation other than funding the provision of thes bills that seems to engender the most controversy is the longstanding donor donee state problem both bills tried to resolve the tension between socalled donor and donee states by seeking to increase funding now or in the future and creatin g mechanisms to gu arantee each state higher rate of return on their proportiona l contribution to the highway trust fund 95 in both bills versus 905 in curre nt law the house bill however would have accomplish this by requiring reopeni ng of the reauthorization funding debate before the end of fy2006 in order to insu re that additional funding is found for donor states without taking future funds away from donee states politically unpopular alternative that ma have complicated final action on this legislation as proposed neither bill ma kes major structural changes to the core highway programs both bills however add new highway programs this is especially the case in the house bill which creates among other things multibillion dollar program to construct projects of nationalregional significance

as transit are codified in 49 usc highway and transit program reauthorization legislation in the 2nd session 108th congress introduction this report discusses significant legisla tive provisions in the two principal bills that were the subject of congressional di scussion to reauthorize federal highway highway safety and tran sit programs in the 108th congress these are the senate bill s 1072 the safe accountable flexible nd efficient transportation equity act of 2003 or safetea passed by th senate on february 12 20041 and the house bill hr 3550 the transportation equity act legacy for users or tealu passed by the house on april 2 2004 although reaut horization is more that year overdue all highway highway safety and transit programs continue to operate as result of extension legislation conference co mmittee was unable to complete its work prior to the end of the 2nd session from the publics perspective the ongoing surface transportation reauthorization debate is taking place against the backdr op of growing concern about congestion and sprawl in urbanized areas and increased c oncern about maintaining access to markets and the rest of the national transportation system in ru ral areas the congressional debate focuses prima rily on money given the large increase in funding made available by the last reauthorization bill the transportation equity act for the 21st century2 better known as tea21 there appear s to be an expectation in some quarters that the reauthorization under di scussion should also provide for large increase in funding at the time tea21 was passed confluence of circumstances provided for considerable boost to highwa trust fund revenues unfortunately for those seeking extensive new funding s imilar confluence of events appears likely any time in the near future as result much of the discussion rns on whether significant additional funds can be found for federal surface transportation programs or whether funding for these programs will be limited to the modest growth forecast for the highway trust fund over the next six years if new funds can be found many of the provisions put forth in house and senate legislation may be adopted in some form during the reauthorization process without sign ificant new funding sources however ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs2 competition for the existing pot of funds will almost surely ensue amongst the various state regional and programmatic stakeholders so far this competition has stifled the reauthorization debate and led to furthe r extension of the tea21 framework this report begins with brief overview of the house and senate bills followed by an examination of how the two bills deal with the problem of constrained budgetary resources and donordonee state issu it then examines the proposed programmatic changes for the federalaid highway programs environmental and safety provisions and issues are then discussed finally the bills mass transit and intermodal provisions are examined overview of legislative proposals this report focuses on the two pieces of legislation under cons ideration in the house and the senate that were the princi pal vehicles for the reauthorization debate in the 108th congress safetea and tealu the senate comp leted action on its bill s 1072 on february 12 2004 the hous has also completed action its bill hr 3550 doing so on april 2 2004 the bill as approved by the house however provided funding at leve l well below what the comm ittee originally intended at introduction to emphasize this point the committee at its march 25 2004 markup also passed similar bill hr 3994 with hi gher funding levels but did not report it prior to house and senate considera tion the bush administration submitted bill of its own indicating the administrati ons reauthorization views and priorities this bill was introduced by request in bot h the house and the senate as s 1072 and hr 2088 respectively which are hereafte r referred to as the administration bill it should be noted that the senate bill carries the title safe accountable flexible and efficient transportation equity ac t of 2003 safetea originally proposed by the administration bill the senate committee on environment and public works further chose to use s 1072 as their markup vehicle and amended the bill by including their own provisions in the nature of substitute s 1072 in its senate passed form however is the senate b ill and although it contains provisions proposed by the administration the bill itself is dramatically different from the introduced version of the bill in both the house and the senate multiple com mittees have role in reauthorization in the house most of the bill as discussed above is under the control of the committee on transportation and infrastructure the house committee on science contributes to the res earch title of the bill hr 3551 and the house committee on ways and means has jurisdiction over the revenue title hr 3971 all three committees reported legisla tion that became part of hr 3550 during floor action on april 2 2004 in the senate the senate committee on commerce science and transportation had previously marked up bill s 1978 srept 108215 authorizing the motor carrier safety administration and national highway traffic safety administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs3 3 the administration bill as introduced allowed for 247 billion in total f unding the presidents budget submission for fy2005 adjust s this figure upward to the 256 billion amount 4 the full text of the

during floor c onsideration the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs whic h has jurisdiction over federal transit administration fta programs marked up its portion of the reauthorization bill which was also attached to s1072 as an amendment finally the senate committee on finance has jurisdiction over the revenue title of the bill the finance committee title the highway reauthorization and ex cise tax simplifica tion act of 2004 was marked up in committee on february 2 2004 this title was also added by amendment to the now senate passed version of s 1072 much of the discussion about the reaut horization bills has centered on the total spending envisioned in each proposal th senate bill is believed to contain 318 billion in total spending authority for the period fy2004 fy2009 the house bill as passed by the house now contains 275 billion which is dramatically below the 375 billion figure found in the introduced versi on of the bill either bill is above the administrations stated position that tota l spending be set at 256 billion over the next six years3 breakout of expected progra m authorizations by major activity is shown in table 1 neither the house nor the nate proposal can be funded by current revenues projected from the progra ms existing funding sources as will be discussed later in this report the administration bill could perhaps be financed from current revenue sources the bush administration has gone on record against the level of spending proposed by s 1072 and has indicated its inte nt to veto any bill of such size that congress might generate4 letter signed by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of transportation on februa ry 11 2004 indicated that they would recommend presidential veto of any b ill that included new taxes bonding or unrelated provisions dealing with issues lik amtrak which is included in the senate bill the senate passed its bill by vote of 7621 senate bill managers therefore believe that barring changing the administrations mind on this issue they could override veto5 the administration in march 30 2004 statement of administration policy is also threatening veto of the house passed version of hr 3550 at its 275 billion spending level this veto threat came as surprise to many house members the bill passed the house with possibly veto proof margin of 35765 it is therefore unclear whether the president would be able to sustain veto of this legislation for procedural reasons the senate br ought hr 3550 to the floor on may 19 2004 and adopted it with the text of s 1072 inserted in the nature of substitutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs4 6 transportation weekly v5 march 29 2004p 1 22 7 for more information on extension legislation see crs report rs21621 surface

billion reauthorization bill march 29 2004 p1 there are several ways table such as this can be constructed this table shows the totals most commonly associated with each bill there are for example know issues with the totals for the house and senate bills which in both cases might be different than those shown here by one analysis6 the house bill contains total author izations of 2838 billion extension legislation as mentioned earlier all existing highway highway safety and transit programs continue to operate on the basis of legislation that extends the program structure of tea21 congress is now on its sixth program extension pl 108 310 this extension continues the highway program until may 31 2005 the existing authorization had been extended previously to february 29 2004 pl 108 88 to april 30 2004 pl 108202to june 30 2004 pl 108224to july 31 2004 pl 108263 and to ptember 30 pl 1082807 it was hoped at the time that the first extension was passed that this would give congress sufficient time to complete action on reauthorization bill ear ly in the second session this was not the case and it is now clear that the reauthorization discussion will be taken up again in the 109th congress by choosing may 31 2005 terminati on date for the existing programs congress has given itself some leeway to find solution to the funding debate that has so far stifled longterm reauthorizati on legislation it was the hope of many on the authorizing committees that new congress and newly reelected president will be more sympathetic to the idea that transportation needs require significant additional funding it was also the hope of the authorizers that additional sources of funding for these programs would be identified before may 31 2005 to some extent this has already been the case as result of the changes in gasohol taxationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs5 8 scope has become the term most used to scribe what programs within the total federal aid highway program will be included in th rateof return on trust fund contributions calculation afforded by the enactment of the american jobs creation act it should be pointed out that the potential 24 billion in new reve nues that these change might raise over the next six years are still far below the amount needed to fund the program at the levels under discussi on during conference conference issues there are numerous and significant di fferences between s 1072 and hr 3550 all these were to have been resolved in conference deciding on the total authorization level is the most obvious nd perhaps most difficult policy issue that needed to be resolved as mentioned above veto threat looms over either of the total funding amounts contained in the two bills and the bush administration threshold is well below the amount required to fund either of the bills in their current form the donordonee issue will be one of th conferences most difficult issues both the house and senate solutions to th is problem require more funding now and in the case of the house even more in the fu ture before either can provide states with the 95 return on contributions to the trus t fund that many desire instead of the existing 905 also in play is the scope of the program to be covered by the minimum guarantee or equity bonus8 leaving programs such as the house passed high priority project program in or out of the scope can dramatically effect states expected annual funding there are several large new allocated discretionary programs in the house bill that require significant new funding as wr itten funding decisions for these programs will be made by fhwa alt hough many expect these funds to be earmarked if the programs are included in the conference report at least initially these new programs reduce the proportion of the funds provided by the bill that are available for core apportioned formula programs many stat prefer apportioned funds that are under their control as opposed to dedicated discretionary funds hence it is likely that the conference will be required to termine the final ratio of programs under state versus earmark or fhwa control although environmental issues were not an important part of the floor debate in either the house or the senate some environmental interests remain concerned about certain provisions in the bills dea ling with streamlinin g and conformity for example the house bill includes statute of limitations on legal claims and specific deadlines for project milestones during project environmental review also there is major difference between house and nate bills on the section 4f publically owned lands and histor ic sites provisions how significant these issues will really be remains to be seen the issue of earmarking will be major part of the conference the house passed version of hr 3550 contains 2884 specifically enumerated high priorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs6 projects under the highway program and numerous additional earmarks for transit projects the senate bill however is bereft of earmarks it is widely believed however that the senate will insist on significant share of any earmarking that might emerge in the conference bill for transit the major issue is also money with project designation earmarking especially of new rail starts not to dist ant second the principal issue to be resolved in the traffic safety nhtsa portion of the b ill is the criteria to be used to determine which states qualify for funding under th section 405 occupant protection and section 410 alcohol counterm easures programs all of the items discussed above are discussed in more detail later in this report conference actions the conference committee met on several occasions beginning in june 2004 on three occasions the conf erees adopted relatively sm all number of legislative provisions that had been agreed upon dur ing staff meetings larger and more important decisions were put off pending decision by members on total program size and on how to solve the donordonee issue during june and july 2004 house and nate conferees exchanged series of informal overall funding proposals the first house proposal would have provided for 298 billion in total spending with guar anteed obligations of 288 billion getting to these numbers required 10 billion re scission of existing unspent contract authority the senate countered with an offer of 303 billion in total spending of which 290 billion would be guaranteed thi s offer requires 13 billion rescission just prior to the beginning of the summer district work period july 22nd the conferees met once more and each made newl adjusted offers the house offer was for 299 billion in total authority with 284 billion guaranteed 15 billion rescission it was alleged but not confirmed that the bush administration would accept these numbers and sign bill that included them the senate offer was 301 billion in total spending of which 289 billion was guaranteed 12 billion rescission at this meeting it was decided that further efforts to reach compromise on the final bill would have to wait until september staff was directed to work with fhwa to determine how either of the offe rs would effect stat distribution of funds and how the donordonee framework would be adjusted by these competing offers when congress returned it continued to investigate number of funding alternatives none however proved satisfactory to all parties although several public statements were made by conferees about the desirability of completing work on bill during the 108th congress real progress ppears to have been made instead congress passed the af orementioned extension legi slation delaying the need for long term reauthorization until early in the 1st session of the 109th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs7 9 for more detailed history of the trust fund see crs report rl30304 the federal excise tax on gasoline and the highway trust fund short history by louis alan talley 10 for discussion of federal transpor tation fuel taxes see crs report rs20281 transportation fuel taxes and legislative issues by bernard gelb highway and transit finance highway trust fund background the highway trust fund consists of two separate accounts hi ghway and transit which are sometimes mistakenl referred to as separate trust funds in practice the highway account and the transit account are discussed as though they were separate entities with the highway trust fund being synonymous with the highway account the highway trust fund is the oldest and largest of the transportation trust funds the fund was created by separate revenue title in the federalaid highway act of 1956 1956 act pl 84627 the 1956 act provided funding for construction of the now virtually complete dwight d eise nhower system of inte rstate and defense highways in addition the 1956 act pr ovided some funding for other federal highway programs over the last 40 plus ears the highway trust fund and the federal programs it supports have been changed numerous times9 in almost every instance congress has chosen to expand the sc ope of the federa l highway program the transit account was created by th surface transportation assistance act of 1982 pl 97424 the transit account gave transit providers consistent federal funding source for capital spending on new and rehabilitated infra structure and for other purposes the highway trust fund is financed fro m number of sources including sales taxes on tires trucks buses and trailers as well as truck usage taxes but approxi mately 90 of trust f und revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels10 the majority of the motor fuel revenue dedicat ed to the trust fund is derived from an 184 cents per gallon tax on gasoline 244 cents on diesel the hi ghway account receives an allocation equivalent to 1544 cents of the tax and the transit account receives the revenue generated by 286 cents of the tax the remaining 01 cents goes into the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund trust fund budgetary treatment tea21 changed the way the highway trus t fund relates to th federal unified budget in two ways first by creating new budget categories and second by setting statutory limitations on obligations the act amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit the act further amended the budget process by setting the limitation on obligations for each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 in authorizing rather then appropriations legislation in addition tea21 provided mechanism revenue aligned budget aut hority raba to adjust these amounts in the highwayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs8 11 for more information see crs report rs21164 highway finance rabas double edged sword by john w fischeraccount but not the transit account so as to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in highway generate d revenues raba issues will be discussed in greater detail in the next section of this report it should be pointed out all of the above notwithstanding that annual revenues and expenditures aff ecting the balances in the trust fund accounts remain pa rt of the overall annual fe deral deficit calculation the net effect of the changes was to t predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit prog rams referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee these categories are separate d from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the use of funds assigned to these categories for any other purpose these so called firewalls were viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of f unding for highway and transit programs additional funds above the fi rewall level could be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process but for the most part this did not occur except in fy2003 coming into the reauthorization debate there were reports that some members would like to revisit the speci budget status of the trust fund at the time of this writing however specific objections to continuation of the current system have arisen both s 1072 and hr 3550 would maintain the existing system the only change in the bills is in the raba computation reforming revenue aligned budget authority raba11 w h n raba was created it was done with the unde rstanding that highway funds would be increased if revenues to the trust fund in creased above expectations and reduced if the opposite occurred in 1998 it was view ed as unlikely that revenue would decrease since growth in trust fund reve nues had increased continuously during the almost all of the 40plus ear life of the trust fund between fy2000 and fy2002 raba provide d almost 9 billion in additional funding for designated highway programs the raba adjustment in the fy2003 budget however negative 43 billion surpri sed even those who expected small decline in raba as result of the recession that began in 2001 the 43 billion negative raba would have resulted in an actual year over year decline of 86 billion in federal highway assistance provided to the states the previous years total had been dramatically increased by positive raba adjustment this yearoveryear drop in the program was more than congress was willing to allow as part of the fy2002 sec ond emergency supplemental bill pl 107206 the raba adjustment for fy2003 was elimin ated in fact congress eventually provided full adjustment of spending by adding sufficient funds from the unexpended balance in the trust fund to f und the program at its authorized level the events of fy2003 created interest in amending the raba mechanism during reauthorization to reduce the chan ce of very large annual swings in raba adjustments both the house and senate bills try to eliminate these swings in bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs9 12 there is general acceptance of the idea that there are significant unmet surface transportation capital infrastructure needs there are however numerous questions about their measurement the fhwa and the fede ral transit administration fta needs studies of the last few years are viewed as much improved in this regard over the studies done decade ago questions still arise as to how needs are determined how the costs associated with these needs are derived and how state w ants are separated from actual state needs as result the issue of highway and transit system conditions and needs is complex and beyond the scope of this paper additional information can be found at the dot website httpwwwfhwadotgovpressroomtest020926htm and at the aashto website httpwwwtransportationorgbottomline 13 as discussed in us congress joint committee on taxation description of the highway reauthorization and excise tax simplification act of 2004 jcx504 ja nuary 29 2004instances this is done by changing the way raba is computed by the office of management and budget this is done by eliminating what has been required look ahead computation that tried to pred ict the direction of the national economy in addition the senate bill suspends ra ba adjustment until fy2006 this is likely due to concerns about the level of une xpended balances in the trust fund among other technical considerations in add ition s 1072 requires that reduction under raba be allowed so long as the cash ba lance in the highway account of the trust fund exceeds 6 billion this again could be viewed as way to mitigate against possible repeat of what happened in fy2003 revenue raising proposals much of the debate about the need fo r new revenues focuses on the concept of unmet highway and transit system needs as detailed in report authored by the fhwa and federal transit administration fta12 the report indicates that the costs required to improve the surface transportation system far exceed the projected ability of federal state and local governments to pay for them transportation organizations while not advocating major structural changes in the federal highway and transit programs are advocating an increase in funding comparable to that in tea21 which was 40 plus larger then its predecessor istea pl 102240 they do not however have ready source of funds to accommodate this increase many but not all in the transportation community are reluctant to seek fuel tax increases at this time the bush administration has made it clear for well over year that it will oppos any increase in federal fuels taxes number of members of congress incl uding much of the house republican leadership is also on record against fuel tax increases as result the transportation community has been seeking alternative sour ces of new revenues for the highway and transit program the discussion below addre sses many of the proposed revenue sources that have been under discussion during the 108th congress the senate committee on finance agreed to proposal identifying seve ral sources of additional funding for reauthorization purposes that was made part of s 1072 dur ing floor debate13 supporting documents provided during fi nance committee markup on february

the amounts estimated during committee markup as of this wr iting there has been outside examination as to the accuracy of the revenue estimates assu med in the committees documents also several of the revenue sources iden tified do not provide new money to the treasury and are instead redi stributions between treasury general funds and the trust funds in the senate proposal each of these redistri butions is offset by other changes in tax law that are primarily not transportation re lated and are beyond the scope of this report the house committee on ways and means has acted on substantial portion of its title of the reauthorization bill by passing h r 3971 the highway reauthorization tax act of 2004 this bill provides 177 billion in additional revenue for the highway trust fund over the next sixyears the bills provisions are similar to those found in the nate bill insofar as changes in ethanol fuel taxation and reduction of fraud and abuse activities are concerned all of the provisions of hr 3971 were attached to hr 3550 during floor consideration prior to the end of the 2nd session congress passed the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 this legislati on was primarily directed at solving an international trade problem it also addre ssed wide range of other revenue issues in the case of transportation the act ddressed many of th revenue provisions discussed in this section the authors of the bill hope that the provisions enacted will raise 24 billion over six years in additi onal revenue for the highway trust fund redirecting portion of the gas ohol tax 25 cents to the trust fund and increasing trust fund receipts by an amount equivalent to the existing gasohol xemption 52 cents as part of federal policy to promote the use of ethanol as substitute for gasoline fuel that is up to 10 ethanol gasohol has been exempt from portion of the federal fuels tax usually 52 cents per gallon in addition 25 cents of the tax levied on gasohol based fuels has been deposited into the us treasurys genera l funds from the perspective of the transportation interest community these factors are depriving the trust fund of income that it deserves gasohol users use the highway system and in this view are not paying their fair share for its upkeep and improvement according to some estimates transfe rring the 25 cents currently deposited in the general fund to the trust fund would net the fund more than 700 million per year crediting the trust fund with the equivale nt of the 52 cent exemption not currently collected in any form would result in more than 15 billion per year14 this 22 billion plus per year would obviously make significant potential contribution to the highway program in both instances it shoul d be pointed out that while there is ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs11 15 for detailed information see crs report rl30369 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci and jasper womachsignificant net increase to the trust fund there is concomitant opposite effect on treasury general funds the problem for those supporting change s in gasohol taxation is the unified budget with the budget back in defic it situation any action that will potentially increase the overall deficit will be greeted with certain amount of caution and potential opposition diverting the 25 cents is straightforward decision about the appropriate destin ation for these funds in the budget crediting the trust fund with funds equivalent to the 52 cent exemp tion is more problematic the 15 billion would likely have to be derived from f unds already deposited in the treasury from nontransportation sources those who percei ve that redirection of an annual 15 billion might come at the expense of other government programs important to them can be expected to object to such move the ethanol issue was part of the 1st sessions as of ye t unresolved debate about federal energy policy15 part of that debate concerned the proposed volumetric ethanol ex cise tax credit veetc which essentially woul d have taxed ethanol at the full transportation fuels ta x rate and deposited these funds in the highway trust fund ethanol producers would be offered tax credit equivalent to the increase in taxation from the general f unds the senate finance committee adopted this provision in its february 2 2004 ma rkup estimating that it would provide 14 billion for the trust fund during the six year reauthorization period hr 3550 now contains similar provision estimating th at these changes will raise 151 billion over the same period ethanol provisions addressing both the 25 cent and 52 cent issues are included in the american jobs creation act the authors of the act believe that these provisions will raise combined 18 billion for the trust fund during the life of the bill an additional 900 million is also provi ded to the trust fund by making the 25 cent change retroactive to fy2004 paying interest on highway account unexpended balances all us treasury managed trust funds with the exception of the highway tr ust fund receive interest payments on their unexpended balances one of the changes made as result of tea21 was to stop paying interest on the unexpe nded balance in the highway trust fund the rati onale behind this decision was the creation of raba which is supposed to reduce growth in the unexpended balance by making funds more immediately available for highway projects for number of reasons that are beyond th scope of this report the unexpended balance in the highway trust fund continued to grow albeit at much slower rate during most of the tea21 reauthorization period interest paymen ts could be source of additional funds for the trust fund according to congressional budget

in the near term it is doubtful that they would approach the predictions of 2002 an intervening drop in the trust funds unexpended balance combined with historically low intere st rates on treasury bonds has lowered the expectations of those expecting large annual returns from th is revenue raising proposal the whole issue of paying interest on trust funds is controversial subject interest payments are essen tially intergovernmental fund tr ansfers the federal funds needed to pay interest do not represen t new revenues for th federal treasury proponents of paying interest on the highway trust fund belie ve it is only fair for the treasury to pay for the use of money deri ved by special purpose revenues in the same way bank pays inte rest on savings accounts opponents of this practice however believe that such payments only rais the cost of government in general and that all federal reve nues should be treated the same regardless of how they are collected the senate has adopted provision that w ill allow for payment of interest on highway trust fund balances this provisi on is expected to provide 2 billion over six years it should be pointed out that mo st of these interest payments are expected to accrue in the early years of this period as balances in the trust fund are expected to decline if s 1072s increased spending provisions are enacted the house bill is devoid of similar provision spending down trust fund balances related to the interest issue is the fact that both the highway account and th mass transit account continue to carry positive unexpended balances spending down these balances has been an issue in the past and was an important part of the tea21 debate it should be pointed out however that the unexpended balance is not surplus as it is frequently and incorrectly referred to by some in the transportation community rather considerable portion of these funds are reserved to cover the funds existing obligations the house senate and ad ministration proposals all re ly on spending down the unexpended balance in the trust fund the senate proposal expects to spend down the balance to an amount lower than 65 billion in any year during the next reauthorization period there is however limit to how low the balance in the trust fund can go the trust fund has fiduciary protection measure know as the byrd rule for former senator harry byrd of virginia that has been feature of the highway finance system for most of the last four decades in simple terms the byrd rule prevents the further obligation of federal highway funds if the current and expected balances in the trust fund fall below certa in level the senate bill in potentially controversial move changes the byrd rule to allow the spending proposed in s 1072 to occur at rate that otherwise could have triggered the rules spending restrictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs13 tax fraud and abuse an issue of long standing is the concern that all fuel tax revenues are not being collected as required alternately there is concern that illegal tax avoidance activities are reducing total revenue collections discussion about tax compliance has been feature of each of the last

revenue collections funding has been provided in the past to fhwa and internal revenue service irs effort s to improve collections and reduce fraud hearings held in the 107th congress by the senate committee on finance identified continuing collection issues as result the committee has concluded that improved collections could raise an additional 4 billion over the sixyear life of the authorization and has included related pr ovisions aimed at raising this amount of additional revenues during its markup the senate committ ee on finance added provision that redirects over 21 billion from the airport and airway trust fund to the highway trust fund of this amount 89 is directed in to the highway account and the remaining 11 is directed into the mass transit account according to the committee this is an amount that they believe corresponds to the use of aviation fuel which is taxed at lower rate in surface transportation vehicles this in the committee view is an instance of tax avoidance andor abuse that needs correction during the amendment process this provision was modified inst ead of fixed annual amount the secretary of the treasury is tasked with identifyi ng and estimating the amount of aviation fuel being used in surface transportation vehicl and crediting the highway and transit accounts appropriately timate of the amount of reve nues this will provide has been made at this time the house bill contains similar provisions the house bill estimates that fraud and abuse enforcemen t activities should provi the trust fund with slightly more than 2 billion in additional revenues during the reauthorization period provision addressing this issue is included in the american jobs creation act the authors of the act believe this provision will provide the trust fund with an additional 51 billion over the next five years ending fuel tax exemptions an issue not discussed in detail during the last year is the concept of ending fuel tax exemptions for wide range of fuel users such as local governments certain agricu ltural interests and school bus operators the senate finance committee ma rkup estimates that it will be able to increase trust fund revenues by 8 billion over the next six years by changing the manner in which exemptions have been collected or funde d and by changing number of other tax provisions major change proposed at ma rkup appears to require all fuel users to either pay the federal fuels tax and seek refund or to immediately document their exemption from payment under the provi sion these groups remain exempt from taxation but reporting as to what would have been paid in the form of fuel taxes is required where it was not befo re all of the funds identif ied here are not new money rather they are transfers from treasury

decided not to include any bonding provisions in the revenue section of the bill the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto began consideration of bonding mechanism by proposing the creation of new 595 billion bond program as an alternative vehicle for financing surface transportation projects its plan would have created organization to be know as the transportation finance corporation tfc that would be established by congress to issue bonds the tfc would issue tax credit bonds for sale in the open market senate finance actively considered proposal that would have created bonding mechanism for transit funding during the 1st session of the 108th congress17 under the proposal the 286 cents dedicated to the mass transit account would have been redirected to the highway account and tax credit or other bonds would have been issued to fund the transit program this proposal was met with considerable criticism from the transit community it was also met with veto threat from the bush administration which viewed the issu of bonds as grave threat to the general fund and the governments ability to control spending18 although senate finance dropped its proposal the use of bonds continues to be discussed in the context of reauthorization and as will be discussed ter in this report bonding provisions were added to s 1072 dur ing the floor amendment process the house ways and means committee also considered bonds as part of its revenue proposal an earlier bill consider ed by the committee hr 3967 contained the same ethanol and fraud nd

proposal and reported hr 3971 without bond provision increasing andor indexing the federal fuels tax the american road and transportation builder s association artba took the lead in actively promoting an increase in the federal fuels tax19 its two cents makes sense proposal would raise the federal fuels tax two cents per year during the life of the next reauthorization according to artba

increase in the fuel tax will add between 15 billion and 18 billion to the trust fund on an annual basis it has been argued that if congress and the president are unwilling to raise the fuels tax they should at least consider indexing it in the future supporters of this idea believe that the trust fund should be indexed to the consumer price index cpi or some other measure of national economic activity to allow revenues to the trust fund to keep pace with inflation over the last decade indexing would likely have added few cents to the fuel tax with concomitant increase in revenues this mechanism however may provide the greatest benefit dur ing periods of high inflation which has not been the case in recent years although not specifically endorsing the artba proposal chairman don young of the house committee on transportati on and infrastructure as well as other members of the committee leadership have ndorsed an increase in the federal fuels tax20 this has mostly been proposed in the c ontext of indexing at first discussion of this idea centered on retroactively indexing the fuels tax back to the last time it was raised in 1993 more recently the indexing under consideration has been prospective for the next sixyear authoriz ation period in either case it was hoped that the fuel tax increase would amount to about 8 cents fuel tax increase however is proposed in either the house or the senate bills long term viability of the trust fund system many observers are concerned that the funding uncertainties created by the fy2003 raba debate and increasing interest in identifyi ng alternative power sources in the auto industry eg fuel cells and hybrid power should alert congress and the transportation industry to the fact that its longstanding trust fund revenue sources should be reviewed there is growing recognition of this problem but specific suggestions as to how the long term health of the trust f und could be ensured are few in number both hr 3550 and s 1072 contain provisions that would create commission or in the case of s 1072 commissions to study this issue so that its recommendations might be acted upon during the next reauthorization cycle new funding much of the lobbying in preparation fo r reauthorization is as shown above predicated on the belief that some signifi cant level of new fundi ng can be identified for the highway highway safety and tran sit programs given the existing state of the economy and concerns about the costs associated with the war on terrorism homeland security and the costs of sustaini ng our effort in iraq such conclusion however is far from foregone if none of the revenue raising proposals discussed above are ultimately adopted income to the trust funds is still predicted to

be reduced this process has been very expensive the mg program under tea21 became the largest federalaid highway program in the final years of the tea21 authorization cycle to raise the guaranteed

authorization would have had advantages during the current authoriz ation cycle but could have posed problems for authorizers when they faced the next reauthorization cycle the big advantage of phasing in the increase is that it saves money while fulfilling the promise to raise the guaranteed return to 95 on the ot her hand it shifts the heaviest burden on the trust fund to the last year of the authorization possibly constraining future authorization increases in fy2010 and beyond as introduced tealu included budgetary escape valve on the rampup to 95 which would have suspended the

controversial and is believed by some observers to create problems for th functioning of the mg by placing significant number of new and expanded pr ograms outside the mg umbrella the house bill as reported and eventually passed by the house would restrict the impact of the mg calculation of guaranteed appor tionment shares to roughly 84 of the total program26 donor states are concerned that this situation would mean that they will have to successfully compete for earma rks in the allocated nonmg programs to achieve even the lowered 905 rate of re turn level relative to the all the highway programs this arrangement has the adva ntage of keeping down the overall program costs it also means however that when donor states eventually compare their

reported 29 see transportation weekly v 5 march 29 2004 p 7814 crs has not verified the accuracy of this analysisreturns on dollar contributions to the htf many will still fall below the specified share return another issue concerns earmarking because the mg sets the overall amount of funds that states get for the progra ms under the mg umbre lla earmarking within this group of programs does not genera lly bring any new money to the state27 these earmarks merely allow members of congress to set project priorities the core formula program totals for each state adjust through changes in the mg distribution for the impact of the designation an earmark outside the mg group of programs will actually increase the amount of money go ing to the state this makes shifting the hpp out of the mg group especi ally controversial because the 111 b illion authorized would through earmarking significantly impact the state shares when eventually calculated on dollar for do llar basis the 66 billion projects of nationalregional significance program could also impact state shares28 with roughly 37 billion of the 225 billion contr act authority provided for federalaid highway programs outside the mg progra m most donor states did not favor tea lus mg proposal when the bill was brought to the floor some donor states however did well enough in obtaining hpp earmarks that according to some analysis they might be better off if the hpp were kept outside the scope of the mg29 both the issues of scope and the impact of earmarking on the mg program surfaced during debate on the floor of the house in the form of an amendment hamdt 514 offered by representativ johnny isakson of georgia the amendment would have brought both the hpp and the projects of national and regional significance within the scope of the mg the amendment also would have increased funding to the core highway formula programs however the wealth of earmarks and perhaps the hesitance of so donor state representatives to break with the transportation and infrastructure committee leadership softened the cohesiveness of the donor state coalition and the am endment was defeated minimum guarantee

return on payments over the life of the bill32 the process of ramping the donor states up to 95 return appears to have variable impact on states for example michigan and indiana achieve 95 return in fy 2004 while california nd texas remain at 905 til fy2009 as mentioned earlier some sparsely populated low population and low income states receive some pr otection under the proposal however some donee states new york and pennsylvania for example face significant share reductions donor donee conference issues conferees face reconciling the house and senate bill quity guarantee provisions that differ in approach scope and rate of return the house bill retains the basic tea21 minimum guarantee structure perhaps its main advantage is that it is known program with six year track record on the other hand the way the mg is calculated and implemented is complex and has been shown to at times to have unexpected outcomes the senate equity bonus eb program is new approach which in concept is much simpler than the mg some of this simplicity however is lost with the protections special rules and limitation adjustmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs23 imposed on the bonus even so it probably simpler equity paradigm than the tea 21 model although there is track record to judge it by scope is major issue for conferees there are really two scope issues that will need to be dealt with first is the breadth of the scope as percentage of total funding the scope of the house bill is r oughly 84 the scope of the senates eb proposal is roughly 93 this percentage could change depending on the treatment of the hpp project list in conference appl ying each bills guaranteed rate of return against the scope of the two bill means that in effect the rate of return in the house bill it is 905 of 84 of the total bill prior to the september 30 2005 reopener requirement while in the senate it builds to become 95 of roughly 93 of the total bill in the last year of the authoriza tion second is the issue of the choice of programs within the scope of the eventua lly decided equity provision the house bill has significantly more new or reconfigured pr ograms than the senate bill part of the scope decision making process will have to be which programs are kept in the final bill and which are dropped or ltered in the past donor states almost always argued for the broadest scope possible the experience in the house with the isakson amendment however may i ndicate that donor state suppor t for the broadest scope possible may not be as predictable as in the past the core of the equity debate is the prope r level of the mg rate of return on state payments to the htf providing for substantial increase in the guaranteed minimum guarantee percentage is an expensive propositi on as mentioned earlier the mg became the largest highway program under tea21 even the house bill as introduced which had roughly 70 billion more in contract authority than the house passed version could only ach ieve 95 guaranteed return by phasing in the increase over the life of the bill the much smaller bill passed by the house retains the tea21 guarantee of 905 coupled w ith the reopener provision the case can be made that the reopener provision in effect makes the house bill an 18 month reauthorization bill the senates eb gets to the 95 guarantee but only by delaying the bonus for some of the large donor states until the last year of the authorization despite the dissatisfaction over the dela yed nature of their 95 guarantee by senators from major donor states the nate bill may have an advantage in conference in that it does get all the donor st ates to the 95 goal even if it is only in the last year of the authorization on ce that level has been achieved it could set precedent that could be difficult for future authorizers to ignore on the other hand debate on the house floor brought up concer ns that too broad scope aligned with percentage guarantee as high as 95 could constrain congress from dealing with all federal transportation needs the spe nding for which could not always rationally be spread across all states statistical caveats number of statistical issues have an impact on mg and eb proposals the use of noncurrent data ie revenue timates from two years prior may skew the state donordonee ratios and lead to conclusi ons about donor or donee status that are questionable also statebystate data on payments to the highway account of the htf are estimates based on extrapolations from state tax data and may not always be accurate or up to date the economic cycle can have an impact on revenues and the budgetary process that can lead to year s when revenues and sp ending levels differhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs24 33 httpwwwfhwadotgovpolicyohpihssindexhtmsignificantly from each other this can have an impact on rate of return finally the mg and eb proposals attempt to achieve specified sha re return on two year old payments data distribution equity however is almost always judged by table fe 221 in the annual fhwa highway statistics report33 which compares estimated dollars paid and apportionmen ts and allocations received in the same year this statistical disconnect means that even an effective mg or eb program will face criticism when the same year dollar for dollar return data are released in addition the impact of proposed revenue changes on stat relative shares of payments to the htf are hard to gage over the life of the reauthorization these changes could change some donor states to donee states or vice versa over the next few years it could also impact the calculation of prog ram size under the mg the difficulties with statistics are particularly acute dur ing the reauthorization process because reauthorization deals with changing law and looking to the future there is an enormous amount of uncertainty in any sta tistical analysis many assumptions must be made which may or may not prove to be accurate as the future moves into the present the share of payments data wh ich begins the mg calculation change from year to year and not always in predictable ways this alone can have major impact in donordonee outcomes and especially on the projection of total program size the projection of statebystate allocations ove r six year authorization although perhaps not as unpredictable as the reve nue data is also uncertain crs contact bob kirk house reopener provision as mentioned earlier the introduced version of hr 3550 was 375 billion bill with that am ount

infrastructure reluctantly bowed to house leadership and repor ted 275 billion bill as rewritten to accommodate this lower funding level the mg level remains at the 905 level through the life of the

of highway and transit legisl ation however have believed that national purpose is served by requiring that each state spend at least portion its federal funding for programs that they view as having national importance both the house and senate bills contain provisions that enhance transferability the senate bill includes several such provisions two of which are particularly notable first is provision that allows highway funds to be transferred to other federal agencies and allows them to administer projects in certain instances second provision allows the secretary of tr ansportation to approve transfers of funds between states for the funding of one or more specific projects and in addition to allow states to transfer funds to fhwa for the same purpose the house bill also contains

provision is modified ve rsion of the freeing alternatives for speedy transportation fast act hr 1767 s 1384 the provision would direct the secretary of transportation to establish an interstate system fast lanes program under which state or public or private entity designated by state could collect tolls for the purpose of reducing traffic congestion by constructing one or more additional lanes on the interstate sy stem the fast lanes program requires that all tolls be collected electronically and that revenues are only to be used for debt service on investment reas onable return on

cmaq is to reduce emissions fro m highway travel as means to assist states in complying with the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for carbon monoxide ozone and particulate matter the program is based on the fundamental concept that lowering the num ber of miles traveled by motor vehicles and reducing congestion to make vehicles operate mo re efficiently can reduce emissions and improve overall air quality under current law states with areas that are in nonattainment with the naaqs and those that must maintain them r eceive cmaq funds according to formula based on the severity of air pollution in those areas and the population residing in them states that do not have any nonatta inment or maintenance areas each receive 05 of the total annual cm aq apportionment categori of project eligibility include 1 mass transit 2 traffic flow improvements 3 rideshare programs 4 traffic demand management pr ograms 5 bicycle and pede strian projects 6 public education 7 vehicle inspection and ma intenance programs or 8 conversion of vehicles to burn alternative fuels according to the federal highway administration fhwa more funding has been obligated for conventional mass transit projects than for any other activity approximate ly 44 of total cmaq funds since fy1992 after more than decade of implementa tion the difficulty in quantifying the overall emissions bene fits of cmaq projects has cause d some to question whether the program has improved air quality significantly enough to help states comply with the naaqs due to the uncertainty of th programs benefits some advocate that its focus should be shifted away from ai r quality to reducing traffic congestion in general others argue that areas on the verge of attainment may benefit from the continued use of cmaq funds for air qua lity projects even if the emission reductions are relatively small they also argue that more areas will be in need of emission reductions in order to comply with stricter federal standards for ozone and fine particulates scheduled for implementation in 2004 nd that air quality benefits from cmaq projects matter how small would be helpful as passed neither hr 3550 nor s 1072 w ould shift the cmaq programs main focus away from reducing emissions from motor vehicles rather both bills would retain the programs basic st ructure and increase its funding overall however the house bill would require each state to redirect relatively small portion of its cmaq funds to general c ongestion relief activities that would not require an evaluation of air quality benefits as condition of approval the bill also would require each state to redirect portion of its f unds for the national highwayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs41 system surface transportation program and interstate maintenance to general congestion relief activities as mentioned earlier in this report th amount that would be redirected from each of these four programs would be termined by statutory formula based on 10 of states apportionment for each prog ram multiplied by the percentage of states population residing in urbanized areas with population in excess of 200000 the total amount of funding redirected from each program would likely be less than 10 as states entire population would have to reside in urbanized areas of this size in order for the full 10 to be diverted environmental organizations have expr essed concern about the house proposal arguing that portion of cmaq funds coul d be diverted away from states with serious air quality needs to those that ve relatively good ai r quality proponents of the house pr oposal c ounter that the questionable impact of cmaq projects on improving overall air quality warrants freeing up some of these funds for reducing traffic congestion based on transportation needs rather than air quality considerations prior to the redirection of funds the house bill would authorize total of 94 billion in guaranteed funding for cmaq projects from fy2004 through fy2009 the senate bill would authorize about 134 billion over this sa time frame and would not divert any cmaq funds to ge neral congestion relie f activities both amounts are higher than the administr ations proposal of 89 billion and the previous authorization of 81 billion howe ver assessing the adequacy of the proposed funding levels is difficult becaus of the lack of quantitative data on the overall emissions bene fits of cmaq projects and the current uncertainty of the extent to which states will need to reduce emissions from various sources in order to attain the stricter federal air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates in addition to authorizing funding each bill would expand project eligibility although in differing ways the hous bill would clarify cmaq eligibility for certain types of projects that would impro ve traffic flow as means to reduce congestion and thereby lower emissions specifically the house bill would allow the use of cmaq funds for projects th at improve transportation systems management and operations there has been some confusion over the availability of cmaq funds for these types of projects and the house bill would specify their eligibility in federal statute the bill also would require states to dedicate portion of their cmaq funds to support the deployme nt of intelligent transportation systems its while such projects are already elig ible for funding states are not required to set aside funding for them under current law the house bill also would add anothe r category of eligibility to the cmaq program for advanced truck stop electrification systems these systems could help to reduce emissions from heavyduty transport vehicles that are frequently left idling overnight or for extended periods in orde r to provide electrical power for heating air conditioning electronic and communi cations equipment onboard the vehicle systems that would provide electricity to these vehicles and eliminate the need for engines to idle for several hours would re duce emissions that would be otherwise be generated by that vehicle however these emission reductions might be partiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs42 offset from power plant emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to power these systems unlike the house bill the senate bill would expand eligibility to allow the use of cmaq funds for the purchase of alternativ fuels as defined in the energy policy act of 1992 as well as the purchase of biodiesel similar proposals have been introduced in standalone legislation in the 108th 107th and 106th congresses proponents of the sena proposal argue that making cmaq funds available for the purchase of alternative fuels would provide additional incentive for the use of cleaner burning fuels and thereby help to improve air quality others counter that the proposed change in eligibility would in eff ect be subsidy for the alternative fuel industry and that the air quality advantag of these fuels will likely diminish as stricter diesel fuel standards are phased in beginning in 2006 the senate bill also would make cm aq funds available for two other new purposes one related to hi ghway construction in genera l and one specific to the purchase of certain types of equipment fi rst states would be allowed to use cmaq funds in order to ensure the deployment of strategies that would reduce emissions from fleets of vehicles that are used in highway construction projects in nonattainment and mainte nance areas the b ill would require states to ensure that such strategies are in place and that they are consistent with applicable guidance the purpose of these strategies would be to help control emissions that occur during the construction phase primarily from the operation of heavyduty vehicles whereas the current focus has been on controlling emissions resulting from highway travel after the road is built second the senate bill also would expand eligibility to include projects or programs that involve the purchase of inte grated interoperable emergency communications quipment however it is unclear how cmaq funds could be approved for these ty pes of projects as the appr oval of funding is contingent upon whether project has the potential to re duce emissions and thereby assist state in attaining or maintaining federal air quality standard unlike the house bill the senate bill also would amend the statutory funding formula for determining how cmaq funds ar distributed among the states the formula would be revised to include fact ors for new nonattainment areas that do not meet the stricter federal air quality standa rds for ozone and fine particulates the structure of the current form ula is based on classificati ons of nonattainment under the previous ozone standard and does not include any funding factors for either fine or coarse particulates because the classifi cation system for the designation of new ozone nonattainment areas is di fferent from that for the pr evious ozone standard and because there currently is not funding factor for particul ate matter nonattainment areas states with new nonattainment areas signated under the stri cter standards for these pollutants would not receive gr eater share of cmaq funds without the proposed revisions to the statutory formula in response to continuing questions bout the air quality benefits of cmaq projects the senate bill would require further study of the programs effectiveness the secretary of transportation would be required to consult with the administrator of the environmental protection agency to evaluate representative sample of cmaq projects and determine their impact on emissions and congestion levels the purpose of the study would be to assist states and metropolitan planninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32226crs43 47 for additional information see crs report rl32057 highway and transit program

176 of the clean air act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the sips specifically projects must not cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard increase the frequency or verity of any existing vi olation or delay timely attainment of any standard because new highways generally lead to an increase in vehicle miles traveled and related emissions both the statute and regulations require that an areas transportation improvement program tip which identifies major highway and transit projects an area w ill undertake demonstrate conformity each time it is revised ie at least every two years highway and transit projects cannot receive federal funds unless they are part of conforming tip while conformity has been required for more than decade the impact of the conformity requirements is expected to grow in the next few years for several reasons the growth of emissions from suvs and other light trucks and greater than expected increases in vehicle miles traveled have both made it more difficult to demonstrate conformity recent court decisions have tight ened the conformity rules and the scheduled implementation in 2004 of more stringent air quality standards both for ozone and for fine particles such as those found in diesel exhaust will mean that additional areas are subject to c onformity thus numerous metropolitan areas could face temporary suspension of high way and transit funds unless they impose sharp reductions in vehicle industrial or other emissions in recent survey the general accounting

bills that would authorize major highway and commercial motor vehicle safety programs and grants include the senatepassed reauthor ization bill s 1072 and the housepassed bill hr 3550 these bills propose various changes in federal safety programs and grants that directly affect the eligibility criteria and amount of funds provided to the states from the federal highway trust fund each of these bills to varying degrees includes some provisions taken or modified from the administrations safetea proposal in general the house bill would authorize more funds for safetyorien ted activities than would the senate bills four major categories of interest are infrastructure as part of the reauthoriz ation process congress may decide the authorization levels and eligibility criteria for obtaining and using various federal aid highway categorical grants and whether separate categorical grant for safety is authorized based on the key bills under c onsideration it appears likely that new separate grant for safety may be authorized both the house and senate bills would place particular emphasis on f unds to enhance safety at grade crossings and reduce road hazards the set aside for highway safety infrastructure projects now specified as part of the stp may be eliminated s 1072 creates new apportioned gran t program called th highway safety improvement program hsip which would include

its hsip funds are to be redistributed to other eligible statesauthorized under title 23 of the us c ode furthermore at least 200 million per year must be spent by the states on the elimination of road hazards and the installation of protective devices at grade crossings some ve questioned whether the amount of this set aside is justified given the relatively small number of deaths typically 430 or less per year that occur at such crossings49 in order to obligate hsip funds s 1072 requires the states to have program that implements strategic highway safety plan that identifies and analyzes highway safety problems and opportunitie s and describes program of projects or strategies to reduce identified safety problems50 also states strategic plan must adopt performancebased goals that focus resources on areas of greatest need and establish and implement schedule fo r conducting safety projects for hazards correction and prevention developed with input from many sources and coordi nated with several other transportation planning mechanisms the plan is intended to guide the expenditure of funds authorized under the hsip before apportioning funds to carry out th hsip the secretary is to set aside 70 million per year for the new safe routes to school program these funds are to be used for the planning design and constr uction of projects to encourage children to bike and walk to school safely s 1072 specifies that state must allo cate for bicycle and pedestrian improvements certain amount of funds that is related to the percentage of all fatal crashes in the states involving bi cyclists and pedestrians also s 1072 specifies that 25 million for each of the fiscal years fy2004 through 2009 shall be used for projects in all states to improve traffi c signs and pavement markings consistent with the reco mmendations in fhwa publication to accommodate older drivers and pedestrians the bill also includes provisions intended to improve work zone safety for example the secretary would be required to issue regulations requiring workers whose duties place them on or in close proximity to federalaid highway to wear highvisibility clothing and implement other safety measures as the secretary deems appropriate s 1072 also includes sanction that woul d be used against any state that does not enact or is not enforcing an open c ontainer law basically such law prohibits the possession of any open alc oholic beverage container or the consumption of any alcoholic beverage in the passenger area including drivers area of any motor vehicle located on public highway or righ tofway of public highway of state starting in fy2008 state could lose up to 2 of specified federal aid highway funds if it does not have or enforce such law if during fouryear

educati onal initiatives to support those campaigns with respect to grant funds intended to help states combat drunk driving s 1072 if enacted would result in many subs tantive changes to current law the senate bill would substantially revise the eligibility criteria used to determine which states receive funding under the s ection 410 alcoholimpaired driving countermeasures program in addition s 1072 would provide twice the financial incentive that state would otherwise receive to each of the 10 states with the highest impaired drivingrelated fa tality rate for the preceding fiscal year hr

would be gu aranteed the sena bill provides 565 billion for transit all of which would be guaranteed the house bill provides 515 billion for transit guaranteed from the funding perspective the admin

also provides two exceptions to that limitation public transit operators could provide charter bus service to local government agencies and to social service agencies with limited resources many organizations could reasonably claim to have limited resources and local government agencies could for example include school districts in which case charter service could be provided to school groups the house bill would change the current statute which provides that the secretary of transportation may withhold from tran sit operator an amount of federal funding the secretary deems appropriate where the secretary finds pattern of violations of the limitation on charter service by chan ging may to shall section 3023c rural transit both the house and senate bills would significantly increase

issues intermodal freight connectors both the house and senate bills establish new program for financing improvements to intermodal connectors intermodal connectors are the access routes to airports coastal or river ts and rail or pipeline terminals59 the access routes are typically short segments of road generally less than two miles in length and are usually local county or city streets that connect the freight terminal to the national highway system many of the connectors especially those leading to seaports are in older industrialized urban areas tw recent dot surveys have found that these access roads in many cases are inadequate to accommodate the heavy truck traffic they handle60 the pavement may be in poor cond ition or the intersections and width of the roads may not be designed to handle large trucks in some cases there may be preponderance of atgrade rail cro ssings which impede traffic flow intermodal connectors have been described as low hanging fruit metaphor used to express the notion that relatively modest investment in these road segments could yield substantial returns in freight movement and reliability however several reasons have been cited as to why proj ects involving intermodal connectors may be difficult to advance one reason may be that urban priorities typically emphasize commuter concerns over freight concerns financing these projects may be difficult because there is dedicated funding sour ce and each mode tends to jealously guard the use of their mode specific trust funds projects designed to improve the exchange between modes

are already in adequate condition projects are to be chosen based on the criteria specified in 1996 dot report to congress entitled pulling together the nhs and its connections to major intermodal

terminal within specific state the federal share of the cost of these projects would be 80 according to the house bill and 90 according to the sena bill the senate bill specifically mentions projects to eliminate railroad crossings or make railroad crossing improvements as an eligible use of funds under this program while neither the house nor senate proposals establish dedicated funding source for intermodal connectors these proposals ssentially represent formal recognition in legislative language of cargo hub access problems as an eligible use of nhs funds freight planning recent gao report on freight transportation stated that the fundamental limitation to overcoming freight mobility challenges is that the publicsector process at the state and cal levels for planning and financing transportation improvements is not well suited to address freight projects62 the gao recommended that the dot help state nd local planners consider freight when determining investment levels for transportation projects both the house and senate bills include language intended to ensure greater consideration of cargo hubs and freight transport in state and mpo tran sportation planning processes the approaches however are somewhat different the senate bill requires each state dot to designate freight transportati on coordinator whos responsibility will be to ensure that freight considerations are integrated into the planning process coordinate with other states to solv regional transportation problems foster collaboration between public and private interests nd build professional capacity to better understand freight tr ansportation needs within state the house bill requires the us dot to establish freight capacity building program in order to better target

adopted the use of larger and heavier 286000 pound cars and short line railroads in order to maintain their role as collectors and distributors of mainline traffic need to improve their track structures to handle these new cars the bill would authorize 350 million in grants for each year fy2004 fy2006 the grants would cover 80 of the project cost with the remaining 20 covered by nonfederal source grants would be awarded on competitive basis to either the railroad directly or to state or local government with the concurrence of the railroad in prescribing regulations for administering the grant program the secretary of transportation is required to condition the award of grant to railroad on reasonable assurances by the railroad that the facilities to be rehabilitated and improved will be economically and efficiently utilized nd ensure the award of grant is justified by present and probable future demand for rail service by the railroad among other criteria federal aid to short line railroads ma generate debate during congressional consideration because unlike other modes rail infrastructure is privately owned in addition to the heavier car issue supporte rs of government aid to railroads have argued that it is justified because in some instances it may be cheaper to upgrade rail lines than to expand highways others have argued that rail aid is needed to offset the effect of truck operators not payi ng the full cost of providing highway infrastructure to them they cite dot highway cost allocation study that estimates that fuel taxes registration fees and taxe s on equipment that the heaviest trucks pay into the highway trust fund amount to 80 of their full cost of highway use63 opponents of public aid to railr oads argue that it would be better to refine truck user fees so that they cover the full cost of their infrastructure rather than provide offsetting subsidies to railroads oppone nts also question the governments ability to choose rail projects that will generate the highest economic returns they worry that states will compete with one another to assist railroads in their state in order not to lose economic developm ent to neighboring state64 rail line relocation the senate bill establishes grant program to assist municipalities in relocating ra il track in order to improve public safety the flow of motor vehicle traffic or for

included in appropriations limitations the funds provided are still considered discreti onary for purposes of the congressional budgetappendix 1 transportation budget terminology transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority prior to tea21 changes in sp ending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appr opriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amends authorized funds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legisl ation appropriations are re quired to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations tea21 greatly limited the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the act enumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 in authorizing legislation65 highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are pr esented perhaps months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represente d in the trust fund as obligated funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from bala nces trust fund balances therefore appeared high in the past in part b ecause funds sufficient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts ve substantial shor t and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribution of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed by the fhwa to the states under formulas set by tea21 for example ll national highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds are funds distributed by fhwa typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal lands highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not appear in the congressional budget but of ten provide frame of reference for highway program recipients who may ssume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per
