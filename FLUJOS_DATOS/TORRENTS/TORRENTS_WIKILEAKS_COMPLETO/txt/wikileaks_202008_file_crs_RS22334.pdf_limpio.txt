above these issues may be brought to the councils attention by the chair the coordinator or with the permission of the chair any agency head on the council the council may make recommendations to the president regarding these issues20 t h council is to terminate after three ears unless the president extends it21 analysis the coordinator and council tablished by the presidents executive orders may be seen as unique framework fo r providing governmentwide response to disaster of unusual scope and magnit ude an analysis of the framework however leads to two questions potentially of interest to congress first is th coordinator appointment sistent with the appointments clause of th constitution which gives congress role in determining the appointment method for fficers of the united states second will congress have restricted access to the c oordinator when carrying out its oversight function president bush has previously used his authority to establish new coordinating office in response to national crisis as pa rt of his response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the president issued 13228 which established the office of homeland security ohs in the eop at th same time he appointed tom ridge as the assistant to the president for homeland secu rity the order provided that the head of ohs would be the assistant to the president for homeland security thus making the ohs leader member of the white house offi ce staff the executive order specified that the mission of the office was to devel op and coordinate the implementation of comprehensive national strategy to secure the united states from terrorist threats or attacks22 as presidential advisor rather than statutory official ridge lacked statutory authority and resources nonetheless as an assistant to the president ridge benefitted from access to and the backing of the pres ident operating under the presidents authority ridge could potentially have held considerable sway in coordinating the homeland securityrelated f unctions and budgets of numer ous federal agencies because congress had an interest in the governmentwide coordination of homeland security activities and budgets number of congressional committees sought ridges testimony during oversight hearings arguing that presidential assistants rarely testify before congressional oversight committees the administration declined to allow ridgehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22334crs5 23 see louis fisher the politics of executive privilege durham nc carolina academic press 2004 pp 224226 and crs report rl31148

emphasis added 26 the law provides that except as otherwise prov ided by this chapter the secretary may delegate any of the secretarys functions to any officer employee or organizational unit of the department 6 usc 112b1 it appears for example that the secretary could redelegate to the coordinator such fema functions as t hose identified in 6 usc 317a2d which pertain to recovery by rebuilding communities so individuals businesses and governments can function on their own return to normal life and protect against future hazards 27 buckley v valeo 424 us 1 126 1976to appear in that context after written exchanges between the white house and the chair and ranking member of the senate appropriations committee ridge offered to come to the capitol and brief members of congress in formally outside the context of oversight hearings23 the more recently created coordinator position has government wide coordinative functions similar to those of the head of ohs the organizational location and potential resources and authority of the position howev er differ from the ohs model nominally senior executive servicelevel appointee the coordinator enjoys unusual positional power his authority on the council exceeds that of any of the other members many of whom are cabinet members although the coor dinator is not the ch air the chair is to consult with the coordinator in the leadership of the council furthermore the coordinator is the one council member who is empowered to bring issues to the councils attention without the chairs permission the coordinato r in his departmental role is further empowered by the president in relation to department and agency heads government wide consistent with existing law these officials are to provide the coordinator with information and otherwise cooperate with him carrying out the coordinators mission the coordinator is then the focal point fo r managing information flow requests for actions and discussions with stakehol ders regarding the federal response24 s spelled out in the executive order the coordinators role is arguably operational as he is to ensure the proper implementation of the presidents policy25 furthermore although neither of the november 1 executive orders provide the coordinator with any statutory authority the coordinators organizational cation within dhs allows the secretary of homeland security to delegate such authority to him26 given the positional power and authority of the coordinator particularly if the secretary delegates statutory authority to h im the question arises whether or not the coordinator would be considered an officer of the united states under the appointments clause of the constitution the supreme c ourt has held that any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states is an officer of the united states and must therefore be appointed in the manner prescribed in the constitution27 article ii 2 cl 2 provides that

nov 21 2005 p a8 29 telephone conversation with representative of the white house nov 23 2005the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states w hose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior offi cers as they think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments therefore if the coordinator is to exercise significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states it could be argued that it is the role of congress to prescribe in law how an appointment to the position shall be ma in effect it coul d be argued creation of position with the power and authority th at the coordinator c ould have would require action by congress rather than the president or the secretary of homeland security because of the hybrid nature of the coordinator position the lines of accountability are not clear as the current officeholder sees it my acc ountability is to the president i report to the president28 inasmuch as the coordinator is to be the focal point of the federal governments multibillion dollar recovery and rebuilding effort in the devastated gulf coast region however congress may insi st on direct accountability of that official to congressional oversight committees w ill these committees have unimpeded access to the coordinator for thos officials subject to senate confirmation the senate usually gains during that process commitment from th nominee to respond to requests to testify when asked this commitment may not be necessary under most circumstances to obtain testimony white house official s indicated that the reason the coordinator position was established in dhs rather than the white house was to facilitate the kind of communication with congress that was point of contention in the ridge case29 additional oversight questions might arise however from the hybrid nature of the position because it has features of both departmental positi on and white house position it is unclear if the coor dinator will behave more like department official or presidential advisor with regard to providing testimony will the coordinators activities as council member in the eop be open to the same vel of oversight as his departmental actions or will these activities be subject to executive privilege claims the unusual hybrid coordinator position was created by the president in response to national crisis of unique dime nsions this hybrid arrangement might arguably be more effective in coordinating fede ral recovery and rebuilding fforts than one in which the incumbent is more clearly an officer of the united states in dhs or as in the ohs model presidential advisor in the eop the office has the clear backing of the president governmentwide information cooperation and access the re sources and infrastructure of dhs and potential opera tional authority as delegated by the secretary as an unusual kind of office however this arrangement raises some questi ons about congresss constitutional appointment and oversight roles congress might elect to establish in statute different mechanism for coordinating these efforts along more customary lines of authority and accountability
