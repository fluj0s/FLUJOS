koyiaki group ranch po box 158 narok february 18 2003 the minister for lands and settlement ardhi house nairobi dear sir re the maasai mara national reserve illegal excision and registration without adjudication of parcel narokcis maratalek155 memorandum the land in the mara national reserve is unadjudicated trust land titles may be issued in relation to it until the land adjudication act has first been applied however prior to such application and subsequent adjudication the director of the kenya wildlife service together with the particular local authority must respectively approve and consent to any alteration of boundaries of reserve and parliament must by resolution signify its approval to the alteration the land adjudication act had not been applied to the mara because it had been reserved for the protection and conservation of wildlife and deemed inappropriate to adjudicate and register it in the names of individuals this confirms that the land adjudication act has not been applied to the area of title no155 the narok land registrar one mr john kimoi chepkurui regardless of nonobservance of legal prerequisites registered it in the name of one livingstone kunini ole ntutu who does not reside in that area to qualify to share in its adjudication the area of that title is whooping 4000 acres since its registration is illegal the title ought to be cancelled the land should after cancellation of the illegal registration revert to the reserve the registration of parcel 155 was fraudulently backdated to october 1997 the reason for that was to hide the fact that the fraud occurred after the 1997 general elections when hon ole ntutu was elected to parliament tourist lodge on 33year lease registered in 1990 in the name of olkiombo ltd has also been grabbed government officers in the narok land registry engineered this fraud and exposed it to enormous liability it may have to pay olkiombo ltd and the council some kshs400 million however legal experts agree that it needs not pay if it takes steps immediately to have the illegal title nullified we attach the following documents to confirm our several assertions forged copy of the chief land registrars letter dated september 16 1997 which police investigation confirmed to be forgery b copy of police statement by the deputy director of land adjudication ms beth nyambura mutugi who states i know the existence of talek adjudication section in narok district within the rift valley province that on 6th may 1997 this section was declared adjudication section today the 21st september 2001 i was shown forwarding letter ref noclrr27volxiii133 dated 16th september 1997 the contents of these documents show the existence of plot no155 within talek adjudication section i would like to state that the documents we forwarded to the chief land registrar did not contain that number at all i have also been shown adjudication record from narok no751041 in respect of plot 155 i would say i do not know the source of that record and was not amongst the records we forwarded to the chief land registrar i have also seen copy of the area list and i have noted that plot no154 is duplicated which is abnormal that the number of plots on the map and the adjudication record must tally i have seen the map and i confirm that it contains plots up to 154 an area list in respect of plot 155 could not be made because our records do not contain that number c copy of statement to police by rakita ole muserian chairman talek adjudication section he says i have been questioned on certain parcel no155 which i deny its existence i did not sign for its adjudication records i have been shown record dated 25697 purporting to have been thumb printed by i would say the thumbprint therein is not mine my name is also written next to the thumbprint in question i do not know the source of the record at all it shows the owner as mr kunini ole ntutu he is not member of my ranch at talek mr ntutu is not member and therefore has colour of right to have parcel 155 he will explain how he got the adjudication documents d copy of the police report in the investigations it shows livingstone kunini ole ntutu had committed these offences i forgery contrary to section 349 of the penal code ii making false document contrary to section 347 d 1 of the penal code iii conspiracy to defraud contrary to section 317 of the penal code iv forcible detainer contrary to section 91 of the penal code copy of letter 224086 dated october 6 2000 the commissioner of lands said to the permanent secretary secretary to the cabinet and head of the public service my investigation on this adjudication programme has shown that it was illegally carried out especially the added area shown on the attached plan the correct area of 472squared km as per legal notice 412 of 28th october 1992 was exceeded creating illegal land parcels including 155 it is important t6o note that parcel no155 is registered illegally in the name of one livingstone kunini ole ntutu f copy of letter dated may 29 2002 from the attorney general office disapproving fraudulent settlement of the suit between the new clerk to council and the fraudster livingstone kunini ole ntutu however before any nullification of title no155 is accomplished government must ask the director of criminal investigation to straight away complete his investigation into the fraud the director said bottlenecks had occurred between his office and the office of the attorney general where the investigation file cidsec216volii177 is held up since december 24 2001 when submitted for advice there had been tremendous efforts by political heavy weights of the previous establishment from ole sunkuli on behalf of hon ole ntutu to children like june moi who after visit to the lodge rapidly developed an almost irresistible appetite for it ole sunkuli had dared ask the attorney general not to be involved in what he perceived to be private dispute the dispute can hardly be private one involving as it were 4000 acres of national reserve it was the owners of the lodge who brought the attorney general to the suit filed by the grabber against the council and the owners of the lodge he will answer for the illegal acts of narok land registry staff and pay compensation on their behalf how that title was evolved is very common feature and rampant practice in the narok land registry mr john kimoi chepkurui has also fraudulently registered unadjudicated council forestland in the names of people who have right to it such registration ought to be nullified as well since it has basis in law we believe mr chepkurui has extensively grabbed the forestland for himself one time narok district commissioner mr joseph kimiwyi hon ole ntutu m p narok south and livingstone kunini ole ntutu the forestland should also be restored to its trust land status the following are their forest parcel numbers joseph kimiwyi i for himself pno narokcis maraenkaroni10436 which measures 45825 acres and pno 9732 and measures 30 acres ii for his pno9847 which measures 110 acres iii for his wife pno10466 which is 195 acres hon ole tutu increased one of his many forest parcels to 3202 acres livingsotne kunini ole ntutu had initially allocated himself narok cis mara enkaroni9470 with an area then of 350 acres and has increased it to 3372 acres unbelievably all that information had at one time or another been brought to the attention of the previous government to halt this destruction nothing happened our collective livelihood in the mara is wholly dependent on the waters of the mara river this is irrespective of whether inside or outside the national reserve we pray that its source being in the destroyed forestland be protected immediately by annulment of all the titles to the forestland finally and in conclusion we request that apart from the further investigations of livingstone kunin ole ntutu for offences committed with regard to council forest land he ought to be prosecuted for the many offences disclosed in the police investigation on the grabbing of the land in the maasai mara national reserve joseph ole kayioni the clerk county council of narok ought also to be investigated and prosecuted for instigating the promotion on behalf of livingstone kunini ole ntutu some fake resolutions by some county council councilors on may 102002 and whose effect was to effectively pass the 4000 acres of the maasai mara national reserve to livingstone kunini ole ntutu the fake resolutions are available and are enclosed the then councilors to be investigated along with ole kayioni are simat liaram solomon moriaso peter nkoitoi daniel rono musere turere matiko sadera joseph ngerechi joseph langat motoron ololosikany saitoti kiok joseph rotich kanyinke nabaalla daniel nakula parbarunye nkoyo felix koech tilal ole sunkuyia korema ole surum and jackson kaloi the narok land registrar john kimoi chepkurui should be investigated for his part in the registration without adjudication of the trust land in the mara and in the forest he should also be prosecuted for taking for himself some of these lands which is theft by servant the hon sk ole ntutu mp should be investigated for being the prime mover in concerted bid to dissipate all trust land in the district for favours from outsiders not otherwise entitled to the land in law the then narok district commissioner mr joseph kimiwyi should be investigated and prosecuted for promoting and presiding over one of the worst case of land grabbing and environment degradation he had arrogated himself the role of distributor of trust land in the district without adjudication and taking it for himself and for his family members one last request that we believe to be the culmination of all the foregoing is that the government in view of the magnitude of the loss of unadjudicated trust land in the district should appoint judicial commission of inquiry to investigate this scandal enc yours faithfully
