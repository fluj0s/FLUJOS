ambassador william b wood for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary on october 13 abdul qayum karzai described to the ambassador the potential saudi reconciliation process he and abdullah anas developed the current initiative year ago and secured taliban engagement through anas connection to mullah abdul salam zaif former taliban ambassador to pakistan he led recent afghan delegation of 17 including former taliban officials to saudi arabia for an informal meeting of mullahs and an iftar dinner with the king qayum expressed concern about the fragility of the process and its vulnerability to being usurped by the government saudi arabia agreed to continue facilitating talks but was firm it would not serve as an intermediary for the taliban they must work directly with afghanistan qayum said the king is concerned about being too closely linked to the taliban and that media speculation regarding the recent saudihosted event made some officials there nervous qayum assured the ambassador the us would be consulted at every step and asked that the us urge the saudis to remain engaged qayum is president karzais brother and an american citizen 2 c for the past two and half years qayum said he had been seeking bottomup process for engagement with reconciliable taliban outside governmental framework although many senior taliban were interested in ending hostilities individual reconciliation was not an option for them politically in october 2007 qayum met with abdullah anas former algerian mujahideen commander now living in london to discuss anas proposal of engaging muslim clerics and scholars to create framework for talks with the taliban qayum suggested saudi arabia or dubai anas agreed and began to consul prominent muslim scholars rallying them around their shared concern that taliban violence gave islam bad name throughout the world seeking saudi involvement 3 c anas and qayum met with dr mansour advisor to king abdullah to ask saudi arabia to host the first engagement in this process gathering group of mullahs mansour reacted positively to saudi arabia serving this role in part because as it would dilute saudi arabias identification with pakistan and extremism according to qayum mansour stated the international community sees us as front qayum noted that the saudis see directly link between afghanistans security and their own stability concerns taliban mullah zaif agrees to participate 4 c in april 2008 qayum hosted dr mansour anas and mullah abdul salam zaif former taliban ambassador to pakistan and informal line to mullah omar at his home in kandahar qayum said that when his guests arrived the television was showing footage of taliban bombing attack on mosque earlier that day the men were visibly upset by the carnage including zaif the shared reaction to the bombing set the tone for constructive talks and zaif agreed to participate qayum shared his view that zaif is trying to carve political space within the taliban for reconciliation qayum prepares the ground and the saudis engage cautiously 5 c as result of qayums and then president karzais meetings with dr mansour king abdullah called karzai directly to discuss the proposed process the kings role energized karzais interest in the process for the first time over the next few months qayum hosted number of taliban representatives in kandahar to continue preparations 6 c through the spring and summer representatives from both saudi arabia and afghanistan shuttled back and forth qayum and former kandahar governor asadullah khalid worked kabul 00002782 002 of 003 closely together traveling to saudi to meet with mansour and prince miqrin head of saudi intelligence mansour made more visits to kabul and anas continued to serve as gobetween with zaif and taliban in august saudi arabia agreed to host an initial contact meeting during ramadan stressing the importance of maintaining low profile while indicating the king abdullahs desire to assist miqrin made it clear the king was approaching the process cautiously and did not want to be linked too closely to the taliban miqrin said saudi arabia didnt want to be alone in this highlighting the importance of keeping the us and uk informed miqrin also stressed the taliban leadership should not see saudi arabias willingness to support the talks as an indication the country would serve as an intermediary the taliban must pursue the reconciliation process directly with afghanistan the september meeting 7 c in organizing the trip qayum mansour and zaif agreed the focus would be on religious activities and peaceful exchanges in keeping with the ramadan season both sides agreed large group would not be advisable so there were 17 in the afghan delegation and only subset would attend all meetings in addition to zaif maulavi ahmad mutawakkil taliban exforeign minister maulvi abdul hadi shinwari former chief justice and current afghan senator arsala rahmani agreed to attend qayum denied reports that hekmatyar sent representative he said hekmatyars nephew was in saudi arabia at the same time but did not participate in the talks 8 c qayum said the saudis orchestrated the encounter carefully when the taliban group arrived qayum went to his room while mansour remained with the group to welcome them mansour like miqrin made opening points to the taliban saudi arabia condemned the killing of innocents in afghanistan and viewed the afghan constitution with the same respect as its own both share common basis in the koran the saudis further clarified they would not support any taliban proposals that infringed on the authority of the central afghan government such as the establishment of autonomous regions 9 c qayum said prince miqrin called him just before dawn to brief him on the dinner and meeting miqrin said large group had come from medina to meet the afghan delegation and there had been an enthusiastic response from the quetta participants qayum said everyone reacted nervously when details of the process first leaked to the media especially the taliban participants and the saudis miqrin suggested an alternative location might be needed for talks perhaps dubai qayum determined to keep process disciplined and out of govt hands 10 c the ambassador praised qayums leadership on this important issue he stressed that such talks require discipline and patience afghanistan must deal from position of strength qayum agreed saying that if the military pressure on the taliban eased the process would fail he confided what he had told dr mansour that the engagement must be kept simple and focused at the beginning with the same facilitators guiding it until it matured it would collapse if too many people or governments became involved qayum repeatedly expressed concern that the government might usurp the process an afghan governmentbased negotiation would lead to everyone at the table demanding slice of the government but the government would be unable to satisfy all of these competing demands and would take the blame for the negotiations failure 11 c the ambassador asked that the us be advised if afghanistan engaged any taliban with ties to qaeda andor global terrorism in the reconciliation process figures like mullah omar and mullah barader the us did not oppose this kabul 00002782 003 of 003 process stressed the ambassador but would not be participant either qayum accepted this and commented that he saw way for mullah omar to survive the process he didnt have the intelligence or popular support to emerge on top he and barader were hated by too many elements within the pashtun spectrum perhaps exile was an option for them in closing qayum assured the ambassador that the us would be kept informed of all developments comment 12 c qayum has president karzais confidence but is neophyte in such process the encounter in saudi arabia was with afghan and taliban proxies rather than decisionmakers it is especially unclear what connection zaif and the other socalled taliban representatives have with the taliban leadership although there are reports that zaif met with two representatives from the quetta shura who had shadowed the delegation to follow developments and report back president karzai is interested in this process at least as much because it represents step forward in support from king abdullah as because it holds some prospect for neutralizing some or all of the taliban that said this encounter could bring saudi arabia closer to afghanistan and could have some benefits with the taliban especially if other pressures on the taliban continue to grow we intend to be supportive but without unrealistic expectations and certainly with direct us involvement wood
