on th threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surfacetoair missiles sams refe rred to as manportable air defense systems manpads pose to commercial airliners most believe that single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat instead menu of options may be considered including installing infrared i r countermeasures on aircraft modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures improving airport and regional security and strengthening ssile nonproliferation efforts equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure system s can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where groundbased security measures are unavailable or infeas ible to implement however this option has relatively high cost between 1 million and 3 million per aircraft and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks however these techniques by themselves ca nnot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect us airliners fl ying to and from foreign airports legislation introduced in the 108th congress called for the

surfacetoair missiles sams also known as manpads manportable air defense systems deve loped in the late 1950s to provide military ground forces protection from enemy aircraft are receiving great deal of attention as potential terrorist weapons that might be used against commercial airliners these missiles affordable and widely available th rough variety of sources have been used successfully over the past three decades both in military conflicts1 as well as by terrorist organizations the missiles are bout 5 to 6 feet in length weigh about 35 to 40 pounds and depending on the model can be purchased on the black market anywhere from few hundred dollars for olde r models to upwards of almost quarter million dollars for newer more capable m odels seventeen countries including the united states produce manportable air defense systems2 shoulderfired sams generally have target det ection range of about 6 miles and an engagement range of about 4 miles so aircraft flying at 20000 feet 38 miles or higher are relatively safe3 most experts consider aircraft departures and landings as the times when it is most vulnerable to shoulderfired sam engagement there are number of different types

early versions of the soviet sa7 and the chinese hn5 are considered tail chase weapons as their s eekers can only acquire and engage high performance aircraft after it has passed th missiles firing position in this flight profile the aircrafts engines are fully exposed to th missiles seeker and provide sufficient thermal signature for engagement first generation ir missiles are also highly susceptible to interfering thermal signat ures from background sources including the sun which many experts feel make s them somewhat unreliable second generation ir missiles such as early versions of the us stinger the soviet sa14 and the chinese fn6 use imp roved coolants to cool the seeker head which enables the seeker to filter out most interfering background ir sources as well as permitting headon and side engagement profiles these missiles also employ technologies to counter decoy flares that mig ht be deployed by ta rgeted aircraft and also have backup target det ection modes such as the ultra violet uv mode found on the stinger missile5 third generation ir shoulderfired sams such as the french mistral the russian sa18 and the us stinger b us single or multiple detectors to

such missile is that it is not as susceptible to standa rd aircraft mounted countermeasure systems which are designed primarily to defeat ir missiles the major drawback of clos missiles is that they

suited for terrorist use as are ir missiles which sometimes are referred to as fire and forget missiles later versions of clos missiles such as the british javelin use solid state television camera in lieu of the optical tracker to make the gunners task easier the javelins manufacturer thales air defence lt d claims that their missile is virtually impervious to countermeasures9 even more advanced clos versions such as the british starburst use laser data link in lieu of earlier radio guidance links to fly the missile to the target laser beam riders laser beam riding shoulderfired sams use lasers to guide the missiles to the target the missile literally flies along the laser beam and strikes the aircraft where the missile operator or gunner aims the laser these beam riding missiles are resistant to current countermeasure syst ems on military and civilia n aircraft missiles such as swedens rbs70 and britains st arstreak can engage aircraft from all angles and only require the operator to tinuously track the target using joystick to keep the laser aim point on the target because there are data links from the ground to the missile the missile can not be effectively jammed after it is launched future beam riding sams may require the operator to designate the target only once and not manually keep continuous laser aimpoint on the aircraft even though beam riders require relatively extensive training and skill to operate many experts consider these missiles particularly menacing in the hands of terrorists due to the missiles resistance to most conventi onal

comm onplace that they longer garner the attention that they once did civilian aviation encounters with shoulderfired missiles estimates vary but the most widely reported statistics on civilian aircraft experience with shoulderfired missiles i ndicate that over the past 26 years 35 aircraft have come under attack from these weapons32 of those 35 24 were shot down resulting in more than 500 deaths33 while these statistics have been frequently cited at least one report has suggested that these figures may significantly overstate the actual numbers of civilian use aircraft that have been attacked by shoulderfired missiles34 that report instead concluded that only about dozen civilregistered airplanes have been shot down during this time period and further notes that some of these aircraft were operating as military transports when they were shot down on the contrary available st atistics may underes timate the total num ber of civilian encounters with shoulderfired missiles it is possible that some aircraft shootings may have been attributed to other causes for various reasons and are not included in these statistics also it is possible that some failed attempts to shoot down civilian airliners have either gone undetected or unreported for many incidents considered to be shoulderfired missile attack against civilian aircraft there is scant information to make conclusive determination if that was in fact the case in some instances while it is widely recognized that the incident was shooting there is conc lusive determination regarding the weapon used for

based on our review of available repor ts and databases on the subject the statistic of 24 catastrophic losses out of 36 aircraft appears to be reasonable estimate but not definitive count of the total worldw ide civil aviation shootings with shoulderfired missiles or similar wea pons however since most of these incidents took place in conflict zones th ey are not typically considered to be politically motivated because the targeted ai rcraft may have been perceived as being used for military purposes35 while most of these hist orical examples do not provide any particular insight into the political motivation behind s hootings of civilian aircraft in the current context of the global war on terrorism they do provide some indication of the possible outcomes of such an attack based on the commonly cited statistic of 24 aircraft dest royed out of 36 attacks over the past 26 years the odds of surviving an attack are not particularly encouraging using these numbers the odds of surviving an attack may be estimate d to be only about 33 however it is important to note that these incidents in clude wide variety of aircraft types including small pistonengine propeller ai rplanes

reduce an aircrafts ir reflectivity and visual profile ir camouflage paint would not reduce an engines heat signature but it might make it more difficult for terrorists to visually see the aircraft and thus could avert sam launch the navy is studying ir camouflage paint on the v22 osprey 53 the cost and maintainability of this paint is still being studied but the paint might actually be lighter

worth examining however it should be recognized that these measures cannot make aircraft completely invisible in the ir spectrum an airplanes ir signature will always be much stronger than that of the

technical digest june 1998 available at continuedto shoulderfired missiles55 it is expected that developing hardened aircraft structures will be challenging problem given that ir guidance systems seek hot engine exhaust and will likely detonate at or near an aircraft engine since most jet airliners have wingm ounted engines hardening of surrounding aircraft structure will likely be infeasible particularly with regard to modifying existing aircraft however some aircraft survivability experts believe that isolating critical systems like redundant hydraulic lines and flight control linkages and improving fire suppression and containm ent capabilities could prevent catastrophic failures cascading from the initial missile strike56 while such options can be integrated into new aircraft type designs they are unlikely to have any near term impact on reducing the threat since retrofitting existing air carrier jets with damage tolerant structures and systems is likely to either be technically infeasible or not economically practical moreover aircraft hardening options will likely require extensive research and testing before their feasibility and effectiveness can be adequately assessed initial indications suggest that aircraft hardening and structural redesign if feasible will likely be very costly and could take many years to implement improved pilot training and air traffic procedures airline pilots already receive substantial simulator training on handling loss of power to one engine during critical phases of flight such as takeoffs and landings this training should already prepare flig ht crews to handle loss of engine power resulting from missile strike therefore additional training for handling missile attacks may be of limited bene fit on the other hand specific simulator exercises using missile attack scenarios may be beneficial by preparing pilots to fly and land damaged aircraft modern airliners are built with redundancy in avionics and flight control systems and consequently missile strike that does not cause catastrophic structural failure would likely be survivable if the flight crew is properly trained to handle such scenario another potential mitigation technique is training flight crews in evasive maneuvers if fired upon by shoulderfired sa m however this approach would not likely be effective and presents significan t risks without missile detection and warning system it is unlikely that flig ht crew would have any indication of missile launch also large transport category airplanes are generally not maneuverable enough to evade shoulderfire d sam there is also concern that defensive maneuvering of rge transport category airplanes could result in loss of control or structural failure57 consequently most obser vers concur that evasivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31741crs15 57 continued httpwwwairbuscomcustomerfastspecialasp also published in boeing aero 3 58 marvin b shaffer op cit 59 robert wall david fulghum op citmaneuvering is not viable option for mitigating the risk of missile attacks however properly trained crew s may be able to use other special procedures to evade missile attacks examples of procedures that may be considered to reduce the airplanes heat signature and vulnerability to missile strikes include minimizing the use of auxiliary power units and other heat sources when operationally feasible minimizing engine power settin gs and if missile launc h is detected reducing engine power settings to minimum levels required to sustain flight at safe altitude the effectiveness and safety risks associated with techniques such as these will need to be carefully assesse d before procedural m easures are implemented another mitigation technique may be to alter air traffic procedures to minimize the amount of time airliners are vulnerabl to missile launches and make flight patterns less predictable current arrival procedures rely on gradual descents along well defined and publicly known approach courses that pl ace airplanes within range of shoulderfired sams as far away as 50 miles from the airport58 similarly departing aircraft with heavy fuel loads operating at high engine power often along predefined departure routes may be particularly vulnera ble and can be targeted up to 30 miles away from the airport before they climb above the effective range of shoulderfired sams59 military aircraft often use spiral des cents from altitude above the airfield when operating in hostile areas using spiral descents may be an option for mitigating the threat of terrorist sam attacks to airlin ers approaching domestic airports doing so can limit approach and descent patterns to smaller perimeter around the airfield where security patrols can more effectivel deter terrorist attacks while spiral approaches may be implemented on limited basis wide scale use of spiral patterns would likely require extensive restructuring of airspace and air traffic procedures this technique may present safety concerns by greatly increasing air traffic controller workload and requiring pilots to make potentially difficult turning maneuvers at low altitude the use of spiral patterns could also reduce passenger comfort and confidence in flight safety also this technique would not mitigate the risk to departing aircraft which are generally considered to be the most vulnerable to missile attacks another technique used by military aircraft particularly fighter jets to reduce vulnerability on departure is to make steep rapid climb out s above the effective range of surface to air missiles over short distance like spiral descents such technique has limited application for civilian jet airliners typical climb gradient for these aircraft is between 400 and 500 feet per mile which means th at they remain in range of shoulderfired missiles for about 40 to 50 miles after departure even if the airplane were to double its climb rate which would probably be close to the maximum practically achievable climb rate for most jet airliners the distance traveled before safely c limbing above the range of s houlderfired missiles would stillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31741crs16 60 marvin b schaffer op citbe 20 miles or more climbing out at such steep rate would also pose risk to the aircraft since it may not provide an adequate margin of safety if an engine were to fail during climb out also steep climb angles are likely to be perceived as objectionable by passengers another option that may be considered is to vary approach and departure patterns regularly varying approach and departure patterns in nonpredicable ways may make it more difficult for terrorist s to set up shoulderfired sam under known flight corridor and may increase the probability that they will be detected while trying to locate usable launch site by ground surveillance local law enforcement or civilians reporting suspicious activities one challenge to implementing this technique is that avia tion radio frequencies ar not protected and terrorists might gather intelligence regarding changing flight patterns also flight tracking data are available in near real time from internet sources and may be exploited by terrorists to gain informati on about aircraft positi on nonetheless this approach could be deterrent by making overflights of partic ular locations less predictable limitations to this approach include disruption of normal air traffic flow which may result in delays increased air traffic controller workload and possible interference with noise mitigation procedures varying air traffic patterns may be viable mitigation technique particularly at airports with low to moderate traffic and for approach and departure patterns that overfly sparsely populated areas also maximizing the use of over water approach and departure procedures when available coupled with measures to limit or restrict access to and increase patrols of waters under these flight paths has also been suggested as mitigation alternative60 other suggested changes to air traffic procedures include the increased use of nighttime flights and minimal use of aircraft lighting however this approach is likely to be opposed by the airlines and passengers since there is little demand for night flights in many domestic markets furthermore minimizing the use of aircraft lighting raises safety concerns for aircraft collision avoidance while the airspace system includes good radar coverage in the vicinity of airports and airliners are required to have collision avoidance systems the last line of protection against midair collisions is the flight crews ability to see and avoid other aircraft therefore increased use of night flights and minimizing aircraft lighting is not thought to be particularly viable mitigation option improvements to airport and local security one of the most expedient measures that can be taken to mitigate the risk from shoulderfired sams to airliners is to height security surveillance and patrols in the vicinity of airports served by air carriers the difficulty with implementing these security measures is that the approach and departure corridors where aircraft operate within range of shoulderfired sams ex tend for several miles beyond airport perimeters therefore while heightening security in the immediate vicinity of an airport may reduce the threat from s houlderfired sams these measures cannot effectively mitigate the threat during the tire portion of flight while airliners are vulnerable to attack

the airport perimeter th at have high threat poten tial and where aircraft are most vulnerable to attack using this in formation security can concentrate patrols and surveillance in these high risk areas airport security managers will likely need to work closely with local law enforcement to coordinate efforts for patrolling these high risk areas terrorist acts are preceded by planning activities much of which is observable because law enforcement fficers cant be everywhere public education and neighborhood watch programs in high risk areas may also be effective means to mitigate the threat the air force has instituted neighborhood watch type program that might serve model for broader application civilians and servicemembers are trained in the eagle eye program to recognize elements of potential terrorist activity and how to mo st effectively report their observations61 aerial patrols using sens or technol ogy such as forward looking infrared flir may also be an effective tool fo r detecting terrorists lurking underneath flight paths however use of aerial patrols may significantly impact normal flight schedules and operations particularly at the na tions larger airports detecting and eliminating terrorist threat before an attack is initiated is the optimal solution if terrorists are not detect ed prior to launch rapid detection and accurate identification of missile attack would be critical step in an effective defense in 2004 dod evaluated groundbased warning systems composed of networked arrays of different kinds of nsors eg electrooptical radar such groundbased sensor grids c ould potentially warn and cue aircraftbased or ground based missile countermeasures groundbased missile counter measures could potentially take many forms randomly dispensing flares in the vicinity of airports has been suggested noting that the israeli airline occasionally used this technique during periods of heightened tension in the 1980s however groundbased flares pose risk of fires on the ground and therefore would not be suitable at many airports in the united states particularly those surrounded by populated or wooded areas furthermore dispensing flares may be annoying to some and may also dimin ish public confidence in the safety and security of air travel ground based interc eptors are another option that has been suggested these interceptors could be vehiclemounted sams like the marine corps humraam system or directed energy weapons like the armys tactical highenergy laser thel the thel has successfully

presidents budget request includes 488 million for the counter manpads spo to continue oversight and evaluation of the phase iii contracts expected to be awarded in fy2006 and carried out in the fy2006fy2007 time frame the fy2007 presidents budget does not seek any additional funding for new dhs countermanpads initiatives bey ond or in addition to the phase iii contracts conclusion single solution can immediately nd completely mitigate the shoulderfired sam threat as congress considers possible legislative and oversight approaches it is likely that it may consider implementing various combinations of available mitigation alternatives in whole or in pa rt in addition congress may consider phasing in mitigation options to best respond to available threat assessments or otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31741crs26 criteria for example if th reat assessments indicate that large widebody airplanes are most at risk congress may consider whether initially equipping these airplanes would more effectively deter the threat of missile attacks congress may also consider whether it would be more effec tive to initially equip aircraft used on overseas flights particularly those operating in countries or regions where the risk of missile attacks is greatest congress ma also debate whether equipping only portion of the air carrier fleet would be sufficient dete rrent whether allcargo jets should be equipped whether passenger carrying regional jets should be equipped or whether equipping the entire air carrier fleet is needed to adequately mitigate the threat equipping aircraft with missile c ountermeasure systems has advantages countermeasures are fixed to the aircraft require little or flight crew intervention and can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where groundbased security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement down sides include high cost and potentially underminin g passenger confidence in th safety and security of air travel also because implementa tion will take time countermeasures ca nnot immediately mitigate todays terrorist threat procedural improvements such as flight crew training changes to air traffic management and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more imme diately help deter domestic terrorist attacks however these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect us airliners flying to and from foreign airports congress and the administration have initiated preliminary actions intended to provide degree of protection to commercial airliners legislation introduced in the 108th congress hr 580s 311 called for th installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in sc heduled air carrier service the department of homeland security dhs appropriations for 2004 pl10890 designated 60 million for development and testing of prot otype missile countermeasure system for commercial aircraft and dhs initially envisioned two year program totaling about 100 milli on to develop test and certify suitable system congress provided an additional 61 million to continue the program in fy2005 pl108280 and for fy2006 designated 110 million to conduct more extensive third phase of the project that is anticipated to be carried out over the next two years these actions may constitute starting point for the consideration of additional protective measures designed to address all aspects of the shoulderfired sam threat
