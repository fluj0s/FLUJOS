meeting with ambassador socialist party ps presidential hopeful current media darling and president of the poitoucharentes region segolene royal left doubt as to her determination to win election as president of france in 2007 she matteroffactly assessed her high poll numbers expressing the conviction that her focus on family school and social services issues along with her popularity among ordinary people make her potent political force current polls show that royal could make formidable candidate in frances presidential election now 14 months away these polls show she is one of only two or three contenders that over half of voters now say they could be willing to vote for as president conceding that polls are not elections ref d but adding that they stop being in error about six months before the elections royal expressed optimism that her popularity would hold until then and for six months thereafter notwithstanding the predictions of pundits to the contrary royal went to considerable lengths to express her openness and friendliness towards the us and mentioned the possibility of visiting washington during an upcoming trip to new york to speak at columbia university end summary disarmingly direct presidential hopeful 2 c in her discussion with ambassador stapleton and embassy officers on february 8 segolene royal lived up to her image as an uncommonly charismatic subtle and determined politician she very matteroffactly reviewed her sustained high poll numbers ref c and made bones about her intention to pursue the presidency so long as other people think its possible for unaffectedly applying to herself the term willful often used about her by detractors royal said she was determined to stay in the presidential race until eliminated or victorious comment according to recent biography of royal she wanted to test the waters by running in 2002 and rues having allowed herself to be discouraged from doing so by fellow ps heavyweights in this biographers account she is determined to stay in there to the end this time around end comment im the one to beat for the ps nomination 3 c royal betrayed qualms about her ability to shape to her benefit the process that is leading to the pss selection of candidate for 2007 by primary vote among party members next november in contrast to her public remarks about securing the ps nomination where she often quotes former president mitterrand in saying that in politics you have to give time to time royal was much more direct with the ambassador shrugging off the chances of her more senior rivals in the ps by pointing out that im the one to beat note among ps party members who will be the only voters in next novembers party primary royals current popularity ratings nearly double those of her nearest rival former prime minister lionel jospin the popularity of royal as potential presidential standard bearer has risen steadily among party members since last summer ref f among the public at large she also far outpaces jospin and other ps heavyweights in current polls as the most preferred ps presidential candidate end note 4 c royal said that the attraction of winning with her as the standardbearer most clearly able to deliver victory was powerful galvanizer of opinion among party members she judged that her relatively junior standing as party leader and alleged lack of qualifications need not stand in the way of her garnering enough support to win from among the partys 130000 cardcarrying members briefly reviewing her electoral and governmental record she believed her experience was more than adequate to overcome any qualms party members and thereafter voters might have about it note and comment royal has been elected to the national assembly four times has served junior minister for the environment junior minister for elementary education and junior minister for families children and the handicapped most recently in 2004 she won the presidency of the poitoucharentes region beating the handpicked candidate of then prime minister raffarin royals is distinguished record of achievement and experience what issue there may be over her qualifications within the ps has to be seen in light of for example former prime minister laurent fabius experience as prime minister president of the national assembly head of the ps party group in the national assembly minister of economy and finance and regular reelection to parliament since 1978 since the february 8 meeting it has become obvious that former prime minister jospin in many ways the partys most senior figure is actively seeking the nomination ref end note and comment goldplated image plus familiesschoolsneighborhoods 5 c royal outlined carefully crafted strategy designed to cast her as the candidate of safe change ie the candidate who answers best french voters simultaneous eagerness for change and fear of it royal said that she believed people want new kind of political discourse this conviction she continued was prompting her to skip the political talk shows and deliberately focus instead on the family school and environmental issues that are her strength and are what matter most to ordinary people she argued that her focus on soft social services issues coupled with her very positive public image her sterling centerleft credentials and proven effectiveness as grassroots politician make her potent political force royal said that the core of her candidacy is having the courage to have confidence in the voters not lot of policy specificity 6 c royal spoke in very general indeed rather vague terms about what she stands for as presidential candidate comment given her popularity it is probably not in her interest to furnish policy prescriptions at this time lest she alienate potential supporters end comment she described crisis of confidence among ordinary french people who she said are prey to feeling of decline she evoked how prospects for those in the middle class are shrinking for their children even more so she pointed to narrowing the quality gap between frances elite schools and its regular schools and universities as key to reinvigorating upward mobility in french society she also criticized the villepin governments emphasis on employment as the engine of upward mobility lamenting the destabilizing effects for family life of the increased job insecurity implicit in many of the governments employment initiatives royal said that she would like to lead national project that would succeed by renewing hope in the people implicitly addressing criticism directed against the absence of program royal noted that the successful record of the jospin government didnt prevent him from losing in his bid for the presidency in 2002 concluding that you dont win elections on your record or your program but rather on the expectations generated by candidacy openness to the us 7 c though she did not dwell on foreign policy issues royal did make an effort to convey openness towards the us echoing the remarks of other political interlocutors across the board she duly noted her opposition to the us invasion of iraq but went to considerable length in assuring the ambassador that socialist government would never have actively campaigned against the us in africa for example and would have handled differences in more understanding and less confrontational manner than president chirac and thenfm villepin royal recalled with evident fondness her work organizing the 1981 versailles summit between presidents reagan and mitterrand this was her first experience with presidentiallevel diplomacy and apparently involved liaising with the us secret service royal expressed her surprise at the time discovering the massive logistical underpinnings required by such events royal also made clear through reference to watching desperate housewives that she did not reject american popular culture royal did not augment her friendly sentiments toward the us with any vision for usfrance relations she did suggest need to find frances place in the world with the gof showing less arrogance in how it speaks to the world the latter factor she suggested had played role in the defeat of frances 2012 olympics candidacy 8 u royal said she would be visiting the us soon probably in the context of accepting an invitation to speak at columbia university in new york this spring she mentioned the possibility of also visiting washington at that time the ambassador said he would be pleased to work with her and her staff to design an appropriate program comment 9 royal clearly believes her determination concern for ordinary people and uncommon mix of strengths as candidate make her real contender notwithstanding the predictions of pundits and her political rivals that the segolene phenomenon will not last opponents whether from centerright with the exception of interior minister sarkozy or her own centerleft either insist on her unfitness for the job ref d or suggest she is stalking horse for draft of former pm jospin although it is not unfair to be skeptical about royals staying power or even her qualifications it is also true that much of the disparagement of her stems from envy of the popularity of female upstart who is also challenging the unwritten rules of the political establishment it is also undeniable that royal has managed to tap into the feelings of an electorate looking for change 10 royal appeared to be well disposed towards the us that said as is the case for many on the left of the french political spectrum it would be mistake to translate high comfort level with american culture into approval for wide range of us polices foreign and domestic royal has only made brief trips to the us as tourist end comment please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
