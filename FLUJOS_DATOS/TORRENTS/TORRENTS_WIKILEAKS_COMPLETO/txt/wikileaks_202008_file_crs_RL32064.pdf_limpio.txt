development act wrda process civil works appropriations and emergency response activities authorization of water resources activities congress generally authorizes corps studies as part of wrda or in survey resolution passed by an authorizing committee wrdas also include authorizations to construct projects and changes to policies guiding the corps civil works program such as the split of project costs between the federal government and the nonfederal project sponsors beginning in 1986 biennial wrda cycle was loosely followed for number of years pressure to authorize new projects increase authorized funding levels and modify existing projects is often intense thus promoting fairly regular biennial consideration of wrda controversial projects and policy changes contributed to sevenyear gap in enactment between wrda 2000 in december 2000 and wrda 2007 in november 2007 pl 110114 annual agency appropriations federal funding is provided for the civil works activities of the corps primarily through the annual energy and water development appropriations act these appropriations acts also may include authorizations of corps activities authorization provisions in appropriations provisions however may be subject to points of order on the senate or house floor due in part to competition for limited funding many authorized activities do not receive appropriations resulting in backlog of authorized construction and maintenance activities few new studies and new construction activities have been included in the presidents budget request in recent years natural disaster and emergency response activities and appropriations in addition to its role in water resources development the civil works responsibilities of the corps include emergency and natural disaster response some of this work is conducted through mission assignments directed by federal emergency management agency fema and other work is conducted independently through the corps natural disaster response

corps plans builds operates and maintains wide range of water resources facilities1 the corps attracts much congressional attention because its projects can provide significant economic stimulation locally and regionally in addition to their basic resource development purposes congress plays significant role in the direction of the agency particularly through the authorization and appropriations of studies and projects in addition to its role in water resources development the civil works responsibilities of the corps include emergency and natural disaster response such as flood fighting operations structural repairs to levees and water supply assistance within the corps projects are largely planned at the district level and approved at the division and headquarters levels 2 the civil works program is headed by civilian assistant secretary of the army for civil works military chief of engineers oversees the corps civil and military operations and reports on civil works matters to the assistant secretary for civil works the agencys traditional civil responsibilities are creating and maintaining navigable channels and controlling floods during the last decade congress has increased corps responsibilities in the areas of ecosystem restoration environmental protection environmental infrastructure eg municipal water and wastewater treatment systems disaster relief and other nontraditional activities

often begins with request for assistance from community eg citizens or businesses or local or state government entity with water resource need eg navigation flood or storm protection or ecosystem rest oration beyond its capability congressional sponsorship is generally necessary to successfully initiate study the corps generally requires two types of congressional authority to initiate studystudy authorization then appropriations study authority allows the corps to investigate problem and determine if there is federal interest if the corps has performed study in the geographic area before new study can be authorized by resolution known commonly as survey resolution of either the house transportation and infrastructure committee or the senate environment and public works committee 3 if the corps has not previously investigated the study needs to be authorized in an 1 for more information on the corps its civil works program and the types of projects that it undertakes see crs report rs20866 the civil works program of the army corps of engineers primer by nicole t carter and betsy cody 2 the corps has 9 civil works divisions and 41 districts division and district map is available at httpwwwusacearmymilhowdoicivilmaphtm 3 to request studys inclusion in re solution member of congress may send letter to the chairman of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure or

the purpose of the study is to inform decisionmakers on whether to authorize corps project for construction early in the study process the corps assesses the level of interest and support of nonfederal entities that may be potential sponsors nonfederal sponsors are state tribal county or local agencies or governments the authorizations of corps studies generally are not timelimited however there is process to begin deauthorization of studies without funding for five years

resources needs but also contributing to each phase of the develo pment process since wrda 1986 pl 99662 nonfederal sponsors are responsible for significant portion of the financing of studies construction and operation and maintenance om of most projects moreover nonfederal support is useful in shepherding project through the many stages from study initiation to final project construction there are three phases that project passes through before construction begins reconnaissance study feasibility study and preconstructi on engineering and design as shown in table 1 5 all three are conducted under single congressional study authorization the length of each phase varies project by project with the size and the complexity of project typically resulting in longer process

governments interest the reconnaissance study also examines the interest of nonfederal sponsors who are involved in all phases of project development corps policy is to complete most reconnaissance studies within 12 months the cost of reconnaissance studies and their related project study plans generally are limited to 100000 at full federal expense around third of the reconnaissance studies eventually lead to feasibility studies only 16 of every 100 reconnaissance studies lead to constructed projects 6 continued 1913 33 usc 542 for the examination and review of an earlier corps report to be eligible for authorization in resolution the new study must stay within the scope of the authorization of the original report 4 these acts are commonly distinguished from each other by including reference to the year of enactment for example wrda 1986 refers to the act passed in 1986 the most recent wrda was enacted in november 2007 pl 110114 for more information on wrda 2007 see crs report

nonfederal sponsorship is secured and the corps recommends proceeding feasibility study begins its objective is to formulate and recommend solutions to the water resources problem during the first few months of feasibility analysis the local corps district formulates alternative plans investigates engineering feasibility conducts benefitcost analyses and assesses environmental impacts under the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 4321 7 the evaluation of federal water resources projects including corps activities is governed by the 1983 principles and guidelines for water and related resources implementation studies written by the water resources council8 an important outcome of the feasibility analysis is the determination of whether the project warrants further federal investment ie if the project has sufficient national economic development benefits the cost of the feasibility and environmental studies is split equally between the corps and the nonfederal project sponsor the feasibility phase ends when the chief of engineers signs final recommendation on the project known as the chiefs report in recent years the congress has used favorable chiefs report as the basis for authorizing projects the corps sends an informational copy of the chiefs report to congress when it transmits the report to the assistant secretary and the office of management and budget omb since the mid1990s congress has authorized significant number of projects based on these informational copies prior to the projects receiving full review by the assistant secretary and omb some recent wrdas have also included authorizations for projects that were still undergoing feasibility analyses these projects generally were authorized contingent on chiefs report being available by december 31 of the year the wrda was enacted continued and infrastructure on march 15 2001 the hearing is hereaf ter referred to as reform of feasibility studies hearing march 15 2001 the testimony is available at httpwwwsenategovepwstm1_107htm031501 7generally the district produces an environmental impact statement eis during the feasibility phase preparation includes public meetings

two years on average and is conducted while pursuing congressional authorization for the project and construction funding the preconstruction costs are distributed between the federal and nonfederal sponsor in the same proportion as the costshare arrangement for the construction phase once the project receives congressional authorization federal funds for construction are sought annually in the energy and water development appropriations act the federal costshare for construction varies by project purpose nonfederal parties are responsible for all operation and maintenance expenses absent few exceptions mainly for harbors and inland waterways

after authorization if project features or the estimated project cost changes significantly an additional congressional authorization may be necessary authorization of significant modifi cation is typically sought in wrda for less significant modifications however additional aut horization is often not necessary section 902 of wrda 1986 allows for increases in total project costs of up to 20 due to modifications that do not materially change the projects scope or function without requiring additional authorization the authorization of corps construction projects generally are not timelimited however there is process to begin deauthorization of projects without funding for five years

availability of funds that is congress does not need to specifically authorize either the study or the construction of the project for the corps to initiate cap project the caps include beach erosion navigation flood control streambank and shoreline protection snagging and clearing modifications to existing projects for the benefit of the environment and aquatic ecosystem restoration in recent years congress has reduced some of the corps discretion in managing the caps by directing funds to particular cap projects

to authorizing corps activities and establishing policies for corps civil works activities such as costshare requirements authorizations in wrda usually fall under four general categories studies projects modifications to existing authorizations and programmatic authorizations although congress has historically authorized corps projects in wrda authorizations also have appeared in appropriations bills especially in years when wrda passage has been delayed authorizations in appropriations bills however generally are discouraged as standard procedure and may be subject to point

enactment has been less consistent controversial projects and policy changes contributed to wrda bills in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses not being enacted the 110th congress enacted wrda 2007 in

members of congress may send letter to the appropriate committee chair requesting the inclusion of study authorization project authorization or project modification10 if the wrda has been introduced in february or early march according to traditional wrda cycle committee staff generally recommend that letters be sent by late spring however formal deadline exists the bill reported by the committee generally passes that chamber with few changes although the appropriations process determines which studies and projects receive federal funds the essential character of project is established during the authorization process and is seldom modified substantially during appropriations g25g20g6g3g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g343g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g501g561 in 2008 the house committee requested submission of requests for items to be included in wrda 2008 and its subcommittee on water resources and environment held hearing on wrda 2008 on april 30 2008 at the hearing the bush administration expressed its concerns about the growing backlog of already authorized corps projects and pointed out how wrda 2008 could either exacerbate the backlog by adding to it or be used to establish priorities for managing the backlog and requests for new authorizations this position contrasts with the perspective of many in congress that wrda 2007 was used primarily to address the pentup demand for project authorizations that had accumulated since the last wrda in 2000 and that another wrda is needed to reestablish the biennial authorization of corps projects to address the nations water resources needs the debate over the necessity of wrda and what types of activities ought to be authorized in the next bill is likely to continue especially as alternative avenues for economic stimulus are considered 9 wrda 1986 marked the end of d ecade or more of stalemate between the congress and the executive branch regarding authorizations in addition to authorizing numerous projects wrda 1986 resolved longstanding disputes related to costsharing user fees and environmental requirements prior to 1986 disputes over these and other matters had largely prevented enactment of major civil works legislation since 1970 biennial authorizations were resumed after wrda 1986 to avoid long delays between the planning and execution of projects and for c ongress to review proposed projects on regular basis 10 if the administration chooses to make wrda proposal congress generally receives the proposal during february of the second year of congress at the same time as the presidents budget httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32064g3g155g150g162g561g5g152g155g153g156g561g152g143g561g7g151g144g146g151g142g142g155g156g561g25g138g157

and survey resolutions typically authorizes dozens or hundreds of new projects however many new studies and new construction projects do not receive appropriations fiscal priorities and public attitudes in recent decades have resulted in declining federal funding for water resources activities thus increasing competition for funding among authorized activities moreover during the 1990s and in 2000 congress authorized not only navigation and flood control projects but also ecosystem restoration environmental infrastructure assistance and other nontraditional activities with enactment of wrda 2007 the corps now has an estimated backlog of roughly 1000 authorized activities to concentrate limited resources and to move projects through construction the bush administration focused its budget request on fundin g priority projects and those projects near completion for flood and storm damage reduction navigation and environmental restoration it also substantially reduced appropriation requests for studies and eliminated the start of most new studies and construction projects civil works funding often is contentious betwee n the administration and congress with final appropriations typically providing more than requested regardless of which political party controls the white house and congress given the project backlog and the limited federal budget resources decisionmakers are sometimes forced to make difficult choices among competing authorized activities as they prepare annual appropriations members of congress may request that appropriations for corps activity be included or altered in an energy and water development appropriations bill by sending letter to the subcommittee chairman or the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development in recent years recommended deadlines for these requests have been in march or april once appropriations have been allocated for corps activity funding requests for subsequent years are typically accorded priority until the study or construction is complete however fiscal constraints and bush administration priorities resulted in deviations from this pattern
