1935 was repealed in the energy policy act of 2005 prior to repeal the public utility holding company act of 1935 required holding companies ie companies with subsidiaries engaged in the electric utility business or the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas to register with the us s ecurities and exchange commission satisfy certain disclosure requirements and comply with strict operational limitations these operational limitations imposed significant geographic and corporate holdings restrictions upon holding companies and eff ectively limited ownership of public utilities to small subset of companies focused specifically on the industry pursuant to the repeal the securities and exchange commission longer has oversight authority for electric and gas holding companies and many of the procedural and substantive require ments placed upon public utility holding companies by the public utility holding company act of 1935 have been repealed the burden of oversight of the financial transactions of public utility companies including mergers and acquisitions now fa lls more heavily on the federal energy regulatory commission ferc fercs oversight authority over public utilities previously established in the federal power act and the natural gas act was enhanced by the energy policy act of 2005 which included the public utility holding company act of 2005 this new gislation requires holding companies and their affiliates to provide the commission s well as state regulators access to their books and records and also grants the co mmission additional authority for oversight of holding company transactions in addition the us securities and exchange commissi on the us department of justice and the federal trade commission will continue to enforce generally applicable laws as they apply to public utility holding company transactions these laws which were unaffected by the ener gy policy act of 2005 prevent transactions that would substantially impede

on electric and gas utilities introduction congress has imposed ownership and operational limitations on the utility industry since early in the 20th century different statut have targeted different industry practices all with the general goal of ensuring dependable utility services for the public at reasonable rates the most recent legislative effort to further these goals is the energy policy act of 2005 one of the most significant provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 is the repeal of the public utility hold ing company act of 1935 puhca 19351 puhca 1935 imposed number of substantive restri ctions and procedur requirements upon companies that owned greater than 10 of the voting securities or otherwise exercised controlling intere st over electric andor gas public utilities the statute was administered by the us securities and exchange commission sec puhca 1935 had long been subject of controversy supporters of puhca 1935 had claimed that the strict limitati ons on public utility holding companies protected the financial health of utility providers and therefore the dependability of service and the consistency of rates supporters also argued that the limitations provided barrier against market dominati on and manipulation by large corporations proponents of repeal argued that ownershi p restrictions and c filing requirements were unduly burdensome and eff ectively barred investment in the utility industry for many new investors who c ould bring new ideas and vitality to the industry puhca 1935s reach had been receding for many years prior to its repeal in 1978 the public utility regulatory policie s act purpa created exemptions from puhca 1935 requirements for owners of certain types of cogeneration and renewable energy power plants

strict corporate ownership and manageme nt rules as the sec was required to do under puhca 1935 puhca 2005 confirms fercs preexisting authority to regulate transactions under the fpa and the nga and grants the commission few new tools to do so as the previous paragraphs descri be although the repeal of puhca 1935 removes extensive restrictions on transactions involving public utilities and their holding companies previously enforced by the sec it does not affect the regulation of these entities by ferc transactions are also subject to the general regulation of other federal agencies although the sec is longer tasked with enforcing the restrictions of puhca 1935 holding companies and their investors still must comply with the secs general reporting requirements and securities regulations also two antitrust laws the clayton act and the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act are relevant in th context of prospective mergers and acquisitions that are now permissible in the absence of puhca 1935 the united states justice department doj and the federal trade commission ftc are charged with enforcing these laws45 the clayton act and the hartscottrodino act apply to any utility mergers or acquisitions accordingly in addition to the ferc review of these transactions as set forth in the revised section 203 of the fpa mergers in the energy industry are also reviewed from the perspective of their compliance with the requirements of antitrust and marketbased concerns by doj and ftc section 7 of the clayton act prohibits mergers or acquisitions which tend to create monopoly46 the pre merger notification provisions of the rtscottrodino act require that certain mergers and acquisitions those meeting appli cable size and other criteria be notified to both the

jurisdic tion over electric utility merger transactions and each utilizes the dojftc horizontal merger guidelines48 theoretically at least all are proceeding from the same assumptions and will reach the same conclusion with respect to particular trans actions however th differing statutory and regulatory prisms through which these guidelines are necessarily filtered may produce different results approval of tr ansaction by one federal agency does not constitute federal government approval and the transaction is still subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws49 what lies ahead for the utility industry the repeal of puhca 1935 does not remove all obstacles to previously barred electric and gas utility transactions state regulatory agencies still have the authority to regulate electric and gas utlities by granting state commi ssions increased access to utility and holding company books and records in puhca 2005 legislators may have been contemplating increased participation of the state commissions in review and regulation of public utility holdings companies since the repeal of puhca 1935 state has enacted any new laws or regulations concerning review of public utility mergers or other transactions some states may rely on preexisting statutory or regulatory language authorizing review of transactions to ensure that they are in the public interest other states may enact new legislation or take regulatory action to increase review or possibly even restrict certain transactions involving public utilities state commissions as well as ferc may increase regulation of cross subsidization between utility and nonutility businesses in the same holding company system the use of utility balance sheets to finance nonutility businesses and the financial health of potentia l holding company owners50 these measures may help to protect consumers who rely on utility service from the financial vulnerabilities of nonutility entities these protections are pecially
