the coast of puerto rico in response to c oncerns about risks to public safety human health and the environment congress directed the navy to close its training facilities on vieques island in 2003 and to relocate th em elsewhere the navy has begun to investigate the presence of munitions and related contamin ation on vieques to determine the cleanup actions th at will be necessary to protect human health and the environment and has begun the surface re moval of munitions in some areas in 1974 congress had enacted legislation that required the navy to cease its training operations on culebra island in response to similar public concerns the army corps of engineers has removed some munitions on culebra to address safety hazards in publicly accessible areas but has not begun comprehensive cleanup of the island the environmental protection agency epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board are res ponsible for overseeing these actions there has been rising public interest in the degree to which the department of defense dod will be required to clean up both islands the scope of the cleanup will depend on the type and extent of contamination found and whether pathway of human exposure exists the nationa l defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 prohibits public access within the live impact area of the former bombing range on vieques public access also may be limited in other areas due to the presence of munitions hazards since denying public access is intended to reduce safety threats dod may be allowed to remove fewer munitions than would be required otherwise however if cont amination has leached from munitions and migrated to present pathway of exposure removal of more munitions may be required to protect human health possi ble pathways include the consumption of contaminated groundwater and cont aminated fish or shellfish at the request of the governor of pu erto rico sila m calderon epa listed vieques on the national prior ities

government acqui red lands on western and eastern vieques for use by the navy and required the residents in these areas to relocate to the central portion of the island where 9300 people now live for discussion of the closure of navy operations on vieques see crs report rs20458 vieques puerto rico naval training range background and issues for congress by ronald orourke 2 in 1901 the federal government placed culebra island under the control of the navy to conduct training exercises and required the residential population to relocate to areas outside of the bombardment zone civilia n population of 1700 now resides in the areas to which people were relocated when the navy assumed control of the island 3 in this report the term munitions incl udes unexploded ordnance uxo detonated munitions and munitions constituents the latter of which includes substances contained in munitions that can leach into the soil surface water and groundwatervieques and culebra islands an analysis of cleanup status and costs introduction there have been longstanding concer ns about risks to human health the environment and public safety from decades of livefire training exercises conducted by the us navy on vieques island and culebra island located off the coast of puerto rico in response to these concer ns congress directed the navy to relocate its training facilities on both islands elsewhere the navy ceased its operations on vieques in 20031 and on culebra years earlier in 19752 there has been rising public interest in the degree of cleanup that the navy will be required to perform on vieques island and in the pace and extent of cl eanup that has been underway on culebra island federal studies of vieques island have not iden tified present risks to human health from munitionsrelated contamination3 however these findings have been controversial to resi dents who report health problems that they attribute to such contamination the possibility of future ri sks has yet to be examined fully as much remains unknown about the extent to which contamination is present although the navy has begun the surface removal of munitions on vieques the cleanup is mostly in the early stages of i nvestigating areas that the navy previously occupied to determine the degree of cont amination and threat of human exposure once these investigations are complete the navy will assess the degree of cleanup that will be required and will select remedial actions to achieve that degree of cleanup subject to approval by the envir onmental protection agency epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board thus far the army corps of engineers has removed limited number of munitions in publicly accessible areas on culebra to avoid safety hazards but has not initiated compre hensive cleanup of the former bombardment areas the puerto rico environmental quality board is overseeing the cleanup of culebrahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32533crs2 4 70 federal register 7182at the request of the governor of pu erto rico sila m calderon epa listed vieques island on the national priorities list npl of the nations most hazardous waste sites on february 11 20054 listing vieques on the npl does not affect the stringency of the cleanup that is require d or increase the availability of funding rather it identifies vieques as site that warrants further investigation to determine actions necessary to protect human health and the environment the governor also requested that epa list culebra on the npl along with vieques however epa has elected to take action on its final lis ting decision for culebra and reports that the commonwealth of puerto rico and the us army are negotiating memorandum of agreement to g overn the cleanup of culebra regardless of the site listing decision the degree of the cleanup on both islands will depend on threats to human health safety and the environment and the types of remediation that will be deem ed necessary to address thes threats whatever actions are required the progress of cleanup will depend on the availa bility of federal funding to pay for the remediation the cleanup of culebra is further complicated by the legal issue of whether the reserv forces facilities aut horization act of 1974 pl 93166 prohibits federa l expenditure for the dec ontamination of the island this report provides information on the listing of vieques on the npl examines the implications of the site listing for envi ronmental cleanup indicat the status and estimated costs of cleaning up munitions and other environmental contamination on vieques and discusses cl eanup actions and costs at nearby culebra island vieques island the navy expects to be required to conduct some remedia tion on the western end of vieques but the eastern lands are likely to contain the most severe hazards and therefore represent the greatest need for cleanup as this area was the location of the former bombing range although the na vy transferred some of the western lands to the municipality of vieques and the puerto rico conservation trust the us government has maintained ownership of all the eastern lands on vieques the department of the interior is required to administer them as national wildlife refuge and wilderness area with public access prohibited in the wilderness area the department of the inte rior may limit public access to so extent in the national wildlife refuge due to the presence of munitions hazards or the need to protect sensitive wildlife populations and their habitat as limiting public access would reduce the possibility of human exposure to health and safety hazards the navy may be permitted to remove fewer munitions and clean up related contamination to less stringent degree than would otherwise be required for less restrictive land uses such as tourism or resi dential development npl site listing the areas of vieques listed on the npl encompass the western side of the island where the navy stored and disposed of munitions at the former naval ammunition and support det achment nasd and the eastern side where the navy conducted live fire training exercises in the eastern maneuver area ema and the atlantic fleet

listing does not include cu lebra island where the navy also had conducted livefire training exercises through 1975 epa elected to take action on its final listing decision for culebra at that time citing legal issues as to whether vieques and culebra could be treated as one facility for listing purposes5 at the time of the site listing the commonwealth of puerto rico and the army had begun negotiating memorandum of agreement to govern the degree of cleanup on culebra that would protect human health and the environment epa reported that the terms or progress of such agreemen t may determine the poi nt at which it may be appropriate to withdraw the original proposal to list the culebra areas6 as noted earlier epa listed vieques on th npl in response to request by the governor of puerto rico sila m calder on submitted in june 20037 the governor had asked epa to list vieques and culebra as single site residents have expressed ongoing concern about the pace and degr ee of the cleanup that is being done on culebra and advocated including it in the site listing along with vieques epa issued proposal for the site listing on august 13 20048 the proposal was open forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32533crs4 9 listing site on the npl is subject to sta ndard federal rulemaking procedures involving formal notice of the proposed listing in the federal register receipt

release of hazardous substances in the united states and requires contamination to be cleaned up to level that is protective of human health and the environment cercla is codified at 42 usc 9601 et

report rl30798 environmental laws mmaries of statutes administered by the environmental protection agency solid waste disposal actresource conservation and recovery act by james mccarthy and mary tiemannpublic comment through october 12 20049 epa proposed two options for listing vieques and culebra on the npl the fi rst option would have involved listing both islands as single site as the gover nor had requested the second option would have been to list the two islands as separate sites under the second option epa stated that it would go forward with final rule listing vieques and postpone the final listing decision of culebra to llow the completion of memorandum of agreement for the cleanup between puerto rico and the army10 according to epa puerto rico and the army agreed to this second option for the site listing consequently epa did not make final decision on the listing of culebra when it finalized the listing of vi eques in february 2005 in its original proposal epa had acknowledged the possibility of deciding not to list culebra as an npl site under this second option and inst ead allow the cleanup to be determined by memorandum of agreement alt hough the agreement itself would not be subject to public comment the cleanup acti ons necessary to fulfill it would be open to comment prior to being finalized to date epa has not announced final decision as to whether culebra will be listed on the npl in the future the navy will be responsible for performing the cleanup of vieques in accordance with requirements specified in the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla11 epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board are responsib for overseeing and approving specific cleanup actions prior to the site listing the navy had begun cleanup investigation in western vieques under ce rcla and will continue th is investigation to fully identify the type and extent of contamination the navy also had been performing cleanup investigation in the eastern ar eas but with authorities under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra12 now that both areas of vieques are listed jointly as one npl site the remediation of the eastern areas also will be performed in accordance with cercla as both areas w ill be treated as single cleanup sitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32533crs5 the navy department of the interior ep and the puerto rico environmental quality board will enter federal facility agreement governing the entire site to determine the specific cleanup actions that will be necessa ry to protect human health and the environment the navy expects th at its ongoing cleanup investigation of the eastern areas will continue under rcra until the federal facility agreement is finalized and specific actions to comply with cercla are agreed upon whereas requirements under cercla may differ pr ocedurally from rcra the stringency of the cleanup essentially w ill be the same as cleanup performed under each statute is very similar whether epa lists culebra on the npl at later date or withdraws the listing proposal the army will continue its cleanup of culebra in accordance with cercla which will govern the memo randum of agreement for the cleanup implications of the site li sting for environmental cleanup the npl primarily serves informational purposes to identify sites that appear to warrant further investigation to determine whether rem oval or remediation of contamination is necessary to protect human health and th environment as noted above the navy already had begun cleanup investigations on vieques prior to the site listing and these investigations will continue to identify the type and extent of contamination that is in need of remediation however the listing of vieques does not necessitate certain degree of cleanup rather the degree of cleanup will be dete rmined by the potential risk of human exposure to potentially hazardous substances and the remedies selected to prevent exposure from occurring the degree of cleanup on vieques will be uncertain until federal facility agreement is finalized to specify the remedial actions that the navy will be required to perform the listing of vieques also does not guarantee certain amount of funding to perform the cleanup rather the navy reports that it allocates cleanup funding according to human health risks the allocation of funding for vieques would depend on the ri sks identified in site investigations and how those risks compare to other contaminat ed navy sites across the country although the site listing does not guarantee certain degree of cleanup or funding level it does offer cer tain advantages such as the potential for an expedited cleanup through greater coordination among the navy department of the interior epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board comprehensive federal facility agreement among these parties for the cleanup will likely be more efficient than entering separate agreements for each contaminated area of the island putting single agreement in place also might help to avoid potential confusion as to which requirements are applicable to the cleanup of each area although culebra was not included in the final site listing the memorandum of agreement being negotiated for the cleanup of that isla nd may offer similar opportunities for increased coordination on the other hand if culebra had been included in the site listing as the governor requested the federal facility agreement for vieques would have included the contaminated areas of culebra as well resulting in comprehensive cleanup plan for both islands the listing of vieques also offers the potential for the navy to gain the approval of cleanup actions more quickly in the eas tern areas of the island as the cleanup now will be done under cercla rather than rcra cercla generally entails fewerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32533crs6 13 40 cfr 300430 14 42 usc 9617e 15 see epas website httpwwwepagovregion02news200404040htm 16 information obtained from epa region 2 officials by telephone on july 28 2004administrative procedures for the approval of cleanup actions for example rcra typically requires permits to be obtained prior to the implementation of specific actions whereas cercla does not with fewer administrative procedures to follow the navy may be able to accomplish the cleanup of vieques more quickly as long as sufficient funding is made available although the navy will not be subject to rcras permitting procedures under cercla the navy will still be subject to federal regulations for the selection of cleanup actions13 these regulations require the opportunity for community involvement prior to final selection for which record of decision rod is made publicly available regard less of differences in pro cedure performing the cleanup under cercla will not alter the stringency of the cleanup relative to rcra as the cleanup requirements under both statutes are very similar the site listing also offers at least one other potential advantage from the standpoint of community involvement as the navy is authorized to provide centralized public forum through which resi dents could obtain comprehensive information on cleanup of the entire island prior to the site listing the navy had established technical review committee to inform citizens bout the status of cleanup on western vieques but similar fo rum was not established for the eastern areas being investigated under rcra at the request of the community the navy converted the technical review committee into restoration advisory board rab in fy2004 the rab holds meetings on quarterly basis to inform th public about the status of the cleanup and provide citizens with the opportunity to ex press concerns about proposed actions in person to federal and state officials as vieques is now listed as single site residents should be able to receive inform ation about the cleanup of both the western and eastern portions of the island thr ough the rab as one centralized forum related to the issue of community i nvolvement the listing of vieques on the npl also makes grant funds available fo r technical assistan ce to help citizens interpret and review information on cl eanup actions being c onsidered cercla authorizes epa to award up to total of 50000 in grants for technical assistance to communities located adjacent to an npl site14 in march 2004 epa awarded technical assistance grant in the amount of 20000 to community groups to help citizens understand the cleanup investigation on eastern vi eques that was being done under rcra15 epa reported that it was able to award this grant with discretionary funds of the office of the administrator16 now that vieques is listed on the npl up to 50000 in grants are available under cercla for technical assistance this amount would be in addition to the 20000 grant that epa has already awarded under the rcra investigation of the eastern areas of the islandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32533crs7 17 42 usc 9659 18 42 usc 9613h see clinton county commissioner v us epa 116 f3d1018 3rd cir 1997 19 42 usc 6972 20 the navy accepted liability for the cleanup of nds transferred to the department of the interior in western vieques in memorandum of agreement dated april 27 2001 and in eastern vieques in memorandum of agreement dated april 30 2003 the liability for cleanup when land is transferred from federal agency to nonfederal entity is specified in section 120h of cercla which applies to the transfer of

cleanup costs at sites closed with authorities provided in the defense base closure act are funded out of the base realignment and closure bra c accounttechnical assistance grants aut horized under cercla are available only to communities that live next to an npl site consequently the residents of culebra island are not eligible for these grants as epa did not include that island in the site listing on the other hand if epa were to list culebra island as separate site at later date the residents would be eligible to receive up to 50000 in grants that would be in addition to those awarded to th residents of vieques if epa had listed both islands as one site as the governor requested the amount would have been limited to total of 50000 for reside nts of both islands combined from the standpoint of the opportunity to bring citizen suits there is possible disadvantage to performing the cleanup under cercla rather than rcra regardless of the listing status of vieques or culebra although epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board are responsible for overseeing the cleanup the right of citizens to sue is means by which the community can take enforcement action against dod if they believe that th department is not conducting the cleanup in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements cercla and rcra differ in at least one substantial way with regard to the time frame within which citizens have the right to sue the citizen suit provision in cercla cannot be invoked in most challe nges to removal and remedial action17 until the removal or remedial action is completed 18 cleanup actions taken under rcra have such timing restriction19 citizens may sue under rcra at any point during the cleanup process as opposed to after the completion of the action in question under cercla source of cleanup funds regardless of the site listing the navy is liable for paying the costs to clean up vieques20 however the payment of these costs is subject to

environmental restoration accounts among the contaminat ed sites for which the department of defense is liable rather the department has the discretion to determine the allocations of funding for each

funding allocation for the cleanup of vieques ba sed on how much cong ress appropriates to its environmental restoration account and the cleanup priorities that it establishes among the sites under

it had expended total of 178 million through the end of fy2004 on investigating contamination and initiating the surface removal of munitions in certain areas of vieques the majority of this funding

by epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board consequently actual cleanup costs could be higher than timated if more extensive actions than the navy has planned are required actual costs also

vieques in april 2003 the navy transferre d 14669 acre s on the eastern side of vieques island to the department of the interior32 the majority of this land was the site of the former eastern maneuver area the remaining land in the most eastern portion was the site of the former atlantic fleet weapons training facility which included the bombing range in response to longstanding public concerns about safety health and nvironmental hazards arising from weapons training operations on vieques congre ss included provisions in the national defense authorization act for fy2002 that required the navy to close its installations on the eastern end of the island and to transfer its jurisdiction over these lands to the departme nt of the interior33 the act stipulated that the department of the interior must administer the 900 acres on the eastern tip of the island as wilderness area this acreage is the site of the live impact area of the former bombing range the law prohibits public access in this area indefinitely to prevent human exposure to safety hazards the act requires the department of the interior to administer the remaining 13769 acres of land on eastern vieques as national wildlife refuge while the act does not prohibit public access within the refuge the department of the interior may restrict access in certain areas due to the presence of munitions hazards outside of the live impact area34 or the need to protect sensitive wildlife populations and their habitat the former eastern maneuver area and the atlantic fleet weapons training facility as whole represent the great est cleanup challenge on vieques island due to the overall size of the land area and th likelihood of severe contamination on the bombing range the navy has begun comp rehensive investigation of contamination in these areas and has begun the surface rem oval of munitions in certain areas epa and the puerto rico environmental quality board are responsible for overseeing and approving these actions status of clea nup investigation as discussed earlier the navy began cleanup investigation in certain areas of eastern vieques in accordance with rcra prior to the npl site listing epa issued

2005investigation in january 2000 the navy re ports that the investigation and cleanup under rcra will continue until federal facility agreement is in place which specifies the actions that will be n ecessary to conduct the cleanup under cercla however the stringency of the cleanup likely w ill be s imilar as the requirements upon which cleanup decisions are based are comparable to those in rcra under the rcra consent order the navy has completed the first phase of investigating environmental contamination at 12 waste storage and disposal sites of these sites 8 are located within the eastern maneuver area and 4 are located within the atlantic fleet weapons training fac ility the collective land area of the 12 sites covered under the consent order encompa sses 80 acres relatively small portion of the 14669 acres that the navy formerly occupi ed in eastern vieques the order does not include the investigation of the former bombing range as the range was still in use when epa issued the order in 2000 in addition to the 12 sites noted above th navy expected to begin investigation of 8 other sites in eastern vieques in 200535 the navy identified these sites in an archive records search which revealed past activities that may have resulted in contamination the navy also identif ied 23 other areas of concern where contamination may be present based on examination of aerial photographs the navy expects to begin investigation of these sites in the future with the time frame not determined as of march 2005 the i nvestigation of the presence of munitions and related contamination on the former bombing range will be based on the findings of preliminary range assessment that the navy completed in april 2003 degree of cleanup there has been significant public interest in the extent to which munitions and related contamination will be cleaned up on the eastern end of vieques island the scope of the cl eanup will depend on public safety hazards posed by the presence of munitions and whether pathway of human exposure to munitionsrelated contamination exists the live impact area of the former bombing range that is to be administered as wilderness area is likely the most contaminated portion of the island as th national defense au thorization act for fy2002 prohibits public access on this land pathway of exposure through human contact with soil or surface water presumably would not be present if this prohibition is enforced consequently cleanup may be less extensive than if the land were designated for uses that would involve human presence however if the cleanup investigation we re to reveal that contamination has migrated offrange and presented pathway of exposure the navy could be subject to more stringent cleanup actions similarly the department of the interior could limit public access to lands outside of the live impact area that are to be administered as national wildlife refuge if munitions hazards are present if access to these lands were restricted the navy could be subject to less stringent cleanup requirements there as well unless contamination were to migrate to areas where people are

in the wilderness area nd the possibility of limited access in the national wildlife refuge would significantly reduce exposure to contamination from contact with soil or surface water however there are other possible pathways of exposure if contamination were to migrate outside of these areas at this juncture pathway of exposure to inhabited areas in the central portion of the island from the migration of contaminati on through groundwater appears unlikely the groundwater has not been used as primary drinking source since 1978 because of high saline levels the majority of resi dents receive their drinking water through public water supply that is piped in from the puerto rico mainland36 few public and private groundwater wells still exist on the island nd are occasionally used when the public water supply is interrupted the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr released public health assessment of public drinking water supplies and groundwater on vieques island in october 200137 the agency concluded that the public water supply was safe to drink it also concluded that water from wells used when the mainland supply is interrupted is safe to drink with the exception of one private well that contains water most likely contaminated from agricultural pollution38 while it appears that contamination from the fo rmer bombing range had not migrated to drinking water wells at the time of the atsdrs assessment epa or the puerto rico environmental quality board could require the navy to take actions that would prevent migration in the future another possible pathway of exposure is the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish contaminati on could migrate into the cean from storm water runoff from the beaches on the former bombing range or could leach into the ocean from underwater munitions possibl contaminating fish and shellfish populations the consumption of contaminated fish and she llfish could pose risk to human health depending on the type and centration of contaminants nd extent of exposure the atsdr released public health assessment fo r the consumption of fish and shellfish around vieques island in june 200339 the agency conducted survey indicating that nearly half of the reside nts on vieques consume fish one or two times each weekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32533crs15 heavy metals in fish and shellfish were tected but the agency concluded that the concentrations were too w to harm human health these findings have been controvers ial among local residents who have attributed various symptoms that they have experienced to the consumption of contaminated fish there appear to be reports of data to confirm that the consumption of contaminated fish poses health threat at this time however epa or the puerto rico environmental quality board could require the navy to take cleanup actions that would prevent migration of contamination in to the ocean based on the possibility that the concentration of contaminants in fish and shellfish could rise to harmful levels in the future if migration were to occur cleanup cost estimates for eastern vieques thus far the navy has expended some funds on investigating the presence of munitions and other hazardous substances on former training areas in eastern vieques and on the removal of munitions from the surface in certain high risk areas the navy also has calculated preliminary estimate of the costs to co mplete the cleanup as indicated in table 3 the navy reports that it had expende d total of 65 million on cleanup in eastern vieques through

the other hand costs to clean up munitions could be lower than estimated if more costeffective detection and removal tec hnologies become available another factor that could have sign ificant impact on cleanup costs is whether the land continues to be administered as national wildlife refuge and wilderness area by the department of the interior as required by current w some stakeholders advocate the transfer of these lands to pr ivate property developers if congress were to amend the law to allow the property to be transferred to private entity for land use with greater potential for human expos ure the cleanup could be more costly for example if the land were used for tour ism or residential development the degree to which the contamination would need to be remediated could be more stringent and therefore more costly actions planned for fy2005 and fy2006 with the funding identified in table 3 the navy has planned to conduct specific actions in eastern vieques to investigate the presence of munitions nd remove munitions in certain areas actions planned for fy2005 with enacted appropriations include completion of the range assessment as noted earlier preliminary assessment was completed in 2003 completion of surface removal of munitions on beaches completion of surface removal of munitions on approximately 200 acres within the live impact ar ea of the former bombing range

island in 1993 and transferred control of access to the state of hawaii in november 2003 upon comp letion of the cleanup the memorandum of agreement for the transfer of kahoolawe from the navy to the state of hawaii specified that munitions would have to be cleared to level that would allow public access the agreement stipulated that all munitions would be cleared from 100 of the surface and that 25 of the land would be restored to the point that it would be safe for multiple uses one of which is human habitation45 there has been some disagreement as to whether the navy met these standards in cleaning up the island there are munitions clearance levels stipulated in the memorandum of agreement for the transfer of land on vieques island from the navy to the department of the interior as discussed earlier the national defense authorization act for fy2002 prohibits public access in the fo rmer live impact area that is to be managed as wilderness area the act does not specify the extent to which the public may have access to other lands in easte rn vieques that the department of the interior is to manage as national w ildlife refuge from safety standpoint neither of these land uses would necessitate the clearance of munitions at vieques to address explosive hazards which are similar to clearance levels at kahoolawe island consequently the extent and cost s of removing munitions may be lower at vieques however if c ontamination on the former bom bing range on vieques were to migrate and present pathway of exposure more extensive and costlier cleanup than the navy has ssumed

areas of the transferred land where munitions were present section 204c of the 1974 act addresses the expenditure of federal funds for envir onmental cleanup on the island notwithstanding any other provision of law the present bombardment area on the island of culebra shall not be utilized for any purpose that would require decontamination at the expense of the ited states any lands sold transferred or otherwise disposed of by the united st ates as result of the relocation of the operations referred to in subsection shiptoshore and other gun fire and bombing operations of the us navy ma be sold transferred or otherwise disposed of only for public park or public recreational purposes47 several legal issues are raised by th above provision the threshold issue is whether it bars fede ral expenditures or land uses that is whether it prohibits any decontamination expenditures by the united states on culebra or read more literally prohibits land uses that would require d econtamination expenditures by the united states the two readings are quite different the first blocks any federal expenditure for cleanup while the second c ontemplates the possibility of federal expenditure for this purpose in certain circumstances s the result of pre 1974 activities or post 1974 activities improperly allo wed or carried out in ope n violation of the act if this initial issue is resolved in favor of prohibiting all payments by the united states for cleanup after 1974 second issue arises what is the effect of cerclas enactment in 1980 and subsequent am endments in 1986 that clarified the applicability of cercla to federal fac ilities the broad cleanup authorities in cercla on their face recognize exception for culebra thus one must ascertain whether cercla by implicati on amends the 1974 law to repeal its expenditurebarring language or whethe r the 1974 prohibition remains in effect as an exception to cercla if the 1974 language is c onstrued merely as land use prohibition there would not be conflict with cercl which would allow the fe deral government to pay for cleanup actions if the land is being used for purposes that would require remediation to protect

extent of the cleanup on both is lands will depend on threats to human health safety and the environment and the types of remediation that will be deemed necessary to address these threats th pace of the cleanup will depend on the extent to which the site investigations reveal immediate threats that require timecritical removal actions otherwise longterm re medial actions may be used to address potential threats of exposure depending on the remedy selected and the quantity of contamination longter m remediation can take several years or even decades in some cases making for lengthy cleanup whatever actions are required the progress of cleanup will depend on the availability of federa l funds to pay for the remedia tion the defense environmental restoration accounts are currently the onl source of funding for cleanup on vieques and culebra how much would be available under thes accounts is limited by congressional appropria tions and the competing needs of other sites across the country the availability of federal f unding for clea nup at culebra is further complicated by the legal issue of whether the reserve forces facilities authorization act of 1974 prohibits federal
