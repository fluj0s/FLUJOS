type 3 idate1964 volnum2 issue37 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec37 the pe course 6409c01 shspec37 the pe course here is some data from the field of study that relates to the pe course new people hear incomprehensible words and dont return thats it that is the reason why you have fifteen people on monday who dwindle to two people on friday what has been discovered here is the act that exists prior to the overt and which illumines the overtmotivator and ow sequences before there is an overt there is noncomprehend so the overtmotivator sequence goes 1 misunderstood word 2 noncomprehend 3 belief that it is ok to commit an overt 4 the commission of the overt 5 the withhold of the overt 6 blow an attack or withdrawal this can be big or small 662 see also hcob 8sep64 levels ii to iv overts what lies behind them critical thought is justifier lessener of the overt and therefore symptom of an overt if you ask the pc for an overt and he gives critical thought of course you dont leave it there you ask for the done having gotten that you could ask for the noncomprehend and behind that for the misunderstood word get the nattery student to find on his own before the next coursetime all of his misunderstoods in previous courses or studies and get them cleaned up someone who cant do anything about anything is reasonable about it all this is disease that civilized person gets into being reasonable doesnt solve anything you cant do anything about it so you get reasonable about it being reasonable is what someone does who cant make his goals anymore if you really find out what the score is you dont have to be reasonable you can do something about it if guy is having trouble understanding and is nattering about scientology before he has had time to find anything to natter about there is word or words in prior related subject that was misunderstood someone who has misunderstood words in field that is allied to scientology will be unable to learn scientology this is why someone who is psychologist has trouble learning scientology he could do some clay table processing to handle it or you could assign him selfaudit looking up the words in psychology that he didnt understand this takes care of the natterer in the pe course as very precise action if you get someone in the pe course who is trying to get it but cant ask him for the word that you have used that he didnt understand if the guy is simply trying and failing to grasp word he just has an incontext misunderstood word find it and he will brighten up then there is the perfect pe student who sits and nods but hasnt clue this is handled by having people give written examples of the point that you have made taken from real life this permits return flow and lets you spot the fellow who is utterly glib and cant apply the fellow who hasnt connected get him to give you list of words that he hasnt understood since starting the course take up those words and clean them up probably some other people on the course havent got them either suppose that you were offered course to teach you all about automobiles and you had never seen one but you had sort of vaguely heard about them you had heard that they travel over the ground at tremendous speeds this sow ded rather neat and intriguing so you decided to take the course then suppose you got hit with three nights in row of how neat cars are and how fast you can go in them and how intriguing they are and you never got word one about what an automobile is what makes it work or what its parts are so when you teach scientology teach it an overt against scientology is justification for not having understood some word or concept in scientology keep it simple and keep it defined as much as possible keep it familiar people like the familiar people dont like things that are totally new the public likes the old with maybe little bit of improvement not new subjects so you had better represent scientology as what it is which is the only conservative study in the field of the mind it follows the traditional patterns of philosophy religion and the mind your own interest in it may have come from your recognition in it of the philosophy of greece and rome and of faculty psychology 663 people justify not having understood subject so they commit the overt that shows that the subject is good presentday psychologists think of man as machine psychology has stable datum perception depends on association and sensation according to the psychologist there is perception in the absence of sensation and association that is machine in the absence of someone tickling its gears and certain things making other things happen is incapable of noticing anything that is happening this notion puts conditions upon being able to perceive anything and it is not true it would be true of machine with nobody in charge but it is not true of being being does not require sensation with association in order to perceive only if person were piece of meat would this be true before i can look at field of id have to have received sensation from it and to have associated it with my childhood robot would have to do that it would have to have associative memory etc psychologists believe that man is robot when you say that perception is engaged upon by the being himself as means of communication with the universe around him and other beings you would have been welcomed by the sixteenth century faculty psychologists but you are damned by the moderns you have introduced volition volitional and nonvolitional acts you have set up the individual as seeing what he wants to see and not seeing what he doesnt want to see you have set up the whole mechanism of power of choice and you have set up the dignity of the individual and that they want nothing to do with because they in not understanding man have gone the route of the overt see earlier part of this tape pp 6612 above thats why psychiatry cuts out brains theyve got to make nothing out of man because they havent understood him and the misunderstood word that it goes back to is psychology every psychiatrist is in the frame of mind of man they are arc broken with their own subject they know it doesnt work this is where their contempt for man comes from they dominate thought in universities they teach that man is good he is just machine such philosophy became necessary when leaders entered wars that killed off thirty million people at crack this philosophy justifies the overt you have to have philosophy that man is good in order to go on committing overts so mans mental subjects first didnt bother to understand anything about man and so then began to commit overts and then employment was found for these blokes by fellows who had to have their overts justified the hitlers and the stalins man is not more degraded than he was it is just that mans mental sciences have departed from the traditional which had to do with the dignity of man wundt made his big mistake at leipzig in 1879 and pavlov and psychiatry came riding in scientology is in the great tradition of the dignity of man the ideas that we are moving along with are the traditional ideas these ideas have to do with attention perception power of choice and motivation of behavior we do not go on the basis of how wicked everyone is we just ask what these things are the idea that men are animals was always there to be bought but it wasnt until 1879 that it got taken up so modern psychology is the upstart subject modern psychology and psychiatry came from the russian and the german two groups of people who have enviable reputation for humanitarianism if the germans had just stopped with 664 music and cameras we would be fine but every once in awhile they got careless with guns psychiatry came from germany and modern psychology came from the russians psychology is really substudy of scientology and as such it is our property after all psychologists cant even define psychology it should have its spelling changed to psycheology study of the soul so as to reflect its true and traditional meaning it is the psychiatrists and psychologists who are the radicals scientologists and the traditionalists we are the conservatives psychiatry psychology philosophy and religion and all subsumed in scientology the radical approaches have had their chance and have failed to produce results they should stand aside in favor of the more traditional approach psychology as psycheology should be seen as being part of scientology the eyes can see by putting something there to be perceived as well as by perceiving what is there learning nomenclature is equivalent to learning what is there treat the pe course as an area where people can learn the language and find out what is there to be named and students will come up smiling if they dont understand the words they blow natter and commit overts thus we build our own opposition l ron hubbard type 3 idate3964

is the same as what it means on adding machines computers have complex circuits sometimes drop of solder gets dropped in which shortcircuits the circuits and adds some wrong constant factor to the computer in mechanical adding machines if you never pushed the clear button after the previous operation you would get the old total added in that is the uncleared answer where old data modifies pt data the mind likewise will add old answers into current computations and get wrong answers persons memory will be bad in the area where the old answer is stuck amnesia is all the helddown fives adding up to total blank memory is not broad condition it is spotty as leopard person has bad memory in an area of aberration traumatic experience is surrounded by locks so sometimes it is hard to find there is such thing however as uniformly good or bad memory the worse off someone is the more areas of nomemory there are insanity becomes way of obfuscating overts as well as motivator and justifier for them if we could get person to see the overt all that insanity would become unnecessary if you want to improve someones memory you must ask memory on what person is aberrated in the area where his memory is poor there is fairly goodsized piece of nuttiness occluding some area of his experience and memory all you have to do is to monkey with it little and it will start to clear psychiatry errs by trying to make sense out of the incomprehensible it cant be done by definition you should not try to figure that square shapes make people nervous because some patients were nervous around doors instead you should find out how come the patients got nuts on the subject of doors you dont try to make sense out of the incomprehensible all you have to do is to understand that he the person who has presented you with the incomprehensible doesnt understand it and to start looking for where it came from 665 people are far more normal than they are crazy cf hs sullivan nobody is totally crazy other mental sciences go crazy on this fact because of mans thirst for allness which is just the craving to identify with psychiatrists going aaa think that there is such thing as total insanity and that therefore there is such thing as the state of being insane even in his legal systems man has to have something called insanity this is not correct person is insane in one or more areas or subjects there is such thing as total insanity gibbering idiot who asks for glass of water when he is thirsty is sane in that area the sentence this man is insane requires three dots at its end to show that it is incomplete psychiatrists have never completed the sentence so that it reads properly and accurately as this man is insane on the subject of _______ but if psychiatrists knew that much about the subject of insanity they could cure it it is the missing link actually they have never defined their terms if you ask psychiatrist what subject is this guy insane on he would say maybe exhibitionism bull pucky thats condition not subject you cant classify insanities because insanity is the same on the same subject as any other to finish the sentence this man is insane on the subject of _______ psychiatrists would have to observe the patient then they would see that there was similarity to others insanity find the subject on which person is insane find the source of the subject and he will have cognitions and the aberration will blow if you are in an area where the pc is cogniting you must therefore be in an area where the pc was aberrated you are tracking down and clearing helddown five cognition is returned memory when the pc is cogniting it is an indicator that he is getting rid of helddown fives and he will be remembering better in that area if person never cognites you arent tracking down any helddown fives clear means on any given subject not nuts anymore especially where the person has been pretty nuts you could say for example on the subject of children this person is clear you would have to put it into the framework of relationship of some kind when you have hit enough stuck fives you can call the guy clear which means cleared being with cleared ability to think guy who has been cleared in given area of aberration cant go nuts in that area again it took fantastically offthewall set of circumstances to aberrate the person in the first place to aberrate him again you would have to get the same weird circumstances all together again and then some because now he is educated too he knows how it happened cleared person or clear would be person with obvious aberrations and with majority of areas cleared who has cleared ability to think the basic business of an auditor is to use scientology tech to locate areas of aberration in the being and then to follow those areas down until the person recognized an earlier causation for the condition he would then be unable to reconstruct his nuttiness in that area because the thing that had him aberrated in the first place is gone and he also knows that he has been nuts in that area so when he sees something approaching that could be recurrence of the condition he preunderstands what might happen again and it wont happen having had the experience and being aware of it is like being inoculated he couldnt go nuts again in that area if he tried therefore clearing is stable 666 the state of total causation is not the same as the state of clear the state of total causation is ot which is different from being unaberrated clearing is something that applies to the mind it is related to finite state of existence the ability to survive well in everyday existence in the universe across time when we try to make clear an absolute we go beyond that into another area that has the sideeffects of clear although you are not trying to fix the guy up the final result is total resumption of beingness at total causation which isnt necessarily in the physical universe in finite time clearing is an assist to finite existence not some supernatural thing man doesnt leap from state of total aberration to state of total divinity it is long walk which starts with the guys present environment the gradient scale only breaks down when the pc gets into running the things that make up the mind gpms now you are handling uncommon unnatural problems like why did the being make time track what is he doing in the physical universe etc an individual who had time at all would not be normal it takes different framework to explain this now you have an individual who through his understandings of what is around him and his exact handling of the masses and significances in his immediate vicinity has gradual emergence and cognition of what is going on we are knocking out his concept of existence and replacing it with total knowingness of existence that individual is emerging towards causation not towards being cleared he is going towards point where he causes the past not where he is cleared of the past the aberrations you are taking away from him on r6 are not timed aberrations that is what makes them build up and that is why they are rough they cant be blown by meter dating they date now however you can date and blow an implant gpm isnt something that happened in the year 2681 bc that is quite different from something that happened within the universe that you can fit in on the time track if you find an engram all you have to do it date it and it goes bzzt the pc wouldnt have prayer of getting it back after the guy is clear you begin to ask where is the time coming from that you are dating the clearing in now you are into r6 and ot the guy is more causative over the universe less worried about what the universe is doing to him you are going from the finite to the infinite the field of recreation of the individual or the individuals rising up towards total cause is long and arduous road you dont run out of gpms very fast the point is that there is separation point between the finite universe and the world of total beingness people going towards clearing are interested in physical wellbeing and their relationships with other human beings they are interested in accomplishing finite goals in the physical universe like keeping job etc if person going up the other track hasnt totally followed the clearing track he is still interested in those things too although perhaps not so aberratedly but only people who are interested in clearing are interested in finite physical universe goals 667 if someone is insane you remove the individual areas of aberration as they become accessible and leave growing core of sanity that was always there somewhere along the line he ceases to be interested in becoming clear of his past and he begins to be very sincerely interested in causation personal individual causation what is the individuals relationship to and responsibility with regard to the physical universe the individual is also capable of going nuts in this direction and thinking that he is god but only if he isnt really past the gates on the road clearing ceases when the individual can recognize his basic gpms and knows where they came from etc ordinary clearing procedures wont touch gpms so clearing ceases now you go into running gpms the person soon gets over being interested in blowing out the electric light or wondering if he could do this etc he gets more seriousminded about the situation as it becomes more real to him and more natural to him he stops worrying about other people getting to be ot the end of the road is in view and it is finite road so the two roads are different one has to do with processing somebody within the limits of time and experience deleting things that keep the individual from getting right answers in existence the other is different auditing changes the individuals responses to auditing change you can still shift the preot back little onto the other road if you do this too much he collides with the next gpm and it jams the meter the locks are now all on top of gpms not on traumatic life experiences charge on subject could lead to misunderstanding word on the subject clarification of the word would cause dropping away of some locks on the subject this could apply to gpm words also it isnt how big or how little persons aberrations are that counts it is how many aberrations he has the closer the aberrations are in subject to each other the more there are these aberrations are not necessarily based on dramatic or interesting experiences either although the pc may try to make more out of them than is actually there l ron hubbard type 3 idate15964 volnum2 issue39 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec39 scientology and tradition 6409c15 shspec39 scientology and tradition you have to understand something about policy policy is not just something that lrh just dreamed up it is something that has been worked out and that has held true over period of time if someone who was supervising staff knew all the policies on central orgs that have been worked out over the years and if he did what they said he would never have to solve single problem looking over any scene in an org and the policies for the area lrh could routinely give the policy covering that situation it is interesting for an organization as young as this one to have this much policy policy makes communication possible between two points this is its main function not forcing people to obey orders in the absence of policy you dont have communication between two points because the two points are not agreed on anything tradition is likewise an agreement the above points about policy therefore also cover civilization civilization has mores and guides to conduct which are agreed upon and which assist the general survival of the individual and the majority of the group policy is or should be based on experience and should lead towards survival 668 so we have policies customs and procedures these are sequential doingnesses if you dont know and follow these you fall out of agreement with the people who are following them and you will feel strange you might have better way to do something than the agreedupon way but if your way is at wide variance with the accepted way the others may shoot you if society is too dissonant it is longer civilization because it does not have agreements there are all kinds of ways of getting married these days this bunch of mishmashes shows that there is something wrong with the institution of marriage as it now stands the rise of animalistic psychology has violated the individuals right even to have customs behaviorism invalidates the idea that people should have customs there are only supposed to be pushbutton responses one is supposed to react to stimuli etc instead of policies you have manipulation people and societies object to manipulation especially hidden manipulation it violates the right to have right way to do things it denies the individual the right to any sense at all it is longer based on considerations of survival the dignity of man involves the ability to decide policy with others policy and customs are things that make sense at least at the time that they are formulated customs and policy look odd when they persist after the problem that they were created to handle has vanished when tradition that originally made sense loses its sense it may now have as its rationale politeness or some such thing people tend to carry solutions into the future after the problem is licked policies can conflict if realities are different for instance in miami during the second world war american planes had habit of practicing dive bombing on hips entering harbors they got fired on by dutch ship returning from the south pacific in scientology we appear to be out of step but what we are out of step with is the new technology of control which assumes that men are animals that should be handled by having their buttons pushed lrh was taught at princeton that law proceeds from the customs of the people law that proceeds only from central source and ignores or seeks to change peoples customs will either be ignored or will bring on revolution as with prohibition the civil rights act also sought to change customs by legislation it violates the first amendment and other amendments of the constitution it violates the right to jury trial something that one seemed to notice this produced breakdown in communication which resulted in disorder and rioting because it was violation of custom and an attempt at central enforcement of custom the way to keep the peace is to keep the customs of the people military governors had this fact laid on them with an axe since this was the way to keep civil bodies in back of the front lines under control having them out of control was embarrassing when you violate the expected survival pattern of an area you have said die bucking custom is bucking theta comm line you have cut the comm line between point and point b now their actions dont mesh since they are operating on different policies 669 custom and policies are methods of bringing about communication and agreement along certain matters that lead to higher level of survival if policy leads to higher level of survival it is good policy poor policy leads to lower level of survival and bad policy leads to complete disaster this accounts for the ebb and flow of civilizations civilizations could die out because their customs have become antiquated but far more often civilizations are smashed by the fact that the central government or an external source an invasion has smashed the customs of the civilization today on this planet communism is engaged upon this process using the wundtian psychology of 1879 scientology is not in conflict with the customs of the planet or the universe quite the contrary if you can communicate with anyone on the subject of scientology he will agree with you unless he misunderstands word since you are talking to him out of the traditional technologies of healing and the human spirit and the traditional philosophies and psychologies know the truth and the truth will set you free this is an ancient policy of psychology that is now being violated for instance washington is now claiming that the government has the right to lie this violates the custom of tell the truth and the policy of the courts governments justify government lies in all sorts of ways but individuals arent supposed to lie it is legal for governments to lie but not for the individual to lie this is bad news the man in the street will agree with you as long as you dont use words that are strange to him he will agree on ideas such as the idea that man has right to be free to control his life etc our target is not to make an insane person quiet but to make him sane that has been the target of mental healing since the stone age but not in the last halfcentury that is why we are looked upon as dangerous by the new faddists who are interested in manipulation not freedom they would argue with the idea that it is good for people to be free an idea that has never been contested in civilized society try asking psychiatrist what are you trying to do with your patient he will never tell you that he is trying to make him sane he will obfuscate the slave philosophy was practiced in sparta communism is similar but bolder we have made progress in how to accomplish goals which man has had as long as he has been man what we have developed that is new is technology to attain the traditional goals of philosophy and religion scientologys way of expressing mans basic goals and our organizational methods may be new but not the basic goals of scientology which are the goals of man we can improve on the idea behind the witch doctor healing by manipulation of symbols we have the advantage of being able to communicate and have session by witch doctor we do not mean someone who uses an african black magic juju but real healing witch doctor in the absence of orthodoxy anything can be called unorthodox society that has right conduct is society in which anyone can be punished and criticized by art critics scientific agencies etc because he is not conducting himself rightly you can longer comply there is nothing to comply with they pretend there is custom there when there isnt any that there is 1234 procedure and then will never tell you what it is and yet punish you because you dont comply with it the material wealth of society doesnt demonstrate its longevity or endurance greeces greatest art and philosophy was produced in its decline 670 the communication of custom is itself technology when it breaks down the custom can be abandoned conversely when the custom itself has broken down you get communication breaking down we get breakdown of civilization when its customs break down because of failure to communicate them you get cooperation when people dont know the customs on which they operate the means of communication of customs are longer taught in this civilization this is where study tech and misunderstood word tech fits in so you could be remiss in teaching scientology by using words that are strange and misunderstood if you do this you have not established communication being comprehensible comes ahead of being effective since comprehensibility makes your effectiveness apparent if youre truly comprehensible people will forgive you almost anything as witness my life so the proper order of importance is 1 comprehensibility 2 necessity demand 3 effectiveness l ron hubbard type 3 idate22964 volnum2 issue40 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec40 review of study 6409c22 shspec40 review of study there are textbooks on how to study even in schools of education lrh plans to write one that would revolutionize the field of study and education in johannesburg tests on school children showed decrease in iq that was more marked the longer they stayed in school the longer person studies of course the more words he runs into that he doesnt understand and the more confusion he piles up artists writers etc in the workaday world have this peculiarity the successful ones have never taken course in their art field or even finished college at party given in new york for professional writers lrh did an informal survey to determine the educational background of the guests he found that most of them had either been expelled from college or had never attended college in the first place the one exception was man who piped up and said that he had obtained phd in literature he turned out to be literary agent failed writer in the years following lrh found out that writing courses dont teach writing they teach some technology that writers dont use and various gimmicks that writers also dont use writers do have and use technology but writing courses dont teach it the trouble is that writers are professional liars when then tell you how they write they tell the most incredible tales they never really say what they do so there are lot of pretended technologies in the area in any technical subject technology builds up in the area of correction such technologies as photographic retouching or correction lists tend to be more complex than the technologies that they correct if you have the technique of how to do it in the first place everything will move smoothly from there on but if technology is missing not known or not practiced we will now get complicated technology arising as lowerscale subject that will be corrective of the upperscale subject medicine is another example of corrective technology the upperscale technology would be that of making bodies properly in the first place 671 as practiced today all education is corrective technology it is trying to correct its own failed corrections there is duress in the field to get students to learn this must be an effort to correct the students failure to get the material in the first place caused by early confusions duress in education is substitute for the missing technology of the misunderstood word and the cause of the failure of education the duress makes it impossible for the student to use his education he is left on suppress and an onlyone basis because the duress has caused him to go out of arc with the subject so he does nonapplication of the information he might even get weird and revengeful towards his subject schools keep kids in line until they are old enough for the police to take over the job freedom from is fighting something or worrying about it not true freedom one way in which you can have misunderstood is by getting what the writer is saying but having misunderstood or missed something perhaps earlier not getting what the writer is driving at how does the state suffer from miseducation in russia many students were given onthejob training for key posts but after their training 100 of the students left the posts that they were trained for what must have happened is that way back in school the communist love of changing the meanings of words got in there the english upper governing class lost their influence by being educated to death so the continuation of culture depends on having technology of study the government is trying to bring in law and order while creating disorder delinquency and stupidity in the schools once again scientology and dianetics collide with an area where there is pretended technology unlike the area of medicine and drugs the field of education is not one of vested interest because there is not as much money in it when you are teaching teachers about study technology you should recognize that you are moving them up from level 0 to level i see pp 521523 above for description of level 0 p 479 above for description of levels i and ii and p 462 above for summary of levels and classes iiv you can tell the teachers the iq of your children could be increased by study instead of decreased or your school could run with less upset or juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation this will be very acceptable to them and they will never think to ask where this data and knowledge is coming from because they never think about anything in the first place you havent realized that they cant see where it is coming from because they cant see at all this is because they have been trained into stupidity when you fail to communicate to someone about scientology it is because you are talking to them above the level at which you should be talking to them youve got to give them the idea that there are data that data can be comprehended and that they can learn something then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge people dont expect anything to work because nothing ever has they dont think that there is anything to know if we are unreal to them it is because everything is unreal to them we have high commandvalue over them scientology could probably put the whole society into some kind of obedience basis but that is not our purpose 672 you would have win if you approached someone on the following gradient 1 getting him into state where he could learn 2 showing him that there was something to be studied 3 showing him that there was body of information about study 4 showing him that there was body of information to study this hasnt been our normal approach we have generally overlooked the fact that if someone cant learn he cant even receive your message in fact his basic ptps have to do with not knowing if he knew that there was some way to learn about anything he would be very interested if he could know that there was some way to gather data he would be on your side because he could apply this to his ptps you would teach him that the first step to knowing about something is to observe it both you and he have probably taken it for granted that he is already doing that when he isnt you could ask him something like have you ever taken really good look at what your wife is doing or some such when you are teaching someone about study you take the obvious and expand it as an introduction to the field in dissemination you are not up against societys ignorance cussedness or unwillingness to be helped but against incorrect study tech and charge on study this jams your comm line incorrect study tech prohibits people from learning that there is more to know thus stultifying the intellect creating stupidity and discouraging observation therefore study is an excellent dissemination tool when disseminating stay simple concentrate on something like one learns through observation which is accomplished by observing tell them about the value of observing gaining familiarity etc dont start with the arc triangle the person that you are disseminating to doesnt know that knowledge hasnt already all been found out he has to come to realize that he can learn and that there is more to know since he first tried to learn something he has been subjected to technology that stultifies the intellect he has weird ideas about study that make him flinch from the idea of learning things you have to make him reach by giving him the obvious which he can see take the obvious points and get studious about them you can get away with being studious about what is obvious person isnt going to get anywhere except by observation anyway let him get complex about the subject of observation he will only wind up back at observing he will get to the fact that you observe by observing after he blows through the complexity by reach and withdraw of observation he gets more familiar eg with his wife thus study can bring him out of it l ron hubbard type 3

that has bypassed many scientologists as evidenced by the difficulty that some of them have in pulling withholds if you knew gradients well you would never have trouble with auditing pcs what you are really having trouble with isnt what you appear to be having trouble with the same applies to pc or student if you are not getting case gain on pc it could be mistake in the gradient you cant get someone 673 over trouble that he isnt having so if you process his problem and he doesnt get better you have him over his head on what he can confront and handle what he complains of may not be the real problem at all some processes like what could you confront handle this automatically this doesnt mean that you dont have to follow gradient in your address to the case you should plan it on gradient processes are all designed with the idea of starting with little and moving up to lot the classification program is designed the same way as the auditor moves up in class he can handle more difficult pcs and more of the pcs case you can handle just about anything by tackling the first fundamental thing first and taking on more and more bit by bit in lots of research people have never gone to the fundamentals they have never asked what they were looking for or where to approach it or observed some obvious basics for instance you can examine sound gross vibration with light fine vibration but you cant examine light with sound you cant look at it with anything but itself the only thing that can look at color light waves is you the color wheel cant be circle the same color appearing at the other end of the spectrum must be matter of harmonics this gets into taste you are the only thing that can evaluate color harmonics when you dont know about gradients you try to build castle on top of palace on top of condition that you call the pcs case without going to the fundamentals knowing what you are looking for or where to approach it or observing some obvious basics this happens because you never walked up the gradient and never saw the fundamentals of th pcs case you only wind up with notion of the fantastic complexities of existence if ones observations are nonsense then ones solutions will be nonsense and if you keep trying to observe the totality of the case without observing one little thing about it you will never find the gradient that leads to observation of the case approach case with the question what is he doing that i can understand you wont be able to remedy the case unless you can find one thing to handle at time on the case to remedy case find one thing you can understand about the case and fix it then find another as this proceeds the case will become simpler dont try to grasp or handle the whole damned case in two days the pc is always at the top of selfcreated gradient of complexity that he hasnt climbed and he tries to get the auditor there too so you get suckered in on it and try to solve the whole case overnight thus you get lose now take overts you ask the pc if he has ever committed crime that could send him to jail if it were discovered that is flying to the top of the building jumping the gradient and making the auditor feel as though he cant pull overts you pull overts on gradient what gradient would work first you have to take into consideration the fact that you are pulling the pcs overts on comm line which may be pretty tenuous to start with the comm line must be sturdy enough to hold the level of charge or overt that we want to have come over on it first build up the comm line then start getting some little overts that come across easily leading to bigger and bigger overts always pulling overts of magnitude that the pc can confront there are two gradients 1 the pcs willingness to talk to the auditor 2 the level of overt that he is willing to tell 674 there are degrees of willingness to talk to the auditor you cant expect pc who is unwilling to talk to you to tell you some big overt once you have the comm line in the pc will be able to tell you as much as he himself can confront which will increase the more he tells you people can generally confront thought more easily than they can confront masses or things so on the pe course stick to definitions of things like life or body not necessarily even definitions of scientology terms you can blow tons of charge with nothing but definitions dont get into heavy bank stuff use light gradient definitions about thoughts are easier for people to grasp than definitions of masses if someone cant see the data that you are giving him he cant apply it and he flies up to the top floor of the building adds complexities to the data and then considers that it is complex and that there is fundamental there so he invents bunch of nonsense with regard to it misses it entirely and never gets any result with it so be careful about gradients in training the student has to be able to see and apply what you are talking about what you want to watch for in pc is glibness unreal answers and comm lag trying to find gradient to enter in on with that fellow is fantastic because he is already stuck in the top floor but unreal the gradient had better be low slow approach you have to find something about the case that you can grasp then go ahead the time to start looking for something in the case that you can grasp is when the case gets into some difficulty some lack of advance undercut the case on the basis of ability if you undercut on the basis of sanity you may insult the pc find out what the pc can really do and get him to do it better when pc doesnt advance find lower gradient find something about the pc that you can grasp the next time you feel queasy about pulling pcs overts look the situation over do you have comm line there to pull the overts on when you do the next stage is what could the guy himself confront approach the pc gradiently with questions like what have you done and why wasnt that an overt you have to keep the comm line in while pulling the overts by pulling them gradiently you can err by asking the pc for more overt than he himself can confront having done as long as you are asking for overts he can confront the comm line will stay in and your manner wont even matter asking for things that he cant confront only restimulates him it is not matter of politeness when we pick up points in the gradient of living that the person has bypassed and gotten stuck on and get him to understand them we call this clearing at those points the pc had wrong answers or omissions when those are cleared up he can confront and live life easily dont be so dedicated to the gradient that you fail to observe when someone climbs it very fast as can happen complicating factor that hasnt been recognized is peoples prior education or knowledge of some area or activity this is generally explained as natural talent or knack you can get mistaken ideas about the difficulty of auditing or about your ability to audit when the real problem is only that of approaching the case on the right gradient it is trebly important to train students on the right gradient so that people can win at it and know that they can do it and keep on doing it 675 l ron hubbard type 3 idate131064 volnum2 issue42 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec42 cycles of action 6410c13 shspec42 cycles of action the importance relative value or worth assigned to datum is as important as the datum this is evaluation of importances cycles of action are fundamental of which one must be aware there is particular crisis relating to this topic except insofar as auditors have been failing to get their questions answered we are talking about cycle in the sense that wheel going around and coming back to the same place is cycle the word cycle has picked up some odd connotations as in the modern short story which tries to give an appearance of nochange by starting and ending in the same place in the same mood in the field of mechanics cycle is total revolution in physics and engineering cycle is the motion between the end of one wave and the end of the next wave ie the motion during one wavelength there is an old definition of cycle that has more to do with what we are talking about that is philosophical concept that doesnt involve the word cycle this concept is found in the hymn to the dawn child in the vedas it expresses that there is nothingness from which comes something that grows matures decays and returns to nebulosity and nothingness johann templehof went to india and got people from krishnamurtis group interested in scientology this annoyed krishnamurti the concept of the cycle of action gives us lots of applicable wisdom cycle of action is plot of consecutive incident against time from r6 we know that time is commonlyheld consideration it is big gpm with lot of rootwords with an endword time connected to them it is an agreedupon progress that we are all making and moving forward in view of the fact that we are all in present time since there is nowhere else to be and that we dont really move in time the incident as it goes forward appears to be plotted against time it is the incident that makes the time old humanoids have time because little happens and there is future kids days are interminable because lot happens you could boil this down to tolerance of incident it is ones tolerance for incidents that give one the impression of time going fast or slow when person has an increase in his tolerance for incident life seems to slow down if you measure time by the amount of incident occurring and then didnt have any incident you wouldnt have any time it is not that the more incident the more time you have necessarily you are dealing with false commodity for one thing and for another thing how much time you have depends on the consideration of whether lot of incident makes lot of time or little time you can practically monitor how much time you have by your consideration of how busy you want to be sometimes there gets to be too much incident so there gets to be not enough time you can manufacture time by deciding that you can confront being busier its the consideration of how much incident makes how much time that gives or subtracts time from ones existence it is how much you decide that you can tolerate or confront if you have the consideration that you can be busier or that you have enough time to do something you can and will you can consider time long or short and it will be you can also get up to point where you consider time long or short without measuring it against incident you could get high enough toned to consider that evening was couple of years away and live couple of years before evening since you would thus be out of agreement with other beings it would seem that to do this you would have to have considerable tolerance for being alone for long periods of time 676 the three actually five different attitudes towards time here are 1 unconscious 2 incident monitors the persons time here the person is at the total effect of time and he is habituated to incident monitoring his time but it is certain speed of incident that he is used to having monitor his life when the pace changes he gets reverse consideration the person never affects changes or even considers the incidents this is homo sapiens 3 person monitors time by willingness to confront incident here at the state of release the person considers one of two things if i get busy time goes faster b if i do nothing time will go faster the first of these two considerations is commonest here the being gets the idea that he can monitor time by his willingness to confront incident he can change his own pace by changing incident 4 person just postulates time this occurs around level vi here the persons considerations about time alone determine the amount of time he has he doesnt have to depend on exterior incident to consider whether much or little time goes by he can make party last long time if he wants to 5 pandetermined time at the level of ot the being might have pandetermined attitude towards time which would monitor the time of others as with sleeping beauty mesmerism provides lowerscale example of similar phenomenon with mesmerism you can put someone into total rapport where he feels and thinks the feelings and thoughts of the person who has him mesmerized the mesmerizer can pinch his own back and the mesmerized person will leap convulsively and have fingernail marks on his back this is form of physical pandeterminism it is quite unethical to do this on some poor sap who has only shred of selfdeterminism left but it is lower harmonic of the upperlevel pandeterminism over time to considerations about how much time is passing you could add other considerations like the consideration that the actions people are engaged in are happinessproducing actions in an area where such consideration had been made everyone would think he was doing fine you could also have the opposite consideration that the actions people are engaged in are miseryproducing actions in this case people would feel as though they were committing overts by acting this would change peoples considerations of time the main culprit in doing this is the newspaper which puts out this consideration by reporting only bad news on pandetermined basis but using very lowgrade finite comm line the newspapers are spreading the idea of worthless series of incidents this makes time worthless to people if society depends lot on whether they feel their cycle of action should or shouldnt proceed this consideration will do something to time and to the amount of doingness 677 an action is simply motion through space having certain speed especially volitional or intended motion it has bad name in some quarters eg in literature or psychology in civil defense during crises any individual in action during an atomic attack would be put out of action local authority who is supposed to act is not being the idea is there must be action intended motion the prevention of motion is fairly prevalent in mental healing the psychiatrist thinks that someone is cured when he becomes inactive person who has label and who is active must be restrained in mysticism the wise or enlightened person is supposed to be totally motionless people would like to believe this if they are scared of ots the mystical mystic is case type he is reasonable but he wont act so the idea of time and whether incidents or action should occur gets messed up action has become dirty word you get an insane generality here the attitude that incidents should take place or lots of incidents should take place below this you get its all going on and theres nothing i can do about it its all happening to it has nothing to do with this is the sign of civilization on the decline even the person who says it has nothing to do with has to admit that it does have something to do with him when he is driven to it if you approach him closely enough with action and you will get cornered rat effect then you get an uncontrolled response like barroom brawl action gets bad connotation because it can produce destruction and pain when people cannot confront pain they are also refusing to confront action and when this happens they cease to confront incident and they wont advance cycle of action and their sense of time goes out by telling sick people to stay quiet doctors are prolonging the time for them telling them to have activity of some sort would make time pass more quickly this has remarkable effect on healing where more action is demanded of person than he can confront pugnacity sets in so you get destructive action which is more action than anyone can confront as with hitler who created too much action this gives people the false idea that the cycle of action always ends in decay and death because this is what it looks like in the physical universe it is here that we depart from the cycle of action depicted in the hymn of the dawn child we are taught this on every hand you have so many examples of cycles of action that end in death and disaster that you get reluctant to complete cycle of action this leads to such foolish ideas as i mustnt complete cycle of action on the pc because it will injure him this is the worry of an auditor who never completes auditing cycles that is what keeps people from arriving they are afraid to get to the final point or there could be something wrong with the persons considerations of cycle or action confrontation of incident may be low for instance some auditors cant confront too rapidly changing pc or too slowly changing pc this could lead to overrun if one cant confront changing the process or underrun if one thinks that completing cycles of action means killing pcs any of these difficulties with the cycle of action means trouble with the auditing cycle one way or another if an auditors comm cycle is out after he is up the line bit then this is why it is not the complexity of the process the auditor has to have his auditing cycle in for sure by the time he is auditing r6 678 there are 1 considerations of cycles 2 considerations of action 3 considerations of cycles of actions in scientology cycle of action is simply from the beginning to the end of an intended action ie the start of the cycle of action would be the first appearance of the intention to do something or of the intention to begin doing it now you can also have an otherdetermined definition of cycle of action from the moment mother looks at to where she whips the selfdetermined cycle of action is from the beginning to the end of an intentional action the way to take care of trouble with the cycle of action is itsa on its elements l ron hubbard type 3 idate201064 volnum2 issue43 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec43 levels the reasons for them 6410c20 shspec43 levels the reasons for them lrh had cognition khrushchev was overthrown because russia went into compulsive duplication of great britain and the us and tried to hold an election the term raw meat applies to 1 lack of processing 2 the pcs opinion of what he is someone who has actually started on r6 must not be returned to clearing or getting definitions audited etc he is sitting in an item and could pick up some other item out of sequence some endword that is out of sequence this could give him nasty somatics so there are solid technical reasons why pcs progress up the levels the original reason for levels was to stretch auditors out to what they were capable of it became obvious that pcs didnt gain well when run above their level despite their eagerness to be run on r6 the reason why john campbell parted company with lrh was his devotion to the machine he thought the ideal civilization was machines tending machines people who consider that they can formulate infallible plans for utopia dont think that people should have power of choice since it disrupts the utopian plans but the ideal plan has hardly been found on the political front as one can see in any newspaper furthermore since absolutes are unobtainable the ideal state will never be achieved beings are not all alike so who could judge when perfection had been attained you would never get complete agreement man is capable of his own judgment this alone keeps the absolute from being attained for instance what is the perfect piece of music all the way down the line the individual never completely loses his individuality integrity to himself is the last resort of thetan the individual can only be pushed so far richmond kelly turner commanded the uss astoria cruiser in world war ii he was captain blightype guy very grim lrh knew him maybe the source of mr roberts nothing on the astoria worked the crew was on white mutiny in which the crew acts only under direct orders takes initiative and executes nothing that is needed unless directly ordered to do exactly that that was their way of getting even thetan never gives up russia is one big white mutiny it is not that there is anything wrong with having rules and having people comply with them what is wrong is using duress continually to deny people any judgment or initiative with regard to the rules 679 the gradient of ability relative to rules is 1 doesnt obey rules because he doesnt know them 2 total adherence to rules based on understanding of them 3 varying the rules based on higher understanding what gets interesting and can get troublesome is when you follow the rules with variations if you are trying to learn some subject follow plan or something there are two conditions that are variation from the must do it 1 total ignorance and rebellion based on aberration 2 skill and judgment enough to know which rules can be varied and how this latter condition is reached when you know the game all the way around the amateur tries to find the perfect instrument to do it the pro knows how to make use of what hes got and the rules in order to vary the rules successfully you have to know the rules cold otherwise you will fail because you are operating out of ignorance and rebellion lrh tells an anecdote about an old chinese carpenter who resists using guard on his band saw he knows what he is doing youve got to earn the right to vary the rules in life or in auditing in confronting variation from the rules the manager supervisor or whoever has to be able to differentiate between the two sources of variation ignorance or familiarity if he doesnt judgment is denied the individual who could exercise it and the supervisor gets into trouble are you dealing with ignorance or virtuosity you can enforce the rule against the person who varies it for the first reason with impunity because life is assisting you by punishing stupidity and ignorance anyway but dont shoot the second type of variation down this person has earned the right to vary the rule whether the person knows his business or not can be seen from his results if he is consistently getting results and protests the rules we can see that he is virtuoso if he is consistently unable to get results he needs more rules not less since his departure from the rules doesnt get good results the only way you will progress is over his dead body but he never dies so you cant win using force and duress against ignorance you must educate on the other hand if you combat virtuosity instead of ignorance and you create leaders for revolution that will unseat you the people who have been exported to this planet all fall into two and only two classes 1 rebellious geniuses 2 stupid criminals there is inbetween the latter rebel destructively and stupidly the former rebel intelligently they give trouble to the stupid state which thinks that it has the perfect answer one gives reactive trouble and the other gives intelligent selfdetermined trouble you had better recognize the difference between the two when you try to handle selfdetermined intelligent trouble with force this is handling thought with mass and it doesnt handle well since power of choice is the main power the person has so use duress on the former but never on the latter all protest is not the former exclusively our question in scientology is why should some people stay debased stupid and protesting 680 becoming an ot has to do with power of choice and power of observation therefore wave of magic wand will produce an ot since it would just be another effect on the person buddha tried to wave magic wand and produces slaves horrible example of postulate gone wrong the asia minor ot jc who turned leaves into loaves and fishes or whatever just impressed everyone to the point that they are still overwhumped this is probably not what he intended the unpopularity of scientology levels comes from an unfamiliarity with the road to be walked youve got to get the guy to where he can talk to an auditor enough and tolerate control enough and be keyed out enough from the mass that he is sitting in and under enough discipline to confront the objects in the bank necessary to run out to resolve his case that may take quite awhile the easiest thing to do is to unburden the case by getting locks off you do this by 1 handling the auditing environment first you unburden the session then get the pc educated into what he is supposed to do and willing to talk to the auditor you have to explain this to him and show him the auditing comm cycle get what auditing is over to the pc this is getting the pc sessionable lrh invents the term sessionable 2 handling the betweensessions environment preparation handle ptps at first just by finding out what they are before actually auditing them we can ask the pc what the parts of his environment are cf expanded dianetics this alone helps him to sort out his problems it gives some gain get the pc to straighten out his environment so he is not sitting in his office with his house right outside the window while he is in the auditing room this is not auditing the environment it is just getting the pc to identify its parts at this point you dont want his problems with his job you just want his job named as part of his environment you are getting him sessionable which might take several sessions b auditing then you ask the pc for problems with the parts of the environment mentioned above find one that his attention is stuck on ask him what communication he hasnt completed to those terminals you handle problems very lightly but wind up with the period between sessions being clean enough so that it doesnt keep coming up at the start of each new session again this may take several sessions 3 beginning approach to the bank now we are going into the pcs past and future in 1 and 2 above we were broadening the perimeters of the pc we continue this now by beginning to handle the pcs past and future helping him to orient himself better we could run give something that happened in the past with date and place this does the same for the pcs past environment that you have done for his present environment at what is now level i you begin arc 681 straightwire orienting the pc to his past repetitive processes if the pc gets to this point he can be audited easily 4 clay table healing using this you can straighten out the concern that the pc has about the body 5 on up the levels in completing the levels you are handling locks on gpms so they get all straightened out ready for r6 someone who hasnt been brought up through the levels isnt ready for r6 and will get into trouble l ron hubbard type 3 idate271064 volnum2 issue44 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec44 the failed case 6410c27 shspec44 the failed case the book of case remedies handles the failed case look up the symptoms and handle as directed but there is one case that will always be failed case the reason lies not with the auditor scientology or the tech in 1954 lrh researched people who had turned against dianetics and scientology to find the common denominator he found about twentyone people who had been in dianetics and scientology but had worked against it and caused lot of trouble seventeen of the twentyone had criminal records also they had had auditing but had gotten case change there might have been twentyone for twentyone but lrh got tired of looking after seventeen recently lrh found out the other factor in the totally failed case the totally failed case commits more overts between sessions in pt than can be picked up in session he is the continuous pt overts case he doesnt asis things well he takes long time to get at anything he takes responsibility for anything he is hard to get in comm with etc in freudian terms he is the detached case dissociative reaction schizoid personality he admits to fantastic crimes but doesnt really consider he did them he is really saying society forced to commit or my hand stole the watch etc he says i picked up the pocket book but means my hand picked up the pocket book such case cant asis the overt because there is lie in his statement of it it is incomplete he says my hand stole the watch but the correct statement is i saw the watch and stole it with my hand he has put an alteris on the line he didnt do it it happened then there is the guy who is putting up social front and never admits anything he has done because he doesnt want to look bad to the auditor this is partly matter of getting in good comm line you can get real overts off the case by asking for horrendously exaggerated overts like have you murdered any little children lately it is trick for another gradient you can ask what are you willing to talk to about you can audit all the sexual overts off the case that you like without restimulating gpms because sex is not in the gpms or endwords as such though it forms locks on gpm endwords and rootwords sex is humanoid activity and the gpm words dont necessarily refer to humanoid activities 682 but the real failed case commits so many overts in pt you dont have time in session to get them all off the failed case is continually committing real pt overts he is so irresponsible that the overts dont react on the meter because they are just not potentially real to him the source of small reads in r6 is running the pc where he isnt which means leaving bpc where he is if he is getting reads on any list you are using to correct this situation either the items on the lists are unreal because hes got reality on gpms being totally uneducated or hes got it all suppressed if you are running prepcheck on pc and he runs out of answers on button eg suppress dont push him on that button just because you are getting ta on it you will just restimulate the rest of the buttons ta action in prepcheck is on the process ie the whole prepcheck not on the button you happen to be running at the moment if the prepcheck is not flat when you reach the end of the buttons go through it again i know of auditing action where pc who has been getting proper ta action in the session who says i dont have any more answers to it has ever had any further answers to it there are indicators in the physical appearance and meter behavior of the pc who is running ow that there are more answers than he is willing to give only in this case do you press the question home this is not applicable to ptps withheld ptps wont hurt the pc they will only be withheld if they are connected to an overt and you will get that on ow buttons so watch out for overrun the slowest rate of change in pc is at the start of the case the case that is winning accelerates in rate of change as you audit it up the line cognitions of given magnitude come faster comm lag decreases so you have to be careful not to overrun the pc the failed case however doesnt change at all you can check rate of change of case by checking to see how many hours it takes for person to have fundamental cog of some kind at first perhaps it takes 25 hours later perhaps it only takes an hour then you get the person who audits almost by inspection the increased rate of cognition goes along with decrease in the comm lag another thing you will notice is the pcs physical posture and mannerisms if there is change in these over time if the pc keeps returning to posture or mannerism then he is not experiencing rate of change of progress another bad indicator in this respect is when nonoptimum condition persists when you see that you know that the case needs remedying the other bad indicators would be there too as an auditing supervisor you should expect to see some change within few days one way to spot what overts the failed case is committing between sessions is to listen for what he complains of in others the way you would handle the failed case would be to extend your zone of influence to include everywhere the case goes between sessions for long enough to prevent the continuous overts long enough to pull the pc out of it this would be very thoroughgoing solution and change but it is about all you could do you do what you can there is fast process to undercut the case either the furthest south process you could use to benefit the case would be justifications but you still have to get comm line established first 683 commoner than the continuous pt overt case is the person who continually committed overts in the past and has this in restimulation the case that has lots of past overts but isnt doing them in pt is easier to handle the proper approach to this case is 1 get in comm with the pc 2 get more and more overts on gentle gradient if the case keeps getting off the same overt it has become problem as far as the mechanics of it go problem is postulatecounterpostulate therefore it floats in time this is problem about the overt it wasnt an overt in his view it was justified so in this situation you can use 1 what have you done 2 how have you justified it or 3 how wasnt that an overt this is not repetitive process ask what have you done that was harmful act and really get an answer that both of you agree was real overt this is not repetitive question it is one question that might take 25 hours of arguing back and forth about what is an overt etc chitterchat to get answered when youve got it then ask how was that not an overt and keep going on that one for as long as it takes to really get that answered you want to get what he really thought was unharmful about it why he really had to do it at the end of this process he will really cog dont run these two questions as repetitive process it can take long time to get them answered you are asking the questions right into the guts of aberration you are not going up on it on some gradient hoping some accident will occur you are going right down the center of the road after something that answered that question an unchanging condition comes from postulatecounterpostulate so an overt which created or sought to solve an obsessive problem hangs in time and becomes both an overt act and ptp most overts are committed as solutions this gives you another inroad to the case that keeps committing pt overts handle the overt as ptp that the pc is trying to solve you could find out what ptp are you trying to solve with overts or what have you done recently that was pretty antisocial then what problem were you trying to solve by doing that it would be an oddball problem the trouble with such case is that you are likely only to get bunch of motivators repetitive questions dont work if the question you ask the pc or his answer to it isnt real to him the fact that the pc is out of comm with you makes finding the ptp that the pcs overt is intended to solve uncertain of result however on ordinary cases it works very well to find what ptp the guy is trying to solve with his overts and doing so blows lots of overts into view that the pc might never otherwise have suspected not all overts are efforts to solve problems some are accidental some are out of misunderstoods getting the justifications off unlocks the problem aspect takes lot of locks off etc the pc will cognite on the problem and the effect can sometimes be magical none of the above will work with truly failed case type although it may sometimes nudge such case the only thing you can do with the failed case is to restrain him somehow from committing overts long enough to get him audited long enough so that he will quit committing the continuous pt overts 684 l ron

of 1964 skullbuster of up to 18 hours day on the meter this resulted in the material necessary to get someone running on r6 then he saw that the low end of what was to become the grade chart the bridge was starting to get unreal to him he was beginning to pass out of any interest in levels 0iv he was understanding peoples insanity so well that he was just asising everything left right and center he didnt have to do anything about it it was beginning to look silly to him he noted this attitude growing in him he realized that this was not ok that bridge from level 0 to level vi had to be put together this project was completed in the period from april to november of 1964 with the book of case remedies clay table healing and clay table clearing during that period of wrapup lrh realized that the subject of study and education has to be clarified and improved so that the material that he had researched could be communicated study tech started from the viewpoint of what material should be communicated and how it should be communicated lrh never published his notes for this project and he has twice lost and found them all this is why lrh hasnt himself gone totally ot and departed the other recent work that lrh has done has been setting out organizational programming as laid out in recent policies it is based on selling books as dissemination tool the money received from selling books and more importantly memberships goes into sealed account for book advertising the more books are sold the more students and pcs will come in names of book buyers who havent come into the org in three to four months are sent to local franchiseholders they can longer teach hqs unless they become city offices for description of city offices see p 300 above so they will become city offices at which time they will have book accounts this is all based on the idea of pyramiding by 1968 r6 should be getting taught in central orgs training at saint hill would be purely organizational the has course is now one week of pe plus thirty to forty nights of more theory on how it is basic data there will be book of pe lectures with words defined etc the pe evening has one period of reading the text one period of discussing the words with attention to people who have earlier misunderstood words or subjects etc and third period in which the students write up whatever examples of what was in the text that they can give from life this gives quiet people chance to say something the pe textbook covers the whole field of ontology very thoroughly this is applied philosophy that is how you can describe scientology to people your advertising for the pe course is just that people can learn how to get along better in life than they have been people are generally aware that they can get along better the philosophy of man is an animal is saying there is nobody there to do anything about anything how can cell cure cell the book that the pe students are being taught from is available for them to have and read the phenomenon of getting more and more out of lrhs writings each time you reread them instead of going into boredom is only true of fairly searching truths and material in which new thought matter can be found it is not true of books that arent designed around the provocation of thought people go into agreement instead of boredom 685 public presence is created it is not natural lrh also intends to write book telling students and how to study and teach what they are studying and teaching how to handle slow students etc that would answer all academic questions with regard to scientology it would be textbook on study and if it worked for education it would give ue stable datum that some part of scientology worked showing that it is workable subject the only trouble that lrh is having with this project is making the textbook complicated enough for college professors to respect it and use it these people look down on things that are easily understood things like awe and reverence shouldnt be mixed in with education i know that if college professor sees something simply phrased in its totality of simplicity then he will immediately relegate it to the first grade teacher i know better than to use prerogative when i mean right but the professor absolutely dies if he doesnt have an adverbial clause modifying participial phrase of some character which syntaxes itself to death people have the idea that there are certain poses and pretences and styles that are necessary however when you enter falsity into subject it may endure longer but it wont work right if something isnt running right or is overly hard to handle there is lie connected with it if the pcs ptp keeps hanging up and ot handling despite your correct attempts to handle it you can be sure that there is lie connected with it either the pc isnt hung up in ptp or the ptp being put forward by him is known and outrageous lie or it is continuing to be ptp because the pc has told someone some falsehoods connected with it we cannot asis it because it doesnt have in it what it is supposed to have in it anyhow the problem is how much lrh will concede to the professors in order to get the comm line and study tech in without going into too much falsity book of policies is also being published which will help to ensure that organizational expansion can occur in an orderly fashion early on some guys thought that scientology was business where you made lot of bucks scientology is an activity which if done well gives you the additional embarrassment of getting rid of money lrh used to amuse himself at parties by telling peoples fortunes by looking at their banks wearing bath towel on his head with woolworth diamond you cant observe the pc without occupying the viewpoint of the

another style of auditing between level 0 and level 2 see hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing it is version of guiding style without repetitive commands it is guiding style that goes into itsa coffeeshop style lrh is talking about guiding secondary style here this is outlined in hcob 12nov64 scientology ii pc level 0iv definition processes p 2 you can herd pcs into line by multiple acknowledgment the styles of auditing parallel the return of selfdeterminism to the auditor progression upwards through the styles of auditing goes along with an increase in the auditors ability to occupy viewpoint and therefore observe the error in training is to demand more of the lowerlevel auditor than he can possibly deliver eg having level 0 auditor finding out from the pc what is troubling him before having him talk about it listen style is the hardest for the instructor to judge and at first for the student to do because it is so simple that the student adds all sorts of complexities you must adjust your supervision to this simplicity there are three actually six barriers to case improvement 1 ptps 2 ptps ld 3 overts and withholds 4 overts and withholds ld 5 arc breaks 6 arc breaks lb these are potentially present in any session at any level we dont try to handle them at level 0 and 1 they come into action at level ii with the things given in the book of case remedies the woof and warp of any case is composed of certain mental makeup of combination of chronic or continuous nature in any pc there is chronic case messup then you have those things that keep the basic aberrations from unraveling these are the things that keep the case from being entered and that prevent the pc from being in session given that he does have an auditor any of these things can be chronic or immediate continuous or temporary an overt act will go into action only when restraint is put on it in the form of some sort of withhold the person becomes guilty etc since you have to have secrecy you have to have censure and with censure there is need for secrecy when being doesnt think an action is good he goes into being made guilty hence the overtmotivator sequence hence the connection between the feeling of guilt and on the one hand feeling that one has done wrong and on the other hand the feeling that one will be punished the overt is prior to the withhold you should classify overt withhold and missed withhold processes all under overts there are lots of things to know about overts and lots of processes for running them the present existence of problem is worse than its problematic nature the ptps floatingness in time is what is peculiar to it and what makes it get in the way of auditing it was looking at the ptp that got lrh into discovering gpms on politicalphilosophical level the problem appears as dialectical materialism which says that force vs force produces ideas dialectical materialism is making philosophy of and deifying the problem although dialectical materialism says that force vs force produces ideas it is actually the other way round since actually idea vs idea produces force the idea that force makes 687 ideas is just an expression of the man from mud theory if neither postulate of problem overcomes the other force accumulates on them and the forces will counteroppose if they are in balance they will hang up in time only those problems that are held in this delicate balance hang up and become ptps to get rid of problem one postulate or the other must give way if one side can overbalance the other the problem slips and doesnt remain ptp past problems may be solved by overbalancing without really being resolved these may still exist in the past but they are not floating up to pt ptps still have an exact balance on both sides the cold war of russia vs the us has slipped since the idea of coexistence crept into the ussr if as an auditor you realize that not every problem needs to be handled but only the ones that are so delicately balanced your job will seem easier since there have been lots of problems in thetans whole existence the balance is actually so delicate that any little nudge will change it and let it slip away you sometimes see pc struggling to hold onto ptp that has been way of life after the auditor has knocked it off its pins the pc has still got tremendous accumulated forces involved in its solution routine is something you use to change an aspect of the pcs case it always works unless there is ptp overt or arc break in the way an arc break is actually tickling of some major restimulation of something in r6 list 1 is adequate to key it out it is direct shortcircuit into the bank there are actually very few things in chronic restimulation in the bank the primary one is difficulties with communication that is the primary endword that gets into restimulation there is real reason why anyone should communicate with anyone about anything when you run recall time you communicated you are actually running 268 gpms all at once so wonder the pc feels better afterwards and when something goes wrong with your comm cycle that upsets the pc exactly what the pc does at that point is probably the rootword when you quiet it down by locating and indicating the bpc you just drop it back to its former status you havent done anything for the pcs case but you have made him auditable the big buttons in the bank are 1 communication 2 time 3 havingness these things like time problems and bits of items like havingness are the things that are in chronic restimulation but the aberrative value of havingness compared to communication and time is miniscule communication is way back on the series communication and time are in restimulation all the time or for one thing there wouldnt be any time that is one reason why waiting is so upsetting that means that you go after arc breaks with feather touch to key them out dont audit them or you will mess the pc up by keying in communication harder knowing that these three phenomena are what keep case from being audited keeps you from being confused by all the possible manifestations which do in fact boil down to these categories ptps ow and arc breaks the pc can be troublesome case trouble source because he has someone on the other side of him who doesnt want him to improve he will try to get better to prove the other person wrong which gives him ptp resulting in case gain 688 overts carry lot of different reactions depending on things like the persons responsibility level they are source of change not fixedness in case the case shifts does well at times gets sporadic results etc the pc wont let himself get any better he has odd computations like the idea that if he gets strong he might commit overts you would get the same manifestation of rollercoaster gain in pts condition if there is someone in the persons environment who keeps knocking him down whenever he gets better the mechanism is withhold when person has tremendous number of overts that remain constant he is trying to solve problem with overts that is the usual reason for the overts the overt can be on the part of the person or of society over the course of an intensive or longer cycle you have to get sufficient gain to get the pc up high enough so that the gates dont get closed in your face by his committing more overts before you get to audit him again the reason the psychiatrist damages people is that his problem is that of preventing people from damaging other people your problem then would be social problem in dealing with the continuous pt overt case you would have to solve this problem before you could make progress with the case the nochange overt case goes up and down little unlike the ptp case the pc may refrain from committing overts for awhile so overts cause change on graphs constantly but not steadily with fluctuating graph you could also be facing pts situation the main problem relating to overts is whether the pc will be damaged by motivators running overts can backfire if you let the pc get off only wholetrack overts because they are safe or miniscule overts critical thoughts etc such pc is dodging continuous pt chain of overts the pc with continual outrud is arc breaky if you try to get him to put his attention elsewhere because when you take his attention away from the charge of the outrud it hits him hes got to have it remedied before he can be run on routine fortunately not all pcs need much remedying the book of case remedies is basically just batch of methods for putting in ruds you can be as nice as you want about pulling withholds but remember that it must be done and that fact may put you beyond niceness once in awhile eg you might have to say something like ok come back for some more auditing when you have decided to tell what you have done thats lfing l ron hubbard type 3 idate171164 volnum2 issue47 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec47 styles of auditing 6411c17 shspec47 styles of auditing reference hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing getting the different auditing styles clarified and formalized will make learning to audit easier over the years many auditing styles have developed to deliver different processes repetitive commands came in in 195556 along with trs muzzled auditing followed to handle auditors who messed up pcs with interruptions comments etc more recently with lrhs work on the comm cycle and the discovery that auditors werent really listening listen style was developed for prepchecking and sec checking where you steer the pc around another style was developed guiding style now that we have all the processes all the styles are there in order of developing an auditors skill as he goes up the levels the higher you go the more precise your auditing is but also the higher you go the more sloppy your auditing may look 689 at the level of r6 the pc is going through so much and changing so fast that the auditor has to be able to shift and change rapidly in order to keep up with the pc and his mind and in order to do just what is necessary to keep the pc running down the bank pc has to be up aways to be able to have allstyle auditing for the pc to be up to standing allstyle auditing would require high level of confidence in auditors and acquaintance with different styles of auditing so the unpredictability of allstyle auditing would throw the pc off if this was the first style he had encountered auditing the pc at lower levels would give him more certainty if you ran r6 on raw meat you might get away with it but the first mess you got into would be the end of the pc hes got confidence in auditing and reliance on scientologys ability to handle ptps to fix him or rescue him etc there is case factor also preventing new pc from being audited on r6 the worse off someone is the more important he is and the more exaggerated his ideas of his ability are hes got hidden standards outconfront etc etc there isnt much you could do if you put the pc on r6 and he spun so dont do it you are making yourself the effect of his bank most people start their auditing in total desperation in fear of going out the bottom getting up to the point where they know that they wont get any worse release is major improvement it doesnt necessarily take long time to do this you might tend to overrun the pc unless you observe well and note the acceleration of gain that occurs dont cut off pc cogs furthermore you are handling level of case that is voluntarily trying to improve which means that there is some spark of responsibility for selfimprovement and some idea that the person can do something about it people can go so far downscale that they think nothing can be done about anything then you get socialist or communist state to take care of them one reason why governments call scientology fake is that they have the opinion that nothing can be done and scientology is claiming that it can do something through pcs course of auditing we must keep the pc winning so that self at cause keeps coming up it is easier to make someone better than to make him worse he resists getting worse but doesnt resist getting better when he realizes that he can and must do something to get better and that he will not get worse be will be release the auditing styles can be plotted against the most likely win for the pc at given stage of his auditing how you audit pc is at least as important as what you audit just the mechanics of auditing are therapeutic regardless of the process they are applied to first the pc discovers that he can talk to someone then he discovers that he can answer question when he is asked one there is some 8c in this that is beneficial as well as duplication which he has fallen away from he cant be anything because he cant duplicate anything unless you have gotten someone out of this kind of condition he cant confront existence thetan can only be what he can see he can only see what he can duplicate it is hard to get duplication of an accident or crime because person cant be it therefore he cant see it this leads to slight occupational liability as an auditor you are looking at pc all the time that you dont particularly want to be youre trying to improve him arent you fortunately it isnt necessary for you to be willing to be aberrated to get well because we have the whole anatomy of the reactive bank and 690 there is sense in it if the pc hadnt made the reactive mind and the gpms he would be virtually unaberratable there would be dwindling spiral because the thetan would have to determine to have something wrong with him thetan had to decide to be aberrated he did it but almost accidentally having done it he was too stupid to get out of his trap there are different degrees of aberration based on the locks and the tendency of the reactive mind to group bunch up and get into restimulation there are some basic things that can go wrong with thetan which are above the level of the bank and gpms these include duplication and communication duplication and communication can be aberrated regardless of endwords there are endwords there too but these are highlevel ideas common to all thetans with or without banks pc should be able to communicate and duplicate pretty well they do improve up to the point where he can confront his bank at level 0 the pc knows that he has communicated because the auditor received the communication at level i the pc knows he has received communication because he has answered it and the auditor is satisfied with the fact that he has answered the communication if the auditor lets the pc receive communication or question that he doesnt answer the pc is unsatisfied because knowing that he didnt answer the question he starts doubting his ability to receive communication at this level he finds that not only can he answer question but also he can answer it repetitively this is big change for many people when pc can answer question repetitively that is even better than just being able to answer question that is why we say i will repeat the auditing command see abridged style below guiding style at this level we are handling the pcs finding out that there is something there to the pc the whole world is reasonless he is starting out at lower harmonic of the truth namely that there is nothing there and that he has reason to be upset about anything he says i feel nervous today and sees cause for it the biggest cog here is that there are causes for things for one thing he will realize that he is not just natively stupid or that life doesnt have to be mess something could be causing the condition he is in the pc needs to get the idea that conditions dont just happen but are caused by things and that be is longer just pawn if things cause things you might be able to predict if things cause things you might be able to do something about something if things cause things you might be able to do something about yourself guiding secondary style this comes out of guiding style auditing steer plus itsa is the process that goes with it you find it and bleed it remedy and b level ii locates causes without knowing the cause person is dispersed all over the universe finding the cause and then doing something about it is terrific abridged style when he has learned all that it is safe to run him on an abridged style we can look and see what is going on the reason why at levels i and ii you always say ill repeat the auditing question when the pc hasnt answered it is that you are teaching the pc that he can receive and answer an auditing question at level iii this is not necessary anymore and it may be irritating to the pc he already knows that he can get the command so you have abridged style in which the auditor and the pc can look and see what is going on this is an abridgement of lower not upper styles the pc says he has ptp you dont guide him 691 into it you just ask what is it it usually blows so you then drop it the pc can asis things more easily now you audit purely against finite result to the point of getting to happen what you want to have happen and further the pc learns that when he gets audited something happens direct style now weve got direct style auditing getting the exact result applies even more here you go direct to the result l ron hubbard type 3 idate151264 volnum2 issue49 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec49 communication gradient on duplication 6412c15 shspec49 communication gradient on duplication level 0 and level i are laid out and the materials exist for levels ii iii iv and vi see hcopl 11dec64 full table of courses and classifications the pe course is back down below level 0 and the has course is in the academy with strict curriculum it includes axioms and other bits and pieces hqs is what old hcahpa was when you go all the way to the top it is then very easy to see what lies between you and the bottom that is what has happened mow we can see what an auditor has to go through and achieve to get all the way up unnecessary parts of training have been eliminated without leaving gaps that people could fall into you can tend to discount how much auditing you have had when you get up near the top that would be one reason why you would think you could take new pc and run him at once on r6 thinking that he is where you are as case when he isnt person who is perfect and has problems 1 is very delicate 2 commits overts the case who never finds anything to audit because he is perfect must be audited very delicately person may get full complement of motivators from something yet still assert that is was right if such person were to admit to or confront single little fault ie give up service fac it would be to him the final degradation he is very overty but he is at point where if he admitted that he had ever done anything wrong he would slip over the edge of degradation that he has been clinging to and start asserting his rightness by being even wronger like kid breaking windows who keeps on doing it trying to assert the rightness of what he is doing manifest insanity is confirmation of an error you have to increase the cases responsibility by series of steps the only trouble you have had with pcs has come from not going up through the steps necessary to keep the pc winning getting gains that are real to the pc the book of case remedies is the totality of level ii overts and ptps but the pc has to be gotten up to the point where he can be run on the processes in the book of case remedies there are certain things senior to the bank on which thetan would be able to be aberrated whether he had bank or not though without bank the thetan could get unaberrated again without auditing the design of the bank is what gives the thetan the dwindling spiral but if thetan werent aberrated and had designed reactive mind he could determine to spin in on spiral now that he has that skill because he has done it but he couldnt have realized how much trouble he would get into he is capable of miscalculating which is fascinating ability to have the thetan is natively capable of getting into more trouble than he can see thetan is capable of having these things happen or 692 making things happen to himself he is capable of setting up masses to suspend in time the masses gpms create time but it is difficult for thetan to aberrate himself to such degree that he cant recover the only way he could recover is to block out duplication cf the axioms that which you dont asis will endure forever if thetan is unwilling to duplicate something it will endure the only way thetan can erase something is to be willing to duplicate it eg if you are unwilling to be like person you will get madder and madder at the person to the point where he will disappear not by being asised but because you cant see him anymore he is still there thus you have universe thetan is nothing and he is unwilling to be something so you get masses and they endure because the thetan wont asis them so he makes bank which tells him what he should and shouldnt be willing to duplicate this bank had two halves 1 the cowboys in the white hats which he was willing to duplicate so they disappeared 2 the cowboys in the black hats which he wasnt willing to duplicate so they became more real and solid this leads to the dwindling spiral communication can be lower gradient on duplication that leads to more willingness to duplicate as well as the other way around the rough part of the bank is duplication you could take some other part of the comm formula drill it and start to knock out the duplication hangup with communication you might get over the obsession not to duplicate without getting an obsession to duplicate you knock out the ferocity of dont ever be that as when you say to yourself i must never never never be bum on skid row and then you must obsessively duplicate the bum by becoming one you get out of compulsive and inhibited actions by communication if person cant stand the thought of an auto accident he wont be able to duplicate car communicate with it or control it and he will crash the remedy would be to have him touch car this shows why touch assists and processes of communication with aberrated body parts or whatever are so effective you become what you resist in other words that which you are unwilling to duplicate will persist and eventually overwhelm this is not to say that you have to obsessively duplicate either mere experiencing of something is nontherapeutic communication with something is therapeutic if you are afraid of being an alcoholic dont try it out communicate with alcoholics or with something relating to this subject then the refusal to duplicate clicks out give the alcoholic bottle or glass to communicate with but dont let him experience it run reach and withdraw on it or on photos of skidrow bums wilson newlyappeared political figure has 48 hour comm lag between his saying i will never and his doing it he is nearly nuts and never notices that he is doing this if hes agin it he is going to be doing it to be it why was i so angry about it yesterday im it the bank says that 50 of existence must be shunned and the other 50 is love it gotta be it cherish it so of course the universe will eventually become the 50 you mustnt have anything to do with you do not have to experience something in order to duplicate it the things that bug you are the things you mustnt be or have anything to do with and if you cant comm with something you cant hold it off how do you keep one boat from smashing another if you mustnt have anything to do with boat hook 693 there are gradients in the field of duplication making drawings is duplication and telling about them is communication so that would help out kid who was having trouble you could get him up to drawing what he didnt like about school drawing school in 3d etc cf play therapy in which the kid is encouraged to demonstrate with toys the various aberrative parts of his life just dont make it too steep gradient having to experience is an outgradient you collapse terminals with the thing that you are experiencing how can you hold anything off if you cant communicate with it also if you cant duplicate something you cant handle it putting it all on communication activity would be less likely to go too steep 8c is steep process because it asks the pc to communicate with mest which is the one thing he doesnt want to duplicate also this process is run duplicatively therefore communication like with the cowboys in the black hats is the key that unlocks duplication it is what you monitor case by and what you try to solve first not only with regard to levels but also at the beginning of every session you could use gradient of duplication instead of gradient of communication though it is hard to assess the gradient properly using duplication and the pc will hit too steep gradient and blow if you approach the whole thing on communication gradient you will give the pc very gentle gradient communication as word happens to be part of the reactive bank an endword but this doesnt matter however just because you have gotten the pc past level 0 it doesnt mean that you have got rid of his reactive mind or his peculiarities as thetan you will never get rid of the latter cleared thetan without bank will still have slump spots centered around communication duplication making things unmaking things persistence any value that time might be and value there is to experience etc he will make and unmake pictures of things he will have an aberratable pattern that isnt planned then he could just look at this small aberration and it would asis he asises things very easily because he doesnt have it all hanging on earlier similars in bank there are certain factors in person regardless of his experiential track for instance the fact that communication knocks out refusals to duplicate this comes up in lot of cognitions nonduplication decision goes along with noncommunication actions 8c is hard because youre asking him to communicate with mest and that is the one thing he will not be it makes quite process 8c also handles unwillingness to duplicate clever auditor always reestablishes the pcs communication where it ought to be before going on to do anything else so if pc is not in comm you must find out why we know the key points withholds ptps and overts they all have outofcomm to them an overt is regretted communication ptp is started but not completed and thereafter refused communication withhold is an unwillingness to communicate if you partially communicate with an unwillingness to communicate youve got missed withhold this is particular kind of problem 694 broader look at this area is given by the fact that the pc has ptp because he is unwilling to duplicate something or someone youve got to be careful not to throw the pc into the bank with gradient if the pc gets misemotional you are on an outgradient because the person is experiencing something rather than communicating push person into situation where there is noduplication decision and communication with that and powie he interiorizes into that very point this can also throw the pc into gpms and endwords of duplication and communication and their negatives communication is the solvent that handles nonduplication as you audit the pc normally youve got destimulative factor you are putting the pc more thoroughly in comm with his bank without throwing him into it ie without experiencing it if you skip the communication you will get the obsessive duplication the experiencing the dramatization you could develop process that would do this to the pc one such process would be what wouldnt you mind going out of arc with more direct one would be what dont you like duplicate it though the latter would be therapeutic on some pcs or by making guy wrong you can prove to him that he is duplicating something that he has said he would never duplicate this is the psychiatric approach you hate your father so you are being him arent you the reason why you cant just process pc all the way north with communication is that you have to pay attention to the complexity of the bank eg service facsimiles the bank is complex enough so that the pc will have to confront and undo it you have to pay attention to the pcs physical peculiarities the pc is going to run into some corner of the bank and you have to pay attention to it you must find areas that the pc can asis and walk him into them but you are not just auditing the pc vs the bank there is the environment full of other peoples banks etc so you have to make fast gain you have to have enough of gradient so that the pc knows that he has made gain and enough gain so that he wont get squashed before the next session you can get rid of bad habits in the pc not by direct attack on them but by general comm process washing out all unwillingness to duplicate if thetan could duplicate he wouldnt need habit to handle it cf earlier data on circuit as substitute for confront see p 47 above person getting extricated from his own bank is also mixed up with other banks also he is still eating dont advise people to experience life if you find some guy that is awfully slow to bring up the line why dont bring him up yourself he has had plenty of time to do himself in and some people have simply done better job of it than others 695 l ron hubbard type

matter of the mest universe let give you tip if someone around you or your organization is having trouble with organizational matters you just processed them subjectively too long it doesnt matter how long you process them subjectively now they are not going to go anyplace the trouble with them is objective you want to give the objectivetype processes not subjective organizational tech is being formed up into courses for the business world it has taken two to three years to plow this line now that we have product to put on the line it will go like crash dissemination techniques have been worked up out of the materials of scientology which have only to be written up and issued lrh has found all the points where organizations dont expand and found what makes them not expand what contracts them etc you end up with formulas that you can give to the janitor to apply to his job and he will look them over and see that they make sense his willingness to work was jammed by his ignorance of the law that governed that work under its various conditions all you have to do is to know and use the formulas if you apply them backwards you shrink and collapse it is longer question of our arriving before everything blows up we have made all our deadlines the questionable period is behind us organization is important to build scientology up to civilization level our intentions are good so we will make it it is now foregone conclusion that we will make it as soon as the materials are in your hands you cant help but make it in the human race and in the mind there is barrier called the hidden standard when anyone is critical they are apparently criticizing against hidden standard of behavior they seldom tell you what the behavior should be only what it shouldnt be or if they say what the behavior should be it is in antipathetic terms there is definition of normal person hence abnormal is defined against hidden standard the communist ideal would be anonymous this is weird person who is doing job should make known that he is the one doing it if someone isnt known he gets reward it is possible to develop odd tests for deciding what is good or right eg choosing doctor for appointment to hospital on the basis of his sports career examination and selection of personnel gets into trouble continually for lack of proper standard the hospital blames the medical school for not training good doctors but the hospital is setting up hidden standard and blaming the school for not delivering without saying what they want delivered marriages are made miserable by the hidden standards that spouses run on each other they dont make clear what they want when they say that they want good spouse eg the wife says you are not an adequate husband the husband says i guess im not an adequate husband but the wifes standard remains hidden she doesnt describe it to him you could handle marital problems organizationally by finding hidden standards auditors come up against this often you as an auditor have to face up to pcs who are running hidden standard on you all the time what you are looking at is not really standard but perverted standard it is not real standard nobodys 696 ever acknowledged this standard and that holds it apart from the time track the auditor should acknowledge the standard so that it doesnt get parked on the time track the standard is the collection of nonacknowledgments that the individual has if you want to end cycle of action acknowledge if you dont want to end cycle of action dont acknowledge in auditing if you dont want to end cycle you halfacknowledge as way of keeping someone going full acknowledgment of cycle ends it nonacknowledgment keeps it going that is why people tend to get uglier not prettier one ever says my you look ugly today one reason why person gets fixed on human bodies is that one said oh i see you are man this lifetime this datum is very applicable to registrars as well as auditors if you acknowledge the person before he arrives he wont arrive nobody will appear for training or processing if you acknowledge heavily the right way to handle letter from someone who announces his intention to come for training or processing is to be courteous and not too definite give some information but not solid acknowledgments people generally work towards beingness they dont function so well just being post this is question of acknowledgment which ends cycle on the post retirement is an acknowledgment of persons total active life it ends the life in many cases it ends life in any form military commissions act as an invitation to overthrow ones superiors because commission is not granted by saying thank you for having been lower post you now have the right to work toward commissioned post corporal would function much better if on attaining his new rank he were to be congratulated not on being corporal but on having been private and on having attained the right to work towards becoming lance corporal if persons rank or position is bestowed as an accomplishment rather than as challenge or becomingness then the cycle has been ended before it began by being prematurely acknowledged the only way person can get in trouble is to be george smith while hes pretending to be his post there is the post which is set of beingnesses and lines and actions and policies all by itself and theres being who runs the set of beingnesses lines actions and policies which is the hat george smith must not operate as george smith when he is supposed to be being or attaining say the post of d of t there is hat and then there is being who runs the hat to get hat on you must put it in category of being in the process of being attained once it is attained and acknowledged it ends so as an auditor you have to be careful what and how and when you acknowledge if arthur says that he has had horrible day at school lrh doesnt acknowledge with good he would use something more sympathetic and really acknowledge it so that it could go onto the backtrack you have the power to put someones past on the past track and to give them future if you want to kill them dead acknowledge everything with crash this gives them future be little doubtful about someones future plans dont use certain solid acknowledgments then give the discussion good acknowledgment recognize that datum like this with lot of uses could easily gang agley on the back track it would get perverted messed up etc from this datum could arise such things as hidden standards and amnesia getting shot is too solid an acknowledgment of lifetime so one forgets it that is the basic mechanism behind nonrecall of past lives things that arent acknowledged because they are totally out of agreement while the good things 697 are acknowledged these unacknowledged things bring about condition where everything disappears out of the persons past except the nonacknowledged things that people thought were silly or that they protested or that they were upset about this gives you decay of personality as person moves along the time track whether the person has gpms or not though without gpms the person could do and undo the aberrations almost at will person should know that he has tendency to collect all those things that were never acknowledged that is because the individual has some dependency on the comm formula as long as person has any desire to communicate he will be liable to malfunction of certain parts of the comm formula and when these parts go awry things do go weird person could regulate his conduct by knowing what parts of the comm formula were good and what parts were bad which parts would natively get him into trouble and which wouldnt if youre gonna associate with your fellow beings youre going to have to use the communication formula one way or another you will have to know how it works the part that acknowledgment plays etc the comm formula can have things go wrong with it so there is potential for native aberration there is direct source of direct aberration plus the native aberration of beings the two can work together gpms which are agreedupon aberration can hold lesser stuff native aberration eg failed acknowledgments etc in place and give them aberrative force and importance insanity could be two things 1 the persons collection of unacknowledged things 2 outright gpm commands to be nuts crazy person is doing lot of things that have never been agreed with and therefore have never been acknowledged you dont have to agree with something in order to acknowledge it where you have both factors working together the gpms make the unacknowledged things very solid and very much in force you know that the pc will run into aberration of this sort at levels vi and vii the latter is power processing he runs into the collection of nonagreedwith things the bank itself has lots of charge the nonagreedwith things locks carry very little charge the pc assigns the values wrongwayto especially at first because he assigns aberration to what he can confront so youve got 1 the bank 2 the accidents and incidents of livingness the power of these two is eight billion to one but it appears to be the reverse because that is all the thetan can confront you can key out the locks and pat the bank back into place this in itself is fantastic improvement over what anyone has been able to accomplish before there are hidden standards about what we are supposed to be accomplishing nobody will admit that you have reached any state because they have never told you what state you were supposed to reach in the first place amongst your fellow human beings this kind of cycle takes place you finish the pc up in session he feels good then he runs into the human race after the session they run hidden standard on him and try to make him prove that he is now in better state 698 the hidden standard interferes with delivery there is point in talking to someone about clear or release youve got to talk scientology in terms that are real in relation to the goals of the person to whom you are talking or you will trip all over his hidden standards about the only standard you could have for clear is fn at clear read the standard for release is do you think that you will get any worse people have hidden standards about who you should be to audit them what condition they should be in in order to have had case gain etc you could run who would i have to be to audit you and acknowledge the dickens out of it for any condition you have described as better condition in scientology there is hidden standard and hidden standard exists even for known standards for instance you say we require pink sheet but they keep bringing you green ones saying is this what you want what happens is that the individual with his concatenation of nonacknowledged ideas adds up to nonobservational point he cant observe from this point he cant tell where he is or what you are saying to him about how he should be etc cf earlier material on service facs as substitute for observation safe assumptions etc see hcob 6sep63 scientology five instructing in scientology auditing instructors task d of ps case handling hcob 160ct63 r3sc slow assessment and pp 497 and 499 above the pc will keep trying to bail himself out provided you dont overwhelm him with things to bail or give him nothing just give him things to bail with within his understanding and ability to confront and he will eventually float in that way you dont q and with his hidden standards you never realize how much better you are than yesterday because you are experiencing negative gain it is longer wrong with you so of course you are not now worrying about it just attesting level and getting certificate acknowledges the entire level the session the auditing etc the attestation keys it out and puts it on the back track this way also the pc doesnt get stuck in win hidden standard because of hidden standards the only safe way to evaluate case progress is mechanical method such as meter and completed cycle of processes it so happens that if the pc does complete the cycle of processes he will have case gain and this can be strung out along levels with such basic processes that you dont have different pcs all the time an unwritten standard is hidden you may feel that there is hidden technical standard this is an alteris what has happened is just that there is material that has not yet been released nobody is trying to hide any technology your best answer to the pcs hidden standards is to hold to your standard technology and just take the pc on up the line with q and 699 l ron hubbard type 3 idate9365 volnum2 issue54 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec54 the new

ardate000 shspec55 the progress and future of scientology 6503c16 shspec55 the progress and future of scientology in 1950 people used to yammer at lrh about fixing up the organization he was caught flatfooted when dmsmh was published one expected it to be bestseller but it was and it stayed at the top of the list for months the publishing firm that published it was overwhelmed by it when others set up the foundation and asked lrh to run it he said ok but he had management control he proposed some ideas then which are only now being put into action until about july 1950 his attitude was well i just wrote it the name lrh was getting very popular but he was trying to avoid the hat but he was setting the place up giving eight hours or so of lecture day getting the building the furniture etc the building had three main railroad lines one on each side lrh used to fix up pcs that other auditors couldnt handle he started the has course using the data straight out of book one the students all went onto the original hca course the word hubbard in hubbard dianetic auditor and in other titles was chosen by the elizabeth and auditors lrh went along with it with certain misgivings few days before the publication of dmsmh palmer at the explorers club offered lrh an expedition to the dodecanese islands south of greece to find sunken ship with statuary the deeper into 1950 it got the better the expedition looked the organization took more and more of lrhs time lrh was still telling people this kind of thing the general manager said to lrh you must front up the organization these people are depending on you lrh found out that joe winter was squirreling telling people that dianetics was developed by some nonexistent group of scientists and that auditing was an art with nothing scientific about it contemporary subjects were things like psychodrama moreno et these things looked good but they didnt work 700 so two hours after the first meeting of the dianetic foundation lrh put his time on the line and took responsibility for the development of the subject rather reluctantly he wasnt prepared to make his life an open book because it was too incredible for people to believe and they would call him liar lrh is not in bad favor with washington senators etc in 1955 if he had wanted to lrh could have gotten legislation passed that would have protected scientology the fbi was very nice when he wanted to find out who out of about 200 staff people were communists they told him who were not communists about thirty out of 200 there was an airplane waiting to take lrh to st louis and put him in spinbin fortunately the people who were sent to get him werent as well trained in combat as he was he took care of them this all occurred subsequent to lrh taking on his hat it has taken fifteen years to get to state where the hat could be worn because lrhs hat assaults the foundations of the society we live in by talking about freeing man bettering man etc ours is philosophy that says that people cant be lied to that we can see through the black magic spells this is an interesting civilization because people dont know who they are where they are where they are going or what they are doing you start laying truth on the line and confusion starts to blow off the early days of dianetics followed that rule we got through it because in july 1955 lrh wore his hat of being him and one has been able to throw him off it since lrh is also capable of occupying subordinate role lrh worried for awhile that he was one of those guys who can only lead and cannot follow however he was delighted to find out in the navy that he was also an excellent subordinate but to occupy topdog role all the way up you know theres government or any mystic vision back of you and confront everything simultaneously and stand there regardless of the dead cats the alarm clocks and bricks and everything else which are coming your way that took some doing and thats all you look at when you look at this early history it was stable datum going into very very aberrated world from where i looked it looked awful lonesome occasionally it took some doing and some confront we have changed things in the world we have changed psychology for one thing it wasnt done alone early staffs took beating at times eg in philadelphia when fifteen or twenty cops came to arrest lrh as witness in bankruptcy hearing by the time the federal marshalls got to lrh they were utterly demoralized they took him downtown before judge and there was great embarrassment when the lies from the wichita foundation were uncovered but we have been standing still waiting for the dead cats to clear from the air our early history is that of trying at first unsuccessfully to just hold position putting in dianetics as stable datum blew off enough confusion in the society so that we could move for long time it was impossible to hold position stably hence the way the early foundations moved around lrh was standing there as being but as an organization we couldnt stand up lrhs idea was to do his research and get it to the point where there was dependable gain there for every case easily attainable and deliverable he paid attention to the dead cats that may have been rough on people the group has been asking him to advance line into society while he has been fixing up the technology so that it could be delivered he has kept organizations running but he has not put much time in on organization comparatively 701 in the early days the reason we didnt deliver was that there was way to enforce the way to do it dianetics got enturbulated because unstraight tech poorly delivered prevented case advance and there wasnt any way you could discipline the administration of the technology to discipline the administration of the tech the following is required 1 youve got to have the technology and not hidden standards 2 youve got to be able to make it known 3 you have to police its use ie to make sure that it is that technology that is applied that is the 123 of an administration early on we lacked not only the tech to handle simple things like ow and pt concerns of the pc but also the means to see that what we did have got applied dianetics was not and we are not just an idea book copyright or nice philosophy lying in book on shelf we are bringing live human beings up to recognition of their own beingness and that is live action we dont face it because it is easier to confront concept than live being we have never been anything but beings going through society when we started up the line it was the enturbulation of the trillions starting to blow we had more ways to knock out the whole track than to get the overt out of the last hour we had started to make hole in the collective aberration of mankind it was we as beings making the hole not the idea not with good tools not with administration to enforce what tech we had you are perfectly right to say its rons fault that it didnt all go smoothly i should have been an ot who came to earth and got ahold of someone named moses and said hey moses here are some rules now you go back and front for is there anything wrong with that story can you imagine anyone doing that if he had all that power this didnt happen it just required more nerve to stand up by yourself the people who attacked us are dead or in terrible shape the organizations that attacked us are weaker we have held the fort successfully and we can now begin to do what we want rather than what we have to do we are holding our position as an organization now we are able to get tech applied our organization takes the form we want it to take in 1950 lrh said it will go as far as it works he has been pushing the tech to its limit despite pleas to take over the admin things are becoming more orderly now lrh is in position to put in administrative form and structure we had gotten ourselves to position where we were holding ourselves from expanding now the instructor can wear his hat in the course the action of administration is simply smoothing out the enturbulence of the environment when you introduce someone to scientology he can run into lots of confusion with the other people in his environment he has changed and they havent as an individual he goes through what scientology as group has gone through however it wont take him fifteen years to get up to point where he can hold his case gain there is terrific relationship between the environment the individual and the speed with which process works the earlier auditing on case is race between the auditor and the pcs environment that was true of the introduction of dianetics and scientology into the environment also that was also race 702 the guy who has an early win in scientology tells his friends and confusion blows off which may spin him in he gets inval etc he has put in stable datum and cant hold his position in the resultant confusion youve got to get process working on somebody that is effective enough so that the environment wont knock him down faster than you can pull him up you have to deliver to him the kind of technology that he can somehow stand up with you must not unsettle him eg with r6 you want him to be stable furthermore you want to give him some administrative protection today you have been given weapons of administrative protection for your pc as well as method of forcing pc to take action and not keep messing up in his environment we are more powerful and things are more stable than ever before and will continue to be so as long as we follow the channels of the administrative system as long as our mutual understanding of the existing situation and the lessons of what we have been through are applied we have had lines that were blocked lrh is pulling out the blocks now putting in comm lines etc the trick is to avoid unsettling lines that are already in and working the goal is an accelerating curve we are past the critical point of organizational case gain now we can hold our gains now we have to get in comm lines and put policy to work if you want to strengthen an organization just find the blocks to expansion and pull them out open up your comm lines put your barriers on the edges of the lines to channel them and put life into the group last summer lrh changed the whole org board to make it more workable this action resulted in smoother flows and less upset we are about to complete that reorganization without cutting out any working lines but paralleling them duplicative functions are being cut out so there is less traffic all we ask of staff member is to discipline his comm line there is vast rush to get the tech all published we need to get the organizational lines in first so that when we hit the society with new material there will be lines for the traffic to flow on the levels checksheets and processes are ready for release the processes are simpler than you would expect earlier technology was more advanced in some instances than later tech for instance the material in the philadelphia doctorate course is level vii material the old technology was workable ever since excalibur was written in 1938 but the chances of it being received followed or applied were remote we are now moving ahead to some law and order which smooths things out man was too far down to know that he was confused now he can come up through the confusion l ron hubbard type 3 idate30365 volnum2 issue56 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec56 arc breaks and generalities 6503c30 shspec56 arc breaks and generalities the problem of getting materials out has to do with lrhs pen fingers and the short only 24 hour day nevertheless expansion is going rapidly what is interesting is the number of false data that you can get that create false impression for instance you can get the datum that they say when only one guy said it we were thrown curve last year it was reported to lrh from at least two sources that the gradation program was unpopular in fact the gradation program alone was responsible for last years organizational upsurge lrh let the gradation program wobble and modified it whereupon decline set in most people think that it was the price shift at the start of the year 703 that caused the decline but the decline was coincident with lrh leaving for vacation when investigated it was found that registrars were using the confusion caused by the price shift to deny service they sold lot of auditing saying the price will be prohibitive in thirty days and everyone went into agreement with it the registrars also confused the public about what they could get with what in terms of memberships furthermore there wasnt price rise the price dropped unlike registrars in central orgs lrh never talked about money someone would come in to central org thinking about auditing and someone at the org who had money problems himself gratuitously gave the wouldbe pc money problems lrh never talked about money yet people force discussion of money on him if processing works the person who gets it is more able to have money since registraring to get money was never something that lrh had to do he is considering removing interviews with the reg as part of the regs hat it must have been something added on the line that suppressed the inflow of money it must have been the selling lrh used to explain every datum at least nine times in lecture before study tech came out that got around misunderstood words because the material was put in various ways when telling students to do something he has found that they will do what he said so he has to be sure that he tells them what to do very very clearly instruction is basically trying to cover all of it so thoroughly that there are gaps and room for question on how to do it an old process gets all the quirks and weird ways to do it ironed out as it gets used people in the org got the odd idea that class vi auditor would only audit level vi material class vi auditors can run level 0 only they would use emeters assess for the exact thing to run etc an auditor uses all the tools of the trade that he has mastered if class vi auditor were doing touch assist on burned area and he could see that the area was not getting better fast ie that there was ta on the process he would know that the pc must have something connected with the injury like withhold or an overt having the pc point to where it happened and where it is now is having him contact the environment and letting the whole incident come into view now the touch assist can go to work never accept rumor as something on which to base any action or decision except to investigate use statistics which are particularities if you dont have stats for each individual you get chaos because it is generality an organization will cause arc breaks amongst its staff if you cant get statistic on everybody present week in and week out people will protest an organization as slavedriving system in the absence of stats the stat has to be on each individual or it is worthless it must also be compared with former stats this is what it takes to keep some activity or organization going for long period of time the galactic confederacy had pretty good org board the org lasted eighty trillion years its only flaw was not having any provision for change or improvement it had two billion staff members in the central org lrh set himself the problem of making an org board that could cover from one person to two billion when things arent staticized you get rumors injustice and authoritarianism because generality is operating earth organizations commonly attribute success wholly to the man at the 704 top when in fact he is only 60 or 70 responsible general macarthur didnt win the war though he was bright cookie in korea he didnt win because he wasnt good politician he disobeyed condition formula he was in emergency and didnt promote public opinion is made out of someones hat the moral is that when you try to explain condition with generalities that do not apply you muck up the whole situation that is how russia will take the us they have better propaganda they are promoting communism and who is promoting democracy wilson and johnson are reorganizing economies in period of decline emergency when they should promote what they cam eventually deliver be prepared to deliver it etc they are advertising crisis if you dont want to be something dont postulate it if you yell crisis you will get crisis apply the proper conditions formula us business operates an though it is in perpetual condition of emergency it uses heavy promotion etc american businesses never apply the condition for normal when they get there so they never get out of emergency in emergency you handle with sledge hammer in normal you handle with kid gloves all this has to do with dealing with what is actually going on but you can never find out what is actually going on from having just mass of something there is nothing to compare it with you can only find out what is happening with the individual bits of something never with the masses you get in trouble when you generalize what should be particular in scientology we do make general statements about men we can only get away with doing this because we have studied many individuals when we say about men is actually description of thetan there is another interesting fact about generalities we used to know fairly little about arc breaks now we know that an arc break is generality that should be particularity it was single but it was called many only an arc break can worsen graph during processing which makes an arc break more serious than ptp if theres graph change theres ptp there is nothing wrong with generality per only with one that should be particularity if you get generality when asking for an arc break get the pc to particularize it you can fail to find the bpc by taking generality as the bpc instead of going on to find out who they is you would still have to get the specific who and it may take several of these steps to get it eg aud is there an arc break pc yes the instructors are mean to aud who is the instructors pc pete aud there is bpc has he failed to answer you etc pc it is actually the students aud who is the students pc agnes id forgotten completely she said i was lousy auditor yesterday what is basically wrong with the r6 bank all the gpms are generalities that is why people arc break so hard on r6 the above datum concerning generalities also solves loss the loss of something produces generality of where it could be when you lose something it could be anywhere which makes it generality this is lie so the person arc breaks one of the ways to cure yourself of loss is to remember that the thing that was lost can only be in one place not in thousands of places 705 its an everywhere that should be particularity it gives the individual an unflat listing question about where the test of what was the bpc is when it is located does the pc cheer up if you have to locate it more you havent found the bpc l ron hubbard type 3

command chart covers only one aspect of organizational functioning true org board must take care of what happens if function is not expressed on the org board it will be worn by everybody unknowingly when you put box on an org board it will be filled men cannot work as team without policy even bad policy will at least make team if it is followed policy is the extant agreement of the group without this agreement you only get individual action if an organization is better organized than other organizations it wouldnt have to do anything spectacular about the other organizations by way of competing with them or battling with them every war traces back to wild outpolicy if we come up the line as people as individuals and also as part of the team we wont get into all the trouble we got into as roarin screamin individuals way back on the track we will be able to make it all the way because we will be able to keep order all the way case stability depends upon the smooth organization of individuals without an organization the tech would drop out in time the organization must be close to flawless once you have put the organization in concrete and started it rolling if it is almost right you have had it because it will become an alldevouring monster and it will fail by the germs of its own destruction and what destroys almost any organization is its own germs its the things it laid in its the things you did not the things that were done to you the only way you can come down is for having made mistake yourself there must always be that prior mistake sometimes it is very slight and unpredictable apparently when curve goes down there are lots of errors there is one major error you must have understandings not understanding there are 265 x 6 separate dynamic urges in man and 265 x 6 x 18 separate causations there was an effort to make them so numerous that one could embrace them actual gpms organizational policy must be comprehensible the org board must express 1 function 2 duties 3 sequences of actions 4 authorities the org board gives the cycle of raw meat to ot the cycles of actions that person would undertake from the public it became public org board too the public enters from the left and proceeds to the right 706 in life 1 you must have an impulse into channel 2 the edges of channel must be held firm 3 the barriers in the channel must be removed 4 the noncompliance of forwardings in the channel must be taken care of 5 the distractions must be removed from the borders of the channel 6 there must be some place for something going down the channel to arrive at this is the definition of life life without that channel wont exist that is livingness going along certain course impelled by purpose with some place to arrive this also gives us all the levels of the gradation program clear is baby ot his next bank is the physical universe the first point on the org board is the office of lrh this used to be hasi this deals with 1 authority 2 lrhs material 3 lrhs signature the main thing about this department is the issuance of conditions the first cog is that there is condition hence this is the entrance point for raw meat he thinks others will take care of him however he must recognize his condition or he will die others tell him that his condition is that he will die scientology says you dont have to die or get sick etc all processes from that point on contain condition after you have condition you had better communicate with it hence the next department is the department of communications and the name of the level iscommunication the next level is perception the department of inspections and reports communication must precede perception the next point is orientation the individual finds out that he has been living in nightmare this is the department of compilation after you have accumulated notes you can put them together and hand them to people so that they can get oriented cf these briefing course notes perceptions get compiled into understandings so the next department is understandings ie the department of publications this department publishes what is to be understood or what is understood understanding is just telling yourself what is understood the next department the department of promotion is under purposes the only thing the promreg ever handles is purposes the pc at this level on the gradation chart has arrived at purposes ie r6 he has gotten rid of false purposes he has achieved the state of clear in its new 1964 definition see tape 6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is pp 664667 above the above

promotion orientation understanding purpose if you cross two divisions on hat from that point on you have jammed the ability of an organization to expand dont have one person on hats in two different divisions therefore six people are necessary in order to have an org one for each division when an organization gets fairly big you cross departmental hats at your peril org div 3 energy org sec dept of organization dept of finance dept of materiel direction energy body personnel feeding personnel housing division 3 has to hold things together eg the physical plant it is also involved in financial

you do the doingness there has been neglected factor on the galactic confederation org board the product an organization has to qualify the product it must find out what made the product fall down ie there is need for lost battles division you must not let the person who trains students examine them qual div 5 enhancement qual sec the last two departments above were originally in reverse sequence

your life and find out which division is missing note that there are six divisions and sixteen departments to expand the org board each department would have primarily six sections with sixteen subsections each one of these subsections in turn may have six divisions with sixteen departments each divisional head knows all the department hats in his division and something about all other departmental hats this gives you basically six hats and staff member hat there should be two admin personnel for every tech person if any hats below you on the org board are empty you are responsible

datum has emerged and research is going south lrh is researching power processing it is not surprising that the more one discovers in the upper reaches the more understanding one has of fundamentals that apply to the bottom youve got r6ew that is holding you nicely im putting the capper on the r6 gpm plot r6 has developed into series of starrated processes the first is the method of cleaning up outruds on yourself it is solo ruds process twoterminal auditing is too slow at level vi solo auditing all the gpms on r6 takes about three months at three to four hours per day the end product of this auditing is clear as we knew it in the earliest days reactive bank at all thetan experiences sense of unfamiliarity at this level and he runs into problems like how do you handle body he has to learn to postulate with great rapidity it is condition of too aware he has to get used to reading peoples minds he finds that absolute zero is proper temperature everything else is hot it is in tiny but observable motion and it is bothersome at first he needs refamiliarization he is not quite sure what he can do his framework on whom he must fight changes he can start wondering about his sanity because previously sensible things seem foolish he can also get solutions he can do analyses of situations that were previously blank puzzles the road to ot is one of familiarity clear has trouble trying to reconcile what has been going on in his life with what he is now he is not really able to think very straight about how confused he was sometimes its hard to understand why somebody else is confused for instance try to wrap your wits around some guys saying but we gotta get the republicans back 709 in power you know they are nutty too since you erased your confusion and dont have it around anymore as standard clear is not necessarily very tolerant state but it is not very antagonistic state either its not negative one is far more positive about things than he ever was before his reactions are far more vivid you have to realize that thetan can become aberrated without being implanted or having gpms but what really made him unable was gpms which gave him wrong purposes and smashed him down so that he couldnt have any purpose of his own all his own real purposes are suppressed when you get out into the open your own purposes show up and you start doing what you would like to do not what your bank wants you to do in scientology we have been working with what the thetan wants we only fail with other people when we treat them as other than thetan being all thetans want out even those that are in an insane asylum who fight everybody who comes in the door beings are basically good one reason why the being has consented to have bank is that it prevents everyone else from being bad that is so farfetched that one would ever look for it as the philosophical fundamental in back of the aberration of man there is aberration that thetan can get into based on his ignorance his unfamiliarities his decisions based on data etc scientology is built straight around what might happen to thetan gpms gave him reverse purposes he decided that to keep others and himself good he should have bank to prevent himself and them from being bad the idea was that man is bad and we have to do something to him to make him good so we all have to agree to have bank to keep us from being bad but the bank cut off the thetan from all familiarity with himself as he was the decision to do that to create bank somehow put him into condition where he couldnt conceive of how he had been it was cutoff he is like guy in coal pit who doesnt believe that there is sun or platos cave metaphor in the republic he thinks that what he is in is normal environment he will say look you can see there is sun or light thats proof that was the barrier that made someone unsalvageable before we knew about it as you come up the line your r gets violated by the wog world the higher you get the more your r is susceptible to violation but fortunately the more capable you are of standing up to invalidation it doesnt mean anything to you it is vital that someone improve on gradient since pcs case gain must not outrun his capability of handling the new reality you cant travel the road to truth halfway see the tape 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth pp 325329 above it is vital that lrh reorganize and perfect organizations now because we are at the makebreak point where it requires hard push at first shifting over to runaway forward motion if we released public book right now we would cave ourselves in the orgs have to be able to expand rapidly before flood of new people hits it we can push the boombutton any time all of sudden lrh made discovery that found the answer to cases that wouldnt run successfully on level 0 power processing there are two levels below level 0 1 conditions processes 2 existence processes existence is below conditions this antiquated the plans for boom so there have been changes there are three conditions processes 710 auditing the case on these belowzero processes is walk in the park however it may take class vi to run them because what flies off the case comes off so fast that the velocity might be too much for coauditor or lowerlevel auditor these processes handle the nocasegain case they were developed to handle cases that lrh had formerly handled with justice and ethics these are the new conditions processes which could be run at any point on case and which have an exact endpoint beyond which they wont run further below the conditions processes is existence processing an existence process is one in which person recognizes something about existence mimicry gets at this sideways having these processes makes it hard to write new public book because they should be included in the discussion but not enough is known about them yet to write about them since the new membership pricing system was created based on the idea of having new public book the pricing is premature which backs it up on the orgs we will get the orgs to back up and get their organization and signup line well in hand look around here and find something really real to you is process at the existence level it was wildcat process from upperlevel tech that belongs at or towards the bottom you get person to find one thing that is really real in the room basic undercutting command might be are you something like that its familiarity without contact or communication and without an awareness of what familiarity is arriving you get the shutoff because as youve gone south youve dropped orientation youve dropped perception communication conditions and youre now in existence that existence must be without any of th other thingsso what is this level called existence how would you audit something without understanding orientation perception communication or the recognition of condition what do we have left we dont know but we will the new organizational plan is going in faster than it has been released you cant keep an org out of it despite its current incompleteness it is big magnet that is trying to take existing departments and put them on it it is unique and it works because it is parallelline org board not vertical org board it operates left and right not up and down one odd characteristic is that each repeating department as you go across the board from left to right has nothing to do with the functions that follow it but includes all of the functions which precede it just try to squeeze into department comfortably some action which follows it on the board to the right you get trouble try to get into the orientation department something about understanding well that has its own departmental functions but the next one to the right is purposes now lets put purposes under understanding in other words were going to have purposes before we have understanding you get mess organizationally or in auditing eg if you try to put something about promotion under understanding why people just sit around and understand that there should be some promotion 711 it was working with the org board that brought to light the lower subzero levels because the org board is not an org board at all its philosophic machine to which an organization is easily adapted its an alldevouring monster anything that comes near it gets changed for the better it gives answers to questions that we have had trouble with before like personnel an ad is kept placed people come in they get hired they work for two weeks with staff hat they go to review etc it all gets done without having to go through any executive an applicant who calls up for job gets call two days later saying come on in he gets metercheck for ta then he is routed through fp to his place of work for two week temporary assignment at the end of which he goes to review and is either kept on or told that he needs more training for the job even if review boots him out he remains an applicant needing some more preparation before he can have the job review also tells the labor exchange about him to see if he can get other employment right away review also has displaced person division to give him meal ticket get him on pe course or coaudit until he can function then he is hired on provisional basis for year review maintains file of these people for periods of crush labor the only way this whole system wont work is if you dont man up the posts this employment system is also great for procurement people come to work and stay to study thus anything that gets near the organization begins to move this new organizational structure improves things for the better whether people like it or not it has to be completed before we release the field staff member program which will give backup to field auditors private practice mds must be wrong since it is failing it takes quite team to process pcs it is possible to process pcs in an organization but not in individual practice suppose you had dissemination technology that would make it so anyone you talked to would immediately become scientologist it exists it is only two or three weeks old not yet released the person who resists and protests it is the easiest to get and if fsms are sending in all sorts of cases even very lowlevel cases the organization must be able to handle them right off the bat all auditors that were ever trained are now to be called fsms the pay is ten percent of the fee of the person you send in center is nucleus of an organization if it moves even vaguely in the direction of an org board it will wind up becoming an organization so fast it wont know what happened there is policy that you cant be retrained for level that you have already obtained this goes along with the policy that checksheet cant be changed once you are on it there are at least twelve levels above level vi and st hill will be teaching those 712 l ron hubbard type 3 idate27465 volnum2 issue59 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec59 awareness levels 6504c27 shspec59 awareness levels lrh makes several observations on recent organizational outpoints wherever the public impinges on the organization it enturbulates and erodes it is the public that is in confusion we are putting the stable datum of an organization or scientologist into the middle of the confusion an individual cannot stand alone against the public in the midst of this confusion he will get knocked appetiteovertincup by the public unless backed up by the organization every scientologist and org in the world is connected with the suppressive thing called the society so they would skid if left by themselves you are dealing with psychotic society there are thirtytwo levels below 0 and the average public is at least fifteen levels below 0and neurosis starts at ten levels below 0 it goes only few levels down then becomes psychosis psychosis is an inability to observe and thats your public last year when lrh first had total reality on the exact character of the reactive mind on exactly how it was there and exactly what it was calculated to make an individual do he was shocked knowing that shock is an indication that there is something wrong with what he is shocked with he went over the structure of the bank suppressed challenged and arc broke it the shock was not actually with the reactive bank but with the pretenses that had been made about the character of man i havent cognited heavily for ages lrh cant get his own ta up masses affect his body but not him here is some more data that lrh has found on the subject of clear clears time track is gone so the eidetic memory talked about in book one is there only if he puts it there clear recalls not with pictures but by knowing pictures are completely unnecessary for any kind of recall at all this is probably the only change theres been from the definition of book one clear there are also energy phenomena mentioned several years after book one like heating things up by looking at them clear can make something warm by staring at it as person goes on up he takes both the new abilities and the lost disabilities for granted the negative gain is gain by absence and the positive gain is regaining his natural abilities after all so he may not notice the change unless he mocks up what was wrong with him last week so dont expect your pc always to be telling you what wonderful auditor you are that is bank phenomenon that will destimulate in three to ten days the persons increased awareness may not be all pleasant he can look at some dynamic or sphere of existence and see it clearly with shock the common denominator of behavior is degree of awareness that is what is held in common by all life there is such thing as being aware or not aware it is all degrees of awareness gradient like all the scales the difference between person and person b is degree of awareness or awareness of different things there are certain things of which one would become aware in order to get or as one got case advance if you skip one or two or three of those you cant become aware of this higher one lrh plotted the scale of awareness to get the bridge down to homo sapiens not having noticed the gap that he had created between himself and the lowlevel pc that is how he got thirtytwo 713 levels of awareness below level 0 he suddenly found himself looking at the human race and it was horrible shock it felt weird he got over it in about twentyfour hours realizing that if you could deal with the average public pc you could process dog you are at least ten or twelve levels below communication with the average public pc the problem is how do you process when you dont have comm line another problem is that as someone comes up in awareness he goes through antisocial bands as well as inoffensive ones there are bands amongst them that are passive and propitiative these are resting places in which society doesnt worry about you ie it doesnt try to suppress you these lower levels are jammed together and it is bit hard to tell the order down near the bottom the awareness scale measures what person could become aware of if you find person anyplace on the awarenessscale then the next action which you have to do to give him case gain is to make him aware of the next level above that for instance someone below suffering might have case gain by being made to suffer you wouldnt necessarily process him up to this awareness the lowest type of process you would use is mimicry he would be aware that he was doing it because you were doing it awareness is always matter of increasing perimeter of reality you get concentric circles of awareness for instance psycho is only aware out to his fist beyond that is delusion awareness can invert and increase into delusion which puzzles you since the person seems to be getting nuttier delusion is inverted awareness youve got to increase his awareness in the direction of sanity or reality process in the direction of something real person who is improving gets more and more aware of what is going on inside wider and wider perimeter you could get guy aware of wall two feet in front of his face and it could be vast improvement you can do this with 8c increasing the distance to the wall when the pc touches it communication begins to come in you can have action without awareness ie you can have the situation where what the individual is aware of and what he is doing are not the same thing ever hence you get longterm headaches therefore the observation of conduct will not diagnose person unless you have little secret awareness scale of your own in other words youd have to know the secret of what the mest universe dictates as gradient scale of awareness observation of conduct will not lead to solution of the situation and man falls down in thinks that it will the field of psychology etc being entirely based on observation and labelling of conduct comes up with inaccurate diagnoses and messedup solutions you cant watch patient and decide that he is gymnastico potico and firebug who is compulsively attracted to water on that account the reason this girl keeps going to the water fountain is because she is thirsty she may be stuck in french foreign legion engram in the sahara therefore the remedy might have nothing to do with water fire etc the moment you grasp this principle you get the stable datum dont draw and conclusions from conduct all unexpected conduct tells you is that you dont know about something but that is something to know labelling is bad science and leads to solution all science is is the discovery that or all science had to find out to become science is that when something isnt working you havent got the answer this explains the advance of the physical 714 sciences the mental sciences got parked by substituting authoritarian statements for searching for workable answer if as an auditor you base what you do on what the pc is doing you will go nuts too for instance if the pc is nattering and the auditor agrees with the natter and takes the pcs data as truth nothing happens conduct can be used only as an indicator that since the pc is behaving in some way that you didnt expect there is something about him that you didnt know that you can ask the pc regardless of whether it is missed withhold or not what dont i know about you will resolve the situation labelling it wont never just label conduct that you dont understand know that you dont know what is going on and find out also consider what the pc can find out about himself the nuttier someone is the harder he is to handle he is less aware and you are less aware of what you dont know about him also the nuttier the pc is the harder it is to get his attention so that you can find out what he is aware of and what is going on and what you dont know the dont knows are fabulous you have to push to get the person to become aware enough to get him high enough on the awareness scale so that you can find out enough so you can find out what you dont know about the person the game would be what can i find out about this person and what can he find out about himself by increasing that awareness scale the person will get saner and saner more and more aware more and more himself he can hit dynamic situations which he becomes aware of with shock you have to eat humble pie to begin this subject at all you have to know that there is something in the universe you dont know and that for person who is way down scale is the most dangerous utterance that he could possibly make he is so totally sealed off from things that if everyone realized how blind he was he thinks theyd just eat him up so he compensates for his unawareness by automatic mechanisms of pretense he lacks the courage to say well i dont know anything about that and yet he cant resolve any situation until he says well whaddya know ive got an area where i dont know therefore when you see somebody behaving oddly the only thing you know is that theres something youre certainly unaware of and that he is probably unaware that he is unaware of hell cover that up with pretended awareness which doesnt exist ie delusion having gone through despair on the subject person can come up to realization that there is something you can know about anything you confront you can know that you dont know and that is the first thing you should know about it now you can take the action necessary to find out and in the process of finding out the whole thing will clarify the amazing thing about aberration is that if you did find out about something eg the internal government of russia it would either go clear or collapse just finding out what situation is asises that situation running an engram out of an organization or an individual is just continuing to pull into view what people didnt know about the individual or organization the only way in which you could fail to pull something into view is to suppose that you knew all there was to know about it and that there was nothing more to learn clear has become broadly aware of where he is unaware when he spots something like this he decides that 1 he should find out or 2 it doesnt make any difference you can decide whether it is worth finding out and if you do start finding out it will collapse 715 l ron hubbard type 3 idate11565 volnum2 issue60 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec60 arc breaks and ptps the differentiation 6505c11 shspec60 arc breaks and ptps the differentiation releases are being made with power processing with lrh d of ping and msh csing it is getting very routine to get keyedout clears in under fifty hours we know that we can audit anybody 34 awareness levels below level 0 note at this time the awareness scale was apparently in its present 1976 form the bulletins covering the power processes are too simple to be anything but confidential the processes are too pure and simple to be generally released they require both great deal of training and high case level therefore power is to be made confidential power processes can only be audited in organizations there is not enough control or sense among people like homer and berner to do it in the field the idea of running endwords on raw meat it just overwhelms the pc and is tough to straighten out clay table processes have been taken out of the processing lineup when people process raw meat with the clay table they neglect one thing rather uniformly getting the questions answered only few processes are left on students auditing checksheets the international situation has improved in the us the senate and house are attacking or are on the verge of attacking the fda in victoria the report on the inquiry is delayed it will doubtless fizzle out people probably thought lrh was exaggerating when he said that we were going to take the planet but he has always meant exactly that we are now just at the edge of dissemination as phase in the development of scientology having the minus0 awareness level scale is great help in dissemination the press will support you on need of change so you press this they will go along with this whatever the press says is protest revolutions are popular until you give them the change that is to be made into then they cool off the scale of awareness is scale of what person group or organization can be aware of it is new having the minus0 awareness level scale opens the door to bringing person right up the line to release on study alone because it has trick if you can locate what person is aware of on that scale you only have to tell him about the next level and he will become aware of that and experience case change therefore you can get case improvement by education dont confuse the level person is at with his conduct for instance someone dramatizing hysteria ie being hysterical isnt necessarily or even generally aware of hysteria therefore he isnt necessarily at the level of hysteria we do know that being must be aware and we mean analytically aware of something to be at that awareness level something someone is dramatizing is above where he is and is overwhelming him what he is aware of can be discovered he what he talks about or seems to be alert to there are lower levels than 34 below zero but power reaches to the bottom and gives release the two levels below level 34 unexistence are false causation 35 and reasonableness 36 these levels are below uncausing 32 the human race generally is near the bottom end of the scale person who is aware of being hysterical is pretty hightoned relatively speaking you cant pull an overt off the person at uncausing there arent any it just happens what will be will be 716 religions fail by being below perception of god the greatest arc break operation that has ever been pulled in the history of the human race the god who is everywhere with mass total generality total unlocatability total power total causation will you please please differentiate between arc breaks and ptps ninety percent of the pcs that you are doing arc break assessments on are in fact in ptps the arc break is usually after ptp unless it is flagrant case of bpc ptp is postulatecounterpostulate the pc is at war with something he is not just worrying about something he doesnt like he is agin something for instance husband has an argument with his wife one wants to go to the movies and the other doesnt this is war not an arc break but it could lead to an arc break on both sides running the arc break wouldnt help though it would run but running the problem will help you could find the problem where you might not ever find the bpc so the sequence is 1 problem 2 overt 3 arc break if you clean up the bpc the case wont improve because the ptp is unhandled they wont necessarily even feel better you have to do something about the fractured postulate the condition of someone in ptp isnt arc broken its war postulatecounterpostulate adds up to war it would have done hitler good to have run him on an arc break he might have been on ptp though probably it would have required power processing to stop him though one commits intentional overts as solution to problem when you define an overt as solution to ptp you can solve any case when overts are defined as arc breaks they are closed to solution the resolution of the case is who have you been mean to process the pc at cause always person commits intentional overts for only one reason they are solutions to problems knowing this even lowlevel cases are open to solution but when you define an overt or series of overts as an arc break you close the case to solution because case is usually struggling along at low causelevel the question have you committed an overt will be hard for him to answer because he has never committed an overt because it was all vitally necessary and therefore totally justified you should ask the more penetrating question why is it so vitally necessary and why is it justified it is because there was problem requiring solution the solution being the overt what throws you is that the problem is so buried in the past that it is impossible to see the connection between the overts and the problem the problem is frequently on the past track often it has nothing to do with pt the person is still solving problem relating to an earlier relationship it is still pt to him hence it is still ptp to him if you trace it back you will find that it made sense somewhere earlier in screwy sort of way guy who is always smashing up his car might be solving problem with daddy who never let him use the car by making the car unuseable you look on lot of things as overts which are in actual fact vitally necessary solutions to urgent immediate problems of survival the only thing wrong with them is when you could ask guy when with finger snap and get say 1932 then you could ask what problem did you have in 1932 you will get many many manifestations but amongst them will not be disinterest if you told 717 someone the right problem he would change his conduct having cognited that his solution was nuts these solutions are daffy because of droppedout time the solution is to an ancient problem which is gone leaving an overt to get the major problem on someones track may take power process but if the person has some fundamental problem in his life it has formed innumerable locks which have moved up to pt and they are the overts and withholds that he is dramatizing in pt if you are clever you can get at these locks you dont have to ask for overts if you ask for solutions to the problem the old process tell problemwhat solutions have you had modified to what solutions have you put into effect to solve that problem could be reworded as how have you attempted to solve that problem so you can just use tell problem what solutions did you put into effect to solve this problem this would give you ow or you could use what have you done to solve that problem how have you attempted to solve that problem or what would solve the problem or what action of yours was solution to the problem some such process would get the overts off any action the person took to solve the problem was to some degree an overt because it was against another postulate an arc break is charge that has been restimulated on the back track which hasnt moved into full consciousness and therefore hasnt been identified the pc avoids the area an arc break is bpc and hasnt anything to do with solutions to problems guy who is failing to complete comm cycle because somebody wont acknowledge it only has really the bpc of missed withhold an inadvertent missed withhold missed withhold can be inadvertent not intended it looks and feels much like an actual missed withhold if you wont acknowledge the fact that the pc has answered the question you bypass the charge of his answer but the better part of it is that you have given him problem since he intended to answer it this is ptp by definition he is trying to solve it by force then he arc breaks but that is secondary it will solve rapidly by asking what problem have you had in auditing especially on pc who has been roughed up by not being acknowledged eventually the pc would give you the problem of getting someone to listen to then to get the pcs overts on auditors ask then how did you go about solving it you get string of overts by getting ptps for instance what problem have you had with about auditing well very often you didnt seem to listen to well how did you handle solve this i stopped telling you right answers so the pc has an arc break ptp and missed withhold you can be misled by the bpc and the fact that yes there is an arc break but the arc break isnt fully cleanupable unless you find the problem that it is based on if you clean up the problem and the problems that the pc has had in his auditing whole string of arc breaks and whole string of overts will blow 718 this is the case because awareness of problems is way south below minus thirtyfour cause overts is way north so if you try to pull problems directly with ow the pc would already have to be so hightoned that it wouldnt have any effect on him if you did pull the problems you can discuss problems with anybody it seems to be the case that where there is life there are problems where are arc breaks and bpc of course to get an arc break just throw an endword into restimulation get total generality hitting the person outside his awareness and you will see an arc break on the generality of it the whole bank is the most total generality that one can state that is still the truth when generality in the bank is restimulated the person cannot identify the threat and he feels terrible not knowing this is true arc break the pc cannot locate the source of this horrible feeling it isnt because he is sick to his stomach it is that he doesnt know why he is sick to his stomach if you give someone wrong item off gpm he will go from tone 40 to tone 40 so fast that he looks like dive bomber that is an arc break but someone who is arc broken with an instructor really has problem and some overts which were solutions auditors can get stuck in the win of successful arc break assessments and do them on people who really have ptps they will get loses that way problems are far more common than real arc breaks an experimental nontherapeutic but very educational process is invent problem you will see black masses show up as the pcs bank collapses on him if you ran invent solution and the solutions that the pc gave you were all really invented solutions the mass would also move in but if you ran think of or recall problemsolution the mass would move off you could do think of problem invent solution and the mass will move in any totally new inventedness tends to collapse the bank if you started knocking out bunch of wholetrack problems you would find the mass going away similarly with wholetrack solutions the nearfar action of it is very interesting this makes problems of comparable magnitude able to bring mass in if you are really inventing which is hard to do the main message is that you can move mental masses around with the idea of problems and solutions why because of the basic definitions of problems and solutions solution is an effort to bat problem away which usually fails the problem being postulatecounterpostulate puts the opposite postulate across from you in hurry when you think of it persons problem is thought of as mass he calls ptp it because it is an it to him mental mass that he tries to bat away postulatecounterpostulate gives you mass so whether he sees it or not when person gets problem showing up he gets mass showing up and whether he realizes it or not the thing he tries to do about it is to do something about it to move it away from him but his effort will move it closer to him so hes in situation when he has problem that he has to do something about something to get rid of the something which is moving in on him this phenomenon of mass moving in happens in life too the pc normally responds by trying to do something to it to push it away but that effort will move it closer to him the guy has huge fundamental problem you get it and ask well all right is that your problem and he will say well 719 really the problem was something else you ask the same question again and he says my problem was so and so and so the pc denies each problem as he asises it they are asising in the course of getting down to the main problem sometimes you have problem of missingness there is nothing there to confront this leads to where is it this kind of problem fringes into generality and borders on the arc break this is where the problem fringes on an arc break that is why problems and arc breaks appear to be cousins its gone and where can i find it are borderline to the arc break so it is easy to confuse them but failures to solve arc breaks should have clued you in to the fact that there is something else wrong fifty percent of the reactive bank is devoted to the compulsion to make reactive bank on every process except r6 you should ask about problems not arc breaks unless you realize that you have goofed in the comm cycle in that case lrh would ask about specific parts of the formula not do long list you dont have overts in the absence of problem the problem may be gone but the solutions are still forthcoming you can run responsibility on problems problems and solutions and any number of things the basic mechanism of the mind is that it needs problem situation to lock up time nothing else can stop person on the time track for instance world war ii is still being fought in literature it was problem with lot of solutions and civilization is to large degree still stuck in it as witness the sunday supplements tv programs etc night club could be mocked up like an air raid shelter and make fortune world war ii was postulatecounterpostulate that is still more real to people than pt any point of the time track where civilization is stuck is seen as more real than any new period it is the same with pcs if your pc isnt paying close attention you can assume that the pc is stuck somewhere in back time you can get his attention by finding out where he is locked in time and entering that prior time period if you trigger the back time period you will find yourself there with him you get the pcs overts by going after problems but if he is below causation he wont recognize them as overts because they are necessary solutions just ask for the problem l ron hubbard type 3 idate18565 volnum2 issue61 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec61 organization and ethics 6505c18 shspec61 organization and ethics references hcopl 1may65 iii organization the design of the organization and the policy letters on staff status pp vivii in oec vol 1 staff status policy letters have been issued on the new org board we will remedy an old evil by putting after the persons name his certification and classification as an auditor his grade as pc and his staff status in the past in trying to appoint someone at distance lrh had trouble knowing who was there now copies of org boards will be exchanged between orgs and it will be easy in filling posts to see who is qualified for promotion to be staff member in tech one needs to have technical certificate that covers basics of the organization an admin terminal needs basic cert on the org then he is qualified as provisional staff status i they can be transferred without permission staff status ii is general staff member this individual has worked for and attained solid position from 720 there on it goes up to incharge head of subsection this is the lowest exec rating an officer is in charge of section for instance the cramming officer is in charge of the cramming section then there are titles that are not associated with rank or status eg communicator post can also have deputies post assigned locally is deputy one assigned from st hill would be acting for awhile then the acting prefix is removed and the person has full status acting or deputy do not refer to rank they refer to permanency deputy is somebody who is in there temporarily small breath of air could dislodge him acting denotes st hill appointment after short time up to year the acting prefix is dropped then the person becomes the title without the prefix deputy hco exec sec is someone holding the post until confirmed it is not at all permanent acting hco exec sec is st hill appointment and therefore official to be an acting the person would have to have the appropriate staff status for the post this is not true of deputy but deputy doesnt draw the pay of an acting you put person on post to see how they do you cant wait to fill posts for someone with the proper staff status so we have the deputy rating this appointment must be confirmed by st hill to get an acting rating and full pay acting applies until person knows his hat cold and can apply it policy letters are pouring out covering everything from organizational theory to nitpicky details of minor hats ethics is there to hold the lines and to get technology in ie to make it possible for tech to go in that is its sole purpose and it is fabulously successful in fulfilling that purpose ethics is the tourniquet before the doctor arrives its purpose is to quiet the turbulence down long enough to allow the auditor to come in you carry ethics in until you get tech in it has looked like the publication of someone as an sp has the same effect as public hanging cancelling someones certs has the effect of getting him back in all straightened up within two to two and half years not cancelling the certs results in his going off into the wilds and never showing up again peter crundall for example had his certs cancelled five or six years ago when he was screaming and howling about something he had to get 500 hours of auditing at his own expense now he is being the featured lecturer at an org it took about two years for him to get his auditing started and he got it all handled so it is an unkind thing to do not to bring order into scientology area man has tremendous reaction to justice the purpose of ethics is to get in tech but mans law and mans justice is not like that man wants to squash people who get in his way his justice has end product save punishment it does not straighten out the community therefore it doesnt work police forces have bad morale because there is end product of penal action people know this and react against it and some on an aaa basis will react against ethics in scientology the same way you jar peoples banks when you present the idea of ethics be that as it may greater proportion of people in scientology today favor decent ethics system than are batting back at it this is because they see that good ethics system will give them better training processing and better grip of on scientology you cant sentence someone to technology or to getting better you can sentence him to not getting better one is forcing us to help people if someone keeps getting in the way it is pretty normal to stop wanting to assist him 721 if you feel like blowing up organizations you should very carefully look up the justice actions of organizations and huge governments etc and compare these things if you do this you find some astonishing data the taut ship the viciously conducted regiment the harshly run empire all these survive and flourish with high esprit corps almost forever the sloppy ones succumb rapidly lrh got interested in this phenomenon while reading gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire the only long periods of progressive rule recovery from barbarian attacks and freedom from internal upsets were periods when the emperor was nut the good emperors got killed within few months this didnt jibe with lrhs experience in handling discipline on ship he realized that what works for small intimate group to keep the peace is different from what is needed for big group which gets lots of confusion in an org the points of enturbulation are the ones where the public impinges eg the line of getting the pc from the reg to the d of p this line keeps going out lrh used to wonder if there was something wrong with us to allow us to get enturbulated in this way then he looked at society in general and saw how much worse off their condition is society is deteriorating we are gradiently doing better and better as we expand we reach straight out into the tumult of society we had to have tools to extend our reach so that we could get our jobs done in time lrh found that as people moved up towards ot certain disdain occurred he saw that ethics would be necessary so that ots would take orderly bites out of people when they got annoyed by the disaster to that extent there is need for an ethics system because sufficiently powerful being annoyed at something is liable to straighten it up with such thoroughness that hardly anybody would ever recover and unless they have some orderly method of straightening things up they will straighten things up in their own way and it will make hell of mess the laws of ethics need to be known and understood they need to be predictable they cannot be capricious the question is are you for just shooting somebody down without warning or do you want ethics do you want law that just freakishly strikes down everybody in sight or do you want the kind of law that says here is the path narrow as it may seem in acting on these lines we have ethics rattling around in the orgs people are getting used to the tools you can give someone shock with heavy use of ethics it can be very effective used lightly used in this way ethics backs up tech most amazingly lrh has just discovered the pts case its cause and handling never audit pts the rollercoaster case is one that we have never been able to handle before he is connected to an sp and until ethics makes him disconnect or handle the sp he will continue to rollercoaster ethics can label the suppressive if nothing else you give the pts case the policy letter covering ptsness you dont have to issue an ethics order unless tech doesnt go in ie unless he cant or wont handle or disconnect you can insist that pts bring the sp in if necessary for auditing if things went that far you could threaten the pts person with not getting the sp audited unless the pts person gets him in before he is labeled an sp 722 suppressives are pretty crazy the sp has got to fight he is back on the track fighting the ugbugs he is in an old ptp he is taking the actions in pt that would solve the problem with the ugbugs he is back on the track fighting an enemy that longer exists 99999999999 of his attention units are at some exact precise past period of the track and in that instant he is fighting off something and is trying to handle something by some means which are the ones he is using in pt he has problems with you and vice versa he isnt up there with you and you arent back there with him thats the whole anatomy of psychosis given associative restimulators and aaa youve got maddog type hes just defending himself in some mad insanity against things which are longer there hence the use of power processes on psychotics you can assume that the sp has problems in pt but those are not the problem that he wants to solve that problem is on the back track and it is loaded with crossassociations and identifications he misidentifies anyone who approaches or tries to help him in an effort to defend himself he is driven down to the first dynamic to such degree that one must get any better when he is driven down into the first dynamic he must destroy all around him one must get any better because they are the flying saucer people once scientology is known to be an effective way to help people watch out international city see pp 604609 above is being looked at by group connected to the we are having an effect the true antiscientologist isnt trying to be convinced he is trying to stop you you are the green alligator he is fighting 7000 years ago and if you or anyone else they are all the green alligator got any better you would be stronger and that would tear it and you would eat him up he thinks insanity is just total stuckness on the track in fight this is point that you prove instantly and utterly when you are running power class vii processes on someone power handles the sp and the insane the sp can be processed to sanity in under fifty hours but you had better have the organization and the ethics to hold things together you have to label ptss and sps to get the tech in an ethics action lasts until tech is in you use english to get tech in you stop it when youve got tech in even if stopping at that point leaves unfinished cycles of action along the way its not question of where does the ethics proceed its how long do you have to hold the area down an organization will run as long as it has channels and as long as particles on the channels dont carom off the sides of the channels and collide with the working parts of the organization if you can bring that about you can have an organization that would have total capability of pouring through it practically the whole of the human race lacking clean and definite flow channels your volume stays small because of all the barriers and stoppages that occur if the channel isnt kept open you cant handle the load scientology is probably the only outfit that ever hit this planet that meant exactly what it said and was doing exactly what it was doing and what it said it was doing and was doing exactly nothing else scientology doesnt have the time to do half the things that it has been accused of an sp saying i never said that believes that he really didnt and he is right in sense how the hell could he say anything he hasnt been there for seven trillion years 723 im sure that many enthetaish people believe that weve gone stark staring mad with all this justice were just having little fun with justice just now and when we learn about it why well be able to control fairly well wide sphere of public in such way that they dont all get destroyed the main danger to them is not ethics its having their silly heads blown off because they make somebody mad youve got to have ethics in to handle nonscientologists if you put discipline in right at the start you can work very nicely with nonscientologists make sure that they know what ethics is how it works etc society is losing its grip we are putting in order to make an orderly show for the future l ron hubbard type 3 idate25565 volnum2 issue62 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec62 the five conditions 6505c25 shspec62 the five conditions if it isnt written it isnt true is laid down so that rumors and verbal orders dont foul things up condition is an operating state each condition has formula that must be applied in order to change the state for the better dont misapply formulas if you know the conditions and their formulas you blow lot of the mystery that the rest of the world is sitting in emergency emergency is the most common state on this planet it is the condition of stats going the wrong way usually down over some significant period for instance it is declared by down stat for four consecutive weeks if stat that should go up goes down or vice versa youve got emergency the condition has to be declared by secretarial executive directive which is causative order certain steps then have to be done the first action is promote if an organization or produce if an individual when this has been done but not before economize dont economize on promoting if you do you inhibit getting out anything in order to produce enough money to raise the stat if this happens you will find yourself smaller and weaker after recovering from the crisis taxation is page out of das kapital from each according to his ability to pay to each according to his need dont economize until after you have promoted or produced if an artist in need of money economized first on materials he would have little or nothing to draw with therefore he would have little to sell so he would have trouble getting out of the financial hole after promotion is well in hand economize and prepare to deliver if you apply the affluence formula and economize when you are in emergency you will either stay in emergency or if you recover the organization will be smaller and of less scope also part of the emergency formula is to change your operating basis or you will head back into another condition of emergency youve got to stiffen discipline you have to stop going down to the pub every night do your homework be little more regular on the job work little harder dont goof quite so much if the activity does not come out of the condition of emergency after that state has been assigned then you have to use discipline because life itself is going to discipline the individual very cruelly cog that is why protecting person from the consequences of his actions is outethics you should give the person consequence beforehand that parallels life but anticipates it if the steps of emergency are not taken successfully even if they are taken 724 and the condition of emergency is prolonged it has to walk forward into an ethics matter because someone must be sitting on most of the comm lines goofing like crazy there must be some ethical problem involved for the condition to be continuing normal operation this is the next condition up from emergency it isnt stable unchanging state because everything in the mest universe either expands or contracts nothing stays really unchanging there are laws against it so in order for normal operation to be stable state it must be continual small increase there must be gradual routine increase the way you maintain small increase is to just let everything continue dont change anything dont put in any harsh discipline ethics and justice is mild and reasonable carefully observe every slightest rise of statistic to see what bettered it and do that for every slight worsening find out why usually it is something nonstandard remedy it jockey change and repair back and forth keep an oic board this keeps your improving statistics going up statistic that stays level isnt normal operation its emergency because one should be expanding if only to keep up with inflation the stat must keep pace with the world around it for instance salary that doesnt rise over two to three years is stable really down statistic and will tend to crash what looks level is really declining if one then economizes which is the affluence formula then you will really be in an emergency continuing this practice will result in collapse sooner or later matter and everything else in this universe obeys these laws or conditions the roman empire went into affluence brought about bv julius caesar but it violated the affluence formula they didnt deliver and they didnt economize instead they squandered the wealth of the empire on socalled conquest they treated the condition as normal julius caesar violated the commercial pax romana normal op which was stable by going off conquering tribes etc britain was trading with rome very happily then caesar came over and fought added britain to the empire gave them slavery not civilization and the empire collapsed in the year 0 ad or 1 ad the chinese conquered russia in siberia driving people west wave of displacement took place with the russians driving eastern european peoples into western europe rome didnt handle them it didnt resettle them or whatever they had boundaries to defend so they resisted the barbarian invasions and got overwhelmed it was all matter of the wrong condition being applied the russians who were in emergency didnt apply that condition either there is such thing as nocondition state state of emergency persists until it is handled even if one loses one gets stuck in the incident and goes on even after something has gone down to collapse it persists the condition continues all the way down even beyond death the dwindling spiral is really just applying the wrong formula for the condition 725 affluence the condition of affluence is one which is dangerous surprisingly enough for instance gambler who hits it big is in danger of getting himself in debt instantly the first thing to do now is economize you must economize first then make very sure that you dont buy anything with any future commitment to it eg installment purchases dont hire anybody with any future commitments that is all part of that economizing clamp it down find every bill and debt you can pay and pay them now invest the remainder in service facilities make it more possible to deliver discover what caused the condition of affluence and strengthen it conduct research to discover what caused it it is something you are doing doubt power and power change the condition above affluence is power change for instance someone is very successful and gets promotion the correct formula is usually violated the new man errs by changing things the formula for power change is just because power has changed dont change anything new broom sweeps clean violates this formula if the operation was successful as it was running the new exec would be silly to change things but that is what people usually do it is easy to inherit successful hats just step in the boots and dont walk all the pressure points will come to you to make changes but the person before you must have resisted these successfully if your predecessor didnt sign it dont sign it dont do anything keep your eyes open learn the ropes see how the place is running apply normal operation to it if it is in normal op there are only two circumstances that need replacement success or disaster if it is successful there is nothing to change if someone can keep an organization doing well he is eventually promoted creditably and moves up to higher power position he would be leaving his organization or his post in condition of power if you move into the position of someone who left in disgrace so the place is in emergency just apply the emergency formula promote for starters keep the promotion going until stats start to rise then economize like mad condition of power is most interesting it is peculiar in that it apparently belies what you would normally think or expect to do as an operating thetan because that is condition of power what you mustnt do is disconnect that will bring about catastrophe for you and for anyone else its the violation of that condition alone thats brought about implanting trapping and an antagonism towards thetans guy who becomes powerful on wall street and disconnects from his old home town friends exemplifies this they resent it people are in fact so used to the power formula being violated that they dont expect celebrities that they used to know to talk to them they think you are going to disconnect it is hard to get people to continue talking to you because they feel that you are superior you have to break down the communication barrier when you come back from saint hill people may be in awe of you somewhat again it is up to you to break down the comm barrier people will be sure that you dont want to be in comm anymore beings in the universe fully expect you to violate the power formula if an organization gets to the point where it is fully selfsufficient in need of pcs students etc and disconnects from those around it people in the community will start thinking about implants mistakes and violating any freedom thetan might have they will get very suppressive they are being denied service for one thing one of the most dangerous things we could do would be not to make what we know available 726 when you move out of position on power change the only way you can disconnect is to take ownership and responsibility for your connections the condition of power change is fellow assuming position that has been held from power to disconnect you have to make record of all of your lines you show what is there so that the replacement can then see what not to change make record of your whole post or you will be stuck with piece of that post to the end of time also you might check in once in awhile to see how your replacement is doing guy gets time track by not taking responsibility for something in this universe it is foul trick to permit death people write last will and testament but they dont take responsibility for their former positions by transferring their lines and writing up the post for their successors probably also have trouble checking in from time to time do all you can to make the post occupiable for fun look at the condition of government and the formula it is applying keynes economic law is increase want l ron hubbard type 3 idate8665 volnum2 issue63 rev0

three gpms run out of the middle of the bank by mistake which turned on bursitis he has the first six gpms of the track run out absolutely correctly doubt and wonder about ethics is appearing in some places all we are doing is developing systems to handle the public students and staff are colliding with ethics which has the benefit of giving them familiarity with it if you dont have system of law and order you will never have law and order you will just have cruelty duress suddenness revenge sudden acts of surprising retribution etc without uniform justice you would get chaos especially with ots in operation clausewitz said that war is means of bringing about more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy in his ignorance of this principle fdr kept world war ii going after germany and japan were ready to surrender by demanding unconditional surrender this was costly and stupid thing to do if you fail to halt war when more amenable frame of mind has been reached you are fool war should not go beyond that point this principle should be kept in mind by scientologists and orgs when under attack there are elements of the society that are at war with scientology because they are stuck in past incidents of fighting enemies you should take action against someone who is trying to keep you from doing your job but how much action just enough to being about more amenable frame of mind all you want to enforce on the entheta artist in the environment is certain degree of politeness dont get fixated on the entheta we want to bring service to the 80 who are doing well and contentedly since fixating on the 20 who are snarling and fuming takes attention from the 80 we should simply cut comm with the 20 once there is set procedure for handling sps once the executive can enforce little more politeness on his environment the exec can then reach because he has method of doing so now there is something he can do about it 727 you want the auditor and the executive in frame of mind to service the 80 not the 20 execs tend to wind up with the entheta comm because they are supposed to handle it one tends to get fixated on the maybe cases the ones that arent running perfectly smoothly there are only two sources of difficulty with cases 1 the auditing comm cycle 2 pts you can make mistakes everywhere else and still get by of course there is also the gae as source of difficulty you can check out both the auditor to review to have his comm cycle checked out and the pc to ethics to see if he is pts the d of p doesnt get chance to talk in detail to the auditor and the pc this can be done in qual you dont just let the poor comm cycle continue hoping that it will get better if the auditor is uncooperative he goes to ethics until he has more amenable frame of mind in an exec cannot handle the isolated goofers he will get savage towards everybody if you cannot handle the criminal you pass suppressive laws that penalize everybody inspection before the fact governments police everybody because of the goofs of few most arbitrary rulings by any authority result from failures to handle the guy who goofed with subsequent desperation and savagery cf earlier statement by lrh that an organization is only necessary when there is failure to handle an individual see p 328 above pc who just wont run on average processing is pts or an sp inevitably and invariably lrh found that we couldnt handle the pts individual with auditing especially with processing below the level of power processing ptss are likely to come to you for help so you had better know that they need ethics or power processing anything else will make the pts individual rollercoaster because someone is arc breaking him faster than you can fix him up when you say that person has been suppressed by the environment faster than you could process him out of it what you mean is that there is an sp in the environment who wrecks his gains the pts pc often doesnt spot the sp you must get the pts individual to ethics and find the sp suppressive persons commonly speak in total generalities they broaden and generalize entheta so their identity broadens and generalizes people commonly cant spot the sp because of the generality around him check the pts individual for who he is connected to that doesnt like scientology do this check on meter and watch it fall off the pin have the pt individual handle or disconnect if you get the wrong person the pc wont handle or disconnect if you are right he will the pts gives enough trouble so that you may not care to help him forther but when you do attempt to find the sp you should hunt and punch around enough to get good result if you find the right person as the sp the pcs face will light up the ta will blow down and the pc will then handle or disconnect with vgis ta case gain pts or sp trying to process pts will 1 raise his tone 2 thereby double the sps attacks on him 3 therefore cave him in worse than he was to begin with you can tell pts by looking for rollercoaster periodic gains and collapse gain ever or ta less than ten divs sp that is all you need to look for youve got to have ethics to handle this 728 with this data you can make releases handle students cases free scientology center cases etc you dont have to slam the door in anybodys face the pts gets told to handle or disconnect before he gets more auditing the sp gets told that he has very rough case which can only be handled at st hill in couple of years well have auditors here who can handle you here you could say in the meantime stay away because its very restimulative to you this is true too it is an unkindness not to label someone suppressive who actually is an sp one way to handle someone who sends in entheta comm is simply to deadfile him you have to bring about more amenable frame of mind on his part before you audit him or comm with him dont let auditors go on flubbing send them to ethics so that they realize the importance of applying the tech right know also that we will have an impact on this society that organizations will fold up under the onslaught of the technology matter how nice and theetieweetie we are weve got to hold the line and give service while we expand we would like to have organizations smoothly reorganize to run power processing we need all the backup of the organizations ethics d of p and full admin there is one nastier than someone who has been dished by power processes by the way it would be disaster to have someone trying to run power in the field it isnt the d of ping or the auditing that is hard to do it is the fact that it needs to become an assembly line which requires high degree of perfection of organization even on lowerlevel processes it is best to have team to handle ptss sps and admin psychoanalysis had certain degree of workability it got across the idea that psychosomatic illness stems from the mind the mind monitors and dominates structure if the mind is left alone in large number of cases the endocrine treatment as in the time when lrh psychoanalyzed half of group of people who were taking male hormones and found that those he talked with responded better to the hormones than the others will not monitor structure but when you remove few psychic blocks all of sudden it bites and monitors structure you could change diet exercise operating environment anything and it would make difference lrh just used freudian analysis on that project what we would call today straightwire but as subject psychoanalysis has failed because the individual practitioner had way to ride herd on or handle the ptss and sps in his practice furthermore he had free time or attention to do research he might have discovered power processing if he had the subject never grew because it never developed an organization that would carry forward the research our danger is only that as we move forward the technology will get shattered by alteris that must be guarded against then the technology must be applied now it collides with society psychiatry doctors etc you say all i want to do is go free ok you go into condition of power now the most serious thing you can do is to disconnect its the quickest way to bring about collapse you have been woven into the race and the universe too long to just suddenly pack it up you pack it up itll pack you up 729 we have double route to enlightenment by study and by processing we havent begun to explore what can be done by study alone one area you cant go through with study and thought alone is the r6 bank mere study wont help person beyond release hed finish up at level v grade v there is tiger between release and clear you arent going to go through the h6 bank by just changing your mind that has to be gotten rid of utterly release might or might not occur just from the cognitions you would get from increased understanding the gradation chart actually goes as many as seventy levels below 34 the interpretation of the scale is tricky because it is what the person is aware of not what he manifests that person is always numb does not place him at 10 on the scale numbness what is important is is this person aware of the fact that he is always numb if guy could only be aware of false causes without knowing that they were false then he would be at false cause on the scale if he knew that false cause was false he would be above that level as when he is willing to accept your statement that babies come from under cabbage leaves because it is false cause lets say the guy says hey what do you know i just realized that im always after changes well there he is at 4 need of change you might say that the pcs level on the awareness scale is his cognition level the guy who never cogs is just not being trained or processed at the level where he could cognite he is over his head cogs come on gradient too power processing takes anyone matter where he is and yanks them up with thud to level iv the pc recovers terrific ability to know to be aware without necessarily attaining any more knowledge than he knew before probably this will just be redoubled at clear and ot here also he can create things which he couldnt do before he will not know more about how to do that by having been clear or an ot but his present level of beingness is such that his ability to grasp and act upon the potential of situation to assimilate and accomplish at that particular line whatever line he is in is just lightningfast he only knows what he knew before as well as he knew it before matter how clear you clear him he only knows what he knew before you dont increase his knowledge you increase his awareness of his present environment an individual will never make it without being trained in something the first thing hes going to be aware of as he moves out of comatose wog state into higher level of action is scientology its the first thing there to be aware of to study and it leads to higher ability level the cruelest thing you could do to somebody would be to audit him all the way to clear with auditor training he has this terrific potential to know and you havent made it possible for him to assimilate the technology which has brought him to this state it puts him in dreadful confusion he has understanding he wonders how did i get here wheres here it would be better to audit him up to release then train him up as far as hes been audited level iv then give him tools to go on up to clear then give him an organization to use those benefits in he needs to know how others function let him know then you have given him familiarity with the existence around him he has increased his span of knowledge of what is in scientology he has increased his organizational scope he has come up to an understanding of the 730 usefulness of the various tools of scientology and he has also found out that these new states are moving up into type of civilization that can also exist this will raise his responsibility with all this you are not going to have lot of catastrophe you are going to have happy people this is taking totality of responsibility you must take responsibility for powerful knowledge look what happened to the atom bomb the nut who invented that took responsibility for it we have powerful technology for the first time we have total grip on knowledge of the universe and can bring people up with an express elevator we take as much responsibility as possible you have to take responsibility for knowledge to the degree that it is powerful we had better measure up to our

lrh to firststage release on 24feb63 they went ahead he went keyedout ot then he did more research and plowed himself into the r6 bank then he developed power processes power processes were totally predicted not empirical there they should be and there they were lrh ran the power processes solo when he got to the end all that was there was beginning of track and the r6 bank he backed off and looked for processes that would enable someone to have an ability back he got third stage release va see hcob 28jun65 releases different kinds hcob 12jul65 states of being attained by processing hcob 5aug65 release stages and pp 733738 below you can run it too far into the bank ie into r6ew but now you are at the correct end of third stage release can go into and out of the r6 bank at will he is also able to have selective abilities this probably made class vi easier we are getting an interesting reaction from orgs why are you sending us class vii note at this point class vii is power auditor were releasing all the people we want on 0 i and ii the differences between the stages of release are basically differences of stability the fellow has been gotten to state where he can postulate when he is released at level iv person can remain keyedout clear until he makes postulate wrongwayto and keys himself in again and the r6 bank kicks him in the teeth power release is more stable we still dont get keyedout ot at will although it does occur sometimes during power processing it is easy to overrun first stage release we have cleared many people by the book one definition of clear and then overrun them because the auditor didnt recognize floating needle after that the pc could get very arc breaky all that could be done with pc like this is to run him on power and bring him to higher degree of stability power can also be overrun if you overrun power and then audit someone on ordinary processes within power processing you would really be in trouble because where is only one thing there to hack at and thats the h6 bank you could audit some selective abilities with power plus run him up to third stage release playing tag with the r6 bank then go on to audit r6 731 it is highly unlikely that person will make clear unless he has been released on power the route through the bank is too hard when it lies across an engram that will revivify you are sitting in an engram trying to run r6 and it wont asis properly that is the trouble with it it is interesting to watch raw meat on power they dont know about the r6 bank they feel wonderful and full of awe because they dont know what the hell happened or what is going on after being run on power processes technical advances are out of this world administratively r6 and power look very simple and elementary the trick in instructing class vii note class vii is now power auditing is to get the simplicity of the processes and procedures duplicated when the students are used to complexity confusion has to blow off you run power processes muzzled the study materials have more to them than would at first appear to be the case the evaluation of importances is one area for instance darkroom worker who works for lrh on weekends knows lots of tricks but he doesnt know fundamental importances lrh spotted the similarity to new auditors who arent fully trained in fundamentals they want tricks and shortcuts all of which are interesting but unimportant it isnt the tricks that get anyone anywhere that is what psychiatry and psychology do they collect tricks like stamp collectors but they have effective standard basic tech i have never heard one of them utter one essential piece of information that would have led to the resolution of case fantastic hors doeuvres main course so the study phenomenon is theres the fellow who knows it and can do it and the theres the fellow who knows all the tricks and cant do it it is out evaluation of importances you can take basically sound piece of data eg that pc who never looks at the auditor or who slews around to sit sideways in the chair is arc broken and twist it to something like never acknowledge pc until he looks at you if you did this on power the pc would go round the bend hed go on automatic there is mainline information and then there are tidbits an auditor in training should differentiate between 1 mainline data which is very senior 2 data you should know to apply the senior data 3 parsley data data that if you use it it will make you look very clever nice data but of great value when someone like lrh shifts senior datum people go adrift for instance audit the pc in front of you was senior before grades and organization an org auditor doesnt audit the pc in front of him at all the auditor now audits the process if he sees bis or runs into trouble he sends the pc to review there is policy letter now with all the things on it that could be wrong with the pc hcopl 7apr70ra green form it is asking too much to expect the auditor to pick up the right one in session with form out of 44 possibilities especially when the pc may have overts on that auditor the pc should be repaired by some other auditor the auditor may be part of what is wrong hence the pc needs another auditor 732 review auditors must be experts in assessment they pick up any read and straighten out whatever needs to be fixed whatever the problem is it is not standard tech that is the problem the review auditor is in different division qual the d of p apparently covers also the cs post at this time is forbidden ever to interview pc or talk to an auditor about pc only what can be statisticized is the concern of the d of p total ta process run hours in session etc if the auditor is trying to talk to the d of p about cases he gets job endangerment chit if pc doesnt gain in processing there are reasons why but knowing little tricks wont tell you what they are you cant put beings together again with cute little trick the auditors job is to audit standard processes on the pc with standard comm cycle on standard gradation program the d of p does standard d of ping he goes over the session and checks ta for the session he picks up the next folder the pcs goal is not to have too much trouble in this session the total ta was 27 divs for 2 12 hour session the pc is not in trouble continue the process next folder goals or gains pc restive didnt want to run any processes how many hours were wasted here all morning and all afternoon the pc was arc broken through it all auditor to ethics and pc to review handled in this way cases keep winning if the pc rollercoasters he goes to review then to the examiner then to ethics if the pc cant spot the sp ethics just keeps working it over there is someone who uses generalities that keep the pc from spotting him if you get the right one the ptss face lights like christmas tree if you get the wrong one it wont and it is like indicating the wrong bpc the condition doesnt change that is the only time ethics lays an egg when the pts situation is handled the pc goes back to the hgc and the auditor takes up from where he left off ethical standard matches case level ethics has as purpose making people better not punishing people suppose the org exec sec sees declining stats in the hgc processing is not as successful as before now is the time to look at all the review chits he finds that auditing cycles are out on several auditors he tells the d of p the d of p sends these auditors for special training and gets their comm cycle in lower classed auditors have lower ethical standards to be an excellent review auditor you must be crackerjack assesser be able to make the emeter sit up and sing know the processes called for on the green form be able to audit routine auditing on the grades be able to cs any folder know when to send pc to review and when to review auditors know when process is flat know what gis and bis can be read from folder know what process should be run next know what is good ta and poor ta and be cryptographer so you dont get misunderstoods you should know which auditor to assign to which pc your auditors are not all releases and you know that there are quirks that make auditor audit poorly with certain pcs if you drop out one of those skills you are that much less complete auditor there is review for power processing so power processing is done in review with two class viis csing each other an auditor in training is not being trained as onemanband he gets tired and quits auditing if he tries but he should be able to do the above actions so that he understands what is happening when he audits 733 you only change the standard pattern of the session when the pc gets nonstandard the pc goes to review when he is flat ballbearing the auditor should know how to do green form not because he is going to do one in standard session but because as the org grows more review auditors will be needed the effects of outtech are slower to appear in the hgc maybe six months than in the academy few days people are always fighting to own this planet thats silly why dont they just go ahead and own it as we are doing l ron

that we have been making them for years and auditors have been going on by them running more processes there were probably releases being made in 1951 from 1957 on when lrh made lots of keyedout clears at an acc the 19th american acc 6jan14feb58 tech bulletins vol iii p 204 auditors should have observed what was happening the longer they cleaned cleans the more upset the pc became in exoneration they didnt realize that it is not ok to run process beyond floating needle this goes from ground zero to clear our main problem is overrun if someone got an fn on selfanalysis it would be goof to run more recalltype processes the first level of the case is recognition of the environment so if you asked person to look around and spot where he was and the needle floated you cant run any cchs or if you got an fn on the first objective process the rest of them are null and void if you go on you are cleaning clean this is the groundwork for quickie grades even on power if the needle floats even if the expected ep isnt there you end off fortunately you can run the rest of the power processes but when one process goes free thats it for that process our main problem is overrun this has happened many times to lrh lrh says he was overrun so much that he must have been running other peoples banks r6 is the exception to ending off when you get an fn because all other processes deal with keyout of the r6 bank whereas r6 is total erasure this doesnt apply to gpms when you get an fn you cant contact them and you are in trouble r6 is the only process which is dealing with total erasure all others deal with locks on r6 the levels ultimately begin with the reactive bank theres just the guy and the possibility that he could get aberrated on top of that the r6 bank is built and then on top of that is built tremendous accumulation that we know as end words and on top of those is erected whole series of whole track incidents and other types of gpms known as implants see fig 28 the latter prevented permanent releases by restimulating the original bank the r6 bank engrams are among and on top of implant gpms secondaries are on top of those with locks on the top engrams are restimulations of endwords endwords are restimulations of the r6 bank the whole trick in running r6ew is to get only endwords not to pick up r6 material itself surrounding the lot is the physical universe which could also be considered sort of bank 734 figure 28 structure of the bank graphics inserted what you are doing with pc is carving away at this stack of stuff it contains significances and masses spaces and energies it is also plotted against time but that is all there is in it the machinery and circuits in it are just combinations of energies and significances and as such they are just special case of the above this combination of energies and significances comprises mass that sits there in its own madeup space plotted against the pcs experiential track known as time there is nothing else in the bank although the bank says there is freud and psychoanalysis were popular because they had more r6 in their technologies than other systems they had some written endwords on which they were basing everything by transference freud meant that the pc flipped into another valence the freudians recognized recovery in terms of release of affect by which they meant an emotional discharge especially grief they didnt recognize other emotions besides grief nor did they recognize underlying engrams all anyone has ever been trying to do when he was sincerely trying to help somebody with his mind was reduce the effect of this thing called the reactive mind or the subconscious 735 mind or the unconscious mind upon the individual himself there are many such psychotherapies on the whole track if anyone discovered scientology by himself he probably freed himself and took off there is trace of such an occurrence in the bank however there are many instances on the track where people attacked the gpms of the r6 bank chewed an item or two out or crushed one or some such they would take picture of the area where someone had been and hit big clapstick in front of the photograph to make it look like it exploded they did this when the thetan was anaten or comatose the thetan would get the idea and take his own picture of his misemotional or painful experience and smack it with couple of beams and snap out of it that is what psychotherapy was in the galactic confederacy there were also suppressive technologies which are easily mistaken for helpful technologies implanters developed techniques to have effects on people there are many technologies calculated to have an effect on people when suppressive studies scientology he does so from the viewpoint of trying to have an effect on someone the sp evaluates his action as an auditor by how much effect it had on the pc not by whether it made the pc better the whole subject of alchemy was devoted to throwing the whole r6 level into restimulation throwing the guy into his r6 bank and letting the guy cook thereafter the alchemists had other goal their books writings and practices make it obvious it was the lead of human beings that they wanted to transmute into the gold of spirit transmutation of metals had nothing to do with alchemy it was transmutation of life that they were talking about their books are full of r6 dichotomies if you get one of the guys who has been into alchemy on power and all that comes off is dichotomies he has been plowed into r6 since time immemorial you will have to find the practice that got him into it and fish him out hypnotism is another practice that is only intended to make people more compliant not to better them you have to wake people up to make them better not put them to sleep you dont want suggestibility you want selfdeterminism some states on the whole track had thought tower to pick up hostile thoughts and record them so that the person indulging in crimethink would be turned in for brainwashing this is swindle there never was such thing person was implanted with that idea and placed under compulsion to report to the police if he had bad thought there was another idea on the whole track for controlling thetans you would take piece of thetan and keep it in lab if the thetan escaped they would touch the piece of thetan with hot rods this was also swindle the rule still holds that processing pc who is determined to succumb wont work because there isnt enough agreement in the session that is why you have an argument with hypnotists your purpose is different from theirs the common denominator of suppressive technologies is lies the common denominator of good technology is truth the whole test of sincerity is is the fellow doing what he says hes doing or is he doing something else these two questions have to be answered about any government movement or individual is there falsity on the line all these downgrade subjects have falsity on the line they say they are trying to make people well but their statistics show what is really occurring 736 people assume that the psychiatrist is there to help the person and he isnt its an apparency as mentioned above the question is with psychiatry in charge is the world saner their stats are not just down they are runaway down since psychiatry has entered the field of criminology crime is fabulously on the increase theres falsity on the line what you understand hes doing is not what hes doing psychiatric research is done by deepsixing every scrap of data that doesnt agree with the theory being pushed if you tried that in engineering bridges and buildings would collapse but if some scientist is telling you oh well you have to be very learned to know about this you may swallow it if you are not careful this is also true in the field of art as an auditor you know that when the pc finds and articulates the problem it blows saying that it is something else wont do it so you see that the basic crime in this universe isnt making or destroying things it is altering truth any subject has few alterises in it otherwise it would just disappear but how many alterises does it have that is the question if it has many it will harm instead of helping people it will prove to be striving to create effects on people subjects with lot of alteris are harmful and subjects with relatively little alteris are helpful evil practices are identified by the falsity that is connected with them the worse off pc is the more he thinks hes got in his mind he gets on an additive line he collects and accumulates therapies like pack rat the medical student who gets every disease he reads about is on an additive line and in the direction of additive we actually approach evil on the direction of subtraction we approach good therefore scientology is based on truth the isness not the alterisness is what we care about it is what is in the mind not why is it in the mind cleaning clean brings about the manifestations of evil because since theres not anything there to be cleaned the pc has to put something there you are therefore adding it is adding because there is nothing there to be cleaned therefore the pc and the auditor have to put something there before anything will happen there are only five or six kinds of things in the mind when you are out of one of them you have to put something there to run it out there is reactive mind with certain elements when you have disconnected the pc from that class of element he has ceased to be an effect of it and you can regard it as gone the r6 gpms wont disappear by someone changing his mind or postulates because the r6 bank is tangle of boobytrapped postulates there wouldnt be anything else in the mind if the r6 bank werent there there would be thing or isness pc gets full blanks time track with solid locks because it all relates somehow to some secondary or engram somewhere on the track you start with the r6 bank then on top of it you get wogginess and wooziness on the subject of postulates he accumulates r6ew locks then his own goals as locks get stacked up on this and implants are overlaid on top of this then you get whole track engrams then secondaries then locks eventually with time when the thetan finally became human everything was lock on something earlier in the bank and he made picture of it yesterday runs like an engram he couldnt look at anything in the universe right now without it hanging up on some experience hes had that he didnt like theres the bank so the thetan gets full time track 737 the thetan is also surrounded by the physical universe which gives him problems additionally there are other peoples universes which are different experientially this can also give him ptp that doesnt have anything to do with mental image picture or reactive bank but it can restimulate the reactive bank and thus be harder to solve ptp can exist as such independent of the bank if you get your hand caught in clothes wringer it is ptp it doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the bank the fact that thetans attention is stuck on ptp keeps him from putting his attention on anything else so he makes gain you can usually handle the problem on the basis that it is problem because he doesnt think he can handle it he has entered lie into it so he doesnt try to do anything about it so it continues to be problem the lie in problem is 1 that it exists and is problem or 2 that one can do nothing about it to handle it if the auditor could get the pc to confront the problem to take it apart and get its elements and take the lies out of the problem the pc could probably confront it and it would cease to be problem however the problem isnt necessarily entirely in the pcs mind every time an arc break is situation where the pc feels under some sort of attack from an unknown source in its inception an arc break is actually an incomplete cycle of action in all likelihood there is some big lie entered into it but the main upset is that the pc couldnt complete what he was doing pc isnt auditable when he is in an arc break because he cant put his attention on anything else it is presence of time that makes ptp as human beings all of us have to some degree an underthegun existence the amount of duress that person is under is proportionate to the degree that he thinks it threatens his survival you can tolerate quite bit of it unless you are on the skids already when the pc is upset the auditor cant get away with making mistakes when the pc is feeling good he can get away with some if you have managed to get the pc disconnected from his arc breaks ptps etc and then go on auditing him on them you are invalidating his ability to confront you are giving him the idea that he ought to be bothered by them when you see the fn dont give two more commands dont get him to itsa some more send him to the examiner let the pc have his win one more command and you are cleaning clean he is out of that outrud the connectors to the bank are gone in that area in trying to find an overrun after the fact youre looking in the goneness for the what wentness and youre looking through mass of it wasnt there anywayness afterwards release isnt just disconnected from the bank he has erased stratum of it in rehabbing you are getting rid of additives third stage release grade va leads the pc through the physical environment contact with the bank and ends up cutting off the r6ew top just going off the top of those floating endwords you can get the pc off of what pins him into those endwords you can just separate that each of the grade v and va processes is run to fn there are four processes on va one having to do with people one with where the pc has been etc power processing is very close to the truth therefore it must be run very standardly 738 after running va there is nothing between the pc and the r6 bank itself now of course he can dive off the shade of this and he has protective coating between him and the r6 bank it stands there naked and raw hes got the r6ew spans that are lying in and amongst the gpms etc he can run those like shot r6ew can run to fn there is actually fourth stage release on r6ew running gpms one can go to fn thus getting fifth stage release by running gpms but these arent important the state of clear is what is important you dont want to go free of the body and leave some of the bank around to key in later in rehabbing you get the liability that you may find yourself working on the next stage up and the rehab process is not calculated to handle the next stage l ron hubbard type 3 idate9965 volnum2 issue66 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec66 classification and gradation 6509c09 shspec66 classification and gradation we have twenty people going for clear we are really getting an assembly line going the world is going downhill but we are reversing the curve all the laws passed to hit mr big end up hitting the worker the effect of the east grinstead city councils refusal to permit building as soon as needed is to make the staff work harder in very little space the maharaja of jaipur who used to own st hill wanted to build forty cottages and polo field the city planners denied him permission so he sold st hill to lrh furthermore the council never meets they didnt meet all august during the best building weather technical advances now consist of improvements in application of the existing technology technology that cannot be applied is not useful some things arent even meant to be applied eg pure mathematics lrh while he was in college suggested applying an abstruse form of mathematics to aerial navigation he was told that he would be flunked out of college if he continued this mathematical principle was later developed by the navy into loran we have had more technology than we have had application there was bug in the application which was not teaching auditors to recognize fns so the only thing holding up scientology has been the failure on the part of auditors to know or recognize the floating needle the trouble that we had with r212 was that it is too fast you have to be on your toes because your pc will go release perhaps before you have finished the first list overrun on k212 can be terrible unfortunately it was done regularly we overran our success point by many years on this process the main trouble you have today isnt getting result it is recognizing that you have gotten it saint hill students have had trouble getting classified for levels iii and iv because of the problem of auditing someone up to grades 3 and 4 people went release before they got to the processes required for those classification levels tech exists now we need to get it applied we have enough tech on world basis we need the technology of dissemination supplied this tech is in the fsm appointment letter if you can see it and it is also released elsewhere we are used to being improved or fixed by being passive and letting things be done to us but the individual is what we are interested in as final product it is interesting how long it can sometimes take for the individual to find himself somewhere around fourth stage release r6ew ep the individual finds himself with 739 an answer to the question who am i namely im not as an intellectual knowledge but as total connection with self all the way back what has disappeared is all the times when the individual has been various identities the gains he gets can seem microscopic yet full of impact as he goes up the line these gains can get incredibly simple as things blow and stops get asised the individual feels that he could always have done whatever ability he has just attained he could have but he didnt so any commentary about the ability of thetan has to come off as an invalidation by understatement any assertion of ability is thus an invalidation you could make the wildest statement you could possibly dream up and then assert that as your own ability eventually youd have to get it off your case as invalidation of self recovery from illness could be related to dissemination you might have pain in the head and not know it until you become aware of it and it blows so that you feel much better what the pc assigns as gain is generally great understatement of the real gain the route the bridge when you first say to someone we will make you better they immediately ask better what better bank robber or is my lumbosis going to be better the difficulty is in trying to communicate what we are trying to do in scientology to someone who has inkling that that sort of thing can happen telling someone who thinks that he is body that he is himself is very hard people tell each other that man is an animal and when he dies he is gone dead this happens even though they dont believe it of themselves man has only believed that he is an animal for the past 7590 years psychology has changed since dmsmh was published it used to say that mans intelligence and condition couldnt be changed it is therefore difficult to tell someone on the street that he can get better you have to show him you can use graph the classification and gradation chart showing that there are these various states so he sees that there is place to go he can get reality on the level just above where he is by visualizing the graph he will see which way to go however it is unlikely that he will have any reality on the levels beyond the next level up life is improved on gradient not by leaps into ot from db if you buy the idea that you could become ot by inspection etc then you are also buying the idea that you dont have anything to do with life because it is you and your awareness that is improving not the attendant and appendant machinery with which you are surrounded we are handling life you must give an individual gradient that is real to him for instance to sick man not hurting is real after you have handled this then you could get him to consider sitting up if you ignore the gradient you can advance person more rapidly than he can tolerate when you promise person that he will made too big jump in too little time you set him up to get big lose people on this planet were not issued an instruction book on themselves how do you learn about yourself you learn by studying one lesson at time by getting one improvement at time you can advance person beyond his tolerance rate in processing 740 the bridge we have is across an actual chasm the way across is by the bridge not off the edge the gradation and classification plan is designed to prevent people from going into the abyss the grade chart prevents loses by providing gradient ethics is the traffic cop the chart has an elastic bottom some people start from zero some people start from lower states level 34 is unexistence there are states way below unexistence on the awareness scale but someone in one of these states wont be able to read the chart as person at given level on the awareness chart improves he is likely to become aware of the next level but he cant skip levels his position on the awareness chart is not question of his behavior or what he is dramatizing it is what he as being is aware of person at unexistence when he improves becomes aware of disconnection level 33 misconnection would be an improvement over existence at all he gets the idea that hes disconnected from things he becomes aware of alert to the fact that in life he is actually disconnected person at fixidity level 27 wont find power real but he will become aware of ridicule or glee level 26 laugh at him and hell notice the awareness scale doesnt show what the guy is dramatizing it is not his behavior that counts it is what he himself as being is aware of it is what hes aware of not what you are aware of about him if the person is aware that he is introverted level 11 he can then and only then become aware of the fact that he is numb numbness level 10 at this level the individual gets reaction from life need of change level 4 is very high state most homo sapiens wonder how they can endure the thing they cant change the one thing scientology does do for sure is to change conditions so someone has to be up to level 4 before he can become scientologist person who has to be helped may not be aware of help or the possibility of it someone who only wants to receive help and doesnt want to give it isnt really up to the help level level 11 being aware of help is sixflow operation person who is unwilling to help others is not up to help on the awareness chart someone moving up the chart through the levels does achieve the awareness at each level above that the person has recognition he sees where he is his orientation becomes better he begins to recognize himself and others for what they are he gets up to where he can communicate then perceive then get oriented you cant find out where you are unless you can perceive where you are then comes understanding then enlightenment enlightenment never takes place before understanding people think it can and modern universities are dedicated to it above that guy gets return of his energy an adjustment he becomes aware of the fact of body and that he is not body he gets to where he can predict he goes into action he sees himself as capable of production he knows result when he sees one he can review the things of his life and take care of it he regains his ability his own purposes start coming out straight he didnt ever realize he was really running on other peoples purposes he gets clearing of his entire past and other purposes and realization of himself and then he goes into state where he is capable of power comprising conditions existence and source the top of the scale of awareness but by the time he gets into that state he is of course totally responsible and can be trusted with it otherwise he wont make it 741 the grades approximate these steps the gradation chart parallels and makes possible the attainment of these awareness levels there are four states of release up to grade 6 then you get clear this is another state of release an ot is capable of operating with or without body he is himself he is independent of the universe around him the only thing that stands in the way of just getting person to become of each level one after another is the machines and odds and ends that he has around him and that have to be dealt with it is hard for person to get close to himself and confront these things you have to know the secret of dealing with these things the actual length of time that it took to find and develop the bridge is more than fifteen or thirty years it would be hard for most people to believe how long it has taken but anyhow it has been done l ron hubbard
