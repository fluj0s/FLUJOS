1 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566the foreign intelligence surveillance act sketch of selected issues introduction the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 pl 95511 92 stat 1783 october 25 1978 50 usc 1801 et seq hereinafter fisa was enacted in response both to the committee to study g overnment operations with respect to intelligence activities otherwise known as the church committee revelations regarding past abuses of electronic surveillance for national security purposes and to the somewhat uncertain state of the law on the subject while fisa now provides statutory framework for gathering foreign intelligence information through the use of electronic surveillance physical searches and pen registers or trap and trace devices and access to business records and other tangible things the 1978 act dealt only with electronic surveillance the pr ovisions passed almost 30 years ago became title i of fisa as originally enacted the measure provided statutory framework for collection of foreign intelligence information through the use of electronic surveillance of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers as those terms were defined in the act the act has been amended repeatedly in the intervening years in an effort to address changing circumstances then as now the congress sought to strike balance betw een national security interests and civil liberties number of fisa bills have received recent attention in the 110th congress on august 5 2007 the protect america ac t pl 11055 was enacted into law this measure in part construed the term electronic surveillance under fisa not to include surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside of the united states and provided author ity for warrantless acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states where certain criteria were satisfied as originally enacted the measure was to sunset on february 1 2008 on january 29 2008 both the house and the senate passed hr 5104 15day extension to the sunset for the protect america act to allow further time to consider pass and go to conference on proposed legislation to amend fisa while ensuring that the intelligence community would have the authority it needed in the in tervening period it was enacted into law as pl 110182 the house of representatives passed hr 3773 the responsible electronic surveillance that is overseen review ed and effective act of 2007 or the restore act of 2007 on november 15 2007 while s 2248 was reported out of the senate select committee on intelligen ce on october 26 2007 and an amendment in the nature of substitute to s 2248 the foreign intelligence surveillance amendments act of 2007 or the fisa amendments act of 2007 was reported outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs2 of the senate judiciary committee on n ovember 16 2007 modified version of the senate judiciary committees amendment in the nature of substitute to s 2248 was tabled the senate passed s 2248 the fisa amendments act of 2008 as amended on february 12 2008 after striking all but the enacting clause of hr 3773 and inserting the text of s 2248 as amended the senate then passed hr 3773 the fisa amendments act of 2008 on march 14 2008 the house passed an am endment to the senate amendment to hr 3773 after intensive negotia tions compromise bill hr 6304 was introduced in the house on june 19 2008 the measure passed the house the following day cloture motion on the m easure was presented in the senate on june 26 2008 further activity on hr 6304 is antic ipated after the senate returns from the july 4th recess the current legislative and oversight activity with respect to electronic surveillance under fisa has dr awn national attention to veral overarching issues this report briefly outlines three such issues and touches upon some of the perspectives reflected in the ongoing deba these issues include the inherent and often dynamic tension between national security and civil liberties particularly rights of privacy and free speech the need identified by the director of national intelligence dni admiral mike mcconne ll for the intelligence community to be able to efficiently and effectively collect foreign intelligence information from the communications of foreign persons located outside the united states in changing fastpaced and technologically sophisticated internati onal environment and the differing approaches suggested to meet this need and limitations of liability for those electronic communication service provide rs who furnish aid to the federal government in its foreign intelligence coll ection this report briefly examines these issues and sets them in context tension between national security and civil liberties two constitutional provisions in particular are implicated in this debate the fourth and first amendments the fourth amendment to the us constitution provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrant shall issue but upon probable cause s upported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be arched and the persons or things to be seized the first amendment to the us constitution provides congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs3 the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances as the fourth amendment protects the peoples privacy rights so the first amendment reflects recognition of the value of free expression of ideas and lawful political dissent to the preservation of free society in introducing s 1566 the bill that became the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 pl 95511 sena tor edward kennedy addressed the challenge of striking an appropriate balance between the legitimate government need to safeguard the nation against the intelligence activities of foreign agents and the concomitant need to protect civil liberties stating the complexity of the problem must not be underestimated electronic surveillance can be useful tool for th governments gathering of certain kinds of information yet if abused it can so constitute particularly indiscriminate and penetrating invasion of the privacy of our citizens my objective over the past six years has been to reach some ki nd of fair balance that will protect the security of the united states without infringing on our citizens human liberties and rights this sentiment was echoed in hearing before the senate judiciary committee on s 1566 when attorney general griffin be ll testified for the carter administration in favor of the measure i believe this bill is remarkable not only in the way it has been developed but also in the fact that for the fi rst time in our society the clandestine intelligence activities of our government sh all be subject to the regulation and receive the positive authority of public w for all to inspect president carter stated it very well in announcing this bill when he said that one of the most difficult tasks in free society like our own is the correlation between adequate intelligence to guarantee our nations security on the one hand and the preservation of basic human rights on the ot her it is very delicate balance to strike but one which is necessary in our society and balance which cannot be achieved by sacrificing either our nation s security or our civil liberties in providing background for its report on hr 7308 the house fisa bill then under consideration the house permanen t select committee on intelligence noted the history and law relating to electroni c surveillance for national security purposes have revolved around the competing demands of the presidents constitutional powers to gather intelligence deemed necessary to the security of the nation and the requirements of the fourth amendment the us supreme court has never expressly decided the issue of whether the president has the constitutional authority to authorize warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes whether or not the president has an inherent power to engage in or authorize warrantless electronic surveillance and if such power exists what limitations if any rest rict the scope of that power are issues that have troubled constitutional scholars for decades electronic surveillance can provide vital information needed to identify those who are acting or preparing to act against us interests for the benefit of foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs4 powers including those engaged in espiona ge sabotage or terrorist acts or who otherwise pose threat to the nation or its citizens and to uncover their plans or activities this information may not be readily uncovered by other investigative means thus surveillance can provide valuable tool for protecting the security of the nation and its citizens however this investigative technique by its nature can intrude into the privacy of both the target of the surveillance and those with whom the target communicates it also has the potential of chilling political discussion and lawful dissent the framing of the current debate on this issue flows in part from questions arising with respect to the terrorist surveillance program tsp first revealed in press accounts in december 2005 while little information regarding the details of this nsa program is publicly available the president has indicated that since shortly after september 11 2001 he had au thorized the national security agency nsa to intercept international communications into and out of the united states of persons linked to queda or related terrorist organizations the purpose of the intercepts is to establish an early warning system to detect and prevent another catastrophic terrorist attack on the united states concerns surrounding the tsp have led to continuing c ongressional oversight and num ber of legislative proposals focused upon providing the intelligence community with the tools it needs for foreign intelligence collection to protect the united states and its citizens while also protecting the civil liberties of those impacted by such collection the current level of complexity and sophistication of global communications technology can provide both increased opportunities for lawful private communications and public debate and increased means for communications between those engaged in criminal wrongdoing or plans or actions which pose threat to us national security while this presents challenges to intelligence collection for foreign intelligence purposes the government has moved to utilize these new technologies for both law forcement and intelligence purposes the balance between these important gove rnmental needs and protections of constitutionally protected privacy interests and first amendment protected activities is dynamic and there can be differences of opinion as to where the appropriate balance point between them may be found collection of foreign intelligence information from foreign persons and united states persons located abroad second related issue in the current debate concerns the appropriate circumstances or standards for collection of foreign intelligence information from foreign persons and united states persons abroad this issue can best be understood when set in the context of recent developments to the extent that pertinent information is publicly available in july 2007 an unclassified summary of the national intelligence estimate nie on the terrorist threat to the us homeland was released the nie expressed the judgement in part that th us homeland will face persistent andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs5 evolving threat over the next three years the main threat coming from islamic terrorist groups and cells pa rticularly qaeda in january 17 2007 letter to chairman leahy and ranking member specter of the senate judiciary committee then attorney general gonzales advised them that on january 10 2007 foreign inte lligence surveillance court judge issued orders authorizing the government to target for collection international communications into or out of the united states where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is member or agent of qaeda or an associated terrorist organizati on the attorney general stated that in light of these orders which will allow the necessary speed and agility all surveillance previously occurring under the terrorist surveillan ce program tsp woul d now be conducted subject to the approval of the fisc he indicated furthe r that under these circumstances the president had determined not to reauthorize the tsp when the then current authorization expired the attorney general also noted that the intelligence committees had been briefed on the highly classified details of the fisc orders and advised chairman leahy and senator specter that he had directed the acting assistant attorney general for the office of legal counsel and the assistant attorney general for national security to provide them classified briefing on the details of the orders because the conten ts of these orders remain classified the scope of or limitations with respect to any authority that may have been provided remain unknown on april 13 2007 the administration nnounced that it had submitted draft legislation to the congress regarding modernization of fisa this draft legislation included proposed new section 102a of fi sa which would authorize the president acting through the attorney general to permit acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning persons reasonably be lieved to be outside the united states if the attorney general certifies in writing under oath that he has made four specifi c determinations on august 2 2007 the dni released statement on modernization of the foreign intelligence surveillance act in his statement admiral mcconnell regarded such modernization as necessary to respond to technological changes and to meet the nations current intelligence collection needs he viewed it as essential for the intelligence community to provide warning of threats to the united states one of two critically needed changes perceived by the dni was his view that court order should not be required for gatherin g foreign intelligence from foreign targets located overseas admiral mcconnell di d however indicate that he would be willing to agree to court review after co mmencement of needed collection of the procedures by which foreign intelligence is gathered through classified methods directed at foreigners out side the united states some news accounts suggest that fisc court ruling this spring may have limited the authority of the united states in certain circumstances to engage in surveillance of foreign conversations taki ng place outside the united states admiral mcconnell stated in remarks included in th transcript of an interview published in the paso times on august 22 2007 that on or about may of this year when another judge of the fisc considered an pplication for renewal or extension of the surveillance approved under the january 10 orders that judge interpreted thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs6 requirements of fisa differently from th judge who had issued the january 10 orders and deemed fisa warrant necessary for surveillance of wire communications of foreign person in foreign country views differ as to the scope of the need and the means by which this need may be met can this concern be addressed by solutions di rected solely at electronic surveillance or acquisitions without c ourt order from the fisc of communications between foreign persons in communication with other foreign persons all located outside the united states whether or not those communications are routed through the united states at some point in their transmission or must the solution be crafted in such way as to permit such surveillance or acquisitions of the communications of foreign persons located abroad whethe r they may be in communication only with other nonus persons or both nonus pe rsons and us persons located outside the united states what is required if some of the communications of the foreign person targeted in the surveillance or acqui sition are with us persons or nonus persons located in the united states may such foreign intelligence be collected from us persons abroad without fore ign intelligence surveillance court order pursuant to certification by the attorney general or the attorney general and the dni jointly or whether court order is required prudentially or constitutionally under the fourth amendment legislative response foreign intelligence surveillance of foreign persons abroad on august 5 2007 the protect america ac t of 2007 was enacted into law pl 11055 which provided that nothing in the defin ition of electronic surveillance under section 101f of fisa shall be cons trued to encompass surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside of the united states it also created new procedure under section 105ba of fisa under which the attorney general and the dni for periods of up to one year may authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the united states if the attorney general and the dni determine based on the information provided to them that five crite ria have been met this authority was similar but not identical to the proposed section 102a of fisa in the administrations draft bill pl 110 55 expired on february 16 2008 after passage of fifteenday extension to its origin sunset date under the transitional provisions in section 6 of th protect america act the acquisitions authorized while the act was in force may continue until their expiration hr 3773 as originally passed by the house provides that court order is needed for electronic surveillance directed at acquisition of the contents of communications between persons not known to be us persons who are reasonably believed to be located outside the united states without regard to whether the communication is transmitted through the united states or the surveillance device is located in the united states if the communications of us person are inadvertently intercepted stringent constraints upon rete ntion disclosure dissemination or use would apply howeve r the bill provides for fisc order for acquisitions for up to one year of comm unications of nonus persons reasonably believed to be outside the us to collect most types of foreign intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs7 information by targeting those persons where those persons may be communicating with persons inside the united states it also establishes requirements for such acquisitions the senate amendment to hr 3773 woul d permit the attorney general and the dni to jointly authorize for up to one ear targeting of pers ons reasonably believed to be outside the us to acquire foreign intelligence information if certain statutory criteria are met the senate bill does not require prior approval by the fisc of applicable certifications targeting pr ocedures and minimization procedures in connection with the acquisition of communi cations of nonus persons abroad nor does it require adoption and s ubmission of compliance guidelines rather it requires submission of certification or targ eting or minimization procedure or an amendment thereto to the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc within five days of making or amending the certifica tion or adopting or amending the procedure where the attorney general and the dni determine that immediate action is required and time does not permit preparation of certification prior to initiation of an acquisition the senate bill re quires the attorney general and the dni to prepare the certification including such termination within seven days after the determination is made if the fisc finds that certification meets statutory requirements and targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with statutory requirements and meet constitutional standards under the four th amendment the fisc would enter an order approving continued use of the pr ocedures involved if the court finds that the required standards are not met then th fisc would enter an order directing the government at the governments election and to the extent required by the fisc order to correct any ficiencies within 30 days or cease the acquisition in the absence of an emergency aut horization the house amendment to the senate amendment to hr 3773 requires prior approva l by the fisc of the applicable targeting procedures minimiza tion procedures and certification before the attorney general and the director of national intelligence dni may authorize acquisition of the contents of communi cations of nonus persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states the fi sc would have 30 days after certification is submitted to review the certification and the targeting and minimization procedures and to approve or deny an order regarding such an acquisition the house amendment also requires the attorney general in consultation with the dni to adopt guidelines to ensure compliance with limitations imposed by the bill on such acquisitions and to ensure that an application is filed under section 104 or 303 of fisa if required by that act th guidelines are to be submitted to the fisc the congressional intelligence committees and the house and senate judiciary committees hr 6304 would amend fisa to permit the attorney general and the dni to jointly authorize targeting of persons r easonably believed to be nonus persons located outside the united stat for periods of up to one year proposed section 702 of fisa contains explicit limitations including protections against reverse targeting in connection with the acquisition of th communications of such persons certification by the attorney general and the dni that certain statutory criteria have been met applicable targeting procedures and minimization procedures would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs8 subject to judicial review by the fisc the certification would attest in part that procedures are in place that have been approved have been submitted for approval or will be submitted with the certificati on for approval by the fisc that are reasonably designed to ensure that an acquisition is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states and to prevent the intentional acquisition of any communica tion where the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acqui sition to be located in the united states generally if the certification and targeting and minimization procedures meet the statutory requirements and are consistent with the fourth amendment fisc order approving them would be issued prior to implementation of the acquisition of the communications at issue if the fisc finds deficiencies in the certification targeting procedures or minimization procedures the court would issue an order directing the government to at the governments election and to the extent required by the courts order correct any such deficiency within 30 days or cease or not begin the implementation of the authorization for which the certification was submitted legislative response foreign intelligence surveillance of us persons outs ide the united states generally the full extent of fourth am endment protections attach to the privacy interests of us persons within the ited states fourth amendment protections also attach to us citizens abroad however the operation of its protections outside the united states may differ from that in the united states due to the fact that citizen abroad may not have the same ex pectation of privacy in addition the warrant clause of the fourth amendmen t may not apply outside the united states where us magistrates have jurisdiction determin ation whether interception of communication abroad is lawful rns upon the law of the country where the interception occurs so depending upon cation the rights available may differ significantly in addition the availability of fourth amendment protections are affected by whom the search was executed and the extent of any us role if the us plays role then the fourth ame ndment does not attach and the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained by or derived from such search unless the foreign conduct shocks the conscience on the other hand if warrantless electronic surveillance targeted at u s citizens communications is conducted abroad for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence by us officials the us district court in united states v bin laden 126 f supp 2d 264 277 sdny 2000 has held that it will be deemed reasonable if it is author ized by the president or the attorney general pursuant to the pres idents delegation and th surveillance was conducted primarily for foreign intelligence purposes and targets foreign powers or their agents in addition to considering the scope of constitutional privacy protections available to us citizens or us persons abroad the 110th congress in fisa legislation before it is also considering what it deems the appropriate level of privacy protection to be afforded such persons while outside the united states in addition to the protect america act of 2007 pl 11055 august 5 2007 the senatepassed amendment to hr 3773 the housepassed amendment to the senate amendment to hr 3773 and hr 6304 each addresses procedures for targeting us personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs9 reasonably believed to be located outside the united states to collect foreign intelligence information the senate amendment to hr 3773 the house amendment to the senate amendment to hr 3773 and hr 6304 each provide for targeting of us persons reasonably believed to be locat ed outside the united states for up to 90 days pursuant to fisc order if statutory criteria are t such an order could be renewed for additional 90day periods upon submission of renewal app lications meeting the same standards in the case of an emergency authorization by the attorney general of an acquisition each bill requires notice to fisc judge by the attorney general or his designee at the time the decision is made to conduct such an ac quisition and requires the filing of an application for fisc order within seven days of the attorney generals authorization of the emergency acquisition minimization procedures would apply to such an acquisition under each of these bills in the abse nce of judicial order approving an acquisition originally authorized by the ttorney general on an emergency basis the acquisition would terminate when the in formation sought is obtained when an application for the order is denied or wh seven days have elapsed whichever is earliest without fisc order inform ation acquired or evidence derived from an emergency acquisition except under circum stances where the target of the acquisition is determined not to be u s person may be received in evidence or disclosed in federal state or local proceedings nor could any information concerning us person acquired from ch acquisition subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manne r by federal officers or em ployees without the consent of such person except with the approval of the attorney general if the information indicates threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person limitations on liability for telecommunications providers furnishing aid to the government the second of the two critical needs identified by the dni in his august 2nd statement was need for liability protection for those who furnish aid to the government in carrying out its foreign intelligence collection efforts he sought both retrospective relief from liability for those who are alleged to have aided the government from september 11 2001 to the present in connection with electronic surveillance or collection of other co mmunications related information and prospective liability protection for those telecommunications providers who furnish aid to the government in the future whether pursuant to court order or certification by the attorney general or the attorney general and the dni that the acquisition or electronic surveillance involve d is lawful and that all statutory requirements have been met under current law there are number of statutory sections which provide some limitation on liab ility for tel ecommunication providers who furnish aid to the government in connection with electronic surveillance or physical search or the installation of pen register or trap nd trace device pursuant to court order underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs10 fisa in addition 18 usc 25112a ba rs suit in any court against any provider of wire or electronic communication service its officers employees or agents landlord custodian or other specified person for providing information facilities or assistance in accordance with the terms of court order statutory authorization or certification in writing by the attorney general or person specified under 18 usc 25187 that warrant or court order is required by law that all statutory requirements have been t and that the specified assistance is required prospective relief from liability for those furnishing aid to the government pursuant to court order or certification or directive pursuant to statute requiring compliance with government demands for ssistance is contemplated in number of bills including hr 3773 as originally passed the senate am endment to hr 3773 the house amendment to the senate am endment to hr 3773 and hr 6304 all three versions of hr 3773 and hr 6304 au thorize the fisc to compel compliance through the contempt power as di d pl 11055 while it was in force retroactive immunity presents more difficult issues there are currently pending substantial number of law suits against the telecommunications providers who are alleged to have furnished aid to the government in connection with its warrantless surveillance programs ce september 11 2001 and other programs approximately 40 of these suits are curren tly pending in the northern district of california under an order of the judicial panel on multidistrict l itigation on august 9 2006 pursuant to 28 usc 1407 the judi cial panel on multid istrict litigation transferred 17 civil actions th at were pending throughout the country to the northern district of california and assigned them to judge vaughn walker for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in in re national security agency telecommunications records litigation mdl1791 another 26 cases were treated as potential tagalong actions under the mu ltidistrict litigation ru the panel of five federal trial nd appellate court judg found that all these class actions share factual and legal questions regarding alleged government surveillance of telecommunications activity and the par ticipation in or cooperation with that surveillance by individual telecommunications companies and thus centralization of the cases is necessary in order to eliminate duplicative discovery prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings particularly with respect to matte rs involving national security and conserve the resources of th parties their counsel and the judiciary arguments may be made on both sides with respect to whether retroactive immunity should be granted telecommunicati ons providers who are alleged to have assisted the government in such progra ms for example the cooperation of such providers is critical to the governments capacity to pursue electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information nd is also essential for collection of communications records for pattern analys is if the telecommunication providers who responded to the governments reque sts or demands for assistance did so in good faith reliance upon assertions by the government that th demand was lawful and that court order was not required it may be argued that the providers should be immunized from ill effects flowing from such good faith reliance some have argued that the unique factual context militates in favor of such relief from liability to the extent those who responded to the governme nts requests for assistance in the wake of 911 did so in response to government assertions that their cooperation was necessary to protect against further attacks httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs11 in many of the suits filed the government has asserted states secrets privilege with respect to the programs involved and the role of any of the telecommunications carriers with respect thereto this is common law evidentiary privilege which may only be asserted by the government that protects information from discovery when its disclosure would be inimical to the national security the privilege can come into play in three ways if the very subject matter of the case is state secret an assertion of the privilege can cause the case to be immediately dismissed and the action barred if however this prong of the state secrets privilege does not apply the privilege may operate to bar admission into evidence of information which will damage the security of the united states the plaintiff then goes forward on the basis of evidence not covered if the plaintiff cannot prove prima facie case with nonprivileged evidence then the case may be dismissed on the other hand if the privilege deprives defendant of information that would otherwise give the defendant valid defense to the claim then the court may grant summary judgment to the defendant in the current context to the extent that defendant telecommunica tions providers may have valid claim of immun ity under 18 usc 25112a but for the application of the state secrets privilege to the identities of any providers who may have furnished aid to the government an argument may be made that the telecommunications providers so impacted should be afforded immunity from suit on the other hand such suits may be the only means by which those who may have been adversely impacted by such government activities may obtain any remedy for any injuries incurred these injuries may have impacted first and fourth amendment protected interests and ther may be other means of vindicating those rights in addition the telecommuni cations providers provide the front line of defense of those rights against governme ntal abuse if the government demand or request is unlawful in some instances it may be argued that telecommunications provider has statutory obligation to protect customer records from unlawful access such arguments militate against affording relief from liability to any providers who may have permitte d unlawful access in addition to these arguments some have argued that because the administration has not shared information repeatedly sought by some committees of jurisdiction with respect to the role of the telecommunications providers in the tsp or other pertinent intelligence activities the congress does not have adequate information to determine whether relief for the telecommunications carriers is warranted legislative response under proposed section 802a of fisa in title ii of hr 6304 civil action may not lie or be maintained in fede ral or state court against any person for providing assistance to an element of the intelligence community and must be dismissed promptly if the attorney genera l certifies to the us district court in which the action is pending that 1 any assistance by that person was prov ided pursuant to an order of the court established under section 103a directing such assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34566crs12 2 any assistance by that person was provided pursuant to certification in writing under
