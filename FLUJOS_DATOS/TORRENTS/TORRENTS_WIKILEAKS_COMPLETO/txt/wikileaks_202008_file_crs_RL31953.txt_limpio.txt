specialist in telecommunications and internet policy resources science and industry division spam an overview of issues concerning commercial electronic mail summary spam also called unsolicited commercial email uce or junk email aggravates many computer users not only can spam be nuisance but its cost may be passed on to consumers through higher charges from internet service providers who must upgrade their systems to handle the traffic also some spam involves fraud or includes adultoriented material that offends recipients or that parents want to protect their children from seeing proponents of uce insist it is legitimate marketing technique that is protected by the first amendment and that some consumers want to receive such solicitations on december 16 2003 president bush signed into law the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing canspam act pl 108 187 it went into effect on january 1 2004 the canspam act does not ban uce rather it allows marketers to send commercial email as long as it conforms with the law such as including legitimate opportunity for consumers to optout of receiving future commercial emails from that sender it preempts state laws that specifically address spam but not state laws that are not specific to email such as trespass contract or tort law or other state laws to the extent they relate to fraud or computer crime it does not require centralized do not email registry to be created by the federal trade commission ftc similar to the national do not call registry for telemarketing the law requires only that the ftc develop plan and timetable for establishing such registry and to inform congress of any concerns it has with regard to establishing it the ftc submitted report to congress on june 15 2004 concluding that do not email registry could actually increase spam proponents of canspam have argued that consumers are most irritated by fraudulent email and that the law should reduce the volume of such email because of the civil and criminal penalties included therein opponents counter that consumers object to unsolicited commercial email and since the law legitimizes commercial email as long as it conforms with the laws provisions consumers actually may receive more not fewer uce messages thus whether or not spam is reduced depends in part on whether it is defined as only fraudulent commercial email or all unsolicited commercial email many observers caution that consumers should not expect any law to solve the spam problem that consumer education and technological

16 state laws regulating spam 17 spam an overview of issues concerning commercial electronic mail introduction one aspect of increased use of the internet for electronic mail email has been the advent of unsolicited advertising also called unsolicited commercial email uce unsolicited bulk email junk email or spam1 complaints often focus on the fact that some spam contains or has links to pornography that much of it is fraudulent and the volume of spam is steadily increasing2 however recent research shows that internet users concerns about spam are actually decreasing even while the volume of spam continues to increase for example in survey conducted by the pew internet american life project during february and march 2007 respondents stated that they were less bothered by spam now than they reported being in the previous survey conducted in june 2003 specifically in the 2003 survey 25 of respondents stated that spam was big problem in the 2007 survey that figure had dropped to 18 even more striking is that the percentage of participants who responded that spam was not problem at all rose from 16 to 28 between 2003 and 2007 the percentage of respondents stating that spam is an annoyance but not big problem has stayed roughly the same at 57 and 51 in 2003 and 2007 respectively3 one reason for this change in attitude towards spam is attributed to internet users growing savvy with identifying spam on their own as well as their increased use of spam filters whether provided by their internet service provider isp or purchased on their own in 2007 71 of internet users use filters up from 65 in 20054 1 the origin of the term spam for unsolicited commercial email was recounted in computerworld april 5 1999 p 70 it all started in early internet chat rooms and interactive fantasy games where someone repeating the same sentence or comment was said to be making spam the term referred to monty pythons flying circus scene in which actors keep saying spam spam spam and spam when reading options from menu 2 this report does not address junk mail or junk fax see crs report rl32177 federal advertising law an overview by henry cohen or crs report rs21647

httpwwwpewinternetorgpdfspip_spam_may_2007pdf crs2 defining spam one challenge in debating the issue of spam is defining it5 to some it is any commercial email to which the recipient did not optin by giving prior affirmative consent to receiving it to others it is commercial email to which affirmative or implied consent was not given where implied consent can be defined in various ways such as whether there is preexisting business relationship still others view spam as unwanted commercial email whether or not particular email is unwanted of course varies per recipient since senders of uce do find buyers for some of their products it can be argued that at least some uce is reaching interested consumers and therefore is wanted and thus is not spam consequently some argue that marketers should be able to send commercial email messages as long as they allow each recipient an opportunity to indicate that future such emails are not desired called optout another group considers spam to be only fraudulent commercial email and believe that commercial email messages from legitimate senders should be permitted the dma for example considers spam to be only fraudulent uce the differences in defining spam add to the complexity of devising legislative or regulatory remedies for it some of the bills introduced in the 108th congress took the approach of defining commercial email and permitting such email to be sent to recipients as long as it conformed with certain requirements other bills defined unsolicited commercial email and prohibited it from being sent unless it met certain requirements the final law the canspam act see below took the former approach defining and allowing marketers to send such email as long as they abide by the terms of the law such as ensuring that the email does not have fraudulent header information or deceptive subject headings and includes an optout opportunity and other features that proponents argue will allow recipients to take control of their inboxes proponents of the law argue that consumers will benefit because they should see reduction in fraudulent emails opponents of the law counter that it legitimizes sending commercial email and to the extent that consumers do not want to receive such emails the amount of unwanted email actually may increase if the legislation reduces the amount of fraudulent email but not the amount of unwanted email the extent to which it reduces spam would depend on what definition of that word is used on december 16 2004 the ftc issued its final rule defining the term commercial electronic mail message but explicitly declined to define spam 5 spam generally refers to email rather than other forms of electronic communication the term spim for example is used for unsolicited advertising via instant messaging spit refers to unsolicited advertising via voice over internet protocol voip unsolicited advertising on wireless devices such as cell phones is called wireless spam crs3 avoiding and reporting spam tips on avoiding spam are available on the ftc website6 and from consumers union7 consumers may file complaint about spam with the ftc by visiting the ftc website and choosing file complaint at the bottom of the page8 the offending spam also may be forwarded to the ftc at spamucegov to assist the ftc in monitoring spam trends and developments the september 2004 issue of consumer reports has cover story about spam including ratings of commercially available spam filters consumers can load onto their computers also individual isps use spam filters though the filters may not catch all spam and have mechanisms available for subscribers to report spam foreign spam controlling spam is complicated by the fact that some of it originates outside the united states and thus is not subject to us laws or regulations spam is global problem and 2001 study by the european commission concluded that internet subscribers globally pay 10 billion euros year in connection costs to download spam9 some european officials complain that the united states is the source of most spam and the us decision to adopt an optout approach in the canspam act discussed below was not helpful10 in april 2005 british antispam and anti virus software developing company sophos listed the united states as the largest spam producing country exporting 357 of spam down from 421 in december 2004 south korea was second at 25 up from 134 in december 200411 tracing the origin of any particular piece of spam can be difficult because some spammers route their messages through other

the canspam act s 877 which merged provisions from several house and senate bills12 signed into law by president bush on december 16 2003 pl 108187 it went into effect on january 1 200413 pl 108187 includes the following major provisions commercial email may be sent to recipients as long as the message conforms with the following requirements transmission information in the header is not false or misleading subject headings are not deceptive functioning return email address or comparable mechanism is included to enable recipients to indicate they do not wish to receive future commercial email messages from that sender at the email address where the message was received the email is not sent to recipient by the sender or anyone acting on behalf of the sender more than 10 days after the recipient has optedout unless the recipient later gives affirmative consent to receive the email ie opts back in and the email must be clearly and conspicuously identified as an advertisement or solicitation although the legislation does not state how or where that identification must be made commercial email is defined as email the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of commercial product or service including content on an internet website operated for commercial purpose it does not include transactional or relationship messages see next bullet the act directs the ftc to issue regulations within 12 months of enactment to define the criteria to facilitate determination of an emails primary purpose the ftc did so on december 16 2004 some requirements including the prohibition on deceptive subject headings and the optout requirement do not apply if the message is transactional or relationship message which include various 12 nine bills were introduced in the 108th congress prior to passage of the canspam act hr 1933 lofgren hr 2214 burrtauzinsensenbrenner hr 2515 wilsongreen s 877 burnswyden s 1052 nelsonfl and s 1327 corzine were optout bills s 563 dayton was do not email bill s 1231 schumer combined elements of both approaches s 1293 hatch created criminal penalties for fraudulent email 13 the senate originally passed s 877 on october 22 2003 by vote of 970 as passed at that time the bill combined elements from several of the senate bills the house passed 3925 an amended version of s 877 on november 21 2003 melding provisions from the senatepassed bill and several house bills the senate concurred in the house amendment with an amendment on november 25 through unanimous consent the senate amendment included several revisions requiring the house to vote again on the bill the house agreed with the senate amendment by unanimous consent on december 8 2003 crs5 types of notifications such as periodic notifications of account balance or other information regarding subscription membership account loan or comparable ongoing commercial relationship involving the ongoing purchase or use by the recipient of products or services offered by the sender providing information directly related to an employment relationship or related benefit plan in which the recipient is currently involved participating or enrolled or delivering goods or services including product updates or upgrades that the recipient is entitled to receive under the terms of transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender the act allows but does not require the ftc to modify that definition sexuallyoriented commercial email must include in the subject heading warning label to be prescribed by the ftc in consultation with the attorney general indicating its nature the warning label does not have to be in the subject line however if the message that is initially viewable by the recipient does not contain the sexually oriented material but only link to it in that case the warning label and the identifier optout and physical address required under section 5 a5 of the act must be contained in the initially viewable email message as well sexually oriented material is defined as any material that depicts sexually explicit conduct unless the depiction constitutes small and insignificant part of the whole the remainder of which is not primarily devoted to sexual matters these provisions do not apply however if the recipient has given prior affirmative consent to receiving such mails businesses may not knowingly promote themselves with email that has false or misleading transmission information state laws specifically related to spam are preempted but not other state laws that are not specific to electronic mail such as trespass contract or tort law or other state laws to the extent they relate to fraud or computer crime violators may be sued by ftc state attorneys general and isps but not by individuals violators of many of the provisions of the act are subject to statutory damages of up to 250 per email to maximum of up to 2 million which may be tripled by the court to 6 million for aggravated violations violators may be fined or sentenced to up to 3 or five years in prison depending on the offense or both for accessing someone elses computer without authorization and using it to send multiple commercial email messages sending multiple commercial email messages with the intent to deceive or mislead recipients or isps as crs6 to the origin of such messages materially falsifying header information in multiple commercial email messages registering for five or more email accounts or online user accounts or two or more domain names using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant and sending multiple commercial email messages from any combination of such accounts or domain names or falsely representing oneself to be the registrant or legitimate successor in interest to the registrant of five of more internet protocol addresses and sending multiple commercial email messages from such addresses multiple means more than 100 mail messages during 24hour period more than 1000 during 30day period or more than 10000 during oneyear period sentencing enhancements are provided for certain acts the federal communications commission in consultation with the ftc must prescribe rules to protect users of wireless devices from unwanted commercial messages the rules were issued in august 2004 see crs report rl31636 wireless privacy and spam issues for congress by marcia s smith for more on this topic conversely the act does not create do not email registry where consumers can place their email addresses in centralized database to indicate they do not want commercial email the law required only that the ftc develop plan and timetable for establishing such registry and to inform congress of any concerns it has with regard to establishing it the ftc released that report in june 2004 see next section require that consumers optin before receiving commercial mail require commercial email to include an identifier such as adv in the subject line to indicate it is an advertisement the law does require the ftc to report to congress within 18 months of enactment on plan for requiring commercial email to be identifiable from its subject line through use of adv or comparable identifier or compliance with internet engineering task force standards or an explanation of any concerns ftc has about such plan include bounty hunter provision to financially reward persons who identify violator and supply information leading to the collection of civil penalty although the ftc must submit report to congress within nine months of enactment setting forth system for doing so the study was released in september 2004 crs7 optin optout and do not email registry much of the debate on how to stop spam focuses on whether consumers should be given the opportunity to optin where prior consent is required or optout where consent is assumed unless the consumer notifies the sender that such emails are not desired of receiving uce or all commercial email the canspam act is an opt out law requiring senders of all commercial email to provide legitimate14 optout opportunity to recipients during debate on the canspam act several antispam groups argued that the legislation should go further and prohibit commercial email from being sent to recipients unless they optin similar to policy adopted by the european union see below eight us groups including junkbusters the coalition against unsolicited commercial email cauce and the consumer federation of america wrote letter to several members of congress expressing their view that the optout approach as in pl 108187 would undercut those businesses who respect consumer preferences and give legal protection to those who do not15 some of the state laws see below adopted the optin approach including californias antispam law the european union adopted an optin requirement for email which became effective october 31 200316 under the eu policy prior affirmative consent of the recipient must be obtained before sending commercial email unless there is an existing customer relationship in that case the sender must provide an optout opportunity the eu directive sets the broad policy but each member nation must pass its own law as to how to implement it17 as noted congress chose optout instead of optin however one method of implementing optout is to create do not email registry where consumers could place their names on centralized list to optout of all commercial email instead of being required to respond to individual emails the concept is similar to the national do not call registry where consumers can indicate they do not want to receive telemarketing calls during consideration of the canspam act thenftc chairman timothy muris and other ftc officials repeatedly expressed skepticism about the advisability of do not email registry despite widespread public support 14 some spam already contains instructions usually to send message to an email address for how recipient can optout however in many cases this is ruse by the sender to trick recipient into confirming that the email has reached valid email address the sender then sends more spam to that address andor includes the email address on lists of email addresses that are sold to bulk emailers it is virtually impossible for recipient to discern whether the proffered optout instructions are genuine or duplicitous 15 see httpwwwcauceorgnode57 16 see httpwwweuropaeuintscadpluslegenlvbl24120htm 17 not all eu nations have yet passed such legislation according to the associated press december 7 2003 1230 the eu asked nine countries belgium germany greece finland france luxembourg the netherlands portugal and sweden to provide within two months an explanation of when they will pass such legislation ap identified six countries that have taken steps to implement the eu law austria britain denmark ireland italy and spain sweden reportedly adopted spam legislation in march 2004 crs8 for it18 one worry is that the database containing the email addresses of all those who do not want spam would be vulnerable to hacking or spammers otherwise might be able to use it to obtain the email addresses of individuals who explicitly do not want to receive spam in an august 19 2003 speech to the aspen institute mr muris commented that the concept of do not email registry was interesting but it is unclear how we can make it work because it would not be enforceable19 if it were established my advice to consumers would be dont waste the time and effort to sign up following initial senate passage of s 877 an unnamed ftc official was quoted by the washington post as saying that the ftcs position on the registry is unchanged and congress would have to change the law to require the ftc to create it20 after the house passed s 877 mr muris released statement complimenting congress on taking positive step in the fight against spam but cautioned again that legislation alone will not solve the problem21 canspam act provision the canspam act did not require the ftc to create do not email registry22 instead it required the ftc to submit plan and timetable for establishing registry authorized the ftc to create it and instructed the ftc to explain to congress any concerns about establishing it ftc implementation the ftc issued its report to congress on june 15 200423 the report concluded that without technical system to authenticate the origin of email messages do not email registry would not reduce the amount of spam and in fact might increase it the ftc report stated that spammers would most likely use registry as mechanism for verifying the validity of email addresses and without authentication the commission would be largely powerless to identify those responsible for misusing the registry moreover registrytype solution to spam would raise 18 survey by the eprivacy group found that 74 of

available at httpwwwftcgovopa200406canspam2htm crs9 serious security privacy and enforcement difficulties p i the report added that protecting children from the internets most dangerous users including pedophiles would be difficult if the registry identified accounts used by children in order to assist legitimate marketers from sending inappropriate messages to them p i the ftc described several registry models that had been suggested and computer security techniques that some claimed would eliminate or alleviate security and privacy risks the ftc stated that it carefully examined those techniques centralized scrubbing of marketers distribution lists converting addresses to one way hashes cryptographic approach and seeding the registry with canary mail addresses to determine if they could effectively control the risks and has concluded that none of them would be effective p 16 the ftc concluded that necessary prerequisite for do not email registry is an authentication system that prevents the origin of email messages from being falsified and proposed program to encourage the adoption by industry of an authentication standard if single standard does not emerge from the private sector after sufficient period of time the ftc report said the commission would initiate process to determine if federally mandated standard is required if the government mandates standard the ftc would then consider studying whether an authentication system coupled with enforcement or other mechanisms had substantially reduced the amount of spam if not the commission would then reconsider whether or not do not email registry is needed on august 1 2005 the ftc issued press release summarizing the results of testing it had conducted to determine if online retailers were honoring optout requests the ftc found that 89 of the merchants it tested did in fact stop sending emails when requested to do so24 labels another approach to restraining spam is requiring that senders of commercial email use label such as adv in the subject line of the message so the recipient will know before opening an email message that it is an advertisement that would also make it easier for spam filtering software to identify commercial email and eliminate it some propose that adultoriented spam have special label such as advadlt to highlight that the email may contain material or links that are inappropriate for children such as pornography canspam act provision the canspam act 1 requires clear and conspicuous identification that commercial email is an advertisement but is not specific about how or where that identification must be made 2 requires the ftc to prescribe warning labels for sexuallyoriented emails within 120 days of enactment and 3 requires the ftc to submit report within 18 months of enactment setting forth plan for requiring commercial email to be identifiable from its subject line using adv or comparable identifier or by means of compliance with internet engineering task force standards however the clear and conspicuous 24 ftc survey tests top etailers compliance with canspams optout provisions august 1 2005 see httpwwwftcgovopa200508optouthtm crs10 identification that commercial email is an advertisement and the warning label for sexuallyoriented material are not required if the recipient has given prior affirmative consent to receipt of such messages ftc implementation on may 19 2004 an ftc rule regarding labeling of sexually oriented commercial email went into effect the rule was adopted by the ftc 50 on april 13 2004 press release and the text of the ruling are available on the ftcs website25 the rule requires that the mark sexuallyexplicit be included both in the subject line of any commercial email containing sexually oriented material and in the body of the message in what the ftc called the electronic equivalent of brown paper wrapper the ftc explained that the brown paper wrapper is what recipient initially sees when opening the email and it may not contain any other information or images except what the ftc prescribes the rule also clarifies that the ftc interprets the canspam act provisions to include both visual images and written descriptions of sexually explicit conduct on july 20 2005 the ftc announced that it had charged seven companies with violating federal laws requiring these labels four of the companies settled with the ftc which imposed total of 1159 million in civil penalties us district court suits were filed against the other three companies26 the act also required the ftc to submit report to congress on plan for making commercial email identifiable from its subject line or to explain what concerns would lead the ftc to recommend against such plan that report was submitted in june 2005 it concluded that requiring uce senders to use prefix such as adv probably would not result in less spam experience with subject line labeling requirements in the states and in other countries does not support the notion that such requirements are an effective means of reducing spam indeed spam filters widely available at little or cost more effectively empower consumers to set individualized email preferences to reduce unwanted uce from both spammers and legitimate marketers mandatory subject line labeling by comparison would be an imprecise tool that at best might make it easier to segregate labeled uce from unlabeled uce it is extremely unlikely that outlaw spammers would comply with requirement to label the email messages they send by contrast legitimate marketers likely would comply as result labeled uce messages sent by lawabiding senders would be filtered out meanwhile unlabeled uce messages sent by outlaw spammers would still reach consumers inboxes27

take number of other actions with regard to implementing the canspam act the ftc routinely issues notices of proposed rulemaking or the results thereof regarding this act which are too numerous to include in this report selected issues are addressed below see the ftcs spam website httpwwwftcgovspam for more information wireless spam the act required the fcc to issue regulations concerning spam on wireless devices such as cell phones the fcc issued those regulations in august 200428 bounty hunter provision the act required the ftc to conduct study on whether rewarding persons who identify spammer and supply information leading to the collection of civil penalty could be an effective technique for controlling spam the bounty hunter provision the study was released on september 15 200429 the ftc concluded that the benefits of such system are unclear because for example without large rewards in the 100000 to 250000 range and certain level of assurance that they would receive the reward whistleblowers might not be willing to assume the risks of providing such information the ftc offered five recommendations if congress wants to pursue such an approach tie eligibility for reward to imposition of final court order instead of to collecting civil penalty fund the rewards through congressional appropriations instead of through collected civil penalties restrict reward eligibility to insiders with highvalue information exempt ftc decisions on eligibility for rewards from judicial or administrative review and establish reward amounts high enough to attract insiders with high value information definition of primary purpose the act required the ftc to issue regulations within one year of enactment defining the relevant criteria to facilitate determination of an emails primary purpose the ftc issued its final rule on december 16 2004 exactly one year after the law was enacted according to the ftcs press release 30 the final rule clarifies that the commission does not intend to regulate noncommercial speech it differentiates between commercial content and 28 see crs report rl31636 wireless privacy and spam issues for congress for more information 29 press release is available at httpwwwftcgovopa200409bountyhtm and the report canspam informant reward system is available at httpwwwftcgov reportsrewardsys040916rewardsysrptpdf 30 ftc press release ftc issues final rule defining what constitutes commercial electronic mail message december 16 2004 crs12 transactional or relationship content in defining the primary purpose of an email message if an email contains only commercial advertisement or promotion of commercial product or service its primary purpose is deemed to be commercial if an email contains both commercial content and transactional or relationship content the primary purpose is deemed to be commercial if the recipient would likely conclude that it was commercial through reasonable interpretation of the subject line or if the transactional and relationship content does not appear in whole or in substantial part at the beginning of the body of the message if an email contains both commercial content and content that is neither commercial content nor transactional or relationship content the primary purpose is deemed to be commercial if the recipient would likely conclude that it was commercial through reasonable interpretation of the subject line or if the recipient would likely conclude the primary purpose was commercial through reasonable interpretation of the body of the message if an email contains only transactional or relationship content it is not deemed to be commercial email message commercial content is defined in the final rule as the commercial advertisement or promotion of commercial product or service which includes content on an internet website operated for commercial purpose that is the same as the definition in the canspam act31 the ftc specifically declined to define the term spam because the act sets forth regulatory scheme built around the terms commercial electronic mail message and transactional or relationship message32 related legislation on december 22 2006 president bush signed the undertaking spam spyware and fraud enforcement with enforcers beyond borders act of 2005 us safe web act pl 109455 the law allows the ftc and parallel foreign law enforcement agencies to share information while investigating allegations of unfair and deceptive practices that involve foreign commerce but raised some privacy concerns because the ftc would not be required to make public any of the information it obtained through foreign sources 31 the ftcs notice of proposed rulemaking had slightly different definition the final rule emphasizes that in the final rule the definition is the same as in the act 32 this explanation is offered on p 11 of the text of the federal register notice as it appears on the ftc website at httpwwwftcgovopa200501primarypurphtm crs13 legal actions based on the canspam act many lawsuits have been brought against spammers the following discussion is illustrative not comprehensive on october 10 2007 the ftc announced that it had filed civil lawsuit against an international enterprise with defendants in the united states canada and australia that used spam to drive traffic to websites selling pills that the ftc alleges do not work33 the ftcs spam database received over 175000 spam messages sent on behalf of the operation the action announced at an international meeting of government authorities and private industry about spam spyware and other online threats is the first brought by the agency using the us safe web act to share information with foreign partners in addition the ftc alleges that the operation violated the canspam act by initiating commercial emails that contained false from addresses and deceptive subject lines and failed to provide an optout link or physical postal address on april 29 2004 the ftc announced that it had filed civil lawsuit against detroitbased spam operation phoenix avatar and the department of justice doj announced that it had arrested two and were seeking two more detroitarea men associated with the company who are charged with sending hundreds of thousands of spam messages using false and fraudulent headers34 the ftc charged phoenix avatar with making deceptive claims about diet patch sold via the spam in violation of the ftc act and with violations of the canspam act because the spam did not contain valid optout opportunity and the reply to and from addresses were fraudulent the doj filed criminal charges against the men under the canspam act for sending multiple commercial emails with materially false or fraudulent return addresses according to the ftc from january 1 2004 until the lawsuit was filed about 490000 of the spam messages forwarded by consumers to the ftc were linked to avatar phoenix the ftc simultaneously announced that it had filed legal action against an australian spam enterprise operating out of australia and new zealand called global web promotions the ftc stated that it was assisted by the australian competition and consumer commission and the new zealand commerce committee in bringing the case according to the ftc since january 1 2004 among the spam forwarded by consumers to the ftc about 399000 are linked to global web

assessment of the acts effectiveness and recommend any necessary changes the ftc submitted its report in december 200541 the ftc concluded that the act has been effective in terms of adoption of commercial email best practices that are followed by legitimate online marketers and in terms of providing law enforcement agencies and isps with an additional tool to use against spammers additionally the ftc concluded that the volume of spam has begun to stabilize and the amount reaching individuals inboxes has decreased because of improved antispam technologies42 however it also found that the international dimension of spam has not changed significantly and that there has been shift toward the inclusion of increasingly malicious content in spam messages such as malware which is intended to harm the recipient other negative changes noted by the ftc are that spammers are using increasingly complex multilayered business arrangements to frustrate law enforcement and are hiding their identities by providing false information to domain registrars the whois database the ftc did not recommend any changes to the canspam act but encouraged congress to pass the us safe web act s 1608 see next paragraph noted that continued consumer education efforts are needed and called for improved antispam technologies particularly domainlevel authentication discussed later in this

state laws that are not specific to electronic mail such as trespass contract or tort law or other state laws to the extent they relate to fraud or computer crime california passed an anti spam law that would have become effective january 1 2004 and was considered relatively strict it required optin for uce unless there was prior business relationship in which case optout is required the

number of lawsuits have been filed under the state laws two notable cases involve the maryland and virginia laws in december 2004 maryland judge ruled that marylands antispam law is unconstitutional
