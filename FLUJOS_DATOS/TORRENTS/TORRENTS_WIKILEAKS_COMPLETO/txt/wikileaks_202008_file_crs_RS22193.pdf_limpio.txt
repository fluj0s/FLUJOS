to states for the development implementation and evaluation of alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers or health care

congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs22193 july 14 2005 grants to states to develop alternatives to medical malpractice litigation legal analysis of s 1337 109th congress henry cohen legislative attorney american law division summary s 1337 109th congress would authorize the secretary of health and human services to award demonstration grants to states for the development implementation and evaluation of alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care provi ders or health care organizations states desiring grants would be permitted to c hoose from among three models of alternatives to the tort system the early disclosure and compensation model the administrative determination of compensati on model or the special health care court model s 1337 109th congress the fair and reliable dical justice act would not like most tort reform bills preempt state tort law rather it would add new section 3990 to the public health service act that would authorize the secretary of health and human services to award demonstration grants to states for the development implementation and evaluation of alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers or health care organizations the secretary would be authorized to award up to 10 grants with each not to exceed period of five years s 1337 would apply to health care serv ices and unlike s 354 and hr 534 which are pending bills that would preempt state tort law would apparently not apply to medical products litigation each state desiring demonstration grant would be required to develop an alternative to tort litigation for resolving medical malpractice disputes and promote reduction of health care errors by allowing for patient safety data related to disputes resolved by such alternative to be collected and analyzed by organizations that engage in voluntary efforts to improve patient safety and the quality of health care delivery1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22193crs2 1 continued suggests that state would be required to devel op plan even before it received or accepted demonstration grant this seems to be the case as discussed in the third paragraph on page 2 of this report 2 state that desired grant could change its ws that prohibited the adoption of an alternative although some states might have to amend their constitutions in order to do soeach state desiring dem onstration grant would also have to demonstrate how its proposed alternative ma kes the medical liability syst em more reliable through prompt and fair resolution of disputes b courages the early disclosure of health care errors c enhances patient safety and d main tains access to liability insurance each state would also be required to identif the sources from and methods by which compensation would be paid for claims each state desiring demonstration grant would be permitted to establish scope of jurisdiction such as designated geogra phic region designated area of health care practice or designated group of health car providers or health care organizations for the proposed alternative to current tort litigati on that is sufficient to evaluate the effects of the alternative state that propos scope of jurisdiction would have to demonstrate how patients would be notified that they are receiving health care services that fall within such scope in awarding demonstration grants the secr etary would be required to give preference to states that have devel oped the proposed alternative th rough substantive consultation with relevant stakeholders and states whose law at the time of the application would not prohibit the adoption of an alte rnative to current tort litigation2 the fact that the secretary would be required to give preference to states that had already developed proposed alternative might seem inconsistent with the fact th at the demonstration grants as noted in the first paragraph of this report would be for the development implementation and evaluation of alternatives however subsection i of the new section 3990 that the bill would enact would au thorize the secretary to provide planning grants to states for the development of demonstration project applications in providing planning grants th secretary would be required to give preference to states whose laws would not prohibit the adoption of an alternative to current tort litigation but would not be required to give preference to states that had alr eady developed proposed alternative it appears therefore that state may apply for planning grant to develop proposed alternative but woul d have to develop proposed lternative in order to apply for demonstration grant three models as noted each state desiring demonstra tion grant would be required to develop an alternative to current tort litigation the lternative to current to rt litigation would have to be one of three models the early disclosure and compensation model the administrative determination of compensation model or the special health care court model early disclosure and compensation model in this model the state would provide immunity from tort liability to any health care provider or health carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22193crs3 3 the bill does not state whether earned sick leav would constitute wage or salary continuation plan 4 the bill does not dictate how providers would apportion the total liability among themselves 5 as the bill does not address the question state presumably could decide that for the administrative determination of compensation m odel to apply in particular case both the provider and the patient would have to agree that it would or if one of them agreed to it then it would become mandatory for the other 6 the bill does not define avoidable injuries or indicate how general or specific the state must be in establishing classes of avoidable injuriesorganization hereinafter pr ovider that offers in good faith to pay compensation to patient injured by the health care provider or health care organization the state would set time within which the provider would ve to make an offer of compensation and such offer would have to include periodic payments for the patients net economic loss reduced by any payments the patient receive d from health accident or disability income insurance or any wage or salary continuation plan3 providers offer would also have to include payment for the noneconomic dama ges eg pain and suffering based on defined payment schedule that the state woul d develop finally providers offer would have to include reasonable attorneys fees if provider fails to make timely good faith offer of the types of compensation noted bove then the state could not abridge the patients right to seek redress through the tort system if provider makes timely offer then the state must permit him to join in the payment other potentially liable providers4 administrative determinati on of compensation model in this model the state would designate an administrative entity board set up classes of avoidable injuries that will be used by the board to determine compensati on and bar negligence lawsuits for the designated classes of avoidable injuries the state would decide whether to make participation by the health care provider health care organization and patient in this model voluntary and if it did decide to make it voluntary it would outline procedure for the parties to decide prior to the provision of health care services whether to participate5 under this model the board would resolve health care liability claims for certain classes of avoidable injuries as determined by the state and determine compensation for such claims6 compensation would be based on the same factors as it would be based on under the early disclosure and compensa tion model net economic losses reduced by the specified collateral source payments noneconomic damage s and reasonable attorneys fees the state would also provide for an appeals procedure to allow for review of decisions in establishing the appeals pro cess the state could choose whether to allow for novo review review with deference or some opportunity for parties to reject determinations by the board and elect to file civil action after such rejectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22193crs4 7 the elimination of the right to jury tr ial under this model would not violate the us constitution because the seventh amendment does not apply in state courts and applies only in suits at common law not in administrative pr oceedings the next section of this report examines this matter in greater depth 8 south dakota v dole 483 us 203 208 1987 9 28 usc 1332 10 erie railroad co v tompkins 304 us 64 1938finally under this model the state woul d establish procedur to coordinate settlement payments with other sources of payment and would establish time frames to ensure that claims are handled in more timely fashion than they are by the tort system7 special health care court model in this model the state would establish special court to adjudicate medical malpractice claims the judges on the court would have to have health care expe rtise in addition to meeting st ate standards for judges and would have to preside over th court voluntarily the judges would have the authority to make binding rulings that would be subject to an appeals process the fact that rulings would be made by j udges would mean that under this model the parties would have right to jury trial the seventh amendment guarantees right to trial by jury in suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars medical malpractice suits are suits at common law so the seventh amendment applies to them the seventh am endment however does not apply in state courts and special health care courts would be state courts one might argue moreover that suits br ought under the special health care court model would not be suits at common law but would be an alternative to traditional tort suits this however might be the case in some states but not in others because the bill does not state what substantive law the special h ealth court judges would apply if state does not enact special law for the special health court but applies the same law that it applies in tort suits then claims heard in the special health court would likely be considered suits at common law but this point seems moot given that the seventh amendment does not apply in state courts an argument that the seventh amendment would apply to suits in special health courts might be that special health courts would be established as consequence of federal law and congress ma not attach unconstitutional conditions to the receipt of federal funds8 this argument seems unpersuasive however because the condition that congress would attach under the special health care court model denial of the right to jury trial would not be unconstitutional because special health care courts would be state courts under current law medical ma lpractice claims may be br ought in federal court under diversity jurisdiction which means that they may be brought in fede ral court if they are between citizens of different states and the matter in controversy exceeds 750009 in diversity suit the federal court applies the relevant state law10 s 1337 would not change this which means that under s 1337 some medical malpractice claims could still be brought in federal cour t and would be decided by jury unless the federa l court appliedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22193crs5 the law of state that had abolished common w torts suits in favor of some other system of recovery awarding of demonstration grants s 1337 contains other provisions that we w ill mention briefly subsection of the new section 3990 provides for the establishment of review panel to evaluate states applications for demonstration grants th comptroller general w ould appoint the panel which would consist of from 11 to 15 pe ople who among them represent patient advocates health care providers and health care organizations attorneys with expertise in representing patients and health care provi ders insurers and state officials the bill provides in reviewing applications the s ecretary shall consult w ith review panel this suggests that the secretary and not the review panel would make the decision whether to accept or reject st ates application for demons tration grant the bill does not state this explicitly however subsection f provides that st ates that receive demonstr ation grants shall submit to the secretary reports as the secretary requires evaluating the effectiveness of activities funded under demonstration grant subsection g provides that the secretary shall provide technical assistance to the states that are awarded demonstration grants technical assistance shall include the development of defined payment sc hedule for non economic damages the development of classes of avoidable injuries and guidan ce on early disclosure to patients of adverse effects and the development in consultation with states of common definitions formats and data collection infrastructure subsection h provides that the secretary in consultation with the review panel shall enter into contract with research organization to evaluate the effectiveness of demonstration grants that are awarded and to annually prepare and submit report to the appropriate committees of congress subsection i concerns planni ng grants which were discu ssed in the third paragraph on page 2 of this report subsection j contains definitions of terms used in the bill and subsection k would authorize to be appropria ted such sums as may be necessary to carry out the program
