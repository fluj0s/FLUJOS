states relations background in the mid1980s at the height of the iraniraq war israel began to perceive growing potential threat from ballistic missile programs in the region iraq was reported to be working to extend the range of sovietsupplied scud missiles to enable it to hit tehran some 400 miles from the iraniraq border in early 1988 israeli concerns about iraqs missile capabilities were confirmed when iraq successfully began raining its husayn missile an extended range scud on tehran at about that same time israel tested its own jericho2 missile with range of over 900 miles during the 1991 persian gulf war iraq fired 39 husayn missiles at israel in an apparent effort to bring israel into the war and divide the antiiraq coalition although all the missiles were armed only with conventional warheads and israelis were killed as direct result of the missile strikes the launches caused panic in israel some observers say that the deployment in israel of six us patriot antimissile batteries substantially eased the panic in israel even though subsequent studies found that the patriot did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20516crs2 1 feuerwerger marvin the arrow next time

the positive psychological effect of the patriots contributed to israels redoubling of its missile defense efforts after the gulf war according to israeli defense experts2 israels threat perception escalated yet again in late 1996 when it learned that iran with substantial help from russian entities was developing ballistic missile the shahab 3 with range of about 800 milescapable of hitting israel if launched from western iran iran flight tested the shahab3 on july 22 1998 although statements by us officials indicated that the missile might have malfunctioned if irans intent was to test it at full range despite the apparently inconclusive test iran subsequently declared the missile operation and began production israels threat perception was compounded by numerous reports that iran is working to mount chemical and biological warheads on its ballistic missiles 3 israel also faces potential threats from missiles acquired or sought by syria libya egypt and saudi arabia4 as well from shortrange rockets used by the proiranian hizbollah militia in lebanon however egypt and israel have been at peace since 1979 and syria and israel have been engaged in peace talks off and on since 1993 since 1992 saudi arabia has participated alongside israel and other middle eastern countries in us russian sponsored multilateral regional peace talks program history and status the following sections discuss the three major joint us israeli missile defense programs arrow weapons system the arrow antimissile system has emerged as the centerpiece of israels missile defense effort the program grew out of usisrael memorandum of understanding signed in may 1986 that formalized israels participation in the us strategic defense initiative sdi in 1988 the united states and israel agreed that israel with financial and technical help from the united states would develop the arrow program as means of providing israel with its own missile defense capabilitycomplementing but remaining independent from that of the united states the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo the arm of the defense department that spearheads us missile defense efforts and coordinates with israel on the arrow program maintains that protecting israel long considered the closest us ally in the middle east furthers us interests according to bmdo the arrow project contributes to the theater missile defense tmd capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20516crs3 5 department of defense ballistic missile defense organization fact sheet arrow deployability program february 1999 6 ibid 7 turkey adopts twotier bmd concept janes defence weekly february 16 2000of the united states by providing access to test data that allow the united states to learn from arrows successes and failures5 bmdo adds that paramount objective behind us involvement in the arrow is to promote interoperability between us and israeli systems6 israel already fields three usmade patriot antimissile batteries the arrow which intercepts missiles at higher altitude than the patriot is intended to work with that system to provide multitiered missile defense capability according to bmdo the initial phase of the program was the arrow experiments program the second stage was designated the arrow continuation experiments aces which ended with successful test against virtual target on september 14 1998 this progress ushered in the next phase of the program the arrow deployability program adp which was intended to produce working prototype following irans july 1998 test of its shahab 3 missile which is faster than the scud israel decided that it would need to deploy three arrow batteries to provide coverage for all of israel on november 1 1999 the arrow2 passed its most critical test intercepting live target missile launched from vessel at sea all parts of the system appeared to work well together including the interceptor made by israel aircraft industries the green pine radar made by elta and the citron tree fire control system made by tadiran on march 14 2000 israel unveiled the arrow2 in public ceremony and said the battery would soon have an initial operational capability according to observers israel is concerned that the arrow technology needs to be upgraded to handle enemy decoys and more sophisticated missiles and israel is discussing with the united states followon program to address these weaknesses some potential usisrael differences center on israels apparent plan to eventually share or export the arrow to countries such as great britain turkey japan india or jordan the united states which must approve any reexportation of the technology has thus far dissuaded israel from discussing the sale of arrow technology with potential foreign buyers however bmdo has said it supports discussing future turkish involvement in the arrow program7 boost phaselauncher intercept bpibpli during 199596 the us air force analyzed alternatives for theater missile defense system that could intercept missiles shortly after launch when they are the most vulnerable in the first few minutes of flight ballistic missiles are relatively slowmoving and have bright exhaust gases that can be easily detected and tracked in june 1997 the united states and israel began joint research program to develop fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles that could deliver weapons that would intercept ballistic missiles immediately after launch boost phase bp the boost phase intercept bpi systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20516crs4 8 sirak michael bmdo says israel is not expected to pursue uavbpi

april 2000 according to observers under consideration featured an unmanned aerial vehicle made by israel aircraft industries missile designed by rafael armament development authority and command and control element made by tadiran in late 1999 apparently because of the complexities of the technology involved and disagreements between the united states and israel over the potential merits of the system israel decided not to move toward full demonstration of the bpi system8 development of prototype would have cost about 500 million between 1998 and 2002 although the bpi concept has not been abandoned entirely israel is now focusing on modification of the concept that envisions striking missile launchers boost phase launch intercept bpli system9 under this concept an unmanned aerial vehicle would detect missile launch and then direct an interceptor to destroy the launcher the arrow see above according to the plan would destroy the first missile launched one difficulty with both the bpi and bpli concepts is that the planned unmanned aerial vehicle might have to hover over the territory of potential adversary in advance of actual hostilities which could be viewed as politically provocative apparently reflecting the uncertainty of the directions of these programs bpibpli research was not funded by congress for fy2000 nonetheless the senate armed services committee in its report on s1059 srept 10650 the defense authorization bill for fy2000 directed the secretary of defense to study and report on by february 15 200010 the feasibility of the bpi or related system the senate report also noted that the ability to defeat ballistic missiles before and during their launch phase could significantly enhance the security of the united states and its allies tactical highenergy laser program thel the thel program is not intended to intercept ballistic missiles but rather to destroy shortrange rockets such as those launched by the russianmade mobile katyusha multiple rocket launcher 25 mile range during periods of fighting over israels occupation since 1985 of tenmile wide security zone in southern lebanon members of hizbollah have occasionally used the katyusha to fire on towns in northern israel israel is concerned that hizbollah will continue its fight after israels planned withdrawal from southern lebanon scheduled for july 2000 if the withdrawal is not accompanied by broader peace deal with syria on the other hand many observers believe that hizbollah will abandon armed conflict after israels withdrawal because hizbollah would have accomplished its key goal of ending israels occupation of south lebanon the thel is followon to an earlier program called nautilus begun in may 1995 to test the effectiveness of lasers against shortrange rockets in february 1996 the nautilus program ended with successful interception of katyusha rocket at the us armys white sands missile range in new mexico in april 1996 the united states

prime contractor trw over cost overruns plagued the program in late 1998 and early 199911 these problems were ultimately resolved but they delayed testing of the thel until well into 1999 on december 3 1999 israel announced that the thel had successfully intercepted number of katyushas in tests at white sands and that additional tests would be conducted in 2000 to determine whether to declare the system operational12 additional funding would be needed to complete testing and move the first thel prototype to israel defense experts maintain that israel would need about 15 thel batteries to fully defend its northern border the gao report cited above notes that lessons learned from the thel program will be beneficial if the united states decides to develop theltype system for its military forces to protect its own combat formations the united states would need mobile version of the weapon according to the department of defense us funding congress and successive administrations have

provide israel with about 100 million for theater missile defense research out of the 12 billion for israel contained in wye memorandum supplemental funds appropriated in the fiscal year 2000 foreign aid appropriations as referenced in the omnibus fy2000 appropriations pl 106113 however state department officials say the breakdown of the wye monies for specific programs might be subject to

have been requested for fy2001 for either the bpibpli or the thel israeli officials have said they want additional us funding for missile defense as part of broader defense package that would accompany any peace agreement with syria13 conclusions most observers appear to believe that the existing joint israelius missile programs particularly the arrowwill continue to receive support from congress and the administration according to the administration and language in reports on recent defense authorization and appropriations bills these programs provide tangible benefits to us theater missile defense programs and help demonstrate the longstanding us commitment to israels security supporters of the joint programs maintain that this type of us security assistance to israel gives israel the confidence it needs in order to offer the concessions required to make peace with its arab negotiating partners some maintain that if crisis were to erupt in the region possession of missile defense could dampen any israeli impulse to strike its potential adversaries preemptively others believe that the joint programs are of limited direct benefit to us theater missile defense efforts and could be counterproductive if they prompt israel to act aggressively toward its perceived adversaries some maintain that israeli missile defense will cause potential adversaries in the region to accelerate their missile development programs in an effort to be able to overwhelm israels defenses israel asserts that its adversaries currently lack the financial and technical resources to be confident that they can overwhelm layered israeli missile defense network some question the viability of the missile defense programs by pointing primarily to the technical difficulties and financial burdensboth to the united states and to israel of constructi ng comprehensive missile defense opponents of the arrow maintain that demonstrating success in tests is far from proving that the system would be effective in real crisis14 some maintain that israel has far cheaper and easier alternatives such as civil defense measures and reliance on strategy of deterrence other critics believe that israel should concentrate on negotiating comprehensive peace with its arab neighbors which according to this view could eliminate the need for missile defense on the other hand some believe that peace treaty can guarantee israels security and that israel should pursue as many defense programs as possible matter what the outcome of any peace negotiation
