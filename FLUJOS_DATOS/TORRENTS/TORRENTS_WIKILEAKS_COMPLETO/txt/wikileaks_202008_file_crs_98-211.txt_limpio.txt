programs president clinton sought 136 billion in discretionary budget authority for fy1999 nearly 800 million or 6 higher than available for fy1998 but unlike year ago when the president concentrated most of the added funds requested on few high priority areas the fy1999 request asked for increases across wide array of foreign operations programs including export promotion agencies development assistance debt reduction initiatives the peace corps drug control aid arrearage payments for multilateral development banks and others israel egypt russia ukraine and bosnia would be the largest recipients of bilateral aid as has been the case in the recent past beyond these regular foreign operations programs the president also sought 179 billion for us contributions to two imf facilities and 502 million for us arreage payments to multilateral development banks in addition to funding questions the foreign operations debate also included important policy issues such as priorities of development aid strategies abortion restrictions on international family planning programs adjusting middle east aid allocations policy restrictions on aid to russia and ukraine and the use of

cap but which provide additional resources for us foreign aid activities in total hr 4328 provides 3163 billion for foreign operations in fy1999 although this still falls about 385 million below the

embassy bombingrelated and counternarcotics emergency supplemental spending and 179 billion for the imf excluding the imf total foreign operations money approved for fy1999 is 618 million more than

relief the peace corps and us contributions to the global environment facility congressional negotiators also settled several other major foreign operations issues in disagreement between the house and senate the bill caps international family planning aid at 385 million but drops housepassed abortion restrictions hr 4328 includes the full 179 billion us payment to the international monetary fund imf subject to conditions concerning recipient country trade and financial policies greater transparency in imf operations and fund lending at abovemarket rates the measure drops the housepassed ban on us funding for the administrations program to curb north koreas nuclear weapons production but subjects the 35 million to additional certification requirements and delays the moneys availability until next year the legislation as approved by both houses begins aid reductions for israel and egypt introduction the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign assistance programs food continued crs2 the largest share about 69 of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the new independent states nis account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are smaller security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency figure 1 international affairs budget international affairs budget enacted fy1999 discretionary budget authority by appropriation bills foreign operations 128 billion 688 agriculturefood aid 09 billion 48 state deptcommerce 49 billion 263 an additional 122 million for the us institute for peace is in the laborh bill figures exclude arrears and emergency supplemental appropriations 1 continued aid administered under the pl 480 program and managed by usaid is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill further the foreign operations measure includes funds for one activitythe exportimport bankthat is not regarded as foreign assistance but rather as us government activity promoting trade opportunities for american businesses in most years this results in foreign operations appropriation including the eximbank that is slightly less 15 in fy1998 than the official foreign aid budget throughout this report references to foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably crs3 from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in us foreign aid policy making the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past decade congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making status table 1 status of foreign operations appropriations fy1999 subcommittee conference report markup house senate senate conference approval house report public law passage report

president clinton submitted his fy1999 federal budget request to congress on february 2 1998 including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriations programs during the next several months house and senate foreign operations subcommittees held series of hearings including testimony from secretary of state albright treasury secretary rubin and usaid administrator atwood in midmay house and senate appropriations committees issued budget authority and outlay allocations in may and june to each of their 13 subcommittees paving the way for initial action on these spending bills the house foreign operations subcommittee approved draft bill on july 15 1998 that was amended and ordered reported by the full appropriations committee on september 10 hr 4569 the house passed hr 4569 on september 17 255161 the senate skipped subcommittee markup as the full appropriations committee reported bill on july 21 s 2334 after two days of debate the full senate approved s 2334 on september 2 by vote of 903 foreign operations like seven other regular spending measures was incorporated into hr 4328 the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations 1999 passed by the house and senate on october 2021 and signed into law on october 21 crs4 foreign operations funding trends in recent years as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to postcold war environment one of the major foreign assistance issues for congress and executive branch policymakers has been the question of budget resource allocation and how to reduce foreign aid spending while sustaining the program as an effective foreign policy tool table 2 foreign operations appropriations fy1993 to fy1999 discretionary budget authority in billions of current dollars fy1993 fy1994 fy1995 fy1996 fy1997 fy1998 fy1999 13901 14298 13611 12456 12267 12787 12864 amounts for fy1998 and fy1999 do not include appropriations for payments of us arrears to multilateral development banks mdbs 360 million and 539 million respectively fy1999 further does not include 17861 billion for the imf and 399 million in emergency supplemental funds under terms of the balanced budget act of 1997 and other budget laws appropriations for mdb arrears the imf and emergency supplementals are not scored against the foreign operations spending allocation for comparative purposes with prior years including mdb arrears and emergency supplementals fy1998 appropriations would total 13147 billion and fy1999 13765 billion after peaking in size at 207 billion in fy1985 foreign operations appropriations began period of declining levels falling to about 123 billion in fy1997 foreign aid spending cuts were especially sharp in fy1996 when congress cut funding by 115 billion or nearly 9 from the previous year administration officials and many in the broader foreign policy community argued that such severe budget reductions in short period of time seriously undermined many us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events after foreign operations funding levels fell again in fy1997 although by much smaller amounts the state department and other executive agencies launched an aggressive campaign in support of foreign policy budget request for fy1998 that sought to reverse the decadelong downward trend congress approved much of the presidents 1 billion increase recommended for this year setting foreign operations appropriations at 1315 billion for fy1998 currently foreign operations represents 078 of the entire federal budget and 24 of total discretionary budget authority by comparison these same figures in fy1985 were 2 and 46 respectively over the longer term of the past 20 years foreign operations spending has experienced three distinct trends when calculated in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation the first period was marked by steady growth in foreign operations appropriations levels during the early 1980s when the united states rapidly expanded securityrelated aid programs in central america pakistan and to countries providing the us with military bases funding peaked in fy1985 at 319 billion in fy1999 dollars followed by sharp cut in fy1986 as the effects of the grammrudman deficit reduction initiative took hold and limited federal spending in most areas for the next five years during second phase of foreign operations crs5 budget trends appropriations remained relatively stable at about 195 billion per year real terms at about the time of the end of the cold war foreign aid spending began to fall steadily from about 167 billion in fy1992 to 15 billion in fy1995 to 13 billion in fy1997 real terms appropriations for fy1997 were the smallest foreign operations level in real terms since 1975 when congress slashed foreign assistance spending during the us withdrawal from vietnam even with additional funding for this year in real terms fy1998 foreign operations spending is about 30 below the average appropriation level approved by congress during the late 1980s 19 less than fy1992 year that might be considered the first postcold war foreign aid budget and 10 less than fy1995 when the majority in congress changed data notes unless otherwise indicated this report expresses dollar amounts in terms of discretionary budget authority the foreign operations appropriations bill includes one mandatory program that is not included in figures and tables usaids foreign service retirement fund the retirement fund is scheduled to receive 446 million for fy1999 in addition funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude us contributions to the international monetary fund imf proposals that are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress is presently considering 179 billion imf request including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing for more see crs report 96279 us budgetary treatment of the international monetary fund foreign operations appropriations request for fy1999 and congressional consideration funding issues for foreign operations appropriations fy1999 total foreign operations funding levels after convincing congress in 1997 to raise foreign operations spending by about 500 million over the previous year the president submitted request for fy1999 that would set foreign aid appropriations nearly 800 million higher than the level enacted for fy1998 the 136 billion proposal was 62 higher than fy1998 discretionary budget authority but unlike year ago when the president concentrated most of the added funds requested on few high priority areas most notably for payment of arrears at multilateral development banks the fy1999 request asked for increases across wide array of foreign operations programs nearly every major component of foreign aid spending was slated to rise in fy1999 however as illustrated in figure 2 and crs6 discussed immediately below enacted fy1999 appropriations for foreign operations provides only modest increases from fy1998 for major areas of foreign aid spending resulting in few changes among the proportional distribution of funds table 3 summarizes the presidents request and congressional action while an appendix at the end of this report provides details on individual account spending levels

amounts exclude mdb arrears aid for israel and egypt imf funds emergency supplementals initially congress was reluctant to meet the presidents recommendation for significant foreign aid increases in fy1999 in fact until final decisions were reached in midoctober regarding overall funding levels it appeared that foreign operations programs would receive less in fy1999 than amounts provided in fy1998 as shown in figure 2 above enacted appropriations for regular foreign operations crs7 programs in fy1999 are 40 million higher than in fy1998 including additional funds for multilateral development bank arrears and several emergency supplementals none of which are scored against foreign operations spending limits fy1999 funds are 618 million higher than the previous year not counting the 179 billion imf transfer congress approved roughly twothirds of the overall increase sought by the president for fy1999 the first step influencing congressional debate on foreign operations occurred in midmay when house and senate appropriations committees issued allocations to each of their 13 subcommittees this process known as the section 302b allocations usually comes after the house and senate have agreed to common budget resolution because of delays this year in taking up budget resolution however house and senate appropriations committee chairmen decided to issue their 302b allocations in advance of final action on budget resolution both appropriations committees issued very low allocations for foreign operations on may 14 the senate panel provided 126 billion in budget authority ba and 124 billion in outlays for foreign operations in fy1999 outlays were later revised upward to 126 billion these figures exclude mdb arrears and imf funding the senate allocation set budget authority for foreign operations about 1 billion below the presidents request and nearly 250 million less than enacted for fy1998 the house committee on may 22 set foreign operations ba and outlays each at 125 billion 100 million less than senate levels house and senate committees began markups on the foreign operations request at nearly the same time on july 15 the house foreign operations subcommittee recommended 12471 billion funding measure 1282 billion with mdb arrears about 315 million 25 below existing levels for fy1998 and 11 billion 81 less than the presidents proposal for fy1999 the full house appropriations adopted the subcommittees funding proposals on september 10 hr 4569 and the house passed the measure on september 17 without changes in funding levels the senate did not hold subcommittee markup but went straight to full committee consideration on july 21 followed by full senate passage on september 2 as passed by the senate s 2334 included slightly higher amount than recommended in the house 12575 billion 12885 billion including mdb arrears added to these amounts were funds for us contribution to the imf which brought the house bill to total of 162 billion and the senate to 307 billion the senate designated both mdb arrears and imf appropriations as fy1998 supplementals the house and senate did not hold formal conference on the foreign operations measures but instead incorporated foreign aid funding into hr 4328 the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 during executivelegislative budget discussions during the final days of the 105th congress negotiators added more than 880 million for foreign operations spending in fy1999 to amounts approved by the house and senate in september senior executive branch officials had advised the president to veto these earlier measures because of inadequate funding as enacted on october 21 in hr 4328 foreign operations funds total 3163 billion including 12827 billion for regular programs 539 million for mdb arrears payments 399 million in child survival former soviet aid counternarcotics and african embassy bombingrelated emergency supplemental spending and 179 billion for the imf excluding the imf total crs8 foreign operations money approved for fy1999 is 618 million more than for fy1998 but 385 million less than the president requested funding for selected foreign operations accounts whereas the president sought increased funding in fy1999 for most foreign operations programs congress was more selective in which areas to add resources above

total lines in this table show three different amounts 1 excluding mdb arrears and imf funds amounts that reflect foreign operations allocations 2 including mdb arrears but excluding the imf and 3 including all funds in the bills in addition hr 4328 as enacted includes 399 million in emergency supplemental funds for child survival former soviet aid counternarcotics and africa embassy bombingrelated funds that are not included in this table these emergency supplementals also do score against foreign operations budget caps imf funding securing full funding for us transfer to the imfs new arrangements to borrow nab 336 billion and the funds new quota increase 145 billion was arguably the administrations highest priority in the foreign operations bill viewed by supporters as an important tool with which to confront crs9 the asian financial crisis russias economic problems and other situations threatening global economic stability the imf also came under attack by critics who believed the fund was not equipped to deal with current economic difficulties was not prescribing the right policy reforms and was operating without sufficient public scrutiny the administration countered that it agreed with many congressional concerns regarding imf policies but that some of the conditions proposed by lawmakers for us payments to fund were unworkable and would ultimately block the transfer of american resources the senate appropriations committee in s 2334 fully funded the presidents 179 billion request attaching conditions that were acceptable to the administration during floor debate the senate rejected 1974 an amendment proposed by senator kyl setting out package of conditions regarded as much tougher than what was already included in the bill that the imf would have to meet before receiving the 145 billion quota funds hr 4569 as passed by the house however provided funding only for the nab hr 4328 as enacted includes full 179 billion funding for both the nab and the quota increase the payment however is conditioned on among other things notification that other major industrial nations have agreed to help implement changes in imf policies that would require that 1 borrowing nations liberalize trade restrictions and financial policies 2 the fund operate with greater transparency and 3 the fund lend money at higher interest rates and on shorter repayments to balance ofpayments distressed countries export promotion programs the president proposed that us government backed export assistance would grow by 146 million or nearly 30 over fy1998 to large extent the additional resources were requested to meet increasing demands by american businesses for exportimport bank loans loan guarantees and insurance especially for opportunities in russia the house in hr 4569 provided 635 million for the eximbank and other export promotion agencies meeting about half of the proposed increase from fy1998 while the senate appropriated 674 million in s 2334 as enacted the omnibus spending bill allocates 657 million for the exportimport bank the overseas private investment corporation and the trade and development agency nearly 17 more than appropriated in fy1998 development assistance bilateral development aid managed by usaid would have grown under the presidents budget by 45 million in fy1999 3 rise but would have reduced spending for some congressional priorities in order to finance administration initiatives the president proposed 43 million cut in child survival and infectious disease programs the subject of previous congressional addons in order to make way for small increases in population assistance environment projects private sectoreconomic growth programs especially in africa and aid to countries in transition from crisis to peace the house reduced usaid development aid by 48 million while s 2334 provided slightly more than the full 177 billion administration request of this total the senate earmarked 435 million for population assistance while the house limited spending for these purposes to 385 million the senate further cut funds for the african development foundation to 8 million well below the existing level 14 crs10 million and house and requested amounts hr 4569 sharply cut to 150 million disaster relief assistance while the s 2334 provided 200 million just under the presidents request as enacted hr 4328 funds usaid development aid programs at 179 billion 65 million more than fy1998 and 20 million above the requested amount including the 50 million in child survival emergency supplemental although usaid will have more development aid resources than it requested the mix of program funds will be different child and infectious disease programs will receive over 100 million more than the fy1999 proposal while 385 million cap population aid will limit resources for that development sector congress made small cuts from fy1998 to both the interamerican foundation 20 million and the african development foundation 11 million family planning restrictions and the population fund unfpa also within development assistance activities the president proposed about 400 million for population assistance and 25 million for unfpa throughout the year the president also restated his position that he would veto any legislation that included so called mexico city abortion restrictions to us overseas family planning policy during house committee markup the panel adopted an amendment by representative wicker inserting revised mexico city abortion restrictions and adding to permanent law ban on us contributions to unfpa unless unfpa terminated programs in china or the president certified that china longer engaged in coercive family planning practices this came in addition to subcommitteeadded prohibition of an fy1999 25 million unfpa contribution because of the resumption by the organization of program in china hr 4569 further capped population aid at 385 million s 2334 took an opposing position earmarking 435 million for population assistance without mexico city abortion restrictions or limitations on contributions to unfpa the omnibus appropriation places 385 million cap on population assistance but deletes the housepassed abortion restrictions it further denies all funding for unfpa due to the organizations new china program see more discussion below debt reduction funds for reducing debt owed to the us government by developing countries would have nearly tripled in fy1999 from 27 million to 72 million under the presidents budget this would support administration initiatives to forgive portions of debt owed by african countries an element in the presidents african trade and investment strategy and to implement multilateral effort to reduce debt owed by the heavily indebted poor countries hipc the house and senate made substantial reductions to the proposed appropriation 36 and 25 million respectively while the omnibus appropriation includes 33 million peace corps as part of two year effort to raise the number of peace corps volunteers from 6500 to 10000 the fy1999 request sought 270 million for the peace corps 22 rise the house appropriated 230 million while the senate reduced peace corps funding below the fy1998 level to 210 million as enacted hr 4328 provides 240 million an amount that will allow the peace corps to expand somewhat in fy1999 but not on schedule consistent with its 10000 volunteer target by 2000 crs11 narcotics aid appropriations for international narcotics and law enforcement programs would have grown to 275 million in fy1999 nearly 20 higher than fy1998 much of the increase was concentrated in latin america especially for the andean drug producing nations of bolivia colombia and peru congress divided on the issue of substantial additional funding for state department counternarcotics efforts with the house supporting the presidents full request but the senate approving only 222 million the omnibus appropriations measure includes 261 million an amount conferees believe will be sufficient to fully fund programs proposed in bolivia colombia and peru beyond this the omnibus bill includes an additional 2326 million emergency supplemental appropriations for counternarcotics activities mostly aimed at efforts in the andean drug producing countries of the total 144 million is expected to finance the procurement of helicopters and other items for colombia and the programs airwing nonproliferation antiterrorism and demining programs nadr funding for range of related programs addressing threats posed by weapons of mass destruction international terrorism and the spread of antipersonnel landmines would rise in fy1999 to 216 million twothirds more than fy1998 under the presidents proposed budget demining aid would grow from 20 million to 50 million but much of the increase in this account resulted from funding activities in fy1999 that were previously appropriated in other lineitems or other spending bills for fy1999 the administration incorporated into the nadr account 21 million to support science centers in russia and ukraine aimed at preventing the brain drain of scientists from these countries who have special skills in nuclear chemical and biological weapons systems the request also shifted funding from the commerce justice and state department appropriation bill for the comprehensive test ban treaty preparatory convention as passed by the house and senate nadr account levels were significantly below the 216 million request 152 million in the house and 170 million in the senate some of the house cuts were attributed to the ban on 35 million us contribution to the korean energy development organization see below and 26 million recommendation for demining programs as approved in the omnibus appropriations congress allocated 198 million for nadr account programs including targets of 35 million for demining 35 million to kedo subject to conditions and 15 million for nonproliferation activities separate and in addition to these amounts congress approved as part of the us embassy security emergency supplemental initiative 20 million for state department antiterrorism programs multilateral development bank arrearage payments for the second portion of 3 year plan to clear us arrears at several multilateral development banks mdbs the fy1999 request included 502 million up from 360 million appropriated for fy1998 although mdb arrearage payments had been expected for fy1999 the administration recalculated and accelerated the appropriation schedule for the 3year plan outlined year ago moreover congress provided special budget exemptions in the balanced budget act of 1997 so that addons for arrearage payments would not squeeze funding for other foreign policy programs last year the president projected 367 million for fy1999 and 863 million total over 3 years crs12 compared with the current fy1999 request of 502 million and total of 998 million2 house and senatepassed foreign operations bills made sharp cuts in the mdb arrears request providing 352 million and 311 million respectively each measure provided only about onefourth of the administrations 1925 million request for the world banks global environment facility gef while s 2334 further included only 5 million of the 883 million proposed for the african development fund levels for mdb arrears rose substantially in the enacted omnibus appropriations to 539 million exceeding the presidents request hr 4328 includes full funding for both the gef and the african development fund funding for countries and regions at the country level the fy1999 proposal recommended both continuity and change in the list of leading recipients of us aid in general the roster of major recipients included in the presidents request reflects us policy emphasis on middle east peace democratic transition in the former soviet union implementation of the dayton peace accords in bosnia and to somewhat lesser extent efforts to counter the drug trade in latin america israel 3 billion egypt 2116 billion and jordan 198 million would continue at about the same levels for fy1998 as would assistance for ukraine georgia armenia and bosnia assistance to russia which congress has reduced the past few years due to overall cuts in the former soviet aid account would increase significantly from 134 million allocated from fy1998 appropriations to 230 million for fy1999 us assistance to haiti would roughly double in fy1999 142 million as the administration sought to shift its program there from one focused on emergency and shortterm requirements to implementation of six year strategy focused on reducing longterm poverty assistance for peru and bolivia aimed at combating drug production and trafficking was also scheduled to rise significantly especially for bolivia where the administration reduced fy1998 assistance in order to fund the congressionallymandated transfer of blackhawk helicopters to columbia notably absent from the list of leading us aid recipients proposed for fy1999 were several countries turkey and greece whose aid levels have been linked by congressional formula that placed them among the five largest recipients in most years during the past two decades would receive only nominal amounts of assistance in fy1999 the administration had raised the prospect several years ago of ending military aid to turkey and greece the first steps came for fy1998 when the state department converted to military grant aid about 35 million in foreign military financing loan subsidies appropriated by congress that would have funded nearly 300 million in market rate loans for turkey and greece to procure us defense equipment us assistance to south africa was also scheduled to decline in fy1999 2 in its report on the fy1999 budget resolution s res 86 the senate budget committee took issue with the administrations recalculation of the mdb arrears plan reporting resolution that assumes an exemption of only 367 million the senate appropriations took similar approach stating that s 2334 completes total arrears payments for the interamerican development banks fund for special operations the asian development fund and the african development fund consistent with the special treatment provided by the committee on the budget the amounts in the senate bill do not exactly match those proposed by the administration or considered by the house crs13 from 73 million in fy1998 to 53 million fy1998 marked the end of the administrations initial fiveyear aid package launched in 1994 to assist the post apartheid government and the beginning of smaller program concentrated on strengthening democratic institutions primary health care services and education that usaid plans to phase out entirely by 2005 in most years during the foreign operations debate congress earmarks in the enacted legislation specific amounts for only few countries or regions that reflect congressional spending priorities for the vast majority of recipients administration officials retain flexibility to allocate the remaining funds

indonesia aid in light of the economic collapse in indonesia and the devastating social impact on the population the senate earmarked 100 million to support new us economic aid strategy for the country the initiative which roughly doubled planned american assistance for fy1999 would focus on programs aimed at local organizations and community leaders instead of central government ministries and be largely administered by nongovernmental organizations s 2334 further removed previous restrictions on military training for indonesia the house bill contained similar initiative the enacted omnibus appropriations earmarks 75 million in economic aid for indonesia along the policy guidelines proposed by the senate and permits training grants for the indonesian military limited to expanded imet programs that focus on civilianmilitary relations and human rights observance courses azerbaijan aid ban senate and house bills each retained the sixyear prohibition on us aid for azerbaijan section 907 of the freedom support act provision the administration had sought to repeal the house appropriations committee recommended repealing section 907 but an amendment sponsored by representative porter reinstated section 907 during floor debate passed 231182 while the senate bill did not repeal section 907 it broadened the exemptions to the aid ban by allowing the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation to extend loans and guarantees to american businesses investing in azerbaijan particularly for those involved in caspian basin oil activities the enacted omnibus measure retains section 907 and adopts the senate text exempting opic and eximbank from the aid prohibitions see below for more discussion north korea and the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo series of recent actions by the north korean government missile sales to iran possible new nuclear construction activities and the launch of rocket that traveled over japanese airspace made the administrations policy towards north korea and its request for 35 million for heavy fuel oil especially controversial during congressional debate this year during house committee markup the panel adopted an amendment by chairman livingston prohibiting without presidential waiver the 35 million request although s 2334 provided the full 35 million request for this high administration priority it required presidential certification regarding several compliance issues related to the 1994 agreed framework and other nuclear matters including two additional conditions added on the senate floor in the omnibus appropriation the president will get the requested 35 million for kedo in fy1999 but on delayed basis the first 15 million will be available after march 1 1999 if the president certifies that progress is occurring on crs15 implementing several agreements with north korea that the dprk is cooperating fully in the canning and storage of all spent fuel from its graphitemoderated nuclear reactors that north korea has not diverted any assistance and that the us is moving ahead with efforts to block dprks development and export of ballistic missiles the remaining 20 million is available after june 1 if the president certifies that progress has been made on the nuclear and ballistic missile issues and that the us and north korea have agreed on the means to satisfy us concerns about the dprks suspect underground construction these restrictions however can be waived for vital national security reasons hr 4328 further limits the presidents special waiver authority section 614 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 blocking its use to provide more than 35 million to kedo in fy1999 russia ukraine and other former soviet states house and senate recommendations were far apart on aid to russia ukraine and other former soviet states although both were well below the presidents overall request the senate provided 740 million to the entire region while the house limited spending to 590 million the final omnibus appropriations provides 801 million plus another 46 million in emergency supplemental funds significantly higher than either house or senate measures there were also substantial differences between country aid targets recommended in the two bills with the senate measure providing higher amounts for ukraine 210 million vs maximum of 147 million armenia 90 million vs not less than 49 million and georgia 95 million vs at least 49 million hr 4328 sets final earmarks at levels somewhat below the senate targets ukraine195 million armenia799 million and georgia844 million the higher overall account level and the reduced senate earmarks is likely to allow the administration to allocate resources for russia closer to the 225 million request than it has been able in recent years congress did not earmark assistance to these countries from other foreign aid accounts such as the peace corps these amounts are not included in the figures listed above africa assistance as subset of worldwide development aid the president asked congress to appropriate 730 million for african development programs in fy1999 an increase from the 700 million allocated in fy1998 beyond this the presidents budget included 67 million under the economic support fund esf to finance democracy and other new initiatives for africa and 35 million for debt reduction3 these proposals came within the context of the presidents 1998 visit to the region and the administrations africa trade and investment initiative launched last year usaid planned to use the 30 million increase in african development aid for technical assistance in support of the trade and investment plan in addition the administration expected to begin great lakes initiative 25 million from the esf account that would help strengthen judicial systems in the region and an education 3 africa like other regions receives funds from many foreign operations accounts including peace corps refugee aid exportimport bank trade and development agency the african development foundation peacekeeping imet and foreign military financing the administration estimates that total foreign operations funds for africa included in its fy1999 request is 123 billion up nearly 100 million from the 1134 billion allocated for fy1998 for more information on us aid to africa see crs issue brief 95052 africa us foreign assistance issues by raymond copson and crs issue brief 98015 african growth and opportunity act by theodros dagne crs16 for development and democracy program 36 million drawn from esf and development aid neither house or senate foreign aid bills for fy1999 earmarked specific amounts for africa nor did the enacted appropriations in hr 4328 recommend target or proportional allocation for the region nevertheless given the additional development aid funds appropriated by congress usaid will likely be able to allocate resources at or near the 730 million proposed level with the congressional addons for child survival and disease activities however aid managers may be forced to program more of these funds in africa than had been recommended with equivalent reductions in some of the trade and investment activities policy issues in the foreign operations debate in addition to funding decisions made by congress in the foreign operations appropriation bill the annual spending measure also includes wide range of policy provisions that frequently raise contentious foreign policy disagreements between the president and congress as mentioned above because of congress inability to enact foreign aid authorization bills for over decade the foreign operations legislation often becomes the vehicle for debate on the conduct of us foreign policy more generally many of these policy provisions take the form of conditions or restrictions on how the president can use money included in the spending bill many of these provisions are opposed by the administration as excessively limiting his ability to manage american foreign policy the most serious of these legislativeexecutive policy differences can ultimately result in delaying the enactment of the foreign operations bill or prompting presidential veto among the most significant policy issues raised during congressional debate this year on the foreign operations appropriation measure concerned conflicting executivelegislative branch development assistance strategy priorities restrictions on international family planning programs proposals to limit middle east assistance and reduce economic aid to israel conditions on aid to russia and ukraine and aid policy related to the dispute over nagornokarabakh policy priorities of us development aid since the end of the cold war common theme of many administration discussions and congressional debates has been what should replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale of the past 50 years more fundamental question raised by some especially critics of development assistance is whether the united states needs to maintain an active globally focused economic aid program or can it be transformed as smaller more targeted instrument with some elements being privatized that would support only the highest us foreign policy interests although there has been definitive consensus reached on these questions between the executive and legislative branches the clinton administration has strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which can be used to bolster variety of us foreign policy initiatives around the world in early 1994 usaid released its blueprint for postcold war development aid policy based around the goal of sustainable development and its four strategies of promoting economic growth stabilizing global population protecting the environment and crs17 advancing democracy more recently usaid has added fifth strategy aimed at developing human capacity through

development aid programs and do not include funds used for the same purposes although to lesser extent in other accounts including esf east europe and former soviet aid programs for example usaid estimates that it will spend in fy1998 and fy1999 385 million and 400 million respectively across all accounts for family planning programs 300 million for agriculture in fy1999 and 135 million for microenterprise including local currencies usaid has maintained since adopting these strategies in 1994 that they must operate as interlinked mutually reenforcing elements of an overall us effort to promote the advancement of market economies and democratic transitions in the developing world until countries reach point of sustainability that longer requires external aid funding reductions congressional restrictions and fluctuating administration priorities however have required usaid to alter the mix of resources devoted to each of the strategies raising questions over whether the integrative mutually reenforcing principles can be maintained congress for example limited development aid for population programs in fys199698 to roughly twothirds the amount provided in fy1995 see below for more discussion on family planning restrictions further the state departments bureau of global affairs places high crs18 priority on environment programs and presses usaid to allocate the maximum amount possible to such activities as result the environment sector of sustainable development probably has not declined as much as it might have otherwise but at the center of this issue for the past three years has been differences between congress and the executive branch regarding funding levels for programs supporting child survival basic education and hivaids and other infectious diseases despite cutting overall development aid in fys199697 by about 23 from fy1995 levels congress earmarked children and disease programs at amounts equal to or somewhat greater than those allocated in fy1995 making the cuts on all other elements of sustainable development closer to 30 although congress boosted development aid appropriations for fy1998 by 100 million over the previous year lawmakers earmarked half of the additional funds for the child survival and disease account congressional proponents of the child survival earmark argue that even though budget pressures require the united states to reduce or hold the line on foreign aid spending the protection of children remains core american value demanding that cuts should be implemented without putting at risk the lives and well being of small children in developing nations they further point out that the spread of infectious diseases poses direct threat to us citizens and that american national interests require continued support for global efforts to reduce or eliminate such illnesses while agreeing with the importance of child survival and infectious disease programs usaid officials apply broader definition to the terms arguing for example that efforts to protect small children go well beyond immunizations and access to other health services the quality of childs life they assert also is determined by an array of other factors including the degree of relative stability in society protection of the surrounding environment access to adequate shelter and implementation of sound economic policies that will ensure jobs and economic opportunities in the future consequently they contend the squeeze that earmarks place on other areas of sustainable development undermines to some extent the success of programs that also benefit children for fy1999 although usaid proposed to alter only slightly its resource allocation for sustainable development objectives the few changes recommended drew sharp criticism in some quarters of congress the 42 million reduction in child survival and infectious disease programs planned for fy1999 ran counter to the emphasis and increased funding mandated by congress for these activities the past three years the request for additional family planning funds although at levels well below the 548 million appropriated in fy1995 focused even greater attention on the most controversial element of usaids sustainable development agenda the largest increase recommended for fy1999 46 million was for environmental programs portion of which would support the administrations stated commitment for usaid to provide at least 150 million annually for the next five years for global climate change activities some also challenged the absence of increased funding for certain usaid activities especially for agriculture programs that agency officials acknowledge have been cut too deeply over the past decade although usaid said it was increasing emphasis on agriculture by strengthening links with economic growth and food security strategies the request for fy1999 was 127 million the same as for fy1998 crs19 congressional action the house restored to fy1998 levels 650 million the amounts for child survival and disease programs including basic education for children and set higher earmark 105 million for unicef hr 4569 further recommended 135 million plus local currencies for microcredit the president had set 135 million including local currencies as an fy1999 target for other development activities house spending levels were nearly identical to fy1998 appropriations although about 100 million less than the request as in previous years this would have most likely resulted in reductions to economic growth and environment programs from amounts planned by usaid moreover if funds were transferred out of the development assistance account to shore up funding shortfalls for disaster aid or usaid operating expenses authority granted by the committee larger cuts in economic growth and environment activities might be expected the senate provided in s 2334 funds for development assistance at level slightly more than the presidents requested but did not continue separate account for child survival and diseases s 2334 however required the administration to continue spending for infectious diseases at fy1998 levels and set basic education aid at 100 million the senate measure also included 305 million agriculture programs and required microcredit to receive 145 million half of which must be for loans of less than 300 the omnibus appropriations funds usaid development aid programs at 179 billion 65 million above fy1998 levels and 20 million more than the presidents request the bill includes separate child survival account at 650 million plus 50 million child survival emergency supplemental bringing resources for child and disease initiatives to 700 million although usaid will receive more development aid resources than it requested the mix of program funds will be different children programs will receive over 100 million more than the fy1999 proposal while 385 million cap population aid will limit resources for that development sector conferees did not include the senate earmark for agriculture programs but recommended usaid allocate 305 million for these activities in fy1999 the final bill does not earmark specific amount for microcredit but requires that half of the loans be less than 300 population and family planning assistance for fy1999 the president sought 400 million for usaid family planning programs 15 million increase over fy1998 levels but the principal executivelegislative dispute over population assistance goes well beyond funding issues centering more directly on abortion related activities of foreign recipients of usaid grants for over decade congress has engaged in contentious debates over us international family planning policy often as part of the foreign operations appropriations twice congressional positions on this issue have been one of the major reasons prompting presidential veto us international family planning programs had been one of the largest growth areas of the foreign aid budget in the 1990s from an average of about 250 million in the late 1980s fy1995 spending across all foreign operations accounts totaled approximately 548 million when congress deadlocked over abortionrelated restrictions and us population aid policy situation that blocked movement of the entire foreign operations bill each of the last 3 years lawmakers adopted interim crs20 provisions that among other things strictly limited the amount of funding for usaid family planning programs the fy1997 and fy1998 appropriation cap of 385 million is roughly twothirds the amount provided in fy1995 as result of the impasse over abortion restrictions congress established delayed timetable for making these funds available schedule that included monthly apportionments or metering of the appropriation second issue in the population aid debate and one directly connected to funding reductions and metering of the past three years deals with abortion restrictions and the eligibility requirements for foreign organizations receiving funds to implement ussponsored family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy the reagan and later the bush administrations restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippf became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was not used in abortionrelated work during the past three years the house and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue that in each case held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measure the house position sponsored by representative smith nj supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries the senate on the other side has rejected house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring policy that leaves these decisions in the hands of the administration moreover administration officials have stated that president clinton would veto any bills that include the housepassed mexico city restrictions unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements for fy199698 that did not resolve the broad population program controversy for congress but did permit the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward it was hoped that the arrangement which neither side liked would provide incentives for those involved in the debate to find middle ground under the terms of the fy1998 temporary arrangement as included in pl 105118 congress deleted the housesupported mexico city restrictions limited population aid funding to 385 million down from 435 million passed by the senate and delayed or metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month although not referenced in the enacted legislation the inability to resolve the dispute over family planning and abortion has blocked congressional approval of funding for other administration high priority foreign policy initiatives at the end of 1997 when conferees removed the housepassed mexico city restrictions from the fy1998 foreign operations measure house leaders withdrew support for pending legislation providing funds for us participation in the international monetary funds new arrangements to borrow and to pay american arrears at the crs21 and other international organizations without white house willingness to compromise on the family planning issue they said imf and funding would remain linked to mexico city restrictions congress recessed for 1997 without resolving the issue in early 1998 congress approved modified mexico city restrictions4 to an omnibus foreign policy authorization bill hr 1757 that among other things authorized us payment of arrears and reorganized us foreign policy agencies the president said however that he would veto the bill congressional delayed submitting hr 1757 to the president until october 21 at which time he vetoed the legislation for more information see crs issue brief 96026 us international population assistance issues for congress by kerry dumbaugh and larry nowels congressional action as in each of the past two years the house bill hr 4569 capped family planning assistance at 385 million for fy1999 and continued most of the noncontroversial restrictions on population aid including that us funds may pay for abortions during appropriations committee markup the house panel further adopted an amendment by representative wicker that inserted the same revised mexico city abortion restrictions that congress adopted earlier this year in hr 1757 that is prohibition on us funds to foreign nongovernmental groups and multilateral organizations which 1 perform abortions with their own money or 2 violate abortion laws or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries it would allow the president to waive the prohibition on performing abortions but would not permit waiver for lobbying exercising the waiver however would result in reduction of family planning funds from 385 million to 356 million the bill also banned the 25 million requested us contribution to unfpa because of the organizations newly initiated program in china the wicker amendment further would have placed into permanent law an annual prohibition on unfpa funding unless the president could certify that unfpa had terminated its china program or that china longer engaged in coercive family planning practices finally the house also adopted an amendment by representative tiahrt that precisely defined the term voluntary family planning programs and established criteria for usaid to apply regarding the voluntary nature of its population projects the senate in s 2334 took supportive and less restrictive position on family planning issues earmarking 435 million for population assistance level higher than the administrations request the legislation continued longstanding non controversial restrictions on the use of us government funds for abortions but did not include the mexico city conditions or limitations on contributions to unfpa the omnibus appropriation caps population aid at 385 million and meters the funds on monthly basis of about 8 but deletes the housepassed modified mexico city restrictions it further denies the 25 million request for unfpa 4 this revised amendment would ban us funds to foreign nongovernmental groups and international organizations which 1 perform abortions with their own money or 2 lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries it allowed however the president to waive the prohibition on performing abortions but did not allow waiver for lobbying if the president exercised the waiver family planning funds would drop from 385 million appropriated to 356 million crs22 because of the china program and adds modified version of housepassed tiahrt amendment regarding the voluntary nature of us family planning activities middle east aid and israels plan to phaseout economic assistance since the late 1970s by far the largest portion of us foreign aid has supported american friends and allies in the middle east especially israel and egypt combined these two countries have received over 100 billion during the past 20 years for decade foreign aid bills annually have earmarked 3 billion for israel and 2115 billion for egypt in economic and military assistance the fy1999 request matched these traditional levels although annual aid allocations for israel and egypt have not grown in dollar terms the decline in overall foreign operations funding the past several years has meant that the proportion of worldwide foreign aid going to the middle east climbed to 44 in fy1997 some in congress and in the executive branch suggested that at time of overall budget cuts all aid activities including those for israel and egypt should be examined for possible reductions in order to fund other emerging initiatives for which new money is not available in similar vein others have argued that if the administration wants to launch new regional initiatives to advance the peace process it should finance them through the reallocation of existing middle east aid resources so funds are not drawn from other foreign aid activities following this suggestion the administration has financed about 100 million in additional assistance to jordan in each of the past two years by transferring 50 million from israel and egypts economic aid packages last year congress took steps to legislate cap on foreign operations resources for the middle east largely at the initiative of representative callahan chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee lawmakers stipulated in the fy1998 funding measure section 586 of pl 105118 that selected middle east nations and regional programs could not receive more than 54 billion of the total appropriation level representing 41 of all foreign operations funds israel 3 billion egypt 2115 billion and jordan 225 million accounted for all but 60 million of the regional total although it was assumed that israel would contribute 50 million for jordan and prioryear appropriations for egypt would be tapped for another 50 million the administrations fy1999 proposal exceeded the 54 billion cap for fy1998 by about 200 million but state department budget justification documents pledged to work with congress on an appropriate formula in order to keep spending within the maximum permitted for fy1998 as congress and the administration have searched the past two years for ways to finance new middle east peace initiatives while straightlining or reducing aid to the region israel put forth in january 1998 plan to cut its aid over the next tento twelve years the concept behind an israeli initiative to decrease assistance from the united states was first raised by prime minister netanyahu during speech before joint session of congress on july 10 1996 as outlined to congressional and administration officials by israeli finance minister neeman in late january 1998 the united states would cut economic aid by 120 million each year for about ten years while increasing military assistance by 60 million annually at the end of the period israel would be receiving an annual appropriation of 24 billion in military aid but longer receive any economic assistance if done over tenyear period in net terms crs23 us aid to israel would fall 60 million each year with total savings of 600 million by 2009 congressional reaction to the israeli proposal generally was positive some cautioned however that perhaps the plan could be implemented over shorter period of time and that further study was needed to assess if israel needed additional military aid because many in congress have viewed egypts aid as linked to israels through the camp david peace process reduction in assistance to israel has also affected egypts aid funding level for more information see crs report 98104 israel proposed changes in us foreign assistance fy1999 by clyde mark congressional action both hr 4569 and s 2334 reduced aid to israel and egypt in generally proportional manner and along the lines set out by israeli officials earlier this year for israel economic aid was cut by 120 million 108 billion and military assistance increased by 60 million 186 billion for net reduction of 60 million in addition the house measure allowed israel to use 490 million of its 186 billion military funding for procurement outside the united states up 15 million from the existing allowance s 2334 permitted 4929 million for these purposes egypt would receive 40 million less in economic aid 775 million and the same 13 billion military package in both measures the omnibus appropriation hr 4328 includes this israelegypt aid reduction initiative basically along the lines included in both house and senate bills israel may spend 490 million in military aid outside the united states as the house proposed the legislation further continues the 54 billion cap on middle east bilateral assistance permitting presidential waiver to exceed this amount if its important to us national security aid restrictions for russia and ukraine since the collapse of the soviet union the administration with relatively steady support from congress has utilized us economic assistance to facilitate the transition of russia ukraine and the other successor states referred to as the new independent states or nis to democracy and free market economies past foreign operations debates have focused on both the size of assistance for the nis account as well as conditions attached to providing the aid especially to russia conditions have dealt with wide range of policy concerns including the initiation of economic policy and political reforms non aggression against neighbors russian troop withdrawal from the baltics among others despite congressional aid restrictions in the past the president has been able to make the necessary certifications that permitted the transfer of us assistance for fy1999 president clinton requested 925 million for the nis account 155 million or 20 more than fy1998 appropriations nearly twothirds 95 million of the additional funds were slated for russia congress not only scrutinized closely the size of the nis request but lawmakers also reexamined policy conditions attached to previous appropriation measures concerning russian support for irans nuclear program implementation of russian law that could discriminate against crs24 religious minorities and ukrainian practices that undermine efforts by american businesses to invest in ukraine5 under conditions enacted in the fy1998 foreign operations spending measure title ii of pl 105118 the president must withhold 50 of assistance scheduled to be allocated to the government of russia until he certifies to congress that russia has terminated implementation of arrangements to provide iran with technical expertise training technology or equipment necessary to develop nuclear reactor related nuclear research facilities or programs or ballistic missile capability aid transferred directly to the russian private sector or nongovernmental organizations would not affected by these conditions the president could waive the provision if instead he determines that the assistance is vital to us national security interests and russia is taking meaningful steps to reduce nuclear support for iran also serving as potential limitation for us assistance to the russian government in fy1998 was provision section 577 of pl 105118 that became effective about april 26 1998 under section 577 the russian government could not receive any further us aid in fy1998 unless the president certified to congress by late may 1998 that the government had not implemented laws executive orders or other regulations that would discriminate against religious groups or communities in russia the law provided waiver authority president clinton issued the necessary determination on may 26 stating that russia has applied the new russian law on religion in manner that is not in conflict with its international obligations on religious freedom further restriction attached by congress to nis assistance for fy1998 concerned complaints lodged by american businesses investing in ukraine that they have been the subject of corruption and harassment by ukrainian officials ukraine has enjoyed strong congressional support for several years becoming the third highest 225 million recipient of us economic aid nevertheless the fy1998 foreign operations measure required the secretary of state to withhold onehalf of ukraines assistance about 100 million excluding election support and nuclear reactor safety programs until she certified to congress by april 30 1998 that the ukrainian government had made significant progress in resolving complaints made by american investors secretary albright issued such notice on april 29 although she acknowledged that she remained extremely concerned about the overall investment climate in ukraine and investor problems that have yet to be resolved due to these concerns she said the us will continue to withhold about 25 million from government assistance in sectors where economic reforms have stalled if progress is not forthcoming and the funds cannot be used effectively the aid would be shifted to private sector and nongovernmental programs congressional action the house bill continued restrictions related to russian iranian nuclear cooperation but dropped conditions on ukraines assistance the senate incorporated existing restrictions on russia and ukraine for fy1999 after making some significant changes in the case of russias cooperation with iran on 5 for more information on nis aid issues see crs issue brief 95077 the former soviet union and us foreign assistance by curt tarnoff and crs report 97696 russias religious law assessments and implications by james nichol october 27 1997 crs25 nuclear and missile programs s 2334 made all us assistance to russia not just 50 of aid designated for the russian government subject to certification that moscow had terminated such arrangements with iran there was waiver included on the issue of minority religious persecution s 2334 required that funds could be provided for russian government aid programs for six months unless the president certified that law or other government action had been implemented that would discriminate against religious groups the senate measure added new restriction blocking any aid to russia until the secretary of state certified that the us and russian governments had reached an agreement that american aid would not be taxed for ukraine the s 2334 withheld half of the assistance exclusive of funds for nuclear safety law enforcement and the free market democracy fund until the secretary of state notified congress that ukraine had undertaken significant economic reforms beyond those achieved this year hr 4328 as enacted appropriates 801 million for the nis plus an additional 46 million in emergency supplemental funds combined the 847 million provides the president with 77 million increase over fy1998 with earmarks for ukraine armenia and georgia at or below requested levels it is likely that the administration will be able to allocate to russia resources closer to proposed amounts 225 million in fy1999 than has been the case in recent years nevertheless conditions on aid to both russia and ukraine will continue for this year and could limit final amounts provided for russia the state department must withhold 50 of us aid to the government unless moscow ends its nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation with iran the restriction however can be waived by the president further assistance to the russian government can be provided after april 21 1999 unless the president certifies that the russian federation has not implemented laws or regulations that discriminate against religious groups finally the omnibus bill includes modified condition added by the senate blocking further us aid to the russian government after april 21 1999 unless the secretary of state has certified that american aid will not be taxed or that significant progress has been made on reaching an agreement that exempts us assistance from customs duties for ukraine congress requires that the president withhold half of the funds for six months until the secretary of state has certified that ukraine has undertaken significant economic reforms including efforts to resolve complaints by american investors us aid to the caucasus and the armeniaazerbaijan conflict in another part of the former soviet union congress has also used foreign assistance as key tool both as reward and as sanction in influencing american foreign policy in the southern caucasus often at odds with the administration the longest interethnic dispute in the former soviet union between armenia and azerbaijan and the status of nagornokarabakh especially have been growing focus of congressional debate in foreign operations appropriation bills during the last several years nagornokarabakh is predominately armenianpopulated enclave in azerbaijan armenia argues for the right of selfdetermination for the people of nagornokarabakh while azerbaijan insists on the territorial integrity of its borders fighting over the territory claimed thousands of lives and created approximately 350000 armenian and 11 million azeri refugees since 1992 efforts to mediate the conflict overseen largely by the organization for security and cooperation in crs26 europes osce minsk group but also with extensive russian participation gained ceasefire in 1994 but permanent resolution6 congress has tended to favor armenia in the dispute by earmarking high amounts of economic aid to armenia and designating nagornokarabakh as recipient of humanitarian aid distinct from azerbaijan and enacting in 1992 ban on all us assistance to azerbaijan section 907 of the freedom support act pl 102 511 concern over the situation of azeri refugees and the growing importance of potential american investment in the large azerbaijan oil sector has led congress to soften the outright ban on aid to azerbaijan and to construct for fy1998 regional assistance package aimed in part at supporting the minsk group peace efforts previous foreign operations bills have permitted humanitarian aid for armenian and azeri refugees in the region as well as assistance to the government of azerbaijan for disarmament programs for fy1998 congress also exempted democracy projects from the section 907 prohibition as well as export promotion aid provided by the trade and development agency and activities performed by us foreign commercial officers in azerbaijan the foreign operations spending measure for fy1998 also included 250 million for the southern caucasus region with the intent in part to encourage the regional parties to cooperate with minsk group peace efforts out of this total armenia was allocated 875 million georgia 925 million and up to 70 million could assist refugees and internally displaced persons as well as reconstruction efforts throughout the region including those in nagornokarabakh although the section 907 aid restrictions continued to apply to azerbaijan in fy1998 with modifications noted above congress assumed that with an interim settlement brokered by the minsk group the president would be able to meet the requirements stated in section 907 for fully lifting the aid ban and permit azerbaijan to receive portions of reconstruction assistance if an interim agreement was not reached by may 30 1998 however the president could reallocate up to 4375 million of the 70 million total for other nis states including those in central asia or russia for fy1999 the administration sought 80 million for armenia and 807 million for georgia down somewhat from the fy1998 earmarks and 315 million for azerbaijan up from an allocation of 214 million for fy1998 the program in azerbaijan would continue humanitarian and democracyrelated activities plus initiate new programs aimed at the private sector and demining activities all consistent according to usaid with the terms of section 907 moreover the administration asked congress to repeal section 907 saying that it continued to act as handicap for us negotiators who need to be perceived as fair and honest brokers to all sides in the dispute in addition executive branch officials argued that section 907 restrictions block us efforts to promote economic legal and regulatory reforms that will be important to protecting american firms and their large investments in caspian 6 for further information on the dispute see crs issue brief 92109 armeniaazerbaijan conflict by carol migdalovitz crs27 basin oil opportunities including pipeline projects that would bring the oil to market without having to pass through iran7 congressional action following the general framework of the fy1998 program the house bill hr 4569 funded the southern caucasus account at not less than 197 million of which roughly 79 million must be reserved for postconflict reconstruction armenia and georgia would receive at least 49 million each of the southern caucus account during committee markup the house appropriations committee adopted an amendment by chairman livingston repealing the sec 907 aid ban on azerbaijan during floor consideration however the full house approved 231182 an amendment by representative porter reversing the committee action and restoring section 907 in s 2334 the senate earmarked 90 million for armenia and 95 million for georgia while the bill did not repeal sec 907 it expanded the list of programs explicitly exempted from the prohibition by adding opic and the exportimport bank to current waivers for humanitarian aid democracy programs and tda the senate appropriations committee further urged in its report that these us export promotion agencies aggressively pursue funding for an eastwest oil pipeline that would cross turkey hr 4328 as enacted provides 228 million for the southern caucus region of which 40 million is designated for the us share of an international peace restoration effort it earmarks aid to georgia at 844 million and 799 million for armenia while section 907 restrictions will remain the omnibus spending measure broadens the programs exempted like the senate proposed to include opic and the exportimport bank for
