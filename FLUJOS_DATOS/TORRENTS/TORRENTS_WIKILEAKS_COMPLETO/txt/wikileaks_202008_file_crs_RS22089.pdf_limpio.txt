crisis in drc and monuc the democratic republic of congo formerly zaire has been in political turmoil for years in may 1997 the alliance of th democratic forces for the liberation of congozaire afdl with the support of rw anda and uganda ma rched into kinshasa and ousted longtime dictator mobutu sese seko within one year tensions between president laurent kabila nd his rwandan and ugandan allies began to mount by august 1998 open conflict erupted between ka bila and congolese forces supported by rwanda angola namib ia and zimbabwe joined the fighting in support of kabila in july 1999 at mmit in lusaka zambia the leaders of uganda rwanda congo zimbabwe namibia and angola signed peace agreement the agreement called for ceasefire within 24 hours of the si gning of the agreement nonetheless both sides to the conflict consistently violated the ceasefire agreement the lusaka accords established joint military commission jmc to investigate ceasefire violations and to disarm militia groups the withdrawal of fore ign forces from congo was one of the key elements of the lusaka accords the accords also called for political dialogue among congolese political and armed groups to settle their differences peacefully and to map out new political chapter for congo the former president of botswana sir ketumile masire was appointed to facilitate the talks the accords called for the deployment of military observers and in august 1999 the ited nations security council authorized the deployment of 90 united nations military liaison personnel to the d rc in november 1999 security council resolution 1279 affirmed that the previously authorized united nations personnel would constitute the united nations organizati on mission in the drc monuc in july 2003 the council authorized an increase of monuc forces to 10800 troops monuc is mandated through march 31 2005 secu rity council resolution 1565 to monitor the ceasefire agreement to verify disengag ement of forces to facilitate humanitarian assistance and to oversee disarmament and demobilization of combatants the operation is authorized under chapter vii of th united nations chapter which allows peacekeepers to use force if necessary to carry out their mandate as of august 31 2004 an estimated 10715 uniformed pe rsonnel including 10022 troops 554 military observers 139 civilian police supported by 699 international civ ilian personnel and 1114 local civilian staff have been deployed to drc frenchled multinational peacekeeping troops which arrived at the end of may 2003 to secure areas in the northeast of the country

troops on october 1 2004 the united nations s ecurity council increased the number of monucs force by 5900 personnel incl uding up to 341 civilian police personnel although secretary general kofi annan requested much larger increase for drc in his august 16 2004 report to the security c ouncil annan recommende d that the council consider increasing the current military st rength of monuc of 10800 in all ranks by an additional 13100 thus bringing the missi ons authorized strength to 23900 he argued that the transitional process in the democratic republic of congo is at critical juncture

peacekeepers sept 12 2003challenges to the mission the mission in congo faces challeng as the transition period comes to an end the kinshasa government still does not have political and security control outside the capital especially in the eastern part of the country in early june 2004 rebel groups led by general laurent nkunda and colonel jules mutebutsi attacked and captured the eastern town of bukavu killing many civili ans and forcing monuc forces to flee the town general nkunda argues that he attacked the town in order to protect civilians of tutsi origin who had been targeted by pro government forces the rebel forces were forced out of bukavu but the incident in b ukavu demonstrated the fra gile nature of the transitional peace process the drc government accused the government of rwanda of backing the rebels rwanda denied that its forces were involved in eastern congo the bukavu incident intensified nsions between rwanda and congo and it seemed the drc might once again plunge into major conflict in late june however president paul kagame of rwanda and pres ident joseph kabila of congo met in nigeria under the auspices of president obasanjo of nigeri the parties agreed to set up joint verification committee to ensure border secur ity in july 2004 united nations expert panel issued report pursuant to secur ity council resolution 1493 which imposed an arms embargo on foreign and congolese ar med groups not party to the peace agreement the report alleged that the governments of rwanda drc and ug anda provided support to rebel groups inside congo6 in may and july 2004 the bush adminis tration hosted talks in washington between rwanda uganda and d rc in an effort to ease tensions in the region again in september the united states hosted talks in new york and the pa rties are scheduled to meet in kigali rwanda in late october while these efforts have eased tensions among these regional actors the internal political situation in congo has deteriorated over the past several months according to the th ird special report of the secretary general the atmosphere of mistrust among the parties has grown and the lack of political will of some influential players to implement the transitional agenda remains serious hindrance to progress organizing and conducting free and fair national elec tions in the absence of security in parts of drc and lack of ba sic infrastructure could be major challenge to the fragile transitional government moreover lack of progress on the military integration of the various groups in the transitional government has raised serious concerns about lasting peace in congo since the deployment of regional military commanders in late 2003 little progress has been made in force integration and other areas another complicating factor for m onuc is how to deal with the interhamwe militia and former rwandan for ces active in eastern congo monuc does not have the mandate to disarm these militia groups major source of instability in the congo the government of president kabila has been unable or unwilling to disarm the interhamwe and negotiations with neighbor ing countries to create mechanism to deal with this problem have been stalled
