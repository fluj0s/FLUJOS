proposals including the lin eitem veto it stated that perennial criticism of the federal government is that spending and tax legislation include provisions benefitting relative few provisions that

spending3 scope of proposal the administration has not released draft nguage to define precisely how the item veto would operate the descri ption in analytical perspectives has three elements 1 the president would be authorized to defer new spending 2 he could act whenever he determined it was not an essential governme nt priority and 3 all savings would be used for deficit reduction apparently th is excludes tax legislation but may include mandatory spending two of the elements seem identical to the line item veto act of 1996 that the supreme court struck down in clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 1998 the line item veto act identified three reasons why the president could cancel discretionary budget authority provide new direct spending or limit tax benefit the president would be required to determine that such cancellation would i reduce the federal budget deficit ii not impair any essential government functions and iii not harm the national interest4 even in the presence of those stated purposes as conditions placed on delegated authority the court invalidated the act deferring new spending it is unclear what is meant by authorizing the president to defer new spending defer generally means to delay or postpone there would be little if any budgetary savings by deferring other than perhaps pushing the spending from one fiscal year to the next which would reduce the deficit in one year and increase it in future year if congress had appropriated the funds to be spent within particular year oneyear money federal agencies woul d have legal obligation to obligate the money that year to avoid that restriction it would be n ecessary for the administration to seek new statutory authority to change the money from oneyear to multiyear period perhaps the section in analytical perspec tives means defer in the sense of the deferral process incorporated in the impoundm ent control act of 1974 as amended the statute defines deferral of budget authority in this manner w ithholding or delaying the obligation or expenditure of budget author ity whether by establishing reserves or otherwise provided for projects or activities or b any other type of executive action or inaction which effectively precludes the obligation or expe nditure of budget authority including authority to obligate by contract in advance of appropriations as specifically authorized by law5 the purpose of deferrals was to lay spending not to cancel it as result of litigation during the reagan ad ministration congress passed legislation to restrict deferrals to routine administrative actions and thus prevent deferrals simply because the executive branch opposed program or activity6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22155crs3 7 budget of the united states government fiscal year 2006 p 362 8

deficits for fiscal years 2005 2006 and 2007 427 billion 390 billion and 312 billion7 however the budget explains that these deficits do not incl ude the costs of continuing operations in afghanistan and iraq8 the congressional budget offi ce cbo has computed that 30 billion 70 billion and 75 billion would be dded to the deficit for those years by assuming the phasedown of activities in iraq and afghanistan and continued spending for the global war on terrorism9 these cbo adjustments bring the deficits for fiscal years 2005 2006 nd 2007 to 457 billion 460 billion and 387 billion another approach is to take the deficit in cbo s baseline for those three years 368 billion 295 billion and 261 billion and add the amounts fo r iraq and afghanistan yielding these totals 398 billion 364 billion and 336 billion under these scenarios the budget deficit for particular fis cal year exceeds 300 billion and in some instances even 400 billion deficits could increase from future po licy changes such as modifications of the alternative minimum tax amt savings from an item veto it is impossible to estimate possible sa vings without knowing the precise item veto proposal the administration is likely to sub mit to congress however the experience with the item veto both concep tually and in actual practice suggests that the amounts that might be saved by presidential item veto could be relatively small in the range of perhaps one to two billion dollars year10 under some circumstances the availability of an item veto could increase spending th administration might agree to withhold the use of an item veto for particular progra m if members of congress agreed to support spending program initiated by the president aside from modest savings the impact of an item veto may well be felt in preferring the presidents spending priorities over those enacted by congress gao report in 1992 in january 1992 the general accounting office gao released report that estimated the

saps prepared early in the process as reliable guide for what happens when presiden ts receive appropriations bills it also contested other assumptions used in the gao study the crs report cautioned that an item veto could increase spending if president armed with an item veto told lawmakers that project or program in their district or state would be itemvetoed unless they supported spending initiative favored by the president12 on july 23 1992 comptroller general ch arles bowsher acknowledged that actual savings from an item veto are likely to have been much less than the potential savings estimated in the gao study actual sa vings could have been substantially less than the maximum and maybe as you have ggested close to zero mr bowsher also discussed situations in which the net effect of item veto power would be to increase spending such result could occur if president chose to announce his intent to exercise an item veto against programs or projects favored by individual senators and representatives as means of gaining thei r support for spending programs which would not otherwise have been enacted by the congress13 cancellations by president clinton the line item veto act of 1996 authoriz ed the president to cancel discretionary appropriations any new item of direct spending entitlements and other mandatory programs and certain limited tax benefits congress would have to pass resolution of disapproval within 30 days the president could veto that resolution and force an override vote in each house president bill c linton used this statutory authority to cancel number of discretionary appr opriations new items of direct spending and targeted tax benefits the total savings over five year period came to less than 600 million his cancellations for fiscal ear 1998 were about 355 million out of total budget of 17 trillion14 the totals would have been somewhat higher had all the recommendations by president clinton been accepted by congress he canceled 38 projects in the military construction bill estimating that this wo uld save 290 million over fiveyear period he identified three criteria that guided the selections 1 the defense

came under heavy fire the sena appropria tions committee held hearings and took testimony from the air force the navy and the army the military witnesses told the committee that the canceled projects were missionessential and could be commenced in 199816 the senate voted 69 to 30 to disapprove the cancellations the house voted 352 to 64 fo r the disapproval resolution president clinton vetoed the resolution but strong bipartisan majority overrode him by the necessary twothirds margin the vote was 78 to 20 in the senate and 347 to 69 in the house the administration reversed itself on cancellation that involved the federal retirement system affecting employees who switched from the civil service retirement system csrs to the federal employees re tirement system fers president clinton stated that the action would save 854 million over five years senator ted stevens chairman of the appropriations committee and senator pete dominici chairman of the budget committee challenged the legal ba sis for the cancellation although it was reported as cancellation of discretionary budg et authority they both agreed that the change in the fers policy did not constitute budget authority in fact the administration was unable to re port estimated savings in budget outlays as substitute it reported the fers proposal as receipt savings17 administration officials later admitted that president clinton did not have authority to cancel funds in the retirement program18 impact on budget priorities although many analysts do not view itemve to authority as an effective vehicle to achieve significant savings or deficit reduction number of studies indicate that governors use the item veto to favor execu tive priorities over legislative priorities19 in 1995 during hearings on the

hearings cbo director robert reischauer agreed that the item veto would not produce much in savings the more important impact would be in giving presidential spending preference over congressional spending evidence at the state level he said suggests that the item veto has not been used primarily to hold down overall state spending but rather it has been used by governors to substitute their priorities for those of the legislatures experience at the national level convinced reischauer that presidents would seek itemveto authority to direct greater resources to their own spending agendas21 earlier in house hearings in 1992 gao assistant comptr oller general harry havens testified about the lik ely effect of proposals to nhance the presidents authority to cancel or refuse to spe nd appropriated funds the great est impact he said would not be in savings but rather in the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches various itemveto or rescission proposals would represent major shift of power from congress to the president in an area that was reserved to congress by the constitution and which has historically been one of clear legislative primacy22 joining havens at those hearings reischauer testified that pressures for increased spending are as likely to come from presidents as from lawmakers recent history suggests that presidents are not necessarily penurious and congre ss is not necessarily fiscally profligate the record for the past 16 years which is roughly the period in which we have been terribly cerned about the deficit s hows that the congress has appropriated less in discretionary spending than the pres ident has asked for in 11 of those 16 years presidents who support reductions in one area often are in favor of increases or more than the congress pr ovides in some other areas23 conclusions restoration of itemveto authority for the president would not be expected to provide substantial remedy for large budg et deficits particularly those in the neighborhood of 400 billion that are currently projected an item veto might produce few billion dollars in savings in fiscal year but could quite possibly increase spending as result of quid pro quo between the branch significant issue relating to the item veto is whether it would give preference to presidential priorities over congressional priorities raising broa der questions about the legislative power of the purse and principles of representative government
