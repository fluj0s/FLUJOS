and historical background updated july 6 2006 betsy palmer analyst in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress territorial delegates to the us congress current issues and historical background summary territorial delegates have served in the house since the late 1700s representing territories that had not yet achieved statehood in the 20th century the concept of delegate grew to include representation of territories where the united states exercises some degree of control but which were not expected to become states currently the us insular areas of american samoa guam the virgin islands and the federal municipality of the district of columbia are each represented in congress by delegate to the house of representatives the individual elected to represent puerto rico is called the resident commissioner instead of delegate the delegates and resident commissioner are the successors of delegates from statehoodbound territories who first took seats in the house in the late 1700s proposals offered in recent congresses have sought to grant the delegate from the district of columbia voting rights on the floor of the house another proposal would expand territorial representation to include the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands floor action in the house and senate on these bills could occur before the end of the 109th congress early laws providing for territorial delegates to congress did not specify the duties privileges and obligations of these representatives it was left to the house and the delegates themselves to define their role on january 13 1795 the house took an important step toward establishing the functions of delegates when it appointed james white the first territorial representative to membership on select committee in subsequent years delegates continued to serve on select committees as well as on conference committees the first fixed assignment of delegate to standing committee occurred under house rule of 1871 which gave delegates places as additional members on two standing committees in these committees the delegates exercised the same powers and privileges as in the house that is they could debate but not vote in the 1970s delegates gained the right to be elected to standing committees and to exercise in those committees the same powers and privileges as members of the house including the right to vote today delegates enjoy powers rights and responsibilities identical in most respects to those of house members from the states like these members delegates can speak and introduce bills and resolutions on the house floor and they can speak and vote in house committees delegates are not however fullfledged members of congress most significantly they cannot vote on the house floor this report builds on earlier reports on territorial delegates prepared by former colleagues andorra bruno and the late william h tansill and

office of territorial delegate was created by the continental congress through the northwest ordinance of 1787 the statutory authority was extended under the constitution and territorial delegates have been regular part of congressional operations since through most of the 19th century territorial delegates represented areas that were on the way to ultimate statehood with us acquisition of overseas territories beginning with the spanishamerican war however congress created the post of resident commissioner to represent those areas which had by treaty or law different relationship to the federal government the office of resident commissioner was however used by the congress to permit representation in the house in only two instances the philippine islands intended for ultimate independence were represented by two resident commissioners until independence was declared in 1946 puerto rico with commonwealth status and treaty guaranteeing popular self determination has been represented by single resident commissioner since 1902 beginning in the 1970s congress returned to the concept of delegate to provide representation to territories and the district of columbia currently the us insular areas of american samoa guam puerto rico the virgin islands and the federal municipality of the district of columbia are each represented in congress by delegate to the house of representatives1 the delegates enjoy many but not all of the powers and privileges of house members from the states in the 109th congress several proposals are under consideration that would change the number of territorial delegates in congress and alter the legal authorities under which the post of territorial delegate and that of resident commissioner serve 1 in the case of puerto rico the congressional representative is called resident commissioner today the offices of resident commissioner and delegate are essentially the same though the resident commissioner is elected to fouryear term and delegates are elected to twoyear terms the term delegates as used in this report includes the puerto rican resident commissioner unless otherwise indicated crs2 109th congress legislative issues northern mariana islands delegate during world war ii the united states took control of the northern mariana islands from the japanese following the war the united nations made the islands trusteeship of the united states in 1975 the united states and representatives of the islands reached an agreement known as the covenant to establish commonwealth of the northern mariana islands in political union with the united states of america and in 1986 residents of the northern mariana islands were granted us citizenship under terms of the covenant the commonwealth makes its own laws the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi pursuant to the covenant agreement with the united states incorporated into pl 94241 48 usc 1801 currently elects resident representative which is different from the position of resident commissioner from puerto rico the resident representative formally presents his credentials to the department of state and is the representative of the cmni government to the various governmental departments in washington concerned with northern mariana islands issues primarily the department of the interior currently the resident representative has official status in congress although he has frequently testified before congressional committees representation for cmni in congress was not discussed in the covenant between the united states and the commonwealth in 1975 in 1986 report to the reagan administration from group known as the commission on federal laws called for granting the northern mariana islands nonvoting representation in the house though action was taken on this recommendation at that time2 delegate proposals in previous congresses when the united states and the mariana islands agreed to the covenant of association it was thought that the mariana islands lacked sufficient population to warrant congressional delegate since then as the population has grown members of the house have debated whether to create new position of nonvoting delegate for the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands bills to authorize the creation of such post have been introduced regularly in the house since 1994 but such measures usually have not been acted upon prior to the 108th congress the most recent committee action occurred in 1996 when the house resources committee reported hr 4067 104th congress second session introduced by representative elton gallegly the bill provided for the election of delegate from the northern mariana islands for the congressional term beginning in 1999 106th congress the committee approved hr 4067 by voice vote on september 18 1996 four members representatives wes cooley helen chenoweth jack metcalf and joel hefley however later asked that the committees report reflect their opposition 2

representative george miller filed formal written dissent the measure was reported to the house on september 27 1996 further action occurred the resources committee report noted that nmi is the last and only us territory with permanent population that has voice in congress the report continued the small population of nmi was cited by the marianas political status commission which negotiated the covenant for the islands as the reason nmi was unable to obtain nonvoting delegate in the covenant despite the backing of the executive branch of the federal government nmi population of 15000 1970 census was considerably less at that time than the populations of guam 86926 and the virgin islands 63200 had been when those territories were granted nonvoting delegates in 1972 two years after approving the covenant without provision for an nmi delegate however congress granted delegate to american samoa with resident population of 27000 most of whom were not us citizens today with us citizen population of 27512 and total population of 59913 nmi is clearly within the threshold of population established by precedents both historical and contemporary3 in opposing the committees recommendation representative miller argued that the resources committee had given little formal consideration to the proposal not even holding hearing or member briefing on hr 4067 before the markup representative miller further charged that there were longstanding labor law abuses in cnmi particularly with regard to working conditions that were unsafe or abusive and wage rates substantially below those found among the states of the united states or in neighboring guam representative miller urged that reform of labor conditions be precondition for authorizing delegate for cnmi this nation has long history of requiring those who wish representation to change behavior such as polygamy or slavery behaviors which are contrary to the beliefs and ethics of this nation as whole i recognize that some assert that we will have better opportunity to pressure cnmi into accepting the legal changes we seek if it is represented in the congress rather i believe that only by sending clear message of disapproval by denying membership in the house of representatives until sustained and substantive reforms are implemented will this house demonstrate that change within the cnmi is required to meet the standard for equal participation in the congress commensurate with that of other delegates4 delegate proposals in the 108th congress on september 29 2004 the house resources committee reported by voice vote hr 5135 which was introduced by representative richard pombo the bill saw further action in the 108th congress the bill would have established the position of nonvoting delegate from the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and it would have provided for the election of the first such delegate in the 2006 election cycle the bill required in manner that parallels the requirements for service as member of 3 hrept 104856 pp 24 4 hrept 104856 pp 1011 crs4 the house that the delegate from the northern marianas be at least 25 years old citizen of the united states for seven years and resident of the territory additional eligibility requirements stipulated that the delegate also be domicilary of the commonwealth qualified voter in the northern marianas and at the time of his or her election not be candidate for any other elected office the bill saw further action in the 108th congress the committee report specifically addressed concerns about labor abuses which caused member opposition in past congresses the report said congressional influence administrative actions and local changes have resulted in reduced allegations of worker exploitation and human rights violations the committee supports the actions taken by governor juan babauta including labor law enforcement and improved coordination with the federal agencies that oversee the local immigration and labor practices hr 5135 will provide for better means for the cnmi to keep congress abreast of its progress and request further assistance in areas of need to address their unique economic base5 the markup was preceded by february 25 2004 hearing by the house resources committee entitled examination of the potential for delegate from the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands testifying before the committee were the governor of cmni juan n babauta pedro tenorio the elected resident representative of the cmni to the united states joaquin g adriano president of the senate of cmni david b cohen deputy assistant secretary of the interior for insular affairs and mrs ruth g van cleve former director of the office of territories at the interior department mr cohen was accompanied by james j benedetto federal ombudsman office of the ombudsman of the interior department who answered questions from members while making it clear that the administration recognizes that it is the houses prerogative to decide its membership cohen said that the administration continues to support the general concept that the cnmi should be represented by nonvoting delegate to the us house of representatives6 all three elected officials from the cnmi testified in support of the proposal the people of the northern marianas do have fundamental right to have voice in their own government said governor babauta i urge you to introduce delegate legislation and see it successfully through the legislative process7 5 us congress house committee on resources northern mariana

testimony is available online from the continued crs5 the purpose of my testimony today is to respectfully request that congress authorize nonvoting delegate position in congress for the cnmi said tenorio such legislation would extend democratic representation to american citizens in the commonwealth and affirm congress commitment to the democratic principles of our republic8 cohen told the committee he believed the cost of an additional delegate from cnmi would be about 11 million each year or the same as the costs for the delegate from guam those funds would come from the legislative branch appropriation representative george miller discussed the concerns he had in 1996 and then said that he believed from the testimony delivered at the hearing that majority of these changes have been made miller said he continues to have serious concerns about the proposal to grant cnmi delegate but felt it is worth continuing the discussion legislatively house measures proposing to establish the office of territorial delegate are referred to the committee on resources the successor to the earlier committee on territories and committee on insular affairs that considered bills concerning delegates in the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries the only modern exception to this referral practice was the bill to establish the office of delegate from the district of columbia this measure was reported from the former committee on the district of columbia the duties of which are now performed by the government reform committee delegate proposals in the 109th congress on february 17 2005 representative pombo again introduced legislation to provide nonvoting delegate for the northern mariana islands hr 873 the bill was ordered reported by the house resources committee on may 18 2005 by unanimous consent on june 8 2005 the committee filed written report on the bill hrept 109110 addressing one concern that the population of the island was not sufficient to merit nonvoting delegate to the house that report found that with us citizen population of 35000 and total population of 69221 according to the 2000 census the cnmi is clearly within the threshold of population established by precedents both historic and contemporary9 further action in the house could take place later during the 109th congress action by the senate would be required for the bill to become law and for the northern marianas islands to receive nonvoting delegate 7 continued committee website httpresourcescommitteehousegovarchives108full02_25_04htm visited june 13 2005 8 testimony of pedro

columbia voting rights on the floor of the house and if so how it should be done house government reform chair tom davis introduced legislation hr 538810 that would grant dc fullfledged member of the house of representatives one who would be able to vote on the house floor the bill also would create new house seat for another state most likely utah which narrowly missed gaining such position following the 2000 census davis introduced similar legislation in the 108th congress11 under daviss plan the district of columbia would be considered congressional district for the purpose of electing member to the house that member would have the same rights as other members including the right to vote on the house floor regardless of the population of the district it would be limited to one representative in the house the bill would not provide for representation for the district in the senate also an additional house member would be added to the state delegation most qualified by population for an additional representative that additional representative would be elected by statewide ballot until the next reapportionment the bill calls for the number of members in the house to increase permanently to 437 members the house committee on government reform approved the bill by vote of 294 on may 18 2006 the bill was also referred to the house judiciary committee press reports indicate that the chair of that committee has promised davis that the judiciary committee will consider the bill some members during the markup questioned whether the bill would violate the constitution because it would give voting rights to an individual who did not represent state12 the house the constitution says in article 1 section 2 shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states other members have proposed granting voting rights to dc residents in other ways dc delegate eleanor holmes norton has also introduced legislation hr 398 that would provide full voting representation to the citizens of the district by 10 davis also introduced similar bill earlier in the 109th congress hr 2043 that bill had the same intent as hr 5388 though its provisions are slightly different the biggest differences is that hr 5388 calls for permanent increase in the size of the house to 437 from 435 the earlier bill hr 2043 would have allowed the size of the house to increase by two members only until the next census after which the size of the house would revert to 435 voting members 11 jennifer yachnin house trio to offer dc voting rights bills

and for president separate electoral votes for the district of columbia would be ended and the post of district of columbia delegate would be abolished representative rohrabacher had introduced similar legislation in the 108th congress action in the 108th congress on june 23 2004 the government reform and oversight committee held hearing on chairman davis proposal the committee heard testimony from representatives dana rohrabacher and ralph regula who also had introduced legislation to provide some form of voting representation to residents of the district of columbia dc mayor anthony williams and several others also testified also in the 108th congress representative regula introduced legislation hr 381 that would have returned most of the territory now associated with the current district of columbia to maryland13 and transformed the dc delegate into house member from maryland but his bill would not have authorized another seat for utah the bill would have carved out section of the district called the national capital service area over which congress would have retained legislative control the davis rohrabacher and regula bills were all referred to the house judiciary committee and the house government reform committee under house rule x the government reform committee has jurisdiction over issues relating to the district of columbia while the judiciary committee has jurisdiction over measures relating to the elections of members to the house of representatives and to the apportionment process none of the measures saw action in the 108th congress

that version did not include the territories in its language the senate took action on that bill 13 in the 1830s portion of the district of columbia formerly part of virginia was retroceded to it crs8 evolution of territorial delegates northwest ordinance the office of delegate sometimes called nonvoting delegate dates to the late 1700s when territories bound for statehood were granted congressional representation the northwest ordinance of 1787 which was enacted under the articles of confederation in order to establish government for the territory northwest of the ohio river provided for territorial delegate14 earlier the ordinance of 1784 had made provision for territorial representation in congress but it had never been put into effect15 following ratification of the us constitution the first congress reenacted the northwest ordinance16 the ordinance specified that the government of the northwest territory would initially consist of governor and other officials appointed by congress according to section 9 once the free adult male population in the district17 reached 5000 qualified voters would be able to elect representatives from their counties or townships to house of representatives18 this elected house together with an appointed legislative council would elect delegate to congress as stated in section 12 of the northwest ordinance as soon as legislature shall be formed in the district the council and house assembled in one room shall have authority by joint ballot to elect delegate to congress who shall have seat in congress with right of debating but not of voting during this temporary government19 the delegates duties privileges and obligations were otherwise left unspecified first delegate in 1790 congress extended all the privileges authorized in the northwest ordinance to the inhabitants of the territory south of the ohio river and provided that 14 the northwest ordinance an annotated text in robert m taylor jr ed the

exercised in the territory northwest of the ohio20 four years later the territory south of the river ohio sent the first territorial delegate to congress on november 11 1794 james white presented his application to the house of representatives for seating in the third congress21 house committee reported mr whites application favorably and submitted resolution to admit him touching off wideranging discussion about the delegates proper role22 an immediate question arose should the delegate serve in the house or in the senate the northwest ordinance which had been enacted by the unicameral congress under the articles of confederation had only specified seat in congress some members of congress argued that the proper place for delegate white was the senate since his method of election by the territorial legislature was similar to that of senators others suggested that perhaps mr white should sit in both chambers proposals for seeking senate concurrence in the matter of admitting delegate white and for confining his right of debate to territorial matters were dismissed on november 18 1794 the house approved the resolution to admit delegate white to nonvoting seat in that body23 at least one delegate has served in every congress since with the single exception of the fifth congress 17971799 debate surrounding delegate whites taking the oath further revealed house members various perceptions of his status some members believed that mr white should be required to take the oath representative james madison disagreed he argued the proper definition of mr white is to be found in the laws and rules of the constitution he is not member of congress therefore and so cannot be directed to take an oath unless he chooses to do it voluntarily24 describing delegate white as more than an envoy to congress representative william smith maintained that it would be very improper to call on this gentlemen to take such an oath he characterized mr white as not representative from but an officer deputed by the people of the western territory in making the case that it would be wrong to accept his oath representative jonathan dayton emphasized mr whites lack of voting power he is not member he cannot vote which is the essential part representative dayton compared delegate whites influence in the house to that of printer who may be 20 act of may 26 1790 ch

notes and prints them in the newspapers25 ultimately the house decided that since mr white was not member he was not required to take the oath26 at the same time congress by law granted mr white the same franking privileges and compensation as members of the house27 the white case established several precedents for the treatment of future delegates in 1802 congress passed legislation that extended the franking privilege to and provided for the compensation of any person admitted or who may hereafter be admitted to take seat in congress as delegate28 like mr white all future delegates would sit in the house this practice was written into law in 1817 the law stated in part such delegate shall be elected every second year for the same term of two years for which members of the house of representatives of the united states are elected and in that house each of the said delegates shall have seat with right of debating but not of voting29 subsequent statutes authorizing delegates specified service in the house the decision not to administer the oath to delegate white however did not become precedential all future delegates beginning with the second would take the oath unincorporated territories after the us acquisition of overseas territories following the spanish american war the supreme court put forth new concept of territorial status in series of cases known as the insular cases 19011922 the court distinguished between incorporated and unincorporated territories incorporated territories were considered integral parts of the united states to which all relevant provisions of the us constitution applied they were understood to be bound for eventual statehood the newly acquired territories were considered unincorporated however and as such only the fundamental parts of the constitution applied of their own force the political status of unincorporated territories the court said was matter for congress to determine by legislation30 congress did grant representation to two of the territories acquired from spain puerto rico and the philippines it did so however in way that distinguished their situation from that of statehoodbound territories

rico31 and the philippines32 who were to be entitled to official recognition as such by all departments according to abraham holtzman reference to congress or the house of representatives was made in the authorizing statutes apparently it was congresss intent that the mandate of these representatives be broader than service in the us legislaturethis suggests role for resident commissioners more akin to that of foreign diplomat than that of legislator nevertheless the representatives from these two territories did serve in the house 33 the resident commissioners from puerto rico and the philippines did not enjoy the same privileges as the nonvoting delegates initially they were not even allowed on the house floor in 1902 and 1908 respectively the house of representatives granted them the right to the floor34 in 1904 the puerto rican resident commissioner was given the same powers and privileges as to committee service and in the house as are possessed by delegates and was deemed competent to serve on the committee on insular affairs as an additional member35 the resident commissioners from the philippines however were never permitted to serve on standing committees the posts of resident commissioners differed from those of delegates in other significant ways initially the philippines owing to its substantially larger population and dispersed land mass was authorized two resident commissioners who served for threeyear terms it was not until the tydingsmcduffie act of 1934 setting timetable leading to the ultimate independence of the philippines that the second resident commissioner position was abolished the resident commissioner from puerto rico was initially chosen for twoyear term but congress at the initiative of the puerto rican government later extended it to four years36 the delegates ranks continued to grow with the authorization of congressional representation for the territories of guam and the virgin islands in 197237 and through further amendment of house rule xii each delegate to the house was given the same committee assignment rights and committee powers and privileges 31 act of apr 12 1900 ch 191 31 stat 77 86 32 act of

shall be entitled to whatever privileges and immunities that are or hereinafter may be granted to the nonvoting delegate from the territory of guam39 delegates rights and responsibilities since the first delegate was sent to congress the house has struggled with the role delegates should play in the house some members noting that the constitution in article i section 2 requires that the house be made up of people chosen every second year by the people of the several states have expressed concerns that allowing delegates to have the same rights and responsibilities as members would be unconstitutional because delegates by definition do not represent states members have on several occasions debated what rights they should exercise in the house evidence of this debate is the variation in the role delegates have played in committees for significant periods delegates were not appointed to standing committees and could not vote during committee consideration of measures or matters even on committees where they were permitted to serve which committees delegates could serve on and their rights on those committee became themes in congress over the last 200 years currently delegates enjoy powers rights and responsibilities identical in most respects to those of house members from the states delegates can speak and introduce bills and resolutions on the floor of the house and can speak and vote in house committees delegates are not however fullfledged members of the house they cannot vote on the house floor whether the house is operating as the house or as the committee of the whole house on the state of the union parliamentary device used by the house to expedite the consideration of legislation in addition delegates cannot offer motion to reconsider vote and are not counted for quorum purposes committee assignments and voting the house began to define the functions of delegates when on january 13 1795 it appointed mr white member of select committee to investigate better means of promulgating the laws of the united states40 during several subsequent congresses the house continued the practice of allowing delegates to serve on select committees william henry harrison the second delegate of the northwest territory served on number of select committees some of which he had moved to create that addressed issues such 38 congressional record vol

disputes with the senate43 the first regular assignment of delegates to standing committee duty occurred under house rule adopted in december 1871 the rule directed the speaker of the house to appoint delegate as an additional member of the committee on the territories and to appoint the dc delegate as an additional member of the committee for the district of columbia44 additional committee

territorial officers of the territorial legislature and of his constituency selfconstituted dispenser of patronage he interceded at times in almost every process of control over the territories and generally one challenged his right to intercede46 along with the right to belong to standing committee the house also debated what rights delegates once on the committees could exercise historians differ on whether delegates were allowed to vote in committees prior to the early 1970s one account states that as additional members of standing committees from 1871 through 1971 delegates did not have the right to vote in committee47 some evidence suggests that delegates were allowed to vote in committee in and around 1841 according to september 3 1841 report of the committee of elections 41

enjoys every other privilege and exercises every other right of representative he can act as member of standing or special committee and vote on the business before said committees and he may thus exercise an important influence on those initiatory proceedings by which business is prepared for the action of the house he is also required to take an oath to support the constitution of the united states48 even if the delegates at one point had that right they had lost it by the late 1880s on february 23 1884 proposition was made in the house that delegates be allowed to vote in committee the proposition was referred to the committee on rules but action was taken49 the right of delegates to vote in committee resurfaced as an issue in the 1930s after lengthy investigation house committee reported that neither the constitution nor any statutes supported such committee vote although house rule provided for the appointment of territorial delegates as additional members on certain committees the report noted the house could not elect to one of its standing committees person not member of the house according to the report the designation additional member applied to delegate clearly indicates the character of the assignment expressly the delegate shall exercise in the committee the same powers and privileges as in the house to wit the right of debating but not the right of voting50 in the 1970s the system of territorial representation in congress underwent significant change as more territories were granted delegates and as delegates were given increased powers51 for 11 years following the admission of hawaii to the union in 1959 the resident commissioner from puerto rico had been the only territorial representative in congress then in 1970 the district of columbia was 48 us congress house committee on elections david levy 27th cong 1st sess hrept 10 sept 3 1841 p 5 quoted in asher c hinds hinds precedents of the house of representatives of the united

according to abraham holtzman they did not as standing committees began to emerge in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries however the house adopted practice of excluding territorial representatives from these important centers of decision making holtzman empire and representation the us congress p 257 similarly jo tice bloom writes during the early period 17941820 delegates were never barred from serving on standing committees by any action of the house they probably did not serve on these committees for the simple reason that delegate was never appointed and therefore the tradition never began bloom early delegates in the house of representatives p 67 nevertheless the court in michel v anderson 817 fsupp 123 note 22 was persuaded that delegates had voted in committee

congressional record vol 75 jan 18 1932 pp 21632164 51 see table 1 crs15 authorized to elect delegate52 that same year congress enacted the legislative reorganization act which contained provision to amend the house rule on delegates rule xii to read the resident commissioner to the united states from puerto rico shall be elected to serve on standing committees in the same manner as members of the house and shall possess in such committees the same powers and privileges as the other members53 the provision was contained in floor amendment offered by puerto ricos resident commissioner jorge cordova my amendment would abolish this privilege service on committee as an additional member it would provide for the election of the resident commissioner to standing committees in the same manner as members of the house are elected this would mean in effect that the resident commissioner may be fortunate to secure election to one of the three committees on which he now serves but my amendment would also provide that the resident commissioner have the same rights in committee as other members which means of course that he would have the right to vote within the committee representative thomas s foley supported the amendment claiming that the grant of voting rights in committee to delegates was within the power of the house the committees of the house of representatives are creatures of the house of representatives they can be extinguished at will and created at will it does not even require concurrence of the other body when we take such an action depriving members of the right to vote in committee is fully within the power of the house by abolishing the committee giving them additional rights to vote is within the power of the house by creating new committee nothing that the resident commissioner could do in committee vote could become final decision unless majority of the elected members of congress supported his position however in the standing committee itself i think that the member from puerto rico should have vote i think the house has the constitutional authority to give him vote in that limited area the amendment was opposed by representative bf sisk the floor manager of the bill and senior member of the house rules committee sisk asked rhetorically whether the cordova amendment would be interpreted so that he would be entitled to vote in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union in response sometime later cordova observed that the amendment which i have offered refers expressly to the standing committees i believe the committee of the whole house is not standing committee the cordova amendment was agreed to by voice vote54 52 pl 91405 sept 22 1970 84 stat 845 848 congress had previously authorized dc delegate act

commissioner from puerto rico as well as to the newly authorized dc delegate55 committee of the whole voting rights during the 103rd congress delegates were allowed to vote in the committee of the whole development that became the focus of intense partisan controversy in january 1993 the democratic majority proposed to amend house rule xii to permit such delegate voting in the event that matter before the committee of the whole was decided by the margin of the delegates votes however another amendment to house rule xxiii provided for an automatic revote in the full house where delegates could not participate56 supporters of the rule xii change portrayed it as logical extension of the delegates right to vote in committee group of republican house members filed lawsuit challenging the amendment to rule xii they argued that the rule change violated article i of the constitution by granting legislative power to delegates who were not members of the house of representatives chosen every second year by the people of the several states57 they took issue with the characterization of the committee of the whole as committee and maintained instead that it was tantamount to the full house in their complaint the plaintiffs stated nonmember voting in the committee of the whole impairs and dilutes the constitutional rights of the plaintiffrepresentatives both as members of the house and as voters who enjoy the right to full fair and proportionate representation in the house of representatives58 they further alleged that the house did not have the authority to unilaterally expand the powers of the delegates the house defendants59 countered that the house of representatives was constitutionally empowered to determine the rules of its proceedings60 they argued that the committee of the whole like other congressional committees was an advisory body and was not subject to article i requirements they rejected the plaintiffs contention that the committee of the whole effectively controlled action 54 continued 116 sept 15 1970 pp 3184831852 55 congressional record vol 117 jan 2122 1971 pp 14 143144 rule xii as amended also stipulated that the dc delegate serve on the committee

provision for an automatic revote in cases in which delegate votes were decisive61 in march 1993 judge harold h greene of the us district court for the district of columbia upheld the changes to the house rules as his opinion made clear however he did so only because of the automatic revote provision if the only action of the house of representatives had been to grant to the delegates from the district of columbia guam virgin islands and american samoa and the resident commissioner from puerto rico the authority to vote in the committee of the whole he wrote its action would have been plainly unconstitutional62 his opinion further stated while the action the house took on january 5 1993 undoubtedly gave the delegates greater stature and prestige both in congress and in their home districts it did not enhance their right to vote on legislationby virtue of rule xxiii they the votes of the delegates are meaningless it follows that the house action had effect on legislative power and that it did not violate article i or any other provision of the constitution63 in january 1994 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit upheld the constitutionality of the house rule changes64 in january 1995 at the start of the 104th congress the house of representatives under republican majority amended rule xii to prohibit delegate voting in the committee of the
