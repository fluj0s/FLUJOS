pension protection act is the most comprehensive reform of the nations pension laws since the enactment of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 it establishes new funding requirements for defined benefit pensions and includes reforms that will affect cash balance pension plans defined contribution plans and deferred compensation plans for executives and highly compensated employees prompted by the default in recent years of several large defined benefit pension plans and the increasing deficit of pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc the bush administration in january 2005 advanced proposal for pension funding reform which was designed to increase the minimum funding requirements for pension plans and strengthen the pension insurance system the administration pointed out several weaknesses of the rules that were then in place sponsors of underfunded plans were not required to make additional contributions called deficit reduction contributions as long as their plans were at least 90 funded because the interest rates used to calculate current pension plan liabilities were averaged over fouryear period and asset values used to calculate minimum funding requirements could be averaged over five years neither plan assets nor liabilities were measured accurately plans that were underfunded were sometimes able to amortize their funding shortfalls over periods as long as 30 years 1 some sponsors of underfunded pensions we re able to avoid making contributions to their plans for several years because they had made contributions beyond the required minimum in the past the use of these socalled credit balances led to greater underfunding of pension plans according to the administrations analysis the pbgc was created by congress in 1974 to insure defined benefit pension plans of private sector employers the possibility that the termination of defined benefit pension plans with large unfunded liabilities might eventually lead to the insolvency of the pbgc lent particular urgency to the effort to mandate improved pension plan funding although the pbgc receives appropriations from congress it is generally acknowledged that if the agency were to become financially insolventthreatening the retirement income of the 44 million americans who have earned benefits under defined benefit pension planscongress would have little choice but to step in and engineer financial bailout of the agency 2 in 2000 the pbgc recorded 97 billion surplus but several years of falling interest rates and declining stock prices and the termination of several large underfunded pension plans led to rapid deterioration in the pbgcs financial position nine of the ten largest pension plan claims for pbgc insurance occurred between 2001 and 2005 see table 1 these nine claims accounted for 63 of the total dollar value of claims made on the pbgc since the agency began operating in 1975 by 2005 the pbgc had funding 1 liabilities arising from plan amendments that increased benefits under the plan could be amortized over 30 years 2 the pbgc receives revenue mainly from the premiums paid to it by companies that sponsor defined benefit pensions and investment returns on the assets in its trust fund

pension plan liabilities extend many years into the future determining whether pension is adequately funded requires converting future stream of pension payments into the amount that would be needed today to pay off those liabilities all at once this amount the present value of the plans liabilities is then compared with the value of the plans assets an underfunded plan is one in which the value of the plans assets falls short of the present value of its liabilities by more than the percentage allowed under law converting future stream of payments or income into present value requires the future payments or income to be discounted using an appropriate interest rate other things being equal the higher the interest rate the smaller the present value of the future payments or income and vice versa beginning in 2008 the ppa introduces new funding requirements for singleemployer defined benefit pension plans the law establishes new rules for calculating plan assets and liabilities and it eliminates deficitreduction contributions for underfunded plans when it is fully phased in the law will require plan funding to be equal to 100 of the plans liabilities any unfunded liability will have to be amortized over seven years sponsors of severely underfunded plans that are at risk of defaulting on their obligations will be required to fund their plans according to special rules that will result in higher employer contributions to the plan plan sponsors will continue to be allowed to use credit balances to offset required contributions but only if the plan is funded at 80 or more the value of credit balances will have to be adjusted to reflect changes in the market value of plan assets since the date the contributions that created the credit balances were made under the ppa plan sponsors minimum required contribution will be based on the plans target normal cost and the difference between the plans funding target and the value of the plans assets the plans target normal cost is the present value of all benefits that plan participants will accrue during the year the funding target is the present value of all benefits including early retirement benefits already accrued by plan participants as of the beginning of the plan year if plans assets are less than the funding target the plan has an unfunded liability this liability less any permissible credit balances must be amortized in annual installments over seven years the plan sponsors minimum required annual contribution is the plans target normal cost for the plan year but not less than zero the 100 funding target will be phased in at 92 in 2008 94 in 2009 96 in 2010 and 100 in 2011 and later years the phasein will not apply to plans that are already underfunded to the extent that they are subject to the deficit reduction contribution rules in 2007 those plans will have 100 funding target beginning in 2008 federal law prescribes the interest rate that pension plans must use to calculate the present value of plan liabilities the ppa requires plans to discount future liabilities using three different interest rates depending on the length of time until the liabilities must be paid the interest rates correspond to the length of time until the obligations are due to be paid shortterm interest rate will be used to calculate the present value of liabilities that will come due within five years midterm interest rate will be used for liabilities that will come due in 5 to 15 years and long term interest rate will be applied to liabilities that will come due in more than 15 years the secretary of the treasury will determine these rates which will be derived from yield curve

sponsors required contribution to the plan pension plans that are determined to be at risk of defaulting on their liabilities will be required to use specific actuarial assumptions in determining plan liabilities that will increase the plan sponsors required contributions to the plan plan will be deemed atrisk if it is unable to pass either of two tests under the first test plan is deemed to be atrisk if it is less than 70 funded under the worstcase scenario assumptions that 1 the employer is not permitted to use credit balances to reduce its cash contribution and 2 employees will retire at the earliest possible date and will choose to take the most expensive form of benefit if plan does not pass this test it will be deemed to be atrisk unless it is at least 80 funded under standard actuarial assumptions this latter test will be phased in over four years with the minimum funding requirement starting at 65 in 2008 and rising to 70 in 2009 75 in 2010 and 80 in 2011 if plan passes either of these two tests it will not be deemed to be atrisk however it will still be required to make up its funding shortfall over more than seven years plans that have been in atrisk status for at least two of the last four years also will be subject to an additional loading factor of 4 of the plans liabilities plus 700 per participant which will be added to the plan sponsors required contribution to the plan plan years prior to 2008 will not count for this determination plans with 500 or fewer participants in the preceding year would be exempt from the atrisk funding requirements

claim benefits and the average length of time that participants and their surviving beneficiaries will receive pension payments under the ppa the secretary of the treasury will prescribe the mortality tables to be used for these estimates large plans may petition the irs to use planspecific mortality table

can differ from the current market value of those assets for example in an actuarial valuation the plans investment returns could be smoothed averaged over fiveyear period and the average asset value could range from 80 to 120 of the fair market value averaging asset values over period of years is permitted because pension plans are considered longterm commitments and averaging reduces volatility in the measurement of plan assets that 3 yield curve is graph that shows interest rates on bonds plotted against the maturity date of the bond normally longterm bonds have higher yields than shortterm bonds b ecause both credit risk and inflation risk rise as the maturity dates extend further into the future consequently the yield curve usually slopes upward from left to right 4 the ppa extends the interest rates permissible under pl 108218 through 2007 for purposes of the current liability calculation

interest rates and the rate of return on investments averaging asset values therefore reduces the yeartoyear volatility in the plan sponsors required minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plan the ppa narrows the range for actuarial valuations to less than 90 and more than 110 of fair market value and it reduces the maximum smoothing period to two years plans with more than 100 participants will be required to use the first day of the plan year as the basis for calculations of plan assets and liabilities plans with 100 or fewer participants can choose another date

covered under employersponsored retirement plans that are separate from those that cover rankandfile employees because the benefits under these plans often exceed the limits prescribed by erisa they do not qualify for the favorable tax treatment that most pensions covering rankandfile employees are qualified to receive thus these deferred compensation plans for executives are commonly referred to as nonqualified plans provided that they meet certain requirements under the internal revenue code irc nonqualified plans are sometimes permitted to set aside funds to prefund deferred compensation

participants the option to receive their accrued benefits in the form of an annuitya series of monthly payments guaranteed for life many defined benefit plans also offer participants the option to take their accrued benefits as single lump sum at the time they separate from the employer the amount of lumpsum distribution from defined benefit pension is inversely related to the interest used to calculate the present value of the benefit that has been accrued under the plan the higher the interest rate the smaller the lump sum and vice versa under prior law lumpsum distributions were calculated using the average interest rate on 30year treasury bonds the ppa replaces the 30year treasury bond interest rate as the interest rate for calculating lumpsum distributions from defined benefit plans 7 beginning in 2008 plan sponsors must calculate lumpsum distributions using threesegment interest rate yield curve derived from the rates of return on investmentgrade corporate bonds of varying maturities plan participants of different ages will have their lumpsum distributions calculated using different interest rates other things being equal lumpsum distribution paid to worker who is near the plans normal retirement age will be calculated using lower interest rate than will be used for younger worker as result all else being equal an older worker will receive larger lump sum than similarly situated younger worker the interest rates used to calculate lump sums will be based on current bond rates rather than the threeyear weighted average rate used to calculate the plans funding target the new rules for calculating lump sums will be phased in over five years plans funded at less than 60 will be prohibited from paying lumpsum distributions plans funded at 60 to 80 can pay more than half of an accrued benefit as lumpsum distribution the ppa also establishes new interest rate fl oor for testing whether lump sum paid from defined benefit plan complies with the limitations under irc 415b in general irc 415b limits the annual singlelife annuity payable from defined benefit plan to the lesser of 100 of average compensation or 175000 in 2006 benefits paid as lump sum or other optional form must be converted to an equivalent annuity value for purposes of applying this limit the ppa requires plans making this calculation to use an interest rate that is lower than the highest of 1 55 2 the rate that results in benefit of more than 105 of the benefit that would be provided if the interest rate required for determining lumpsum distribution were used or

will be assessed on all underfunded plans regardless of the plans funding status in earlier years for employers with 25 or fewer employees the variable premium is capped at 5 the variablerate premium must be computed using threesegment yield curve beginning in 2008 the ppa makes permanent surcharge premium for certain distress terminations which was added by the deficit reduction act of 2005 and
