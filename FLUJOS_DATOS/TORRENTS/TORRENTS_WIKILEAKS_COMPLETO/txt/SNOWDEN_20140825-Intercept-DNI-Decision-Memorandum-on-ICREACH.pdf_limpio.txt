secretnofornmr memorandum for the director of national intelligence subject ufouo sharing communications metadata across the intelligence community decision memorandum purpose ufouo to request the director national intelligence establish us intelligence communitywide communications metadata sharing structure to recommend that the national security agency establish this structure along with appropriate query tools training and oversight and that director nsa be designated the ic executive agent for icwide communications metadata background snf post 911 the ic has increased its needs for communications metadata1 currently nsa collects processes and stores vast amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide intelligence targets this sigint information often includes the originator and recipients identifiers as well as the date time and duration of the transaction and in some cases locations of targets snf cia fbi dia and dea also have access to communications transaction data from their unique sources these organizations to include nsa have benefited from sharing this data through the crisscrossproton program since 1999 presently nsa pushes roughly 60 million records per day limited to telephony only to proton resulting in over 30 of the total proton data set snf while the proton program has had many notable successes over the years todays environment requires that the ic implement more holistic information sharing and collaboration in order to ensure the efficient and effective sharing of many millions of new minimized communications metadata records daily the ic must have new sharingcollaboration structure that is scaleable to the larger ic and is capable of much greater volume of data snf nsa stands alone in conducting metadata analysis on large scale and as result our tools and methodologies as well as the infrastructure employed are well tested and have been proven efficient and effective over time we already extensively 1 c communications metadata refers to structured data about data it includes all information associated with but not including content and includes any data used by network service or application to facilitate routing or handling of communication or to render content in the intended format it includes but is not limited to dialing routing addressing or signaling information and data in support of various network management activities eg billing authentication or tracking of communicants derived from nsacssm 152 dated 20041123 declassify on 20290325 secre tnofornmr secre tnofornmr share metadata internally within the nsacss extended enterprise and with our second party partners snf under this proposal ic partners would have access through nsas globalreach the ic version will be called icreach service to more than 50 existing nsacss metadata fields contained in trillions of records as well as other ic agency communications metadata predominantly resident today in proton nsas throughput to icreach would dwaif the volume of nsas present contributions to proton as well as the input of all other ic contributors those fields revealing sources and methods or sensitive foreign relationships within metadata records would not be shared moreover nsa is preparing to include dni digital network intelligence data in globalreachicreach change that would also exponentially increase nsas contributions to the ics communications metadata structure discussion snf nsa proposes that the dni establish new icwide communications metadata structure with requisite tools training and intelligence oversight this structure will consist of data repositories at various ic agencies all interlinked through web based analytic query structure via jwics whereby ic personnel can make one query to access all sharable communications metadata this structure will also allow ic personnel to choose the data they wish to query and the set of tools they desire to display and analyze the data snf this structure will allow unprecedented volumes of communications metadata to be shared and analyzed this structure will use the intelligence community shared information space icsis carved out in intelink and protected by community pki access authorization having such structure will provide the ic with access to nsacss and other icelement metadata as well as the internal federated query that nsa analysts use to correlate these information elements and enrich the results with knowledge from our analytic reference files and other collaboration this proposal will address existing icwide stated needs for additional nsa communications metadata elements and take the ic to an unprecedented level of information sharing snf this initiative is in keeping with the 911 and presidents wmd commissions recommendations on information sharing the presidents various executive orders related to information sharing and your own announced goals on information sharing and collaboration s this initiative was intended to facilitate new level of sharing information across the ic for situational awareness lead information adversary analysis and targeting and will add to the process of greater information sharing across the ic recommendation snf i believe the time is right to designate an ic executive agency for sharing communications metadata as an integral part of greater ic sharing environment sigint metadata is vast rich source of information to build community collaboration and target knowledge and the emerging intelligence based target social network analysis discipline nsa is prepared to accept this role and build the communications metadata coalition the ic needs for both current target tracking and future threat warning snf to this end my staffs have been meeting with cia dia fbi and dea metadata users and technical experts to work out the details of this proposal once secre tnofornmr secretnofornmr approved we will be ready to implement this structure with roll out to these agencies within few months followed by the greater ic within year dni decision ufouo establish an icwide communications metadata structure concur nonconcur other ufouo designate
