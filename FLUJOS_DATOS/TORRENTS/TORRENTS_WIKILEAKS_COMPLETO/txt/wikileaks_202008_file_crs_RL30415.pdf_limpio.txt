least thirtyone states have enacted laws banning the socalled partialbirth abortion procedure although many of these laws have not taken effect because of permanent injunctions they remain contentious to both prolife advocates and those who support womans right to choose1 the concern over partialbirth abortion has been shared by congress congress passed bans on the partialbirth abortion procedure in both the 104th and 105th congresses2 unable to overcome presidential vetoes durin g both congressional terms the partialbirth abortion ban act was reintroduced in each successive congress until its enactment in 2003 s 3 the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 was passed by congress in october 2003 the measure was signed by the president on november 5 2003 the us supreme court has also addressed the performance of partialbirth abortions in stenberg v carhart 2000 case the court invalidated nebraska statute that prohibited the performance of such abortions prior to this decision the us courts of appeals remained divided on the legitimacy of state statutes banning partialbirth abortions3 in gonzales v carhart 2007 case the court upheld the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 finding that as facial matter it is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy 4 this report discusses the courts decisions and the partialbirth abortion measures in the 106th 107th and 108th congresses g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the supreme court has held that woman has constitutional right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy5 although state cannot prohibit woman from having an abortion it can promote its interest in potential human life by regulating and even proscribing abortion after fetal viability so long as it allows an exception for abortions that are necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother6 in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey the court expanded states authority to regulate abortion by permitting regulation at the previability stage so long as such regulation does not place an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion7

procedure where the fetus is removed intact from womans body the procedure is described by the medical community as intact dilation and evacuation or dilation and extraction d x depending on the presentation of the fetus8 intact dilation and evacuation involves vertex or head first presentation the induced dilation of the cervix th collapsing of the skull and the extraction of the entire fetus through the cervix9 d x involves breech or feet first presentation the induced dilation of the cervix the removal of the fetal body through the cervix the collapsing of the skull and the extraction of the fetus through the cervix10 this report uses the term d x to encompass both procedures d x is one of several abortion methods the principal methods of abortion are suction curettage induction and standard dilation and evacuation d e11 the decision to perform one abortion method over another usually depends on the gestational age of the fetus during the first trimester the most common method of abortion is suction curettage12 suction curettage involves the evacuation of the uterine cavity by suction the embryo or fetus is separated from the placenta either by scraping or vacuum pressure before being removed by suction induction may be performed either early in the pregnancy or in the second trimester in this procedure the fetus is forced from the uterus by inducing preterm labor d is the most common method of abortion in the second trimester13 suction curettage is longer viable because the fetus is too large in the second trimester to remove by suction alone d involves the dilation of the cervix and the dismemberment of the fetus inside the uterus fetal parts are later removed from the uterus either with forceps or by suction d x is typically performed late in the seco nd trimester between the twentieth and twenty fourth weeks of pregnancy although the medical advantages of d x have been asserted the nature of the procedure has prompted prolife advocates to characterize d x as something akin to infanticide 14 in women s medical professional corporation v voinovich the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit discussed the differences between the d and d x procedures in reference to an ohio act that banned partialbirth abortions the primary distinction between the two procedur is that the d procedure results in dismembered fetus while the d x procedure results in relatively intact fetus more specifically the d procedure involves dismembering the fetus in utero before compressing the skull by means of suction while the d x procedure involves removing intact all but the head of the fetus from the uterus and then compressing the skull by means of suction in both procedures the fetal head must be compressed because it is usually too large to pass through womans dilated cervix in the d procedure this is typically 8 see stenberg v carhart 530 us 914 927 2000 9 id 10 id 11 see hope clinic 195 f3d at 861 12 see voinovich 130 f3d at

crushing the skull while in the d x procedure it is always accomplished by suctioning the intracranial matter15 the procedural similarities between the d and d x procedures have contributed to the concern that the language of partialbirth abor tion bans may prohibit both methods of abortion plaintiffs challenging partialbirth abortion statutes have generally sought the invalidation of such statutes on the basis of two arguments first that the statutes are unconstitutionally vague and second that the statutes are unconstitutional because they impose an undue burden on womans ability to obtain an abortion the supreme court has held that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined16 vague laws are found unconstitutional because they fail to give people of ordinary intelligence reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and thus allow them to act lawfully17 moreover the inability to provide explicit standards is feared to result in the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of statute the undue burden standard was adopted by the court in casey in that case the court held that state could enact abortion regulations at the previability stage so long as an undue burden is not placed on womans ability to have an abortion any regulation which has the purpose or effect of placing substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion creates an undue burden and is invalid 18 the sixth circuit was the first to consider whether ban on partialbirth abortions imposes an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion in voinovich the court found that an ohio statute that attempted to ban the d x procedure was unconstitutional under casey the court determined that the language of the statute targeted the d x procedure but encompassed the d procedure because the d proc edure is the most common method of second trimester abortions the court contended that the statute created an undue burden on women seeking abortions at this point in their pregnancies g21g157g142g151g139g142g155g144g561g159g495g561g5g138g155g145g138g155g157g561 in stenberg v carhart nebraska physician who performed abortions at specialized abortion facility sought declaration that nebraskas partialbirth abortion ban statute violated the us constitution19 the nebraska statute provided partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including lifeendangering physical

abortion procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery21 the term partially delivers vaginally living unborn child before killing the unborn child was further defined as deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina living unborn child or substantial portion thereof for the purpose of performing procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child 22 violation of the statute carried prison term of up to twenty years and fine of up to 25000 in addition doctor who violated the statute was subject to the automatic revocation of his license to practice medicine in nebraska among his arguments dr carhart maintained that the meaning of the term substantial portion in the nebraska statute was unclear and thus could include the common d procedure in its ban of partialbirth abortions because the nebraska legislature failed to provide definition for substantial portion the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit interpreted the nebraska statute to proscribe both the d x and d procedures if substantial portion means an arm or leg and surely it must then the ban encompasses both the d and the d x procedures23 the eighth circuit acknowledged that during the d procedure the physician often inserts his forceps into the uterus grasps part of the living fetus and pulls that part of the fetus into the vagina because the arm or leg is the most common part to be retrieved the physician would violate the statute 24 the state argued that the statutes scienter or knowledge requirement limited its scope and made it applicable only to the d x procedure according to the state the statute applied only to the deliberate and intentional performance of partial birth abortion that is the partial delivery of living fetus vaginally the killing of the fetus and the completion of the delivery 25 however the eighth circuit found that the d procedure involves all of the same steps the physician intentionally brings substantial part of the fetus into the vagina dismembers the fetus leading to fetal demise and completes the delivery physician need not set out with the intent to perform d x procedure in order to violate the statute26 the supreme court affirmed the eighth circuits decision by 54 margin the court based its decision on two determinations first the court concluded that the nebraska statute lacked any exception for the preservation of the health of the mother second the court found that the statute imposed an undue burden on the right to choose abortion because its language covered more than the d x procedure despite the courts previous instructions in roe and casey that abortion regulation must include an exception where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother the state argued that nebraskas partialbirth abortion statute did not require health exception because safe alternatives remained available to women and ban on 21 neb rev stat 283269 22 id 23 carhart 192 f3d at 1150 24 id

although the court conceded that the actual need for the d x procedure was uncertain it recognized that the procedure could be safer in certain circumstances28 thus the court stated statute that altogether forbids d x creates significant health risk the statute consequently must contain health exception29 in its discussion of the undue burden that would be imposed if the nebraska statute was upheld the court maintained that the plain language of the statute covered both the d x and d procedures30 although the nebraska state attorney general offered an interpretation of the statute that differentiated between the two procedures the court was reluctant to recognize such view because the court traditionally follows lower federal court interpretations of state law and because the attorney generals interpretative views would not bind state courts the court held that the statutes reference to the delivery of living unborn child or substantial portion thereof implicated both the d x and d procedures 31 because the stenberg court was divided by only one member justice oconnors concurrence raised concern among those who support womans right to choose justice oconnors concurrence indicated that state statute prohibiting partialbirth abortions would likely withstand constitutional challenge if it included an exception for situations where the health of the mother is at issue and if it was narrowly tailored to proscribing the d x procedure alone 32 justice oconnor identified kansas utah and montana as having partialbirth abortion statutes that differentiate appropriately between d x and the other procedures33

to exceed two years for any physician who knowingly performed partialbirth abortion partialbirth abortion was defined as an abortion in which person deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living fetus until the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the fetus and actually performs the overt act that kills the fetus34 in addition to criminal penalties s 1692 and hr 3660 provided private right of action for the father if married to the mother at the time she receives partialbirth abortion procedure and if the mother has not attained the age of 18 years at the time of the abortion the maternal grandparents of the fetus unless the pregnancy resulted from the plaintiffs criminal conduct or the plaintiff consented to the abortion35 when president clinton vetoed similar partialbirth abortion bill hr 1122 during the 105th congress he focused on the bills failure to include an exception to the ban that would permit partialbirth abortions to protect the lives and health of the small group of women in tragic circumstances who need an abortion performed at late stage of pregnancy to avert death or serious injury36 while s 1692 and hr 3660 would have allowed partialbirth abortion to be performed when it was necessary to save the life of the mother such an abortion would not have been available when it was simply medically preferable to another procedure g343g342g349g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 hr 4965 the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2002 was introduced by representative steve chabot on june 19 2002 the bill was passed by the house on july 24 2002 by vote of 274 151 the measure was not considered by the senate hr 4965 would have prohibited physicians from performing partialbirth abortion except when it was necessary to save the life of mother whose life was endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including lifeendangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself the bill defined the term partialbirth abortion to mean an abortion in which the person performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally vaginally deliv ers living fetus until in the case of head first presentation the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother or in the case of breech presentation any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus 37 physicians who violated the act would have been subject to fine imprisonment for not more than two years or both although hr 4965 did not provide an exception for the performance of partialbirth abortion when the health of the mother was at issue supporters of the measure maintained that the bill was constitutional they contended that congressional hearings and fact finding revealed that partialbirth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of woman and that such an abortion poses serious risks to womans health 34 s 1692 106th cong 1999 hr 3660

partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 was signed by the president on november 5 2003 pl 108105 the house approved hrept 108288 the conference report for the measure on october 2 2003 by vote of 281142 the senate agreed to the conference report on october 21 2003 by vote of 6434 in general the act resembles the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2002 in language and form the act prohibits physicians from performing partialbirth abortion except when it is necessary to save the life of mother whose life is endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including lifeendangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself physicians who violate the act are subject to fine imprisonment for not more than two years or both although the supreme court previously held that restrictions on abortion must allow for the performance of an abortion when it is necessary to protect the health of the mother the act does not include such an exception in his introductory statement for the act then senator rick santorum discussed the acts lack of health exception38 he maintained that an exception is not necessary because of the risks associated with partialbirth abortions senator santorum insisted that congressional hearings and expert testimony demonstrate that partial birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of the mother poses significant health risks to the woman and is outside the standard of medical care 39 g9g152g151g163g138g149g142g156g561g159g495g561g5g138g155g145g138g155g157g561 within two days of the acts signing federal courts in nebraska california and new york blocked its enforcement40 on april 18 2007 the court upheld the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 finding that as facial matter it is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy 41 in gonzales v carhart the court distinguished the federal statute from the nebraska law at issue in stenberg 42 according to the court the federal statute is not unconstitutiona lly vague because it provides doctors with reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited43 unlike the nebraska law which prohibited the delivery of substantial portion of the fetus the federal statute includes anatomical landmarks that identify when an abortion procedure will be subject to the acts prohibitions the court noted if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of living fetus to one of these anatomical landmarkswhere depending on the presentation either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the motherthe prohibitions of the act do not apply 44 38 149 cong rec s2523 daily ed february 14 2003 statement of sen santorum 39 149 cong rec at

knowledge requirement in the federal statute alleviates any vagueness concerns because the act applies only when doctor deliberately and intentionally delivers the fetus to an anatomical landmark the court concluded that doctor performing the d procedure would not face criminal liability if fetus is delivered beyond the prohibited points by mistake45 the court observed the scienter requirements narrow the scope of the acts prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion46 in reaching its conclusion that the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy the court considered whether the federal statute is overbroad prohibiting both the d x and d procedures the court also considered the statutes lack of health exception relying on the plain language of the act the court determined that the federal statute could not be interpreted to encompass the d procedure the court maintained that the d procedure involves the removal of the fetus in pieces in contrast the federal statute uses the phrase delivers living fetus47 the court stated does not involve the delivery of fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix48 the court also identified the acts specific requirement of an overt act that kills the fetus as evidence of its inapplicab ility to the d procedure the court indicated this distinction matters because unlike dx standard does not involve delivery followed by fatal act 49 because the act was found not to prohibit the d procedure the court concluded that it is not overbroad and does not impose an undue burden womans ability to terminate her pregnancy according to the court the absence of health exception also did not result in an undue burden citing its decision in ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england 50 the court noted that health exception would be required if it subjected women to significant health risks51 however acknowledging medical disagreement about the acts requirements ever imposing significant health risks on women the court maintained that the question becomes whether the act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists52 reviewing its past decisions the court indicated that it has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty 53 the court concluded that this medical uncertainty provides sufficient basis to conclude in facial challenge of the statute that it does not impose an undue burden54 45 id at 1628 46 id at 1629 47 18 usc 1531b1a 48 gonzales 127 s ct at 1630 49 id at 1631 50 546 us 320 2006 51 gonzales 127 sct at 1635 for information on ayotte v planned parenthood of

2003 without health exception it acknowledged that there may be discrete and welldefined instances where the prohibited procedure must be used55 however the court indicated that exceptions to the act should be considered in asapplied challenges brought by i ndividual plaintiffs in an asapplied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in facial attack56 justice ginsburg authored the dissent in gonzales she was joined by justices stevens souter and breyer describing the courts decision as alarming justice ginsburg questioned upholding the federal statute when the relevant procedure has been found to be appropriate in certain cases57 citing expert testimony that had been introduced justice ginsburg maintained that the prohibited procedure has safety advant ages for women with certain medical conditions including bleeding disorders and heart disease58 justice ginsburg also criticized the courts decision to uphold the statute without health exception justice ginsburg declared not only does it defy the courts longstanding precedent affirming the necessity of health exception with carveout for circumstances of medical uncertainty it gives short shrift to the records before us carefully canvassed by the district courts59 moreover according to justice ginsburg the refusal to invalidate the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 on facial grounds was perplexing in light of the courts decision in stenberg 60 justice ginsburg noted in materially identical circumstances we held that statute lacking health exception was unconstitutional on its face61 finally justice ginsburg contended that the courts decision cannot be understood as anything more than an effort to chip away at right declared again and again by the courtand with increasing comprehension of its centrality to womens lives62 citing the language used by the court including the phrase abortion doctor to describe obstetriciangynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions justice ginsburg maintained that the courts hostility to the right roe and casey secured is not concealed 63 she argued that when statute burdens constitutional rights and the measure is simply vehicle for expressing hostility to those rights the burden is undue64 55 id at 1638 56 id at 163839 57 id at 1641 58 id at 164445 59 id at 1646 60 id at 1650 61 id 62 id at 1653 63 id at 1650
