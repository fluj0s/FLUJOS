rawle king analyst in industry economics government and finance division the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 summary of key provisions summary in 1968 congress established the national flood insurance program nfip in response to severe flooding following series of hurricanes in 1963 and 1964 and hurricane betsy in 1965 the key policy objectives of the nfip were threefold 1 reduce the nations flood risk through floodplain management 2 improve flood hazard data and risk assessment through mapping the nations floodplains and 3 make affordable flood insurance widely available in communities that adopt and enforce measures to make future construction safer from flooding today the nfip reportedly saves taxpayers over 1 billion annually in flood losses that in the absence of the program would otherwise have been paid by taxpayers fiscally the program had been selfsupporting from the mid1980s until the 2005 hurricanes these storms exposed serious weaknesses in the nfip that congress is addressing in an effort to return the program to financial soundness in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes the nfip faces unprecedented financial and regulatory strains hurricanes katrina rita and wilma resulted in 1928 billion in nfipinsured losses as of december 31 2007 the program had to borrow 17535 billion from the us treasury in order to pay claims and expenses after katrina those concerned about program challenges in the wake of the 2005 storms cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury the need to put the nfip on sounder financial footing substantial premium discounts or crosssubsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements and questions as to the performance and efficiency of private insurers operating under the nfips write your own program policymakers are now examining ways to strengthen the nfip on july 19 2007 representative maxine waters introduced hr 3121 to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program and other purposes chairman barney frank had introduced hr 1682 an earlier version of hr 3121 on march 26 2007 hr 3121 would make the program satisfy traditional criteria for actuarial soundness by phasing out discounted premiums hr 3121 would also 1 allow the federal emergency management agency fema to increase flood policy rates by 15 year up from 10 2 increase the programs borrowing authority to 215 billion from 208 billion 3 raise civil penalties on federally regulated lenders who fail to enforce mandatory purchase of flood insurance for mortgage holders 4 increase program participation incentives 5 add coverage for wind as well as water damage and 6 encourage the revisions to flood maps the bill passed the full house on september 27 2007 on november 1 2007 senator christopher dodd introduced s 2284 flood insurance reform bill designed to increase the amount of premiums collected reduce the cost of expected claims under the nfip s 2284 would also forgive the programs outstanding debt to the treasury some stakeholder groups have expressed concerns about making abrupt changes to the nfip particularly phasing out the subsidized premiums they point to need for flood insurance reform but say changes should be made in the broader context of program reauthorization the nfip

3121 8 the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 summary of key provisions background in 1968 congress established the national flood insurance program nfip in response to rising flood losses and as an alternative to ad hoc federal disaster assistance the nfips insurance operation was selfsupporting from the mid1980s until the 2005 hurricane season when hurricanes katrina rita and wilma exposed serious flaws in the program the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes were catastrophic disasters that required approximately 110 billion in federal disaster relief including an estimated 1928 billion in claims payouts under the nfip1 the program now faces unprecedented financial and regulatory challenges congress is concerned about the financial challenges facing the nfip an important aspect of the financial challenges facing the program involves the rebuilding of the gulf coast region and the adequacy of the nfip to meet the future commercialmultifamily real estate mortgage financial needs of all other communities without federal flood insurance for example lenders will not be able to readily sell mortgages in coastal areas and other regions prone to flooding without reliable and uninterrupted source of affordable flood insurance mortgage credit and home ownership would be more expensive the nfips financial status has forced policymakers to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the nfip in managing and financing the nations flood risk those concerned about program weaknesses typically cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury the need to put the nfip on sounder financial footing substantial premium crosssubsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements and questions as to the performance and efficiency of the write your own program legislative efforts are now underway in congress to reform the nfip on march 26 2007 representative barney frank introduced hr 1682 the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 in order to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program and other purposes on july 19 2007 representative maxine waters introduced hr 3121 bill that is 1 testimony of donald powell federal coordinator gulf coast rebuilding us department of homeland security before the committee on senate homeland security and governmental affairs may 24 2007 crs2 substantially similar to hr 1682 hr 3121 added two new sections to allow for the purchase of optional insurance that would cover flood and windstorm losses section 7 and to extend the nfip five years through september 30 2013 section 27 section 4 of the bill was modified to reflect minor changes of the phasein of actuarial rates beginning on january 1 2011 on november 1 2007 senator dodd introduced s 2284 flood insurance reform bill designed to increase the amount of premiums collected and reduce the cost of expected claims s 2284 would also forgive the programs outstanding debt to the treasury some stakeholder groups like mortgage lenders and real estate developers point to need to reform the nations flood insurance program but insist that radical changes should not be made in reaction to the katrina disaster their main concern relates to making abrupt changes to the nfip without full knowledge of potential unintended consequences which they maintain may include possible increases in the cost of affordable rental housing occupancy costs for businesses delinquencies and foreclosures or reduced property values others observe that these issues and other implications of flood insurance reform should be examined in the 110th congress as some members debate the broader issues surrounding reauthorization of the nfip before program authority expires on september 30 2008 impact of 2005 hurricanes on the nfip the number of claims and severity of flood losses from the 2005 hurricane season was unprecedented in the history of the nfip the federal emergency management agency fema handled 241000 claims and has paid out approximately 163 billion thus far on flood losses stemming from the 2005 hurricane season fema anticipates that total payouts for the 2005 hurricanes will be approximately 207 billion as of december 31 2007 the nfip had borrowed 17535 billion from the treasury to pay for hurricane katrina claims and for the interest payments due on that borrowing in hurricane katrinas aftermath policymakers have expressed broad concerns about the financial condition of the nfip the potential for future catastrophic losses and the programs ability to meet its financial obligations to the treasury and to policyholders in an attempt to protect the nfips integrity and ensure that fema has the financial resources to cover its existing commitments immediately after the 2005 hurricanes congress passed and the president signed into law legislation to increase the nfips borrowing authority to allow the agency to continue to pay flood insurance claims first to 35 billion on september 20 20052 to 185 billion on november 21 20053 and finally to 20775 billion on march 23 20064 2

funds borrowed to pay 2005 hurricanerelated claims within the next 10 years5 even if fema increased flood insurance rates up to the maximum amount allowed by law 10 per year the program would still not have sufficient funds to cover future obligations for policyholder claims operating expenses and interest on debt stemming from the 2005 hurricane season6 during congressional hearings on june 12 2007 before the house financial services committee subcommittee on housing and community opportunity edward l connor deputy assistant administrator for insurance with fema suggested that congress should consider the forgiveness of nfips treasury borrowing supporters of debtforgiveness point to the avoidance of billions of dollars in flood losses that would otherwise have been paid by the treasury and taxpayers today the nfip reportedly saves taxpayers over 1 billion annually in flood losses that in the absence of the program would otherwise have been paid by taxpayers debt forgiveness could however be judged an explicit subsidy from general taxpayer funds with federal budgetary consequences s 2284 introduced by senator christopher dodd in the 110th congress would forgive the nfip debt to the treasury recognizing the unprecedented financial and regulatory challenges facing the nfip and the exposure of the federal government to future claims from another catastrophic loss year many insurance market analysts and policymakers appear to agree that this 39yearold program is in need of an overhaul those concerned about program weaknesses cite increased need to borrow from the us treasury the need for the program to bring in sufficient premiums to cover the federal outlays of funds used to pay claims substantial premium crosssubsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood maps that will form the basis for making decisions about where and how to rebuild the gulf coast and the need to modernize them to more accurately reflect flood risk nationwide costly impact of

government longterm exposure to potential changes in weatherrelated risk which could have significant implications for the nations growing fiscal imbalance summary of hr 3121 appendix 1 provides summary of key provisions of hr 3121 the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 this bill is substantially similar to hr 1682 introduced by chairman barney frank in the 110th congress and hr 4973 introduced by representative richard baker in the 109th congress introduced by representative maxine waters on july 19 2007 and cosponsored by chairman frank and other members hr 3121 would modify the nfip to bring more consumers into the system and gradually phase out premium subsidies currently available for structures built prior to the mapping and implementation of nfip floodplain management requirements the socalled preflood insurance rate maps prefirm structures prefirm buildings pay heavily discounted rates on the first 35000 of their structures insured value and full riskbased premium rates for the remaining insured value hr 3121 would also increase the nfips borrowing authority from the us treasury from 20775 billion to 215 billion to cover claims and expenses and increase the dollar limits on the amounts of coverage available for residential property from 250000 structure and 100000 contents to 335000 structure and 135000 contents for any singlefamily dwelling and from 500000 to 670000 each for structures and related contents of nonresidential property the bill does not address nfip debt forgiveness hr 3121 includes provisions aimed at moving the program to actuarial rates for certain properties starting on january 1 2011 change expected to generate 335 million year in additional revenue the bill also would update the nations flood maps and elevation standards fema would be required to phase in actuarially sound premium rates for commercial and nonprimary residences such as secondary and vacation homes and create new categories of optional coverage such as business interruption coverage necessary increases in living expenses basement improvements and replacement cost of contents fema would also be required for the first time to assess and map the nations 500year floodplain and areas that would crs5 be flooded if dam or levee failed7 the bill would authorize the appropriation of 400 million year over the 20082013 period for updating flood maps8 hr 3121 would increase enforcement tools made available to bank regulators at both the federal and state levels lenders would face higher penalties for noncompliance with the nfips mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement the current level of 350 per violation would increase to 2000 per violation with 1 million cap per institution on penalties in any given year the 1 million cap however would not apply to institutions for calendar year if in any three of the last five calendar years the institution was assessed penalty of at least 1 million in addition lenders would be required to notify borrowers of requirements that flood insurance is available to all homeowners and not just to those in the 100year floodplain as part of the real estate settlement procedures act respa requirements the bill would instruct fema to 1 establish an appeals process 2 implement specified minimum training and education standards for insurance agents selling flood insurance 3 report to congress regarding implementation of each provision of the bunningbereuterblumenauer flood insurance reform act of 20049 4 identify each regulation order notice and other material issued by fema that implements the act and 5 create new notice provision to ensure that individuals who purchased homes in areas of elevated flood risk are made aware of the risk and given an opportunity to purchase flood insurance on july 26 2007 the house financial services committee approved hr 3121 section 7 of the bill would for the first allow for the purchase of optional insurance coverage for wind as well as water damage and extend the nfip five years through september 30 2013 currently nfip offers insurance for losses from flood only during the markup to hr 3121 several amendments were offered and approved representative richard bakers amendment would delay coverage for wind damage until june 30 2008 representative randy neugebauers amendment would require fema to undertake study on the inclusion of nationally recognized building codes in flood plain management criteria representative ruben hinojoses amendment would require study of the economic effects of charging actuarially based premium rates for prefirm structures representative ron kleins amendment would update flood plain maps representative emanuel cleavers amendment would require the completion of the 100year flood plain map update by 2010 and not be delayed by work on 500year flood plain study he also had an amendment to require fema to provide more education about flood insurance program 7 the areas downstream of structural flood control measures heretofore were not considered in the 100year floodplain as result residents did not have to comply with the mandatory purchase requirement

insurance the repetitive loss problem by rawle king crs6 the government accountability office gao would be required to conduct study on expanding mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements on non federal mortgages and properties located in flood zones protected by dams or levees in addition the bill would direct fema to report annually to congress on the financial status of the nfip issues concerning hr 3121 hr 3121 does include several provisions that may be of concern to private insurers the real estate industry mortgage lenders and the bush administration some property owners may drop or reduce their flood insurance coverage because of higher premiums should this happen congress might face the question of appropriating more funds for disaster relief in the event of another catastrophic flood the real estate industry is generally concerned about efforts to expand the nfips mandatory purchase requirement to include lowrisk areas 500year floodplains or regions with 02 chance of flooding located in areas downstream of dams and levees insurers are concerned about provisions that call for an extension of the deadline for filing for proofofloss for up to 180 days following disaster as well as the proposed prohibition of nfip denial of claims solely for failing to meet the deadline insurers also have expressed concern about applying changes in the bill retroactively to claims dating from hurricane isabel in 2003 they are also concerned about the broadening of the phaseout of premium subsidies applicable to primary residences when they are sold mortgage lenders are concerned about the lack of safe harbor for technical noncompliance and unintentional clerical error they have also expressed concerns about expanding the mandatory purchase requirement to statechartered institutions not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic requiring mortgage companies to escrow funds for hazard insurance and requiring lending institutions to notify homeowners about residential risks in the 500year floodplain critics of expanding the scope of the nfip to cover wind loss in addition to flood loss insist the nfips present 175 billion deficit would increase july 10 2007 study by towers perrin on behalf of the american insurance association aia for example indicated that depending on the extent to which the expanded nfip replaces private insurers the program deficits from wind damages could be 100 to 200 billion there is consensus as to the impact of expanding the nfip to include wind coverage supporters of the expansion say there will be federal subsidies for the wind aspect of the legislation also the home or business owner in flood plain would have to purchase flood insurance coverage to obtain the wind coverage wind coverage will not be sold separately finally while the bush administration has expressed support for flood insurance reform legislation statement of administration policy released on june 27 2006 raised concerns over provisions in similar legislation introduced in the 109th congress hr 4973 would have added new lines types of coverage crs7 increased the maximum coverage limits and required fema claims adjusters to participate in statesponsored mediation at the request of state insurance commissioner10 according to administration officials the requirement for fema claims adjusters to participate in statesponsored mediation raises constitutional concerns involving separation of powers between the branches of the federal government and between the states and the federal government11 the issue of concern is that congress would be conferring on state officials the authority to subject agents of the federal executive to the authority of state government entity in light of these concerns some stakeholder groups would rather fold consideration of hr 3121 into broader look at the whole program which is due for reauthorization in 2008 the real estate industry for example wants congress to strike balance between ensuring the longterm fiscal viability of the nfip and avoiding changes that may result in market inequities and housing affordability problems12 real estate professionals and local public officials have raised concerns about femas map modernization and flood elevation standards new notification requirements and the elimination of subsidies for nonresidential properties and non primary residences in response to postkatrina fema maps and elevation standards for building or reconstruction for example some local community officials along the gulf coast have complained about the cost of compliance with femas new flood mapping and elevation standards these community officials want waivers on the new standards and in the absence of such waiver might drop out of the nfip in addition the 30000 increased cost of compliance icc benefit under the nfip which is used to pay the cost of complying with new land use or construction ordinances designed to reduce future flood losses might not be sufficient some consumer advocates want to increase the icc benefit to 50000 at of course higher claims costs to the program the withdrawal of communities in floodprone areas from the nfip could result in higher uninsured losses and the unintended consequence of higher federal expenditures for disaster assistance 10 executive office of the
