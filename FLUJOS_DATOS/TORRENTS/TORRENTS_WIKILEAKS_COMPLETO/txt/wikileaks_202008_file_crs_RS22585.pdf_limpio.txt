of broadcasting organizations is envisioned to adapt broadcasters rights to the digital era broadcasting industry advocates of the need for this treaty observe that ex isting relevant international agreements1 do not offer sufficient protection because advances in broadcasting technology and the parallel volution of the industry are not covered by the terms ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22585crs2 2 report wipo doc woga 3310 october 3 2006existing agreements these proponents not that the primary agreement covering broadcasting and cablecasting rights the ro convention was c oncluded in 1961 and predates home audio and video recording telecommunications satellite systems and consumer satellite dishes di gital technology wireless networks and the ability of consumers to receive broadcasts via com puter or mobile telephone accordingly proponents assert the convention does not adequately protect these new modes of broadcasting the proposed new broadcasting treaty w ould grant broadcasting and cablecasting organizations protection of their program trans missions for fixed term of years enabling them to prohibit copying and redistribution of transmissions without authorization which could be enforced through t echnological means of preventin g circumvention of encrypted transmissions and the like such protections would be distinct from the copyright of the creators of the content for program trans missions however opponents of the treaty respond that it is not necessary noting that the development of the broadcasting industry in the united states has not been hurt by the fact that it is not even party to the rome convention from its first session in november 1998 the sccr decided to pursue in earnest discussions and submissions concerning the text of new broadcasting treaty since 2004 the sccr has been pushing for diplomatic conference for final negotiations and adoption of treaty however after nine ears and 15 sessions plus two special sessions of preliminary negotiations consensus has been reached on text adequate for diplomatic conference at its may 2006 meeting the sccr decided to drop webcasting transmitting over the internet and simulcasting transmitting simultaneously via traditional broadcasting over the air and on the internet from the scope of the treaty placing them into separate parallel negotiating track the united states was almost the sole proponent of including webcasting in th treaty and had tried to bolster support for it by linking it to simulcasting which the european union advocated the sccr hoped to increase the likelihood of successfully conc luding the treaty by dropping these highly controversial issues at its fall 2006 meeting the wipo general assembly tentatively agreed to convene diplomatic conference in novemberd ecember 2007 to conclude treaty for the protection of only traditional broadcasting or ganizations and cablecasting organizations contingent on the sccrs successfully tabling consensus proposed text to that end the sccr held two special sessions in january and june 2007 to aim to agree and finalize on signalbased approach the objectives specific scope and object of protection2 the emphasis on signalbased approach was an attempt to narrow the focus of the treaty to signal theft and piracy in order to allay concerns that new layer of intellectual property rights in the content of broadcasts would in effect extend protection beyond the expiration of copyrights for each broadcast transmission and keep or remove content from the public domain at the c onclusion of the second special session it became apparent that the conclusion of treat by the end of 2007 would not be feasible given the significant differences that yet re mained among the positions of various parties further steps have been taken to organize diplomatic conference although the treaty remains on the agenda of the sccrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22585crs3 3 despite the reference to further revision of

january 25 2008the revised draft basic proposal wipo doc sccr152rev and nonpaper prepared by the sccr chair in april 2007 provided the basis for negotiations at the second special session and apparently remain the current working text3 the revised draft basic proposal was considered inad equate to support successful diplomatic conference because it essentially incorporated every major alternative text for those articles where major differences remain among the wipo parties for example there are two alternatives for article 18 one providing that the term of protection shall be 50 years the other that the term shall be 20 year s the protections available under the rome convention have term of 20 years and the longer 50year term proposed for the new treaty has been controversial furthermore this text does not define signal although the chairman of the sccr floated proposed definition of signal in an informal non paper at the first special session in january 20074 article 2 in th april 2007 nonpaper does not define signal but doe s define broadcast in terms of signals there appears to be uncertainty and disagreement among the negotiating parties as to precisely what signalbased approach means for the narro wed focus of new treaty consequently some parties suggest that signalbased approach mandated by the wipo general assembly may still encompass certain elements of exclusive rights including the right to prohibit certain uses of broadcast whic h remains major point of contention these two examples are indicative of the lack of consensus affecting most of the provisions of the revised draft basic proposal therefore it may be useful to c onsider some of the major points of contention for the treaty the principles expressed in various stakeholder statements are fairly representative of common objections raised by treaty opponent s and also of some of the concerns or positions expressed by various wipo c ountryparties during negotiations joint statement distributed by 41 corporations industry associations and nongovernmental organizations at the first special session of the sccr advocated several guidelines for treaty text while not conceding their position that treaty is not necessary at all this statement is similar to earlier statements issued by many of the same stakeholders at the september 2006 meeting of the wipo general assembly nd to

the convention provides for the obligation of ea ch contracting state to take adequate measures to prevent the unauthorized distribution on or fro m its territory of any programcarrying signal transmitted by satellite the distribution is unauthorized if it has not been authorized by the organization typically broadcasting organi zation that has decided what the program consists of the obligation applies to organiza tions that are nationals of convention party however the convention provisions are not applic able where the distribution of signals is made from direct broadcasting satellitedecision not to accede to the rome conventi on we see necessity for the creation of new rights to stimulate ec onomic activity in this area longstanding negotiations do not justify the creation of rights that would be exceedingly novel in us law and that are likely to harm consumers existing ri ghts and stifle technology innovation6 before the creation of such rights the stakeholders ma intain that there should be demonstrated need for such rights and clear understa nding of how they will impact the public educators existing copyright holders online communications and new internet technologies7 second according to the stakeholders the treaty should not be rightsbased that is grant exclusive rights in broadcasts similar to copyright rather it should be in their view signalbased meaning that the preven tion of theft or piracy of prebroadcast signals should be the focus of the treaty th ird stakeholders assert that the treaty should not be negotiated with reference to whether it detracts or departs from the rome convention although the signers of the statem ent believe that str ong signal protections are consistent with the rome convention the european union in particular has advocated that new treaty should comply with the rome convention however some stakeholders observed8 that the narrowed treaty focus on signalbased approach is more akin to the brussels convention9 fourth to the extent the treaty permits rights beyond protection against signal theftpiracy the stakeholders claim that mandatory limitations and exceptions similar to those under copyrigh t laws should be included in the treaty to ensure that the treaty does not prohibit uses of broadcast content that are lawful under copyright law the treaty should also in their view permit additional limitations and exceptions appropriate in digital network environment fifth the stakeholders contend that the tr eaty should exclude coverage of fixations transmissions or retransmissions over hom network or persona l network concerns have been raised that because the revised draft basic proposal envi sions protections for technological protections m easures tpm and digital ri ghts management schemes drm the beneficiary broadcasting organizations would have the ability to control signals in home or personal ne twork environment stakeholde rs allege that this would inhibit such networking

network service providers are not subject to liability for alleged infringement of rights or violations of prohibitions due to actions in the nor mal course of business or actions of customers the south centre an intergovernmental or ganization of developing countries issued research paper on the broadcast treaty in january 2007 which expressed some of the same concerns with regard to the benefits that the treaty would have for developing countries as well as additional concerns10 recommendations similar to those discussed above include that the negotia tors 1 consider maintainin g that the rationale and scope of application of the new in strument be limited to signal protection 2 do not accept the inclusion of any exclusive rights or at the least that such rights do not extend beyond those incorporated in the rome conventi on unless clear evidence is found for the need to grant such rights and mechanisms to address the potential harms they may cause are developed and 3 ensure th at appropriate safeguards to pursue public policy objectives and limitations and exceptions are included in the text additionally the south centre recommends that the negotiators 1 refrain from expanding protection to include delivery via computer networks as well as an reference to webcasting which is at odds with the position of the united states and we bcasting advocates 2 provide for special treatment to public service broadcasting ndor discrimination between commercial and noncommercial broadcasting 3 limit the maximum term of protection to 20 years if exclusive rights are required fo r signal protection rather than the 50 years in the revised draft basic proposal and 4 do not include obligations concerning the protection of tpms and drm schemes or at least consider including limitations and exceptions as minimum standards to these obligations to ensure they do not impede access to content as noted above the united states has been the primary advocate for extending protections to webcasting whether in new broadcasting treaty or in separate agreement or protocol in statement submitted to the sccr the united states clarified that it never intended that protection be afforded to the ordinary use of the internet or world wide web such as through email blogs websites and the like we intended only to cover programming and signal s which are like traditional broadcasting and cablecasting ie simultaneous transmissi on of scheduled programming for reception by the public11 in the statement the united states sought to replace the term webcasting with netcasting and clarified that netcasting was limited to transmissions over computer networks carrying programs consisting of audio visual or audiovisual content or representations thereof which are of the type that can be but are not necessarily carried by the program carrying signal of broadcast or cablecast and which are delivered to the public in format similar to broadcasting or cablecasting it decided that webcasting unnecessarily implied that ordinary activity on the world wide web would be coveredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22585crs6 12 it was also not signatory when the conv ention was concluded so it would appear that congress has never previously considered the convention 13 examples of such letters are available via httpwwwefforgipwipobroadcasting_treaty last visited

protections to netcasting as were and woul d be extended to trad itional broadcasting and cablecasting but asserted that such protections would only be whatever was necessary to prevent signal theftpiracy assuming that the treaty is eventually successfully concluded and that the united states is signatory any such treaty would not take effect for the united states unless and until the treaty was ratified by the united states with the advice and consent of the senate and congress enacted implementing legislation furthermore if the final text of the treaty adopted by wipo includes alternative aaa to article 27 of the revised draft basic proposal party to the new broadcast treaty w ould be required to become party to the rome convention first which would mean th at the united states would also have to consider ratification of that conventi on to which it is not currently party12 implementing legislation would likely be necessa ry to establish new protections or amend existing ones in broadcasting laws and perh aps copyright laws currently 47 usc 325 and 605 and 18 usc 25102512 provide for br oadcasting protections and title 17 of the us code contains the copyright ws additionally webcastingnetcasting and simulcasting may be included in separate agreement or as protocol to new broadcasting treaty unless they are reconsider ed for inclusion in the new broadcast treaty itself certain stakeholders either opposed to th treaty or concerned about the inclusion of certain protections have called on congress to hold hearin gs on the treaty to determine whether new treaty is necessary or at least to exercise greater oversight over the us delegations positions on the treaty13 they had also urged that the us copyright office and the uspto solicit public commentary which those agencies did through the aforementioned roundtables th stakeholders are concerne d that without public input major changes in us telecommunications and copyright laws will be effected via implementation of new broa dcast treaty without full oppor tunity for domestic debate14 partly in response to the objections raised by stakeholders in the information and communications technology industries the unite d states reportedly sought to ensure that diplomatic conference would not proceed if special sessions failed to resolve the major disagreements15 furthermore the senate judici ary committee expressed concerns about the treaty to the copyright office and uspto urging advocacy of narrow signaltheft based approach and opposing ne w layer of exclusive rights16
