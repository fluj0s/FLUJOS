sensitivity insensitive typical vehicle bomb makeup there is standard type of vehicle associated with vehicle bombs vehicle selection depends on several factors which vehicles are common for the region availability of those vehicles and the security environments near the intended target for instance well hardened facilities with good physical security measures in place including significant standoff distances may require the terrorist to use trucks with large enclosed cargo areas that provide increased explosive capacities capable of generating damaging blast effects over large distance terro rists are imaginative consider things like the use of emergency response vehicles being used by terrorists to slip past cordon chec kpoints possibly after an incident to deliver vehicle bomb special note do not discount the possibility that terrorists have observed your operations and may atte mpt to coax first responders to an incident only to entrap them with secondary and possibly tertiary explosive devices be wary of responding to the same location building etc and staging your response from the same command post cp on repeat responseth reat situations use military working dogs mwd and physical search methods to ensure cps are secure consider propane oxygen and acetylene tanks as suspicious there are several documented examples of flammableexplosive gas filled cylinders

drums have been used as the casing for the explosive itself tanks have been cut open and filled with everything from anfo to military grade high explosives he to thermite high temperature incendiary mixture of aluminum powder and metal oxide terrorists may employ blast directing technique this involves adding steel plating or so mething with considerable mass around the main charge to funnel the blast wave toward the intended target this technique would also increase the difficulty of detecting the explosive device with current xray detection techniques steel around the explosive main charge may also provide additional fragmentation hiding places for the explosive main charge typical places to find the explosive main charge include vehicles back seat trunk cargo bed or the enclosed cargo hold area of watersewagefuel tankers passenger vans step vans or semitrailers terrorists also use vehicle gas tanks as hiding place for explosive main charges the gas tank is cut open filled with explosives and sealed back up separate gas supply container is used to get the vehicle bomb to the target also watch for other hidden compartments false walls or floors molding plastic explosives into shapes that are easily hidden in vehicle compartments and nonexposed crevices is favorite tactic dont forget that an prills can be blown like insulation into vehicles voids and body cavities vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 17 for official use only main charge initiation techniques the overwhelming means of successfully initiating vehicle bomb is the vehicle driver using suicide switch there is also documented evidence that remote control rc infrared ir electronicmechanical time delay and other electrical initiation devices are being successfully used often the vehicles external radio antenna is used as the electronic initiators signalreceiving antenna there may be an antitamper feature on the vehicle bomb for instance microswitch that completes the electric firing circuit when the vehicle doors is opened or loose wire that contacts bare metal on the vehicle frame could be used to initiate the detonation predominant electrical initiation power sources include the vehicle battery one or more 9volt batteries one or more 15volt aa batteries or any combination thereof do not discount battery sizes not mentioned the predominant nonelectrical initiation source is time fuse there are many different types of time fuses commercially manufactured they are usually called safety fuse or hobby fuse the us military uses m700 time fuse the biggest disadvantage for terrorist using time fuse is its characteristic smoke and acrid odor smells like lfur and rotten eggs although the time fuse can be encapsulated in plastic or surgical tubing minimizing its burning signature commercial safety fuse there are numerous brands which differ usually only in their exterior water proofing materials and color markings black powder is widely used as the burning core of safety fuse to provide the necessary delay prior to an explosion it burns at rate of 8858 to 14436 seconds per meter vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 18 for official use only 27 to

systems approach for detecting vehicle explosive threat through an entry control process the basis for the implementation guidance provided in this section is the result of force protection battlelab initiativethe vehicle entry explosive search strategy veess this initiative provided the data and concept of operations that maximizes the detection capabilities associated with the entry control process it is significant that the word process is used in describing this systematic approach to explos ive detection the approach is both layered and tailored drawing on the principles described below however it requires you to exercise fair amount of judgment in order to flexibly apply those principles to your site specific conditions recommended strategy systems approach systems design represents popular concept for increasing the overall capability to detect expl osives across the threat spectrum the basic idea is to employ traditional vehicle search techniques and explosive detection technology into an overall strategy to detect vehicle bombs at entry control points vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 23 for official use only the system design relies upon successively layering these resources and tailoring these technologies to address 1 your site specific threat 2 the resources available to you and 3 your particular operating environment in order to progressively detect and isolate explosive threats for immediate cordon and evacuation followed by appropriate response actions by eod technicians this concept incorporates isolation of the search stations by exploiting distance and physical barrier methods in an effort to mitigate the effects of blast and fragmentation respectively detection and search optimization the benefits associated with systems approach are illustrated in the chart below1 the chart presents combinations of layered and tailored systems and their detection frequency and false alarm rates the systems considered are

explosive trace detector technology used with the trad itional strategy achieves 9192 detection rate with 20 or 27 fa lse alarm rate depending on which particular technology options are used significant investment above these levels only results in small gains in detection with significantly higher increases in false alarms the bottom line is that the most expensive systems in one or all of the following resources dollars manpower training andor maintenance may not provide an appreciable benefit over simple traditional and robust technology systems properly layered and tailored limitations available data indicates that the use of vapor detection equipment used in isolation can provide somewhat inaccurate assessment3 there are too many variables involved including type of explosive vapor concentration or lack thereof environmental factors and the construction of the container or vehicle thus single technological solution exists to adequately screen vehicles for large and small explosive devices detectors also require additional extensive training of security pers onnel to interpret results severe climates may increase the probability of failures and required maintenance screening vehicles at entry control points ecps also impacts the routine flow of traffic and most bulk detection devices are expensive vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 26 for official use only vehicle search procedures ask the driver of the vehicle to open all compartments doors the hood and trunk if applicable during your search of vehicle if you find anything suspicious follow your local procedures the search area will likely be evacuated and eod will probably be notified remember that you are not only looking for the big bomb but any type of weapon ied or

the following guidelines are provided explosive detector dog edd searches although specific edd search pro cedures vary according to local policy individual mwd handler preference and the unique abilities of individual canines the typical approach follows five general steps 1 the driver exits the vehicle and opens all doors the hood and trunk lids any other compartments any packages and is placed in holding area where he or sh is not allowed to witness the vehicle search the driver should also be physically searched 2 the edd team the handler and the dog proceeds directly to the downwind side of the vehicle 3 the edd team starts the search at specific point and search in counterclockwise manner with the handler visually guiding the edd to search for scents along the fenders wheel wells hubcaps spare tire and bumpers 4 the dog is directed to search all opened compartments vehicle seats and floorboard 5 the dog is directed to search any onboard packages and parcels figure

and those referred to later in this section are tnt equivalent weights the detonation of vehicle bombs generates four primary hazards to personnel in fixed structures shelters and in the open primary fragments consisting of vehicle debris ejected at moderate to high velocities and generally low trajectories secondary fragments from barriers and structures countermobility devices and structures near the large vehicle bomb lvb and ecp will be completely involved in the lvb explosion and will produce secondary debris as they are broken up by the force of the blast this debris will again be launched at relatively low trajectories but will have significant velocity secondary debris in fixed structures window glass and some structural materials such as masonry walls can fail and become debris that is hazardous to personnel occupying perimeter spaces in buildings blast the force of the explosion as it is transmitted through the air blast can cause injury to personnel in the open it

employed in this fashion can be effective in stopping primary debris if they are sufficiently tall however they also may become secondary debris hazards in the immediate vicinity of large explosion

structures such as blast walls that are intended to remain as permanent facility hardening measure generally these structures have been employed in one of two ways 1 at the anticipated detonation location or 2 immediately in front of the building they are designed to protect unfortunately test data indicates that employing blast barrier at the detonation point provides appreciable increase in protection in all but very few building types however constructing blast wall immediately in front of occupied structures can provide significant protection the blast wall effectively reduces the pressure from reflected pulse to an incident pulse permitting reduced safe standoff distances blast walls can be massive however requiring height equal to 15x the protected structure height and width

nuts and bolts of setting up and implementing blast and fragment mitigation measures in the most optimum configuration possible for given set of conditions or restraints this section will build off of the principles discussed in the intended use and context section but is tailored to stand alone in the sense that all of the recommendations for site layout standoff and barri er selection are

proper barrier implementation sequently blast is generally the driver in selecting vehicleec p orientation the vehicle should optimally be pointed head on towards the assets to be protected to reduce near field blast pressure blastfrag mitigation plan factors to be considered in mitigating vehicle bomb threat can be divided into two major components debris hazard distances and safe structure

with one another almost all cases will require referencing at least two of the four chart types 1 debris hazard distance charts the debris hazard distance charts should be referenced for all debris hazards as this is the only chart type out of the four in this manual that deals with debris each chart deals with different charge weight and barrier combination regardless of whether or not there are expeditionary or permanent st ructures present these charts must be referenced for debris information remember the debris hazard distance charts must be referred to for primary fragment info

with or without shock dissipating blast walls in checking expeditionary structure safe distances the user must also refer to the debris hazard distance charts for debris information 34 fixed structure wall and window safe distance charts for permanent structures there are two types of charts the fixed structure wall safe distance charts and the fixed structure window safe distance charts both charts must be used together to evaluate the safe distances for fixed structures the wall charts give vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 51 for official use only the safe distances for standard and retrofitted cmu walls in fixed structures the window charts do the same for the windows of the fixed structure with variables for the window size thickness and protective film again in checking permanent structure safe distances the user must still refe r to the debris hazard distance charts for debris information the table below shows the necessary charts for different situations to reiterate in ever situation without exception the debris hazard distance charts must be used one additional structure chart must be used when expeditionary structures are present and two additional

safe standoff determination for buildings it should be pointed out that the standoff distances presented below are for design purposes they are not intended to replace or supersede eod evacuation

be approximately 305 meters 10 ft or 1067 meters 35 ft from the lvb fragment mitigation using concre barriers will be limited to the height of the barrier the further the barrier is from the detonation point the higher the barrier will need to be to stop an equivalent number of fragments recommended heights for earth sandbag and concertainer style barriers are presented on the charts the

battlelab conducted field experiment in late 1998 to dete rmine among other objectives the general detection capabilities of expl osive detector dogs edds in an actual operational setting against realistic vehicle ieds in this experiment the edds used demonstrated an average detection frequency of 66 and false alarm rate of approximately 5 the detection frequency varied somewhat according to the size of the ied in question however initial indications from the experiment suggested that the dogs are quite ag ile students able to learn new explosives sizes very quickly unfortunately there is much additional research required before the issue of quantity impacts of detection capability will be fully understood 2 because of the difficulty of controlling and measuring odor stimuli under nonlaboratory conditions it is likely not possible to collect similar data in the field there are number of potential sources of variation between boratory and field conditions including dog search technique timing training history handler skills and visualauditorynontarget olfactory stimuli interferences johnston and hartell 1997 28 during us army field test of canine mine detection capabilities although the dogs correctly alerted at much higher rate than they incorrectly alerted the raw number of false alerts was approximately 25 greater than the raw number of correct alerts potential causes hypothesized by the researchers included unknown previous contamination r esident from previous explosives tests on site and crosscontamination of explosive odors from active to inert target mines nolan and gravitte 1977 6466 3 the naval explosive ordnance disposal technology division naveodtechdiv conducted variety of test and studies between 1988 and 1996 in support of portable explosive vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 92 for official use only detector development according to naveodtechdiv the tests support three primary conclusions 1 explosive vapor detection is not viable means of explosive detection for plastic and chlorate d explosives and is unreliable for any type of explosive if the explosive is carefully packaged 2 trace particle detection that is detection of residual sample from the surface of suspect object may be more practical and reliable means of explosive detec tion than vapor detection given specific operational circumstances these required circumstances are that sufficient quantities of explosive material must be transferred from the ied to exposed and accessible surfaces such contamination must be distributed over significant surface area or easily locatable and sufficient sample must be readily acquired through surface wipes or air transport 3 it is the inability to obtain sufficient sample from hidden explosive devices that reduces the performance and limits the application of current portable explosive detection devices sample acquisition not detector sensitivity is the critical limiting characteristic this problem applies to both vapor and particle detection frank et 1997 23 emphasis added the naveodtechdiv goes on to suggest that methods to locate likely areas of contamination or to increase sampling efficiency may be particularly valuable 1997 23 the report emphatically states that portable handheld trace explosive detection will see marked improvement only if the attention of

applicable to standard 532 or 14 thick annealed glass windows criteria are provided for glazing sizes with widths varying from 12 to 60 and heights varying from 24 to 72 the existing structure must provide locations with adequate strength for the attachment of retrofit catcher bar support brackets in addition to any direct blast load at the location this window retrofit method is called the daylight application frf catcher bar system it consists of the application of fragment retention film frf along wi th catcher bar at the inside face of the window installation of the fragment retention film is done with the window glazing remaining in place the film is trimmed so that it just covers th exposed surface of the glazing and does not extend into the bite of the frame the catcher bar is typically metal bar that spans hor izontally across the inside of the window at the midheight of the glazing and is fastened to the wall on either side of the window in the event of an explosion that blows the glazing out of its frame the glazing remains adhered to the frf as the fractured glass and frf flies toward the inside of the room it strikes the catcher bar wraps around it and if the film and bar are strong enough is stopped by the catcher bar the frf holds the fractured glazing together as unit thus the shards of broken glass are prevented from being blown into the building and injuring the occupants anchorage of the catcher bar to the existing structure will depend on the type of existing wa ll construction on window size and on window arrangement the catcher bar spans horizontally vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 94 for official use only across the inside of the window at midheight of the glazing support for the ends of the catcher bar can be provided by brackets anchored to the wall on either side of the window it may also be fastened to vertical members that span from the floor to the ceiling anchorage to the wall is recommended if there is enough room and the wall is strong enough if space or strength restrictions make attachment to the wall impractical attachment to vertical members supported at the floor and ceiling becomes an option in this case the floor and ceiling must have ade quate strength for attachment of the vertical supports the design aids given in this document are for the combined system of daylight application frf on annealed glass with catcher bar and are not applicable for the individual components the design of catcher bar includes the design of attachment brackets and anchorage as well as sizing the catcher bar crosssection this document provides the information needed for determining frf thickness and catcher bar crosssection determination of the frf thickness is the first step once th thickness has been selected then the required strength of the cat cher bar can be determined information needed to begin the design process includes the charge weight the standoff and the glazing size charge weight is the weight of tnt equivalent to th explosive threat standoff is the distance between the explosive charge and the window the required window information is the width height and thickness of the glazing with this informati on the plots presented in the below chart can be used to determine the frf thickness required these plots are applicable for minimum film tensile strength

structures to blast effects in the context of terrorist attacks however the primary cost of an explosion is measured pr imarily in injuries to personnel and only subsequently in terms of damage to structures thus when the united states air force usaf force protection battlelab fpb was tasked to develop the vehicle bomb mitigation guide vmbg the paucity of informa tion on personnel vulnerability became immediately apparent based on the minimal data that was vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 113 for official use only available the primary risk to pe rsonnel at expeditionary sites is inside structures such as tents trailers huts and other improvised habitations thus the objective of the bait initiative was to gather sufficient data to quantify injuries to personnel inside blastimpacted expeditionary and temporary structures improved assessment methods for personnel vulnerability and casualty predictions were deve loped with test data from all fifteen tests which were conducted with charge sizes of approximately 250 600 2450 and 12200 pounds ammonium nitratefuel oil anfo at varying standoff distances biofidelic specimens and modified hybrid iii anthropomorphic test dummies atds were placed in expeditionary and temporary structures in six tests positioned at varying distances from 2450 pounds anfo such that they were subjected to range of overpressure and impulse conditions sufficient to ensure varying injury results amid shelter debris impact and shelter collapse overall body motion and overpressure measurements of human body response were made by applying accelerometers and pressure gages to the torsos and heads of cadavers and dummies necropsies of the posttest cadavers were performed to quantify the level of injury and the probability of fatality the environment within the expeditionary structure was characterized with pressure gages and highspeed cameras to record physical insults to the biofidelic specimens and to observe overall body motion in addition selected expeditionary structures were instrumented to measure the reflected pressures at the structure the acceleration of the tent canvas and frame and the frame deflection posttest structural response observations and measurements were also made da ta collected for these structures were used to correlate the observed injuries with the structural debris environment experienced by the biofidelic specimens in the event of structural failure of temper there is risk of blunt trauma to the head face neck and thorax at vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 114 for official use only threshold of structural damage typically referred to as failure by structural engineers where at least one major supporting component of the structure has completely fa iled the risk of severe injury appears to be greater in temper tent than southeast asia sea hut this is primarily due to the more hazardous nature of the temper frame debris which may be easily mitigated through the use of frame padding in sea huts blunt trauma injuries also occurred to the face neck and chest it is only at higher levels of structural damage for the sea hut where complete collapse of the sea hut roof occurs that similar levels of injury are seen the cadaver necropsies and anthropomorphic data analyses demonstrated that structure damage and injury correlations work well for the temper structures slight to severe structural damage correlates to chance of injury but low probability of fatality while severe damage to failure co rrelates to high probability of injury and moderate probability of fatality for sea huts on the other hand structural damage and injuries do not correlate as well specifically failure of structural components does not correspond to high likelihood of severe injury or fatality instead severe injuries and potential fatalities were only observed when structural collapse occurred it should be noted however that the probability of being hit with structural members in the tem per is considerably lower than that in the sea hut thus while not specifically addressed in this test series as test variable personnel location and structure population will determine the probability of injury in each structure injuries created by the blast debris inside the temper tents and sea huts would require at minimum substantial medical resources for

secondary debris calculations in the last several decades vehicle bombs have been favorite tactic used by terrorists to try to achieve their objectives united states us government inst allations determined to prevent vehicle bombs from reaching the desired location conduct various search activities on all vehicles entering base or facility one common method of accomplishing search is to install entry control points using variety of vehicle barrier configurations to force entering vehicles to stop at designated location and be searched while an ecp may be effective in preventing entry of suspected vehicle bomb into an installation it does not necessarily prevent detonation of the bomb at th ecp typical barriers used to create the ecp are designed for vehicle impact loads not blast loads when vehicle bomb detonates at an ecp the barriers can fragment vbmg afh 102401 for official use only january 2004 119 for official use only and throw debris great distances depending on the

calculations were made with the mudemimp code part of the dispre model roll after impact was included in the debris distance calculations because significant roll was observed in videos and highspeed films of the bass tests certain aspects of dispre were modified to account for the differences between rectangular structure walls and the ecp standalone barrier walls load reductions normally taken in dispre do not apply to the barriers also the areas used in mudemimp to calculate debris density were modified to exclude the 5degree spread of debris out from the corners of the barrier the use of this spread angle is based on the dispersion of debris observed in tests of walls of rectangular concrete and masonry structures the ecp barriers are generally shorter and longer than those tested to generate the original dispre data using only the rectangular area bordered by the nor mal to each barrier end proved to be better match to the bass data finally the use of soil backing does reduce debris velocity and resultant debris throw distance but not as significantly as if the entire mass of the soil backing were added to the mass of the barrier to decrease the velocity all modifications to the dispre approach were made after careful investigation of the bass test data and the unique features of the ecp barriers the maximum distances for debris densities corresponding to 1 5 and 10 hit probabilities along the barrier width were then plotted safe distances predicted using the modified dispre approach could thus be compared directly to the bass test data typical comparison plots
