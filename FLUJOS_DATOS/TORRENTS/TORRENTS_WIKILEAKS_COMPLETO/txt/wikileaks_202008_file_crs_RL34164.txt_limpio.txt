garrett l hatch analyst in government organization and management government and finance division virginia mcmurtry specialist in american national government government and finance division improper payments information act of 2002 background implementation and assessment summary on november 26 2002 the improper payments information act ipia was signed into law as pl 107300 116 stat 2350 augmenting previous financial management reform laws the ipia seeks to increase financial accountability in the federal government and thus reduce wasteful spending the law requires agencies to identify each year programs and activities vulnerable to significant improper payments to estimate the amount of overpayments or underpayments and to report to congress on steps being taken to reduce such payments in may 2003 the office of management and budget omb issued guidance to agencies on the implementation of the ipia which was revised and incorporated into omb circular a123 as appendix c in august 2006 ombs guidance while consistent with some provisions of the ipia has been criticized on several counts whereas the statute requires agencies to report to congress on all programs with more than 10 million in estimated improper payments omb added an additional threshold such that agencies must only report on programs with improper payments that exceed both 10 million and 25 of total program payments critics have identified number of examples of programs with improper payments over 10 million that are not reported to congress because they do not also meet the 25 threshold in the 2006 update of its guidance omb stated that it may determine on casebycase basis that some programs are to be subject to annual performance and accountability report requirements even if they do not meet the 25 threshold ombs guidance has also been criticized for permitting agencies to exempt some programs from the ipias annual requirement for risk assessment under the act every program and activity is to be reviewed each year ombs guidance however now allows agencies to review program once every three years if it has been deemed lowrisk critics say this runs counter to the language and intent of the ipia and that it leaves open the possibility that improper payments might go undetected during the exemption period for fy2007 omb reported governmentwide error rate of 35 this figure does not cover an estimated 16 of atrisk outlays about 292 billion which lack improper payment estimates and are not yet reflected in the error rate including number of major programs until valid

legislative history and intent on november 26 2002 the improper payments information act ipia was signed into law as pl 107300 116 stat 2350 augmenting previous financial management reform laws the ipia is intended to increase financial accountability in the federal government and thereby reduce wasteful spending the law requires agencies to identify each year programs and activities vulnerable to significant improper payments to estimate the overpayments or underpayments exposure and to report on steps taken to reduce such payments as explained more fully below improper payments generally include any payment that should not have been made or was made for an incorrect amount previously there was governmentwide requirement for agencies to estimate or report in any systematic way on improper payments although it is generally acknowledged that billions of dollars are involved the office of management and budget omb estimated for example that in fy2005 improper payments under 47 federal programs totaled approximately 373 billion1 the ipia was introduced in the 107th congress as hr 4878 on june 6 2002 by representative stephen horn with group of bipartisan cosponsors and referred to the house committee on government reform the subcommittee on government efficiency financial management and intergovernmental relations held markup on the measure on june 18 2002 and approved the bill as amended by unanimous voice vote on july 9 2002 hr 4878 was considered under suspension of the rules and passed the house as amended by voice vote on october 9 2002 the senate

payments had received attention in previous congresses during house floor debate on hr 4878 representative horn noted that hearings held in the past clearly demonstrated the need for such legislation since the 104th congress the subcommittees i have chaired have held approximately 100 hearings on wasteful spending within the federal government time and again witnesses from the general accounting office and agency inspectors general have told the subcommittee that poor accounting systems and procedures have contributed to the governments serious and long term problems involving improper payments2 in the written report of the senate committee on governmental affairs to accompany hr 4878 the provisions of the bill were explicitly linked to gao recommendations offered in best practices guide for agencies in managing improper payments prepared at the request of the committee chairman senator joseph lieberman the guide suggested that determining the nature and extent of risks for improper payments was crucial step hr 4878 would begin the process of improving the management of improper payments following gaos guidance by requiring that agencies annually estimate the amount of improper payments and report on the steps they are taking to reduce the amounts of those payments in the largest programs3 major provisions the ipia directs each executive branch agency in accordance with omb guidance to review all its programs and activities each year identify those susceptible to significant improper payments and estimate the amount of improper payment exposure agencies are then to report annually to congress on improper payments using standardized methodology determined by omb4 with respect to any program or activity with estimated annual improper payments exceeding 10 million each agency is also required to provide report on agency actions to reduce such improper payments including 1 the causes of the 2 rep stephen horn debate on hr 4878 remarks in the house

federal contractor or governmental or other organization administering federal program or activity previous improper payment efforts the ipia codified and expanded efforts already underway in the executive branch to reduce improper payments in 2001 the bush administration designated improving financial performance as one of five governmentwide initiatives in the presidents management agenda pma the establishment of baseline on the extent of erroneous improper payments for major federal benefit programs was key component of the financial management initiative5 agencies were to include information on erroneous payment rates for benefit and assistance programs over 2 billion as part of their fy2003 budget submissions in july 2001 revisions to omb circular a11 in section 57 implemented this objective requiring 15 federal agencies to include improper payment information with their initial fy2003 budget materials to omb enactment of the ipia extended improper payment reporting requirements to all executive branch departments and agencies lowered the threshold from 2 billion to 10 million and designated congress as well as omb to receive the annual agency reports

departments and agencies from mitchell daniels may 21 2003 m0313 ipia guidance was subsequently revised and incorporated into appendix c of omb circular a123 crs4 steps to be taken by the agencies first agencies were required to review systematically all their programs and activities and identify those which are susceptible to significant erroneous payments defined as annual erroneous payments in the program exceeding both 25 of the program payments and 10 million second agencies were to determine an annual estimated amount of erroneous payments made in those programs and activities found susceptible to significant errors this calculation was to be based on statistical random sample sufficiently large to yield an estimate with 90 percent confidence interval within 5 precision the third step was to determine why the particular programs were at risk and then put in place plan to reduce the erroneous payments the last step was agency reporting to the president via omb and congress on the estimates of the annual amount of erroneous payments in its programs and activities and on progress in reducing them revision of omb circular a123 in the summer of 2006 omb issued new appendix to omb circular a1237 updating the guidance in m0313 appendix c titled requirements for effective measurement and remediation of improper payments8 contained two parts the first addressed ipia reporting and the second recovery auditing9 it began with new language expanding and clarifying the definition of an improper payment an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under statutory contractual administrative or other legally applicable requirements incorrect amounts are overpayments and underpayments including inappropriate denials of payment or services an improper payment includes any payment that was made to an ineligible recipient or for an ineligible service duplicate payments payments for services not received and payments that are for the incorrect amount in addition when an agencys review is unable to discern whether payment was proper as result of insufficient or lack of documentation this payment must also be considered in error10 other noteworthy features in the update included provisions for alternative sampling methodologies reporting requirements for certain low risk programs and guidance for federal agencies that fund stateadministered programs the revision also contained best practices listing for preventing identifying detecting and recovering improper payments finally while the definition of

requirementsmay still be subject to the annual par reporting requirement this would most likely occur in programs with relatively high annual outlays11 scorecard standards and ratings the bush administration designated eliminating improper payments eip as separate program initiative in the pma in 200412 under the eip initiative which is ongoing 15 federal agencies receive quarterly scorecard ratings from omb for their efforts to identify eliminate and recover improper payments13 the scorecard uses stoplight rating system of green for success yellow for mixed results and red for unsatisfactory agencies are rated against six eip standards for success or core criteria listed below if an agency meets all six of the criteria it receives green rating if it meets the first four criteria but not the fifth and sixth it is rated yellow and if an agency fails to meet any one of the first four criteria it is rated red the criteria an agency must meet to get to green in the eip initiative include the following have risk assessment in place that identifies all programs that are at significant risk of improper payments have an ombapproved plan for measuring improper payments on an annual basis and meet milestones established in the plan have an ombapproved corrective action plan that includes reduction targets be in compliance with improper payments reporting requirements demonstrate that improper payments are being reduced consistent with reduction targets and have established improper payment recovery targets and show it is actively meeting these targets14 11 ibid p 4 an example is given of program with 10 billion in annual outlays and 1 error rate below the 25 error rate threshhold yet resulting in 100 million in improper payments in such an instance omb may require that the program be designated as high risk and included in the agencys annual par as part of ipia reporting 12 see discussion in fiscal year 2006 budget of the us government washington gpo

httpwwwwhitehousegovresultsagendastandardsforsuccess082007pdf crs6 as indicated in figure 1 results in the initial round for the eip scorecards released december 31 2004 indicated that agencies received green five were yellow and 10 were red15 by june 30 2008 the scorecard showed that five agencies were green in status eight agencies were yellow and two were red in three and half years the number of agencies receiving green increased from zero to five and the number of agencies receiving red declined from 10 to two the first agency to attain green was the department of housing and urban development hud on the june 2005 scorecard joined the next quarter by the department of labor the only agency to receive red grades throughout the period depicted was the department of the treasury further examination of the data in figure 1 however discloses more complicated picture for example the first three quarters in fy2007 had the same totals for the red two yellow nine and green four grades yet there were noteworthy changes from the march to june 2007 ratings hhs advanced from red to yellow while dhs slipped from yellow back to red with respect to the most recent scorecards depicted in figure 1 the grades recorded for june 30 2007 and september 30 2007 were identical as were the grades for december 31 2007 and march 31 2008 during the last four quarters hud slipped from green to yellow for december 2007 and march 2008 but had returned to green by june 30 2008 the only other change during this period was the movement of sba from yellow to green one might arguably suggest that many of the agencies 8 out of 15 are experiencing some difficulty in progressing from yellow to green in the scorecards the up and down arrows in figure 1 indicate change in grade from the previous quarter during the 15 quarters covered there were 19 instances where an agencys grade changed from one quarter to the next most of the changes 16 reflect an improvement in rating with the national science foundation nsf jumping from red to green in the final quarter of 2005 hence the double arrows on the other hand there were four instances when an agencys grade was lowered from one quarter to the next the department of veterans affairs va received four yellows followed by four greens and then slipped back to yellow for the last three quarters the small business administration sba started with red advanced to yellow for four quarters and then to green for three quarters but slipped back to yellow for the three quarters before returning to green the dhs went from four reds to six yellows and then for the last five quarters entered in the chart regressed back to red in addition to the current status grades provided in figure 1 omb since 2005 also has given the agencies grade for progress in implementation16 these 15 ibid scorecard december 31 2004 at httpwwwwhitehousegovresultsagenda 200412scorecardpdf 16 since the quarter ending december 31 2004 was the first quarter for which agency efforts in the eliminating improper payments initiative were rated there were progress scores given electronic versions of scorecards for progress in implementation grades are continued crs7 ratings have been predominantly green from the outset for the quarter ending march 31 2005 11 green and four yellow for the quarters ending december 31 2005 and march 31 2006 all agencies included in the scorecard received green except for the department of the treasury17 for the next six quarters either two three or four agencies received yellow grade but the group of agencies not receiving green varied somewhat from quarter to quarter by june 30 2007 there was just one yellow treasury but for the first time an agency dhs received red grade for progress in implementation in the september 2007 scorecard dhs had moved back up to green the only yellow was for treasury the same ratings 14 green and 1 yellow appeared in the december 2007 scorecard by march 2008 two more agencies education and dhs were back in the yellow category and the scorecard for june 30 2008 remained unchanged from the previous quarter it is not clear that how useful scorecard ratings are as indicators of agency results in eliminating improper payments while ombs standards for success overlap with ipia objectives the scorecard ratings themselves do not appear to be tightly linked to improper payments rates or amounts the department of labor dol for example improved from yellow rating at the start of fy2005 to green by the end of that fiscal year even though its error rate increased during that time18 similarly the department of housing and urban development hud received green rating in each quarter of fy2006 despite reporting nearly 15 billion in improper payments that year19 under the present scorecard grading system then an agency may receive the highest rating even when its error rate increases or when the dollar value of its improper payments reaches into the billions as discussed in more detail below an apparent increase in error rate or total amount of improper payments due an agency may actually reflect progress in identifying risk susceptible programs and achieving viable estimates for more programs 16 continued available at httpwwwwhitehousegovresultsagendascorecardhtml 17 the department of the treasury did receive grade of green for progress in implementation for the quarter ending march 31 2005 but subsequently has consistently been rated as yellow 18 omb improving the accuracy and integrity of federal payments january 31 2007

each of the two fiscal years after the governmentwide baseline for improper payments was established in fy2004 then increased in fy2007 in its 2007 report omb suggested that the declining error rate between fy2004 and fy2006 was largely due to two factors reduction in improper payments reported under the medicare feeforservice program and low improper payment rates among the programs that reported for the first time in either fy2005 or fy200621 gao has argued that while improper payments have declined significantly under the feeforservice component of medicare that was not necessarily consequence of improved accountability of program dollars but rather was due largely to refinements in the way hhs calculated the programs improper payments estimate22 20 ombs annual improper payments

senate subcommittee on federal financial management government information federal services and international security continued crs10 the overall error rate increased from 29 in fy2006 to 35 in

31 2008 according to ombs assessment in the january 2008 report the majority of improper payment errors reduced in the last four years resulted from agencies ensuring the availability of supporting documentation necessary to verify benefit accuracy this type of improvement provides greater confidence in the accuracy of federal payments with respect to the remaining payment errors they resulted from challenges when verifying recipient eligibility in meanstested programs while documentation errors generally are not associated with incorrect payments eligibility errors result in beneficiaries receiving an incorrect amount of funds23 amount of improper payments the data in table 1 also show that the dollar amount of the governments improper payments declined in fy2005 and then increased in fy2006 and fy2007 the initial decrease was the result of reductions in improper payments under medicare and the increase in fy2006 was largely due to the 157 billion jump in 22 continued hearings

estimated improper payments under usdas marketing loan assistance program24 in fy2007 the amount of improper payments grew by 144 billion with two newly reported programs accounting for most of the increase medicaid feeforservice 129 billion in improper payments and national school lunch 14 billion in improper payments that the fluctuation of improper payments can be driven by changes in individual programs is indicative of the concentrated nature of the problem in fy2007 for example nine programs accounted for 902 of reported improper payments and just three programs medicare feeforservice medicaid feeforservice and the earned income tax credit accounted for 637 of all reported improper payments that year25 federal outlays the federal outlays data in table 1 represent the amount of risksusceptible dollars for which federal agencies have developed improper payments estimates in fy2007 agencies had estimates in place for approximately 156 trillion out of 185 trillion 84 in total atrisk outlays compared to fy2004 this represents 526 billion increase in risksusceptible expenditures with estimates in place it also indicates however that 16 of atrisk outlays about 292 billion lacked improper payment estimates number of major programs are among those lacking estimates including the state child health insurance program schip temporary assistance for needy families tanf and medicare prescription drug benefit part d in the 2008 report omb noted that delays in reporting error measurement in remaining programs occur because many stateadministered programs are subject to complex regulatory guidelines that need to be followed before conducting error measurements for example agencies need to receive feedback from program recipients about viable alternatives for measuring error consequently development of national and statistically valid error measurement can take months and even years to complete26 until all these programs have estimates however the full extent of the improper payments problem will remain unknown continuing concerns reporting threshold there has been criticism of ombs definition of significant emphasis added improper payments in addition to the 10 million threshold in estimated improper spending established by the statute omb required that the improper payments represent at least 25 of total program payments the chairman and ranking 24 ibid 25 ibid the nine programs that accounted for 902 of fy2007 reported improper payments were medicare feeforservice medicaid feeforservice earned income tax credit unemployment insurance

payments january 31 2008 crs12 minority member of the house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management representative todd platts and representative marsha blackburn sent letter to omb in august 2003 questioning the 25 minimum threshold likewise according to news article senators charles grassley and max baucus then the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate finance committee stated in january 9 2004 letter to then omb director joshua bolten that omb should not have established the 25 threshold and should have simply required that agencies report all programs generating estimated improper payments of more than 10 million the senators reportedly observed that by adding the 25 threshold the improper payments figures that will eventually be reported to the public will look better and feel better than they really are27 according to gao the 25 threshold could mask the extent of the improper payments problem in 2006 report reviewing agency pars from fy2005 gao identified many examples of agency programs with estimated improper payments over 10 million that were not included in the agencys improper payments estimate because they did not meet the 25 threshold28 for example gao said that the department of education did not report on three programs that each had estimated improper payments exceeding 10 million 155 million in total because in each case those payments represented less than 25 of program outlays29 if the 25 criterion were applied to large programs gao concluded billions of dollars in improper payments could go unreported30 omb has defended the 25 threshold stating it was established to ensure that agencies were focusing their resources on programs with the highest levels of risk for improper payments31 as noted above revised ipia guidance issued by omb in 2006 as appendix c to circular a123 addressed this issue to some extent language in the updated version stated explicitly that omb could require large program with relatively high annual outlays but that failed to meet the 25 criteria to be considered as high risk and included in the agencys annual ipia reporting such determination however would be done by omb on casebycase nonmandatory basis the clarification in appendix c arguably thus may be viewed as not going far enough by some in congress who in the past have taken issue with ombs addition of the 25 prerequisite 27 cited by amelia gruber omb defends actions on improper payments govexeccom january 14 2004 28 gao improper payments agencies fiscal year 2005 reporting under the improper payments

for significant improper payments ombs 2006 revised guidance however permits agencies to exempt programs from the annual review requirement which omb refers to as risk assessment for two years if program is determined not to be risk susceptible thus if program were reviewed in 2007 and deemed not at risk then the program would not have to be reviewed again until 201032 at hearing on improper payments held in march 2007 mccoy williams director of financial management and assurance at gao testified that omb had discussed the proposed changes with gao prior to issuing the revised guidance according to the witness we at gao advised omb that the provision to perform risk assessments every 3 years for those programs not deemed risksusceptible was inconsistent with the ipia requirement for agencies to review all programs and activities annually33 ombs exemption from the ipias annual review requirement might exacerbate the consequences of inaccurate risk assessments agencies are still refining their procedures for identifying risksusceptible programs in some cases improvements in risk assessment methods have resulted in programs being designated as risk susceptible that previously had been considered lowrisk the department of agriculture usda for example enhanced its risk assessment methodology in fy2006 and as consequence it determined that four programs were susceptible to significant improper payments that year which had been considered lowrisk the previous year34 usda reported that those four programs had total outlays of 128 billion and had issued combined 804 million in improper payments35 while omb praised the agency for identifying previously undetected improper payments usda could have claimed ombs annual review exemption for the four programs after determining they were lowrisk in fy200536 had it done so usda would not have been required to reassess those programs until fy2008 and hundreds of millions of dollars in improper payments might have gone undetected for another two years in addition the exemption has been applied not just to individual programs but to entire agencies in fy2007 four agencies reported that they did not conduct new 32 ombs guidance would require program to be reassessed if it experienced significant legislative change or major increase in funding even if that assessment would occur less than three years from the last risk assessment 33 testimony of mccoy williams march 29 2007 gao07635t p 6 34 the four programs were direct and countercyclical payments conservation reserve program farm service agency fsa

agencies to establish policies and procedures internal controls that prevent detect and recover overpayments to contractors resulting from payment errors38 omb also requires agencies to report on their recovery auditing efforts in their pars in addition to data on the amount of contracts reviewed the amount of improper payments identified and the amounts recovered agency reporting must include description of recovery audit activities corrective action plan to address the root causes of payment error and description of any management improvement program carried out by the agency omb in turn includes data on agency recovery audit efforts in its annual ipia report the data provided by omb show that since recovery auditing activities began in fy2004 federal agencies have recovered only half of the 1699 billion in improper payments identified for recovery to put it another way the government has yet to recover almost 850 million in erroneous payments to contractors the recovery rate varies widely among the agencies ranging from high of 100 at the environmental protection agency and the department of commerce to low of 05 at the department of homeland security dhs the low recovery rate at dhs is significant as the department has only recovered 24 million out of 5060 million in erroneous payments moreover gao has raised concerns about the quality of recovery efforts to date at dhs and has called for dhs management to increase its oversight and monitoring of recovery auditing efforts across the 37 testimony of mccoy williams gao director of financial management and assurance

payment errors mccoy williams again appeared for gao and daniel werfel acting controller testified for omb45 mr williams indicated that his testimony was based on gao report sent to the subcommittee the previous week 46 and that despite the improvements to date challenges continue with respect to ipia implementation mr williams outlined five specific problems one issue is the comprehensiveness of agencies risk assessments despite the ipia requirement for an annual review of all agency programs that may be susceptible to significant improper payments the review of 2007 pars by gao indicated that not all agencies reported conducting risk assessments some agencies reported that they did not conduct risk assessment of all their programs since omb guidance allows agency programs deemed not risk susceptible to conduct risk assessment generally every three years47 second problem according to gao relates to the inclusiveness of improper payment estimates gao found that estimates have not been developed for all of the programs identified as risksusceptible for improper payments the 55 billion improper payment estimate for fy2007 did not cover 14 programs with fy2007 outlays totaling approximately 170 billion third challenge cited by gao involves ipia noncompliance issues few auditors reported on ipia compliance problems as part of their audits of an agencys fy2007 financial statements according to gao these noncompliance issues related to the key requirements of the act including risk assessments sampling methodologies implementing corrective actions recovering improper payments and inadequate documentation48 another omission in some of the agency reports involved the absence of discussion on possible statutory or regulatory barriers impeding agencies ability to reduce improper payments the fifth problem relates to management challenges in the design or implementation of necessary internal controls which are critical in efforts to identify improper payments and prevent them in the future daniel werfel ombs acting controller also testified at this 2008 senate subcommittee hearing he noted three important trends in the ipia data from fy2004 through fy2007 first agencies are expanding the universe of highrisk 44 continued homeland security timothy b hill chief financial officer centers for medicare and medicaid services and lee white executive vice

disagreement between omb and gao since the addition of appendix c to omb circular a123 in 2006 48 ibid p 14 crs17 programs that are measured each year second agencies are moving forward toward closing all reporting gaps so that the full extent of governmentwide improper payments will be known within few years third after an agency has identified and reported payment errors it is able to implement corrective actions and reduce those errors in subsequent years mr werfel in reviewing these trends stated that after four years of ipia implementation agencies generally have the tools in place to ensure that all high risk activities are identified and measured agencies do not however currently have the full complement of tools they need to eliminate improper payments49 mr werfel then suggested three strategies to address this deficiency first maximize the impact of program integrity dollars in other words concentrate efforts on the higher risk larger dollar amount programs nine programs account for 90 of the fy2007 governmentwide improper payment total second address challenges in eligibility verification such errors accounted for about 80 of total improper payment errors in fy2007 third mr werfel supported enactment of specific program reforms recommended by the administration most recently being reproposed in the presidents fy2009 budget50 there has not been an oversight hearing focused exclusively on the ipia in the house during the 110th congress on june 3 2008 however the subcommittee on government management organization and procurement held hearing titled oversight of federal financial management51 testimony provided by omb reviewed the status of financial reporting governmentwide as well as at the agency level mr werfel then referred to other improvement initiatives including reducing improper payments he praised congress for taking step toward enacting some reforms supported by omb including discretionary funding above the cap for activities with proven track record of reducing error and generating program savings in the fy2009 budget resolution sconres 70 52 legislation to amend the ipia in the 110th congress on the same day as the hearing mentioned above senator tom carper chairman of the subcommittee introduced s 2583 the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 200853 49 testimony of daniel werfel before the

affairs by voice vote ordered that s 2583 with an amendment in the nature of substitute be reported favorably s 2583 as reported would amend the ipia to expand and strengthen ongoing efforts to identify reduce and recover improper payments due the federal government for example the threshhold for agency heads to identify programs as susceptible to significant improper payments would be broadened creating the likelihood that more agencies would have to report on additional programs while the floor for program expenditures subject to recovery auditing would be lowered expanded reporting requirements regarding corrective action to be taken would be placed on the agencies and omb agency inspectors general would be newly tasked with the responsibility of preparing annual compliance reports and these would be included with the annual financial statements timetiered approach for remediation of an agencys noncompliance status would be established ranging from submission of corrective action plan to congress to mandatory submission of reauthorization proposals which if not approved by congress would trigger freeze in level of authorizations s 2583 as reported also would allow the omb director to establish pilot programs on compliance enforcement to test potential accountability mechanisms along with incentives or penalties to ensure statutory compliance with law and ultimately elimination of improper payments in the house companion bill hr 5467 was introduced on february 14 2008 but further action has occurred 53 continued congressional record daily
