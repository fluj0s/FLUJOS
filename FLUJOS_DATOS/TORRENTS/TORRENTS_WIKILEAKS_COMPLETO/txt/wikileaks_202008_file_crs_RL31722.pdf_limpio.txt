divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722individuals with disabilities education act idea and medicaid summary the individuals with disabilities edu cation act idea the centerpiece of federal legislation on educa ting children with disabilitie s is an unusual statute because it not only provides funds to states and school districts but it also guarantees the rights of children with disabilities to free appropriate public education fape idea requires that children with disabilities be provided with special education and related services so that they can benefit from their guaranteed public education for some children benefitting from or even attending school depe nds on healthrelated services for example child depende nt on ventilator for life support could require inschool staff to ensure the pr oper operation of the quipment in order to attend school for such child idea requi res that necessary staff and services be provided while idea mandates special education and related services it is not intended to pay for the total cost of this education and these services one approach congress has taken to ease the burden on states and school districts of fulfilling the requirements of idea is to allow the use of funds available under medicaid federalstate entitlement program providing medical assistance to certain lowincome individuals to finance health services deliv ered to special education students who are enrolled in medicaid however for vari ous possible reasons medicaid funds appear to account for only small proportion of expenditures for special education and related services these reasons include most idea children are not enrolled in medicaid federal privacy re quirements may hinder identif ying which idea children are participating in medicaid inschool health services ma often be of relatively low cost medicaid financial re quirements may reduce reimbur sement to schools and medicaids complexities may make many school distri cts unwilling or unable to access this funding source relatively little is known about the in terrelationship between idea and medicaid thus statebystate study might be useful to cong ress in determining whether to take legislative action pending on the outcome of such study various changes to medicaid could be consid ered to the extent that problems arise because of program complexity improving technical assistance and outreach might be useful to the extent that problems are related to medicaid eligibility expanding medicaid eligibility to cover more children with disabilities could be examined and to the extent that the problem is one of medicaid financing changing some of the rules that may adversely impact local educational agencies leas could be contemplated since some might oppose an changes to medicaid that would result in increased state costs other alternatives might be considered for example creating funding relationship between idea and the state childrens health insurance program schip could be ex amined in add ition federal privacy requirements might be amended to fac ilitate the identification of children with disabilities served under idea who are so enrolled in medicaid finally idea amendments could be considered such as targeting some funding for children with disabilities who require expens ive healthrelated services in order to attend schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722contents v r v i w 1 v r v i w f i d a1 i d n d r l t d m d i c l n d h l t h s r v i c s 3 i d n d m d i c i d 5 overview of medicaid eligibility and services 7 r

those obligations congress has been concerned about th financial burden that children with disabilities can impose on state and local systems of public edu cation b ecause idea requires that certain medical and h ealth services be provided if they are necessary for child with disability to participate in and benefit from public education one approach cong ress has taken to ease the fi nancial burden of serving children with disabilities is to allow use of funds available unde r medicaid federal state entitlement program providing medical assistance to certain lowincome individuals to

services following that discussion the report analyzes possible reasons why medicaid appears to cover relatively little of idea healthrelated costs finally the report outlines possible legislative approaches with respect to medicaid and idea overview of idea idea pl 10517 is an unusual if not unique federal statute in that it is both civil rights statute and grants statute in addition to authorizing funding to provide special education1 and related services for children with disabilities idea requires that stat accepting idea funds and all currently do must ensure certain procedures rights and services for children with disabilities and their parents in general terms these include identifying locating and evaluating all children with disabilities regardless of the severity of th eir disability to determine which children are eligible for special education and related services making available free appropriate public education fape to all children with disabilities generally between the ages of 3 and 21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs2 2 the various types of procedures include an opportunity for parents of child with disability to examine records and participate in meetings and obtain an independent educational evaluation of the child prior written notice of change or refusal to change placement an opportunity for mediation and an opportunity to present complaints for an overview of these and other idea provisions see crs report rl31259 individuals with disabilities education act statut ory provisions and selected issues by nancy lee jones and richard n apling 3 us department of education ed to assure the free appropria public education for all children with disabilities the twentythird annual report to congress on the implementation of the individuals with disabilities education act 2001 table aa2 hereafter cited as ed the twentythird annual report 4 some states distribute stat funds based on estimates of the varying costs for serving children with disabilitiesensuring that each child receiving services has an individual education program iep spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs the parent must be part ner in planning and overseeing the childs special education and related services as member of the iep team educating children with disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate with children who are not disabled and providing procedural safeguards to children with disabilities and their parents including right to due process hearing the right to appeal to federal district cour t and in some cases the right to receive attorneys fees2 in general idea defines child with disability as one who needs special education and related services because of specified disability or disabilities in its definition the act lists series of disabilitie s including mental retardation hearing visual or speech impairments autism specifi c learning disabilities and other health impairments section 602 3 during the 19992000 school year th ere were approx imately 57 million sc hool age children ages 621 served under the idea program across the 50 states the district of columbia dc and puerto rico these children had wide range of mild to severe disabling conditions that qua lified them for idea children identified with specific learning disabilities were by far the largest single category of idea children representing 505 of the total population another 192 had speech and language impairments nearly 11 were mentally retarded and an additional 83 had emotional disturbances the rema inder of the idea population about 11 were classified as having hearing ort hopedic or visual impairments developmental delay autism deafblindness traumatic brain injury other health impairments or multiple disabilities3 although services for children with di sabilities can be quite expensive idea formulas do not distribute gran ts to states based on cost4 instead most idea funds are distributed by formulas based on numbers of children with disabilities total population in the age range served and num ber of children from poor families in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs3 5 the act specifically limits the definition of dical services to those with diagnostic and evaluative purposes only section 60222 ed regulations for idea elaborate on this definition medical services means services provided by licensed physician to determine childs medically related disab ility that results in the childs need for special education and related services 34 cfr 30024b4 the regulations add school health services to the definition of related services and fine these services as those provided by qualified school nurse or other qualifie d person 34 cfr 30024b12 6 cedar rapids community sc hool district v garret f 526 us 66 1999age range serviced in addition while id ea provides for certain procedural rights and services it is discreti onary program its funding is subject to appropriations not mandatory program like medicaid thus by saying that service is required under idea does not mean that idea funds n ecessarily pay for that service rather it means that the state and th school district must provide the service and pay for the service by whatever means available be it idea funds from the federal government state special ducation funds local funds or other federal programs such as medicaid idea and related medical and health services as noted above basic tenet of the id ea is that as condition of accepting idea funds states and leas must provide free appropriate public education fape to children with disabilities guaranteei ng fape involves the provision of special education which must be specifically tailored to the needs of the individual child and related services the latter includes services necessary for children with disabilities to participate in and benefit from special ducation and public education in general and might i nvolve depending on the di sability or disabilities transportation speech therapy psychological services physical therapy interpretive services for example for hearing or visu ally impaired students and healthrelated services idea law and regulations together with court interpretations make an important distinction between medical services which under idea are those that only can be provided by licensed physician and health services which are services provided by other health care providers such as school nurse or physical therapist5 under the fape requirement the state and school districts must only provide medical services to the extent that such services deal with the diagnosis and evaluation of childs disability other services provided by physician need not be paid for by the state or the sc hool district on the other hand health services that are necessary for the child to participate in and benefit from public education must be provided by the state or the school district the supreme court has upheld the dis tinction between medical and health services most recently the court held in cedar rapids community school district v garret f 6 that the school district as part of its obligation to provide fape under idea must provide ongoing school health services to garret f who is dependent on ventilator for life support because maintenance of the ventilator and other health services were not dependent on licensed physician but could be provided by responsible person such as school nurse the court by 7 to 2 majority ruledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs4 7 for further information see crs report rs201 04 cedar rapids community school district v garret f the individuals with disabilities education act and related

table b1 10 ed in its most recent annual report to congress on idea does provide national data on services provided under part c of idea to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families many of these services appear to be health related for example 14 of these infants and toddlers received audiology services7 received nursing services 39 received occupational therapy and 38 received physical therapy in addition many service providers are obviously healthcare professi onals and paraprofessionals such as nurses occupational therapists and physical therapy assistant ed the twentythird annual report table iii13 and table iii15that the services were covered by the finition of related services and must be provided in order that garret f could benefit from fape7 students like garret f can pose substantia l financial burdens on school districts justice thomas in his dissenting opinion in garret f noted that the school district would have to hire an additional employ ee to provide the onetoone care garret f requires which will cost minimum of 18000 per year8 unfortunately there are current data on the overall amount leas spend on providing medical and health services to children with disabilities under idea expenditures for related services of which medical and health services pres umably account for significant share are substantial for example expenditures for staff providing related services for school age children with disabilities under id ea are estimated at about 75 billion9 currently there are good data on the ty pes of health service needs of school aged children served under idea10 however some studies do provide glimpse into the health service needs of children with disabilities unfortunately varying definitions of what constitutes disability make it difficult to apply the findings directly to the idea population elaine maag in study of the supportive health services needs of children with disabilities provides some useful data on the nature of these needs rather than the categor ical definition of child with disability under idea her definition wa s based on limitations in func tioning in one or more of the following areas mobility selfcare communication and learning in addition although she included children w ith mild moderate and severe limitations in mobility and selfcare she excluded children with mild communication or learning limitations based on this definition she pr esented data representing an estimated population of nearly 4 million children with disabilities ages 5 to 17 maag points out that supportive health services tend to be ongoing services and also tend to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs5 11 elaine maag supportive health services needs of children with disabilities p 2 obtained from httpaspehhsgovdaltcpreportssuphsndhtm hereafter cited as maag health services needs this study was based on data from the 1994 and 1995 waves of the national health interview survey nhis 12 recall that under idea medical services has special meaning ie services provided by licensed physician this limited definition of medical services can cause confusion in broader discussion of health care financing in which medical services might be provided by other professionals or even by paraprofessionals 13 for further information on medicaid see crs report rs20245 medicaid fact sheet by jean hearneunique to children with disa bilities as opposed to more traditional health services such as prescription drugs annua l doctor visits or emergency care11 based on population of children with di sabilities ages 5 to 17 that excludes some more mildly disabled individuals maag estimated that about 40 of this population receives some type of supportive health service most prevalent among these services are communication services such as speech therapy received by an estimated 15 million next most prevalent ar therapeutic services such as physical and occupational therapy about 850000 recipien ts followed by family services for example respite care about 700000 daily living services perhaps provided by personal care attendant about 500000 nd medical services12 such as nursing services about 200000 many of these supportive health services are provided in the school as well as at home and elsewhere otherwise child with disability could not attend sc hool and could not benefit from public education for example paraplegic child in order to attend school might need persona l attendant to cope with daily living requirements such as personal hygiene nd biological functions under the fape requirement of idea the school would be required to provide such support idea and medicaid congress has been concerned about th financial burden that children with disabilities can impose on state and local sy stems of public education one approach congress has used to attempt to ease this burden is to authorize the use of funds under medicaid federalstat entitlement program providi ng medical assistance to certain lowincome individuals to finance health services delivered to special education students who are elig ible for medicaid coverage13 prior to 1988 medicaid did not pay for coverable services that were listed in childs iep since special education funds were availabl to pay for these services and because generally with few explicit exceptions medicaid is always the payer of last resort congress changed this connection between idea and medicaid in 1988 section 411k13 of the medicare catastrophic covera ge act of 1988 pl 100360 amended medicaid title xix of the social secu rity act at section 1903 as follows c nothing in this title shall be cons trued as prohibiting or restricting or authorizing the secretary to prohibit or restrict payment under subsection for medical assistance for covered services furnished to child with disabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs6 14 the 1997 idea amendments redesignated part h as part c the

agency was called the health care financing administration or hc fa in this report we use both abbreviations cms and hcfa as appropriate 17 section 612a12a the committee reports accompanying the 1997 idea amendments pl 10517 elaborated on th relationship between medicaid and idea the committee places particular emphasis in the bill on the relationship between schools and the state medicaid agency in order to clarify that health services provided to children with disabilities w ho are medicaideligible and meet the standards applicable to medicaid are not disqualified for reimbursement by medicaid agencies because they are prov ided services in school context in accordance with the childs iep srept 10517 p 12 hrept 10595 p 92 18 34 cfr 300142a1because such services are included in the childs individualized education program established pursuant to part b of the individuals with disabilities education act or furnished to an infant or toddler with disability because such services are included in the childs individualized family service plan adopted pursuant to part h of such act14 officials from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms15 the federal agency that administers the medicaid program16 have interpreted this provision to allow but not require state dicaid agencies to pay for such services according to these officials most states have elected to do so idea requires states to establish interagency agreements to ensure that idea eligible students receive the serv ices to which they are entitled such agreement or mechanism shall include the following i agency financial responsibility an identification of or method for defining the financial res ponsibility of each agency for providing services described in subparagraph bi to ensure free appropriate public education to children with disabilities provided that the financial responsibility of each public agency described in subparagraph b including the state medicaid agency and other public insurers of children with disabilities shall precede the financial responsibility of the local educational agency or the state agency responsible for developing the childs iep17 thus for disabled child who is rolled in both idea and medicaid when necessary services are covered by state medicaid program the financial responsibility of the state medicaid agency and other public insurers of children with disabilities must precede the financial responsibility of the school district or the state agency responsible fo r developing the childs iep18 given cmss interpretation of the 1988 amendment to dicaid law this idea requirement thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs7 19 see seep what are we spending table b1 the estimates in this study are based on stratified random sample designed to genera lize to all students with disabilities in the 50 states and the district of columbia about 40 of th responding leas reported recovering any payments from medicaid this amount so represents small proportion of medicaid funding for schoolage children ages 618 in general which is about 18 billion according to the most recent data fy1999 thus medicaid funding for schoolbased medical and health services for children with disabilities may represent less than 4 of all funding for eligible schoolage childrenmedicaid be the first payer would apply only to those states that have elected to pay for services listed in ieps recent evidence suggests that medicaid currently pays small proportion of the overall excess cost of providing special ducation and related services to children with disabilities ie thos expenditures over and above the costs for educating children without disabilities recen t national study for school year 19992000 indicated that medicaid pr ovided about 648 million for services to children with disabilities representing bout 18 of the estimated dditional expenditure of 36 billion to provide special education and related services for such children19 overview of medicaid igibility and services in order to explore the interrelation ship between idea and medicaid and to assess why medicaid appears to pay for relatively small proportion of the cost of servicing idea children it is first necessary to discuss some of the complexities of medicaid with respect to eligibility and services for children relevance of medicaid bene fits for idea children although as noted above there are some data on healthrel ated services provided to children with disabilities studies have been publis hed describing the medical and support service needs of schoolage idea child ren in order to understand medicaids potential role in supporting ligible idea children in sc hool one must make best guess of their service needs defined fro m medicaid perspective based on what is known about their disabling conditions and what is known about the services used by disabled children in general generally medicaid finances compre hensive array of both mandatory and optional medical and health related services but it doe s not cover all the supportive services that many idea children may need while in school most notably medicaid probably has little to offer those children with learning disabilities who represent about onehalf of the idea population dicaid does not cover the kinds of special educational services that many of th children require during the school day on the other hand medicaid does cover hea lth services that are necessary for other children with disabilities to benef it from free appropria public education for the purposes of idea the most relevant medicaid benefit is the early and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt program this program provides screening and preventive care to n early all groups of dicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21 as well as services n ecessary to correct health problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs8 20 hcfa medicaid guide p 10 21 with respect to financial eligibility criteria for medicaid both earned and unearned income are considered for some eligibility categories assets eg savings acc ounts savings bonds may also be taken into account states may base eligibility on gross income and assets but in most cases they apply what are known as income and asset disregards that is for certain categories of income sp ecific amounts may be disregarded or ignored in determining financial eligibility the effe ct of these counting methods is to allow individuals with gross income and assets abov the stated standards to qualify for medicaididentified through screening that is with the exception to eligibility discussed below states are required to provide all federallyallowed treatment to correct identified problems even if the specific treatment needed is not otherwise covered under the states medicaid plan for exam ple according to hcfa guide if the state does not cover an optional service under its medicaid state plan such as occupational therapy the state would have to make medical assistance available for the service when furnished to child eligible for epsdt if occupational therapy is medically necessary20 in addition to epsdt medicaid covers number of other services relevant to idea children with wide range of disabilities durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs ventilators and prosthetic devices are also available through medicaid medicaid covers the therapy services that may be needed by children with orthopedic impairments and speech disorders it also cove rs visionrelated screening and diagnostic services and will pay for eyeglasses for children with visual impairments children with hearing disorders may receive audiology services and hearing aides for idea children with developmental disabilities emotional disturbances and those who are mentally retarded certain nonmedical supportive services such as psychosocial rehabilitation and personal care services eg assistance with daily activities and some medical services when appropriate provided by professional attendant may be covered under special medicaid waiver programs other relevant services include psychologist and social worker services prescribed drugs and transportation medicaids eligibility rules for children although medicaid may pay for coverable medical healt h and support services that children with disabilities need to attend and benefit from school idea children must meet specific financial21 and nonfinancial eligibility rules which vary widely from state to state in order to receive these services in addition ther are alternative routes for determining medicaid eligibility which influence the health services that are available the complexity of medicaids eligibility rules together with the difficulty educational agencies experience in navigating these rule s are likely to be primary reasons why medicaid covers only portion of ideare lated costs for schoolage children in addition as discussed below some studi suggest that only about onefourth of idea children are enrolled in medicaid most likely due in large part to medicaids financial restrictions eligibility for standard medicaid services in analyzing the eligibility pathways into medicaid for children who qualify for idea services it is important to consider medicaid eligibility groups that specifically target the disabled living

also medicaid heshe must be under 18 and have medica lly determinable physical or mental impairment which results in marked and severe functional limitations and which can be expected to result in

waiver programs states may use medical and nursing needs as well as functional assessments in determining eligibility for hcbs functional measures may include for example the need for assistance with eatingdrinking toileting mobility and medication management andor the presence of cognitive impairments or behavioral problems to qualify for hcbs waivers an applicant may be required to display

cover relatively little of idea heal threlated costs as noted above recent data indicate that medicaid covers only small share of the excess cost for providing special education and related services for children with disabilities although data limitations prevent definitive determination of medicaids limited role with respect to idea possible reasons include many idea children may not be eligible for medicaid leas may not be identifying all idea children who are enrolled in medicaid the inschool services covered by medicaid for idea children may be relatively low cost certain medicaid financial re quirements may reduce medicaid reimbursements for leas and medicaids billing procedures are complex and as result manyleas may be unwilling or unable to access this funding source many children with disabilities may not be eligible for medicaid although there is current direct inform ation on the number of idea children who are eligible for medicaid it is likely that most are not eligible and that is one reason medicaid does not cover more idearelated health care costs the most recent idearelevant national data are from an sri study for school year 19851986 for children ages 13 to 21 in special educa tion which reported that about 22 were covered by medicaid or by similar coverage 31 there are more recent idea specific data in part because different fe deral agencies collect different types of survey data about medicaid recipients and about childre n with disabilities served by idea among other difficulties these agencies use different definitions of who is

medicaid agency cannot submit list of beneficiarie s to other agencies but leas can obtain information on which school children are dually covered under idea and medicaid in one of two ways states have estab lished automated data systems for certified medicaid providers leas that are certified medicaid providers can access online confidential medicaid eligibility files to determine which idea children are enrolled in medicaid by entering childs full name date of birth andor social security number for example and for other information pertinent to billing eg to determine scope of covered benef its for child if this automated option is unavailable to an lea medicaid agencies may compare list of all children compiled by an education agency against medicaid files and in retu rn provide informati on concerning which children on the education agencys list are already enrolled in medicaid the lea can then identify those children enrolled in medicaid who are also served by idea some medicaid agencies and school systems have taken additiona l steps to resolve confidentiality requirements for example some medicaid agencies have modified application forms to obtain pa rental consent to release in formation eg information regarding education records necessary for claiming medicaid reimbursement for healthrelated educatio nal services in other stat some schools seek parental permission to bill medicaid for special education students which in turn permits information sharing41 computer matching of ducation and medicaid records would assist leas in obtaining medicaid reimbursements for children who are covered under both idea and medicaid but this strategy would not resolve the problem that some idea children may be eligible but not enrolled in medicaid such children will not be included in medicaid eligibility files other outreach and enrollment facilitation strategies would be required to address this circumstance many medicaid inschool rvices may be

could help explain the small contribution medicaid makes to ideas ex cess cost even if true however it is important to remember that healthrelated services for some children with disabilities for example garrett f discussed above ar substantial medicaid financing issues ma reduce lea reimbursements two medicaid financing issues may affect leas ability to b ill medicaid and may contribute to the trend in limited medicaid spending for idearelated services medicaids third party liab ility rules and financial rrangements under medicaid managed care one issue is medicaids thirdparty lia bility rules when private insurance is available to cover idearelated service costs idea regulations permit the use of private insurance for faperequired serv ices however parents fully informed consent must be obtained and that cons ent must be obtained each time private insurance is to be accessed43 comments accompanying the final idea regulations explain the need for fully informed parental consent parents who permit use of their private insurance often experience unanticipated financial consequences consent must fully inform parents that they could incur financial consequences from the use of their private insurance in addition parents need to be informed that their refusal to permit public agency to access their private insurance does not relieve the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at cost to the parents44 at the same time there are specific thirdparty liability rules under medicaid that can complicate the financing of school based services to idea children with both medicaid and private insurance coverage there are official data showinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs21 45 preliminary data for fy1999

idea services 47 medicaid and school health technical assistance guide aug 1997how many medicaid children are also covered by private insurance but the likelihood of such dual coverage increases with family income when private insurance is available medicaid must pay only the remainder of allowable costs for coverable services after othe r third party coverage such as employerbased insurance has been taken into account even when such insurance actually pays nothing however under idea leas cannot require parents with privat family coverage to use that coverage to pay for iep services required in school the implications of these seemingly conflicting program policies is that leas may be caught in the middle and could end up paying the portio n of costs that medicaid cannot cover given its third party liability rules the second financing issue concerns medicaid managed care and how these arrangements may affect the availability of medicaid payments to schools for idea related services under medicaid managed care state medicaid agencies contract with managed care organizations mcos for example blue crossblue shield kaiser foundation health pla n humana family health plan to provide specified set of benefits to enrolled beneficiaries these mcos are frequently reimbursed on the basis of predetermined monthly fee called capitation rate for each enrolled medicaid beneficiary in fy1998 the late st available data of the roughly 183 million medicaid children nearly 57 were enrolled in prepaid health plans and medicaid managed care has continued to grow since that time45 contracted benefits may include the services required by idea children to benefit from public education when an idea child is eligible for medicaid and enrolled in medicaid managed care plan control over the delivery of thos services and hence reimbursement for those services may fall to either the lea or the health plan depending on the terms of any contractual relations hip between the lea and the mco when an lea is not in the provider network of the mco medicaid reimburseme nt for idearelated services provided by the lea may not be available46 while there is federal requirement that states establish relationships between leas and managed care organizations hcfa now cms has encouraged states to promote such relationships the policy go is to insure that the provision of medicaid covered services can be coordi nated between schools and mcos so that children receive necessary care and such care is not duplicate d for example to achieve this goal some state laws re quire such coordination eg mcos must include leas in their provider networ ks and reimburse them for schoolbased services other states exclude schoolbased services from managed care

qualified medicaid provider more generally with the exce ption of the iep requirement these same conditions must be met by all other medicaid providers such as hospitals seeking medicaid payments for schoolbased servi ces delivered to any medicaidenrolled child however other medicaid providers are likely to have considerably more experience with medicaids and other in surers processes and procedures for successfully claiming reimburse ment ensuring that these conditions are met is more daunting prospect for leas that otherwise seldom if ever interact with health insurers including medicaid48 while congress has authorized the use of medicaid funds for covered health services for eligible children with disabilities and hcfa encouraged the establishment of relationships between the program and schools hcfa pointed out that there are however challenges in the collaboration between the medicaid program and the schools federal medicaid requirements are complex and the implementation of medicaid varies by state because many schools are unaccustomed to these requirements and the complexity of operating in the medical services world understanding and negotiating medicaid in order to receive reimbursement often has the effect of placing considerable administrative burden on schools49 the wide variability among state medicaid programs makes it difficult if not impossible for the federal government to provide uniform guidance to leas on how to participate in this program alt hough hcfa has published lengthy guide on medicaid for schools50 the guide frequently advises schools and school districts to seek assistance from their st ate medicaid office because of the variability in state programs selected legislative approaches faced with growing budget deficits many states reduced medicaid spending in both state fiscal year 2002 nd the current stat fiscal year 2003 further reductions in 2003 and 2004 could be on the horizon for some states this state fiscal situation creates difficult environmen t for proposals that could l ead to increased medicaid costs for states nonetheless there is continuing interest in approaches that would

continue to pursue its present cour of increasing idea fundingdisabilities if congress desires to incr ease medicaid funding for this group various changes to the program might be considered to the extent that the problem is seen as one of program complexity improved technical assistance and outreach could be considered to the extent that the problem is seen as one of eligibility expanding medicaid eligibility to cover more children with disabilities could be contemplated and to the extent that the problem is s een as one of medicaid financing changes could be made to some of the rules

be considered as another potential means of financing the healthrelated costs for children with disabilities policy changes to schip in addition to changes in medicaid could increase the funding ava

work on creating regulation to ban contingency fee arrangements in accessing medicaid funds to pay for schoolbased health serviceswere made inappropriately52 why did this happen some of these problems may stem at least in part from leas l ack of understanding about medicaids reimbursement rules which are likely to be particularly incomprehensible to institutions that are in the business of ducation not medical care also for some leas the administrative resources necessary to regularly successfully and appropriately bill medicaid may be limited to facilitate schools participation in medicaid on behalf of idea children new policies to remedy some of these problem s may be helpful for example state medicaid agencies could be required or encouraged thr ough higher federal matching rates for example53 to provide direct outreach and technical assistance to state and local educational agencies another strategy to facilitate coordination between idea and medicaid which was included in the presidents fy2003 b udget proposal is that cms will complete and publish gu idance for schoolbas ed administrative claiming medical service claiming and claiming reimbursement for transportation services54 policies such as these could help leas make increased use of medicaid to finance additional idearelated costs bu t these types of indirect policy changes may not substantially reduce the overall hea lth carerelated fina ncial burden on state and local education agencies for special education students extending medicaid eligib ility to add itional idea children is more direct strategy for providing financial relief to these education agencies it is likely that some perhaps many sp ecial education students in higher income families do not qualify for dicaid under current law although there are reliable data that indicate the proportion of idea children currently eligible for medicaid as noted earlier as many as threefourths of children in special education are not enrolled in the program given the lack of detailed information on family income in particular this enrollment level may be appropriate in addition during this time of fiscal stress states may not be interested in further medicaid eligibility expansions however idea children especi ally those with intensive service needs may be costly for some schools to serv and may otherwise create

ambulatory servi ces and tbrelated drugsfinancial hardships for their families ther have been some legislative proposals to extend medicaid coverage to such children the bill that received the most attention in the 107th congress was the family opportunity act foa of 2001 s 321 and hr 600 introduced in the house and senate in early 2001 on september 9 2002 substitute version of the senate bill was reported out of the nate committee on finance nd was placed on the senate legislative calendar further action was taken the key provision in this bill would add new optional eligibility group for disabled children to the medicaid statute the new group would include ch ildren under 18 years of age who meet the disability definition for children under th supplemental security income ssi program and whose family in come is above the financia l standards for ssi but not more than 250 of the fpl states w ould be permitted to exceed the 250 fpl maximum but federal financial participati on would not be available for coverage of disabled children in families with income bove that level wh ile the income level under foa would potentially reach more idea children the ssi definition of disability differs from the disability defi nition under idea which could make some idea children ineligible under foa spite the higher income standard more inclusive and targeted approach might be to create new categorical group under medicaid comprised of idea ch ildren who are not otherwise eligible for the program coverage of this new group could be made ma ndatory or optional for states and could include an income standard eg idea children living in families with income at or below 300 of fpl some members of congress and some state legislatures might be reluctan t to support such proposal since it would create new eligibility group that may incl ude some highcost individuals all of whom would be entitled to the full range of covered medicaid benefits to address such concerns legislation creating such new categorical group could also limit covered benefits to schoolbased idearelated h ealth and medical services55 finally our analysis identified two medi caid financing issues that may reduce lea reimbursements medicaids third party liability rules when private insurance is available to cover idea related service costs and financial arrangements under medicaid managed care an exemption to medicaids third party liability rules could be established in the case of lea s billing for schoolbased medicaid services delivered to idea children enrolled in medi caid who also have private insurance or other third party liability coverage under idea rules schools cannot require families to use their private insurance when available to cover the cost of idea related services but dicaid law requires that dicaid pay only the net amount applicable after other available third part coverage is considered even when such coverage pays nothing with an exemp tion to current medicaid law leas could receive the full amount of allowable paymen ts for medicaid covered services rather than the net amount applicable after other third party coverage is taken into

such an exemption for leas only may be viewed as unfair to other medicaid providers that deliver sc hoolbased services to idea children in addition state medicaid agencies c ould be required to establish explicit relationships between medi caid managed care organizations and leas for the purpose of providing schoolbased idearelate d services to meet this requirement states could be given severa l options such as 1 require mcos to include leas in their provider networks and reimburse such leas for schoolbased services delivered to idea children enrolled in these medicaid managed care plans 2 exclude idea related services from mco contracts eliminating possi ble service duplication and facilitating leas access to medicaid reim bursement outside the managed care context andor 3 devise an alternative plan which must be approved by the secretary of hhs to establish explicit re lationships between mcos and leas states may choose different options for mcos rving different geographic regions and medicaid populations state medicaid agencies would need to inform education agencies of these decisions and leas wishing to receive medicaid payments would need to work within the rules established for their region as well changes to schip and idea another potential means of financing the healthrelated costs of special education students is through the state childrens health insurance program schip56 schip allows states to cover uninsured children under age 19 in families with income s that are above applicable medicaid financial standards as of fy2001 the upper income eligibility limit under schip had reached 350 of the fpl in one state nearly onehalf 24 of the states and the district of columbia had established upper income limits at 200 of the fpl another 13 states exceeded 200 of the fpl the remaining 14 states set maximum income limits below 200 of the fpl states may choose from among three be nefit options when designing their schip programs they may expand medicaid create new separate state insurance program that must met minimum benefit requirements or devise combination of both approaches all 50 st ates the district of columbia and five territories have schip programs in ope ration as of early 2002 21 are medicaid expansions 16 are separate state progra ms and 19 use combination approach approximately 46 million child ren were enrolled in schip during fy2001 over 34 million were served by separate state schip pr ograms and 12 million were enrolled in schip medicaid expansions states implementing medicaid expansi ons under schip create new optional coverage group under medicaid such dicaid expansions must provide all mandatory medicaid benefits and covered optional services to these schip children but payments for services provided to medicaid expansion children under schip are matched at higher fe deral matching rate57 in addition the nominal costsharinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs27 57 continued under schip ranges from 65 to 83 across states in both programs these matching rates are set such that states with lower per cap ita incomes receive the higher federal matching rates and vise versa for states w ith higher per capita incomesrules under medicaid apply to medicaid expa nsions under schip most importantly the funding relationship between idea and medicaid describe d above applies to medicaid expansions under schip in contrast there is nothing in the schi p statute or regulations that establishes funding relationship between the idea program and separate state schip programs to establish such relations hip both the schip and idea statute would need to be amended such amendments c ould be modeled after that used to create the funding link between medicaid and id ea schip and idea funding link could be made mandatory or optional for states with respect to idea two schip benefit issues are important to highlight first guaranteed access to all federally allowed medically nece ssary treatment under the epsdt provision in medicaid does not apply to separate schip programs second existing benefits unde r separate schip programs may not include relevant schoolbased services required by id ea children there are recent data delineating the specific benefits covered and limits applied to those benefits under schip adding an epsdtlike mandate to schip is likely to receive limited political support however adding an op tional benefit specifically for schoolbased idearelated services could be considered ferpa amendment changes to ferpa might be considered so that limitations on releasing edu cational records does not prevent or inhibit school districts and state departme nts of education from sharing data on the status of children with disabilities with medicaid agenci as noted above this act restricts entities receiving federa l funds from releasing educational records except to parents and students and under other specified circum stances except in specified cases the permission of the parent or of the stude nt must be obtained to release records examples of exceptions are re lease of records to another school district to which student is transferring and release of information in connection with students application for financial aid from time to time congress amends ferpa to take into account reasonable need to share st udent information for example in 1992 congress excluded from the definition of educational records law enforcement records kept by law enforcement unit s uch as the campus police attached to an educational agency or institution thus such records can be shared with another law enforcement agency for ex ample without permission in addition ferpa could be amended to permit school districts or state educational agencies to share educational records with the state medicaid agency for the purpose of identifying children with disabilities who are eligible for medicaid idea funding changes to idea might also be considered one approach to relieve the financial bur den on states and school dist ricts for providing special education and related rvices including the costs of health services is to increase federal funding for idea and the cong ress has been doing this since fy1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31722crs28 funding for schoolage children with disa bilities under idea has more than tripled from 23 billion to 75 billion for fy20 02 in add ition the president has requested an additional 1 billion in f unding for fy2003 finally some members have advocated fully funding idea by providing states their maximum authorized grants under the act this would currently require more than an 11 billion increase to approximately 188 billion for fy2003 in addition to increases in overall f unding congress might consider setting aside or requiring states to set aside funds for leas facing extremely high special education costs for example as the lea faced in the garret f case discussed above one difficulty in this approach is determining which childrens costs would be considered and how much funding would be required one approach that congress has considered and enacted deals with certain leas educating children of parent s in the military as supplement to funding under the impact aid program the floyd d spen ce national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106398 section 363 au thorized the secretary of defense to make payments on behalf of certain children with severe disabilities the determination of severity is based on the cost of child s educationa l and related services if the lea is paying for serv ices by another provider for example private school placement the cost must be five times the national or state average per pupil expenditure whichever is lower if the lea serves the child directly the cost must be at least three times the stat average per pupil expenditure payments would be determined after ta king into account state idea and other funds for the childs education nd related services
