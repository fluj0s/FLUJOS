administration in the department of commerce the department of the treasury the department of health and human services and the department of agriculture would have been transferred to the commerce department which currently administers the programs of the economic development administration under the administrations fy2006 proposal the department of commerce would have administered core program and bonus program the bonus program would have awarded additional funds to communities that demonstrated efforts to improve economic conditions the fy2006 saci proposal would have reduced total funding for the 18 programs from 56 billion in fy2005 to 37 billion in fy2006 congress rejected the administrations budget proposal and funded all 18 programs at total level of 53 billion although an outline of the proposal was included in the administrations fy2006 budget documents the administration did not submit legislative proposal during the first session of the 109th congress instead after facing significant opposition an advisory group was established within the department of commerce to assist the secretary in developing detailed legislative proposal the administrations fy2007 budget

consolidating at least 18 existing community and economic development programs1 into twopart strengthening americas communities initiative the proposed base program would award funds in support of job creation and economic development according to administration documents the core program would use such factors as job loss unemployment and poverty as criteria when determining eligibility2 bonus

economic conditions as of this writing the administration has not proposed new legislative authority for this initiative nor has it released such details as the following eligible recipients method of distributing funds requirements for matching funds or leveraging 1 the administrations budget documents identify 18 programs to be included in the consolidation proposal they include several programs under single program or agency heading instead of identifying specific programs distinguishing these smaller setasides from the core programs would yield 23 rather than 18 programs proposed for consolidation for instance the administration does not identify separately the four programs administered by the economic development administration that are proposed for consolidation but groups all of these programs under the agency the administration only includes funding for the neighborhood initiative grants and economic development initiative grants both congressional earmarks when calculating the amount of cdbg set aside funds that would be consolidated under its proposal it does not include fy2005 funding for all remaining cdbg setasides or earmarks these include housing

existing programs to the new program in proposing the consolidation of various community development community service and economic development programs the administration contends the following about the programs whose activities would be consolidated they have been judged to be ineffective to be unable to demonstrate results or to duplicate the efforts of other programs they have unclear longterm objectives and are not focused on long term community outcomes and they include many communities that longer need the assistance undermining the purpose of some programs to help distressed communities using the community development block grant cdbg program to illustrate the point the administration contends that 38 of the programs funds currently are allocated to communities and states with poverty rates below the national average this contention has drawn criticism from observers of the cdbg program they argue that using the national poverty rates as basis for comparison masks the community development needs of jurisdictions that have significant pockets of poverty and urban blight even though their poverty rates may be less than the national average4 when challenging the administrations assertion concerning the lack of need among such communities supporters of the program could note that when congress designed the cdbg program and its grant allocation criteria and formula the intent was to award funds to states and communities based on such objective measures as the state or communitys relative share of poverty housing overcrowding aged housing stock and population growth rates thus states and communities with relatively greater community development needs as measured by the formula factors arguably receive greater percentage of funds per capita than communities with lesser community development needs moreover cdbg supporters also note that congress requires each state and entitlement community to allocate at least 70 of its funds to activities benefitting low and moderateincome persons5 2005 study conducted by hud on the effects of the 2000 census on the allocation of cdbg funds noted that although funding anomalies exist in general the formula still provides more dollars per capita to needier communities than to less 4 us congress house committee on government reform subcommittee on federalism and the census strengthening americas

per capita cdbg allocation was four times greater than for the 10 of communities with the least need in addition the hud study proposed several optional formulas intend to fine tune the programs targeting of funds7 fy2007 budget proposal the administrations fy2007 budget request includes revamped strengthening americas communities initiative saci proposal the administration has requested 336 billion in fy2007 funding for its revamped saci but has yet to introduce formal legislative proposal this revamped saci proposal would include 3032 billion for the formula portion of the cdbg program including 574 million for indian tribes and 3272 million for economic development administration eda assistance including 29 million for eda salaries and expenses the 336 billion in requested appropriations is approximately 2 billion less than the 53 billion in aggregate fy2006 appropriations for the 18 programs the administration sought to eliminate the fy2007 proposal would reduce funding for cdbg from 3770 billion including 594 million for indian tribes for fy2006 to 3032 billion including 57 million for indian tribes this is 738 million less than appropriated in fy2006 for these two components of the cdbg program which is 20 funding reduction the 3032 billion in proposed appropriations would also represent 12 billion funding reduction when measured against the seven programs administered by hud that would be eliminated under the presidents proposal the administration has indicated that it will seek to introduce legislation that would accomplish the following

began using its program assessment rating tool part to evaluate the effectiveness of federal programs8 according to the administration it subjected 607 programs to the part review process and found that 33 of those programs received score of ineffective or results not demonstrated the administrations part process is not without its critics while some observers view the part as an extension of the government performance and results act gpra designed to ensure that activities of federal agencies have measurable outcomes critics of the part view it as political tool that shifts power from congress to the president some critics of the part also ask whether programs are reviewed in consistent and valueneutral way omb watch for instance contends that the fy2006 part outcomes are biased against programs that operate through grants whether competitive grants or block grants9 of the programs rated ineffective and zeroed out completely adds omb watch 89 are competitive or block grants10 according to the administration of the 607 programs in fy2006 subject to its part review the eight programs listed in table 1 below were among those proposed for consolidation in the administrations strengthening americas communities initiative11 three of the eight programs were rated moderately effective or adequate whereas the remaining five were judged as ineffective or results not demonstrated for fy2006 critics noted that 10 of the programs included in the administrations proposal were not subject to part review conversely the administration may claim that the programs that have been reviewed constitute more than 90 of the total fy2005 funding level for the programs included in the administrations fy2006 proposal for fy2007 six of the 18 programs underwent part assessment with only two national community development initiative and economic development administration programs judged as moderately effective the remaining programs including cdbgs were judged as

function according to the managers statement in the accompanying conference report the increase is to maintain economic and community development programs such as cdbg at fy2005 levels the conference report also noted that the budget resolution assumed an increase of 06 billion above the president request to fund the community services block grant at its 2005 funding level it should be noted that

administrations consolidation proposal witnesses included administration officials from the department of housing and urban development the office of management and budget and the department of commerce and officials from organizations representing local governments13 administration witnesses testified that the fragmented nature of the 18 programs reduces coordination encourages duplication and may provide assistance to communities that have sufficient resources and modest needs at the expensive of communities with the greatest needs it was also mentioned that most of the approximately 1100 communities currently eligible for cdbg would be eligible under the proposed base 13 organizations representing the views of local officials included us conference of mayors national association of counties national league of cities and national community development association crs8 and bonus programs with the aim of graduating the wealthiest communities from the program noting that the proposal was work in progress the witnesses for the administration outlined broad concepts that could be important components of its proposal one witness noted that the march 1 2005 federal register includes notice concerning the formation of an advisory panel to assist in the development of formal legislative proposal witnesses representing the interests of local governments voiced unanimous opposition to the administrations proposal among concerns they raised during the hearings was the lack of consultation by the office of management and budget in the development of the proposal they were briefed on the proposal after it had been developed representatives of local governments also objected to the following transferring of the community development function to the department of commerce particularly from the department of housing and urban development whose cdbg component represents 74 of the funds that would be terminated under the new program reducing program funding and narrowing the focus of the new program to economic development and job creation at the expense of the wider mission of the cdbg program in addition witnesses objected to the administrations contention that some percentage of communities currently eligible for cdbg should be removed as grant recipients because their poverty rates are below the national average they countered that using the national poverty rate as basis for comparison does not recognize that communities whose poverty rates fall below the national average may have substantial pockets of poverty according to the census bureaus poverty estimates for 2000 the national poverty rate was 124 excluding the population living in institutions college dormitories and other group quarters if the 2000 national poverty rate were used as qualifying threshold for eligibility 18 states and puerto rico 35 urban counties and approximately 541 entitlement cities would be eligible14 the 576 entitlement cities and urban counties whose

poverty rate as threshold for eligibility would result in approximately half of the current cdbgeligible communities qualifying for the new program it should be noted that the administration has stated that poverty is but one factor that will be considered in determining program eligibility and that other criteria such as unemployment and income may be used as eligibility criteria allowing additional communities to qualify for the new program administration advisory group to assist the administration in developing detailed legislative proposal the secretary of commerce established the strengthening americas communities advisory committee sacac15 the 17member sacac is composed of individuals from state and local governments the private sector nonprofit organizations and research institutions and is slated to be in existence for two years several national organizations representing state and local governments and community development organizations who opposed the saci did not submit nominations for the sacac in protest of the administrations proposal the sacac submitted an initial report to the secretary in july 2005 after conducting several field hearings and undertaking review of current federal policies though the sacac offered specific legislative proposal its report chronicled the evolution of federal economic development policy challenged the existing paradigms that buttress federal economic and community development programs and outlined guiding principles and recommendations to be considered by the secretary of commerce in developing detailed legislative proposal for the saci among the recommendations included in the report16 are the following establish regional competitiveness as the overriding goal of federal economic and community development policies coordinate and consolidate workforce development programs with economic development initiatives direct federal economic and community development assistance to encourage communities to form regional alliances based on economic relationships rather than political boundaries target federal economic and community development resources to communities and regions with the greatest need

progress and quantify performance outcomes current distribution of funds proposed for consolidation when the administration first introduced its saci as part of its fy2006 budget request the fy2005 aggregate budget authority for programs included in the administrations consolidation proposal was 5615 billion congress rejected the administrations consolidation proposal but it did reduce the overall funding for the programs that would have been consolidated to 5338 billion for fy2006 most of these funds 80 are administered by the department of housing and urban development hud see figure 1 if approved by congress the administrations proposed cuts coupled with proposed increases in other programs within hud would have reduced the agencys total budget by 109 from 319 billion to 285 billion instead congress elected to fund the18 programs in fy2006 though cdbg formula grants for fy2006 were reduced by 400 million to 37 billion overall funding for the programs proposed for consolidation was reduced by only 300 this was due in large part to an increase in funding for cdbg setasides and earmarks in addition total funding for hud increased by 2 billion fueled by an increase in section 8 assisted housing and decrease in offsetting fha receipts critics of the saci maintained that the program if enacted would reduce the agencys role in encouraging solutions to the nations housing and community development problems one of the key components of the agencys mission 42 usc 3531 critics note that the administration fails to recognize the link between housing policy and community and economic development policies crs11 figure 1 percent distribution of fy2006 appropriations for community and economic development programs included in the administrations saci proposal by administering agency 802 53 10 15 119 cdbg formula grants when first introduced in 2005 the saci proposal recommended consolidating the activities of the 18 programs and reducing funding from 5615 billion to 37 billion the program most affected by the proposal would have been the formula portion of the cdbg program of the programs proposed for consolidation cdbg formula grants account for 74 of the 5615 million in aggregated fy2005 appropriations and 70 of the 53 billion in aggregate fy2006 funding see table 3 opponents of the change maintain that because cdbg is the largest source of federal assistance for community and economic development and neighborhood revitalization activities changing or eliminating the program would affect not only the 1178 state and local governments that receive direct allocations but it would also affect the thousands of nonprofit subrecipients of cdbg funds including community development corporations community action agencies and faithbased organizations the administration has noted that it is committed to ensuring that the new program will continue to provide local governments with high degree of flexibility but it will also require that communities demonstrate measurable results for fy2007 the administrations budget proposal would reduce funding for entitlement communities and states by 19 below the programs fy2006 appropriation this proposed reduction would be in addition to the 10 reduction in cdbg funding from fy2005 to fy2006 it is anticipated that the proposed reduction in cdbg funding would also be accompanied by changes in the programs structure although the administration has not yet offered formal legislative proposal it has stated that in will introduce legislation that would revise the programs formula to more closely target assistance to communities most in need this may mean some communities currently eligible for assistance may either be eliminated as entitlement communities or may be subject crs12 to deep funding cuts the administration has also indicated that some portion of the cdbg appropriation may be used to fund bonus program although the parameters of the program are unclear economic development adminstration the fy2007 version of the presidents saci proposal would revamp the economic development administration programs the proposal would consolidate four existing programs public works economic adjustment assistance research and evaluation and technical assistance into single account the regional development account funds would be awarded on competitive basis to entities that support multi jurisdictional regional development activities the new regional development account rda in eda would be funded at 257 million with an additional 27 million in funding made available for planning grants awarded to the economic development districts 13 million for trade adjustment assistance and 29 million for salaries and expenses policy questions among the questions the administrations initiative poses are the following why has the administration chosen to revamp existing programs such as cdbg and eda rather than create new program the administrations initial saci proposal called for the elimination of both eda programs and cdbgs these programs were to be replaced by new block grant how will eligibility for the new rda grants and the revised cdbg programs be determined how will the new bonus program differ from the existing programs that may have divergent recipients such as cdbg which allocates funds to states and local governments and the community development financial institutions fund which competitively awards funds to financial institutions involved in community development lending in underserved areas how will the new program differ in its approach from the existing cdbg and eda programs what formula factors will be used to distribute funds and how will they differ from the targeting requirements of the cdbg formula how will the new bonus program work should congress legislate changes that would more closely target assistance based on need or should grant assistance be awarded based on competitive factors and what common performance measures will be used to evaluate program effectiveness crs13 table 3 distribution of funds proposed for consolidation fy2005 fy2006 fy2007 admin percent of program appropriations
