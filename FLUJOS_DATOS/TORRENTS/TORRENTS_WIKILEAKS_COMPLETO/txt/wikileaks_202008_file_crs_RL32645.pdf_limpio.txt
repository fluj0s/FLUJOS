pillars of agricultural trade liberalization identified in the 2001 doha ministerial decl aration substantial reductions in trade distorting domestic support the phaseout w ith view to total elimination of all export subsidies and substantial improvements in market access crucial tradeoff for the negotiations is the extent to wh ich developed countries reduce their trade distorting domestic support in return for additional market access from large developing countries nonagricultural market access nama received less scrutiny the agreement provides general guidance for future negotiations on the modality for reducing tariffs the binding of developing country tariffs sectoral tariff elimina tion and special and differential treatment sdt for developing countries the nama talks may benefit from the new impetus in the agricultural negotiations the parameters of the services negotiations were established as part of the pre doha builtin agenda and in the doha ministerial declarati on that launched the new round the framework reaffirms the commitments made at doha and charges the negotiators to complete and submit their initial offers as soon as possible to submit revised offers by may 2005 and to ensure that the offers are in sectors and modes of supply that are of interest to veloping countries rvices involving the temporary movement of natural persons will remain contentious for both developed and developing countries the framework sets forth modalities for negotiations on trade facilitation including assessing the needs and prioritie s of member countries providing technical assistance to developing count ries and addressing trade facilitation language in the gatt agreement an early matter for clarification is whether the negotiations will yield enforceable rules or merely guidelines for trade facilitation while the framework agreement resolved several contentious issues regarding the negotiation of future agriculture agreement other issues were addressed in cursory fashion if at all much work rema ins to be done to flesh out the framework to achieve an actual agreement on trade lib eralization the manner in which these issues are resolved may influence the vel of congressional s upport for any resulting agreement the agreemen t also abandons the january 1 2005 deadline for the negotiations but instead sets d ecember 2005 as

paid special attention to the concerns of developing countries and the round was formally entitled the doha development agenda this emphasis was pa rtly in order to get the developing countries majority of the wtos membership to agree to the commencement of the round however some developing countries d difficulty in implementing their uruguay round commitments and many developing c ountries have expressed concern about undertaking new obligations at doha negotiators agreed to resolve issues related to their implementation of the uruguay r ound agreements to negotiate special and differential treatment for developing countries in the new round and to provide technical assistance in the negotiations and implementation of the agreements negotiations proceeded at slow pace several deadlines for agreement on negotiating modalities ie methodologies by which ne gotiations are conducted were missed in the agriculture industr ial market access nd other negotiating groups in

2003 in cancún mexico to resolve the modalities in the weeks before canc ún negotiating documents to achieve this resolution were criticized by all sides and expectations for the ministerial were reduced from agreeing on modalities to achieving an agreement on the framework for negotiating the modalities to be used in future negotiations from cancún to geneva the cancún ministerial however failed to achieve even these expectations trade ministers at cancún became embroiled in disputes over agriculture and the singa pore issues the g20 an informal group of developing countries led by

seeking to have services make up one of the pillars of the framework agreement1 the united states has been less concerned with the dispos ition of the singapore issues with ustr zoellick at one point

addresses the three pillars of agricultural trade liberalization identified in the 2001 doha ministerial declaration substantial reductions in tradedistorting domestic suppor t the phaseout with view to total elimination of all export subs idies and substantial imp rovements in market access4 failure to agree on framework for the agriculture negotiations would have contributed to uncertainty about prospe cts for concluding the dda and about the viability of the wto as global forum for negotiating further farm trade liberalization the framework now beco mes the basis for establishing specific formulas schedules end dates and other parameters referred to as modalities for achieving dda objectives for agriculture during the next phase of negotiations which seem likely to continue into 2006

subsidies eliminated the united states has consistently maintained that tradedistorting domes tic support should be reduced substantially but also wants to preserve safetynet farm income programs enacted in the 2002 farm bill5 the european union eu while willing to eliminate export subsidies over time wants an end to expor t credit guarantees and some food aid programs that it claims are export subsidies the eu also wants to maintain direct decoupled payments to farmers along with payments linked to production established under recently enacted refo rms of its common agricultural policy cap the developing countries large and diverse group that constitutes majority of wto members want special and differential treatment with respect to tariff or subsidy reduction the poorest or

commitments in the three pillars implications for us agriculture an eventual agreement on agricultural trade liberalization in the dda round would have both market effects for the us agricultural sector as well as effects on us agricultural policies and programs market effects market effects of global agricultural trade liberalization are difficult to estimate at this point in the negotiations because such specifics as the extent of tariff reduction the timing for th elimination of export subsidies or the percentage reductions in tradedistorting suppor t remain to be ne gotiated in general however substantial tariff reductions or increased market access quotas could result in expanded exports of many us commodities including grains oilseeds cotton and fruits and vegetables other us commod ity sectors such as dairy or sugar could experience more intense competition from fo reign suppliers but those effects would be mitigated by designating such products as importsensitive as provided in the framework agreement and therefore subj ecting them to longer phased reductions in tariffs andor increases in quotas ex port subsidy elimination could also benefit number of us commodity sectors eg dairy meat and livestock products and cereals by improving competitive conditions in thirdcountry markets but tightening of disciplines on us export credit programs could penalize producers of commodities that have benefitted from such programs eg grains and cott on market effects of reducing tradedi storting domestic support should be to increase prices for commodities that have bene fitted from payments that encourage excess production and downward pressure on prices policy and program effects the harmonizing approach in the agriculture framework suggests that others notably the european union eu would have to cut tradedistorting support more than woul d the united states in the eu case its bound level of amber box support is currently depending on exchange rates around 80 billion while the us bound level is 19 billion according to us trade negotiators the united states likely should have difficulty in meeting the aim of cutting the sum of tradedistorting support levels by 20 in the first year as reductions would be made from bound or permitted rather than applied or actual levels the us dept of agri culture usda estimates that the us bound level of domestic support under new wto agreement could be as high as 39 billion the current us bound level of support for amber box spending plus estimates of the future bound levels of minimis and blue box spending while actual spending could be cons iderably less rendering the 20 cut in the first year meaningless for the united states howe ver depending on the outcome of the negotiations future cuts

cotton for special attention10 the elimination of eu export subsidies has been longstanding objective of us agricultural trade policy as has requiri ng greater transparency by stes such as the canadian wheat board pressure from us and developing country wto members in the dda round plus successive reforms of the eus common agricultural policy cap which has reduced its reliance on export subsidies led the eu to offer to eliminate them by date certain in exchange however the eu countered that all forms of export subsidie s including us export credit guarantees and food aid s hould be

significance on this paragraph depending on the interpretation accorded it this paragraph could reopen ma ny of the issues workedout in the framework text it also reflects the continued lack of c

often provides only general guidance these include the modality for reducing tariffs the binding of developing country tariffs the issue of sectoral ta riff elimination and special and differential

endorsed the use of non linear formula applied on linebyline basi s as modality to conduct tariff reduction negotiations nonlinear formula can work to even out or harmonize tariff levels between participants this type of formula could result in greater percentage reduction of higher tariffs than lower ones resulting in greater equalization of tariffs at lower level than before by contrast an example of linear formula would be one that reduced tariffs by certain percentage across the board consequently this formula would not change the relative tariff rates between members country with relatively high ta riffs before undergoing the formula would still have high tariffs relative to other countries afterwards this approach is generally favored by countries with high ta riffs or certain tariff peaks that the country seeks to preserve certain nonlinear form ulas such as an harmonization formula seek to even out or harmonize the tariff rates among nations an harmonization formula would also wo rk to reduce tariff peaks and tariff escalations another stated go of the declaration tariff peaks are considered to be tariff rates of above 15 and often protect sensitiv products from competition tariff escalation is the practice of increasing tariffs as value is added to commodity as an example of tariff calation cotton would come in with low tariff fabric would face higher tariff and finished shirt would face the highest tariff tariff escalation is often employed to protect importcompeting va lueadding industry the emphasis on tariff peaks and escalation re sults from findings that the use of peak tariffs and escalations are particularly levied agains t the products of developing countries as well as becoming increasingly costly to the consumer in developed countries17 the framework does not specify imp lementation period for tariff cuts but developing countries are to be fforded longer implementation periods tariff binding the framework encourages th continued binding of tariffs tariffs are bound when country commits not to raise them beyond certain level therefore binding has been seen as th first step in tariff reduction bound tariffs are often significantly higher than tariff levels that are actually applied which has led to questions as to the usefulness of re ductions from bound rather than applied rates the united states supports reduction from applied rates wh ich would result in greater cuts to actually levied tariffs some contend that the use of the applied rate may serve as disincentive for countries to undertake unilate ral liberalization countries would likely hesitate to undertak unilateral tariff reductions if they know that multilateral liberalization efforts would use such rates as starting point it may also increase the incentive to raise applied rates prior to negotiation18 under the framework agreement tari ff reductions would be calculated from the bound rather than the applied level reductions in unbound tariff lines would be calculated from twice the currently applied rate participants ie developing countries who have bound less than 35 of their tariff lines would be exempt

us trade than they do in the us economy as whole in 2003 servi ces accounted for 301 of us exports of goods and services and 141 of us imports of goods and services25 several factors may account for the smaller figure most services must be bought and sold through direct contact between the buyer and seller and are not conducive to cross border trade while nations have reduced or eliminated

that not much progress would be made until the wto negotiators resolved how agricultural issues would be addressed30 developing countries were reluctant to make offers on services until they saw how far some of the developed c ountries were willing to go on agriculture because the framework agreement addressed many ag ricultural trade issues supporters of liberalized trade in services are anticipating that the services negotiations will gain momentum framework issues the framework itself menti ons services only briefly because they were not the focus of the negotiations over the framework and the parameters of the negotiations had already been established as part of the builtin agenda and in the doha ministerial d eclaration that launched the new round the framework reaffirms the commitments made in the doha ministerial declaration and charges the negotiators to complete and s ubmit their initial offers as soon as possible to submit revised offers by may 2005 and to sure that the offers are of high quality the framework also charges the negotiators to bear in mind when making their offers the sectors and modes of supply that are of interest to developing countries the

portion of total trade indicating many untapped opportunities for trade in services if barriers are eliminated however for many countries especially veloping countries liberaliza tion in services trade is very sensitive issue that may make achievi ng the opportunities difficult if not elusive trade facilitation32 background the wto negotiating framework sets forth modalities for negotiations on trade facilitati on as one of the singapor issues trade facilitation was pushed by the eu and other countries but met resistance from some developing countries developing country members we re not necessarily opposed to the goals of trade facilitation but they were relu ctant to negotiate new commitments in the wto for many reasons mainly because they wanted the doha r ound to focus on settling implementation issues from previous agreements they were also concerned about their capacity to implement potentia lly costly trade facilitation agreements however developed country members including the ited states insisted that trade facilitation would benefit all members by creating more efficient global trading system and they agreed to incl ude provisions on technical assistance and special and differential treatment in the negotiating framework to ensure that developing country needs were met th is may have influenced the developing countries to agree to the inclusion of tr ade facilitation in the negotiating framework previous wto rules have addressed trade f acilitation but it was first introduced as separate topic in the wto at the singapore ministerial in 1996 the doha ministerial statement agreed to continue discussions on trade facilitation and to begin negotiations after setting modalities at the cancun ministerial the trade facilitation discussions in the wto since doha have concentrated on three core areas improving the relevant articles of the gatt 1994 individual country needs and priorities regarding trade facilitation especially thos of developing countries and technical assistance to developing countries in the area of trade facilitation trade facilitation aims to improve the effi ciency of international trade through strengthening trade rules

transparen t system of administering trade trade facilitation has the potential to reduce the cost of trade increase opportun ities for trade diminish corruption associated with customs procedures increase compliance with customs rules and reduce the cost of goods to consumers for both developed and developing countries trade facilitation may have the most visible impact on small and medium enterprises smes because they are often priced out of international trade due to the relatively high costs of administrative barriers for small volumes of goods since smes are said to contribute significantly to job creation and economic growth in both developed and developing countries increasing their ability to benefit from trade may positiv ely affect world economic growth us position the united states has the potential to benefit from trade facilitation in the same way as other countries certain u s industries in particular rely on the ability to quickly clear goods through customs such as agricultural importers and exporters and the expre ss delivery industry us trade with developing countries may also benefit such trade has been increasing total us trade with ldcs nearly doubled from 1996 to 2003 from 76 billion to 141 billion and us trade with its gene ralized system of preferences gsp beneficiaries increased by 73 from 193 billion in 1996 to 261 billion in 200335 this trade has traditionally been hindered by several factors including the fact that developing countries tend to have the leas t efficient administrative trade procedures now that other barriers to trade with deve loping countries such as protective tariff regimes are being dismantled trade facilitation may help both the united states and developing countries further realize gains from trade with each other reducing the costs of trade with developing countries could help us busin esses establish new export markets and lowercost suppliers in developing countries the united states may also

singapore and switzerland th current controversy in tr ade facilitation is that many of the developing countries are opposed to new wto disciplines and they would prefer optional guidelines however ma ny other countries agree with the us position that rulesbased system is ssential for establishing accountability and implementing concrete changes to facilitate trade they also agree that developing country concerns can be adequately ddressed through atte ntion to technical assistance and special and differential treatment issues for negotiation the negotiating framework modalities cover the three core issues of trade facilitation that member countries have been discussing since doha clarifying and improving aspects of certain existing wto rules concerning trade facilitation providing tec hnical assistance to veloping countries and identifying and considering the needs and priorities of all countries especially developing countries incl uding special and differen tial treatment it does not specifically state whether the negotiations will result in guidelines or new rules yet it provides for assistance to developing countries in implementing whatever rules may be negotiated the existing wto rules singled out for attention are articles v viii and x of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt36 each of these articles concern different aspects of trade facilitation and they we re initially agreed on prior to the formation of the wto trade facilitation was seen as less important than market access and other areas negotiated under the gatt during this time and thus the gatt does not provide specific rules fo r customs procedures article v deals with freedom of transit the rights of goods passing through territory between countries article v iii deals with fees and forma lities connected with importation and exportation requiring efficient and fa ir fees for moving goods in and out of countries article x deals with the p ublication and administration of trade regulations requiring transparent trade regulations and the equal enforcement of these regulations including j udicial review process in order to carry out its task the framework further directs the trade negotiations committee to establish negotiating group on trade facilita tion and appoint its chair the negotiations are to consider the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries special and differen tial treatment has traditionally meant granting longer trans ition periods for developing countries but the framework states that the extent and timing of entering into commitments shall be related to the implement ation capabilities of developing country members also the members agreed that developing count ries will not be required to undertakehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32645crs18 infrastructure investments beyond thei r means the framework encourages developed country members to provide technical assistan ce to developing countries within the area of trade facilitation through the negotiations members agree to identify their own trade facilitation needs and priorities and cons ider the concerns of devel oping countries regarding the potential costs of proposed measures tec hnical assistance and capacity building for developing country particip ation in the negotiations is emphasized and developed member countries are expected to provi this assistance developed country members are also expected to provide support in implementing the commitments that arise from the negotiations whether that be in building human and institutional capacity or physical infrastructure the framework recognizes that negotiated agreement may require some members to furt her develop their infrastructure and this may be burdensome for some veloping countries in th is case developed countries are expected to make every effort to sure support and assistance for implementing the commitments however developing country will not be required to implement commitment with costs beyond its means if it does not receive adequate support from developed member countries that stipulation is necessary because the framework points out that developed countries cannot commit to openended support the members also agree to revi ew the support and assistance provided and assess whether it supports implementing the negotiated agreements looking ahead the framework agreement resolved several contentious issues regarding the negotiation of future agriculture agreement for other issues the framework was less clear or the issue was ft unaddressed much work re mains to be done to flesh out the framework to an actual agreemen t on trade liberalization for the doha negotiations to succeed however these issues must be addresse d and resolved in turn the manner by which these issues are resolved may influence the level of congressional support for any resulting agreement agriculture agreement to reduce domestic support according to harmonizing formula wto member s with higher levels of trade distorting support must cut more represents substantial progress but difficult negotiations are expected over specifics such as the percentage cuts in overall support nd in specific categories of trade distorting support amber box newlydefined blue box and minimis similarly the eus concession on eliminating export subsidies is supposed to be matched with us cuts in export credit guarantees and food aid programs just how parallel reductions in these programs might be achieved as well as the schedule and end date for eliminating export subsidies likely will be difficult negotiating issues the market access provisions of the agricultural framework agreement are less precise than t hose for domestic support or

inserted at the insistence of the developing count ries casts doubt on the finality of these decisions the first activity of negotiators is to determine the tariff formula or whether to use or whether to use different tariff reduction modality the success of the nama negotiations may also depend on cooperation of developing countries some of which are withholding active participation aw aiting progress in the agriculture negotiations trade facilitation in establishing talks on trade facilitation member countries may first r each an agreement on whether to negotiate new rules or merely guidelines fo r trade facilitation this may be accomplished by first reaching agreement on concrete steps for the provision of technical ssistance and the application of special and differentia l treatment developi ng countries may prove more likely to engage in the talks if they are confident that they will not be forced to take measures beyond their capacity and it may be possible to agree to negotiate new rules
