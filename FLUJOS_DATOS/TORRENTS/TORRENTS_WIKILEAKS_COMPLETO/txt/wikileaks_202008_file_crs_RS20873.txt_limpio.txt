there have been divergent views with regard to sex and young people many argue that sexual activity in and of itself is wrong if the persons are not married others agree that it is better for teenagers to abstain from sex but are primarily concerned about the negative consequences of sexual activity namely unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases stds these two viewpoints are reflected in two pregnancy prevention approaches the adolescent family life afl program encompasses both views and provides funding for both prevention programs and programs that provide medical and social services to pregnant or parenting teens the abstinence education program centers on the abstinenceonly message and only funds programs that adhere solely to bolstering that message for

indicated his support for abstinence education as governor of texas he stated for children to realize their dreams they must learn the value of abstinence we must send them the message that of the many decisions they will make in their lives choosing to avoid early sex is one of the most important we must stress that abstinence isnt just about saying to sex its about saying yes to happier healthier future6 the proposal he supported during his presidential campaign would have provided at least as much funding for abstinence education as was provided for teen contraception services under the medicaid family planning title x and afl programs namely about 135 million annually7 as many as 27 other federal programs have teen contraception component but expenditures solely for this component could not be isolated8 for fy2008 abstinence education funding totals 177 million 50 million for the abstinence block grant to states 13 million for the afl abstinence education projects 109 million for the cbae program up to 10 million of which may be used for national abstinence education campaign and 45 million for an evaluation of the program9 abstinenceonly versus comprehensive sexuality education according to 1997 survey among the 69 of public school districts that had districtwide policy to teach sex education 14 had comprehensive policy that treated abstinence as one option for adolescents in broader sexuality education program 51 taught abstinence as the preferred option for teenagers but also permitted discussion about contraception as an effective means of protecting against unintended pregnancy and disease an 6 campaign literature from georgebushcom accessed by author on november 22 2000 7 some family planning experts caution that the spending data may be misleading because it includes much more than contraception services they contend that family planning programs include vast array of medical services beyond the prescription of contraceptive method including pap smears breast exams screening for stds and oneonone counseling of teens 8 the mch and title xx social services block grants are among the hhs programs that provide contraceptive

fy2006 and fy2007 crs6 abstinenceplus policy and 35 taught abstinence as the only option outside of marriage with discussion of contraception prohibited entirely or permitted only to emphasize its shortcomings abstinenceonly policy10 advocates of the abstinence education approach argue that teenagers need to hear single unambiguous message that sex outside of marriage is wrong and harmful to their physical and emotional health they contend that youth can and should be empowered to say to sex they argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinenceonly message they also cite research that indicates that teens who take virginity pledges to refrain from sex until marriage appear to delay having sex longer than those teens who do not make such commitment the study found that teens who publicly promise to postpone sex until marriage refrain from intercourse for about year and half longer than teens who did not make such pledge11 they argue that abstinence is the most effective means of preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including hivaids advocates of the more comprehensive approach to sex education argue that todays youth need information and decisionmaking skills to make realistic practical decisions about whether to engage in sexual activities they contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases12 they maintain that abstinenceonly messages provide protection against the risks of pregnancy and disease for those who are sexually active they point out that teens who break their virginity pledges were less likely to use contraception the first time than teens who had never made such promise the april 2007 mathematica evaluation of the title v abstinence education program found that program participants had just as many sexual partners as nonparticipants had sex at the same median age as nonparticipants and were just as likely to use contraception as nonparticipants supporters of the abstinenceonly approach say that the evaluation only examined four programs and is thereby inconclusive recent compilation of experimentally designed evaluations of comprehensive sexual education programs found that some comprehensive programs that included contraception information decisionmaking skills and peer pressure strategies were successful in delaying sexual activity improving contraceptive use or preventing teen pregnancy13 10 david j landry lisa kaeser and cory l richards abstinence promotion
