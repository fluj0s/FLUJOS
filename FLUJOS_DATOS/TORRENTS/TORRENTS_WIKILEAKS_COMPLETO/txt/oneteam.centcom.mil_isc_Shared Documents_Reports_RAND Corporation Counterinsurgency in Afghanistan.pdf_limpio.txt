insurgents comprised of the taliban hezbiislami the haqqani network foreign ﬁghters local tribes and criminal organizations began sustained eﬀort to overthrow the afghan government us and coalition eﬀorts in afghanistan oﬀer useful opportunity to assess what worksand what does notin counterinsurgency warfare this study examines the beginning of the insurgency in afghanistan and asks three major questions first what was the nature of the insurgency second what factors have contributed to the rise of insurgencies more broadly and to the insurgency in afghanistan in particular third what capabilities should the us military consider developing to improve its ability to wage eﬀective counterinsurgency operations the core argument of this study is that the united states should focus its resources on developing capabilities that help improve the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces to wage counterinsurgency warfare it has not always done this well the analysis of 90 insurgencies since 1945 in chapter two indicates that three variables are correlated with the success and failure of counterinsurgency eﬀorts capability of indigenous security forces especially policet local governancet external support for insurgents including sanctuarytxii counterinsurgency in afghanistan the us militaryalong with other us and coalition part nersis more likely to be successful in counterinsurgency warfare the more capable and legitimate the indigenous security forces are especially the police the better the capacity of the local government is and the less external support to insurgents there is the indigenous government and its forces have greater chance of gaining in max webers words monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within given territory 1 in many cases signiﬁcant direct intervention by us military forces may undermine popular support and legitimacy the united states is also unlikely to remain for the duration of most insurgencies this studys assessment of 90 insurgencies indicates that it takes an average of 14 years to defeat insurgents once an insurgency develops in the afghan insurgency the competenceand in some areas incompetenceof the indigenous government and its security forces have been critical factors this analysis suggests that success in afghanistan hinges on three factors first is the ability of the united states and other international actors to help build competent and legitimate afghan security forces especially police which was not accomplished during the early stages of the counterinsurgency repeated trips to the regional police training centers in afghanistan as well as interviews with police in the ﬁeld indicated that the afghan national police were corrupt incompetent underresourced and often loyal to local commanders rather than to the central government indeed the afghan police received little attention and were low priority in the early stages of the counterinsurgency this was mistake the police are the primary arm of the government in counterinsurgency because of their presence in local villages and districts the us military made signiﬁcant changes in the police training program beginning in 2005 and 2006 but persistence is the key to police reform based on the low quality of afghan police when the taliban was overthrown in 2001 police reform in afghanistan will take at least decade 1 max weber politics as vocation in h h gerth and c wright mills eds from max weber essays in sociology new york oxford university press 1958 p 78summary xiii second the united states and other international actors need to improve the quality of local governance especially in rural areas of afghanistan field research in the east and south showed that development and reconstruction did not reach most rural areas because of the deteriorating security environment even the provincial reconstruction teams which were speciﬁcally designed to assist in development and reconstruction projects operated in pockets in the east and south because of security concerns ngos and state agencies such as the us agency for international development and the canadian international development agency were also not involved in reconstruction and development in many areas of the south and east the irony in this situation is that rural areas which were most at risk from the taliban and where unhappiness with the slow pace of change was greatest among the population received little assistance the counterinsurgency in afghanistan will be won or lost in the local communities of rural afghanistan not in urban centers such as kabul this means the counterinsurgency must ﬁnd ways to reach these communities despite security concerns third the united states and other international actors need to eliminate the insurgents support base in pakistan the failure to do so will cripple longterm eﬀorts to stabilize and rebuild afghanistan every successful insurgency in afghanistan since 1979 enjoyed sanctuary in pakistan and assistance from individuals within the pakistan government such as the frontier corps and the interservices intelligence directorate isi the taliban and other insurgent groups enjoyed sanctuary in the federally administered tribal areas and balochistan province the taliban regularly shipped arms ammunition and supplies into afghanistan from pakistan many suicide bombers came from afghan refugee camps located in pakistan and improvised explosive device components were often smuggled across the afghanistan pakistan border and assembled at safe houses in such provinces as kandahar the taliban used roads such as highway 4 in kandahar province to transport ﬁghters and supplies between afghanistan and pakistan and the leadership structure of most insurgent groups eg the taliban hezbiislami the haqqani network and qaeda was based in xiv counterinsurgency in afghanistan pakistan there is some indication that individuals within the pakistan governmentfor example within the frontier corps and the isiwere involved in assisting insurgent groups solving this problem will require diﬃcult political and diplomatic feat convincing the government of pakistan to undermine the sanctuary on its soil this eﬀort became more challenging with the rise of an insur gency in pakistan by range of militant groups members of which assassinated pakistani opposition leader benazir bhutto and conducted brazen attacks against the pakistan army isi and oﬃcials from other government agencies militants from pakistans border areas were also linked to range of international terrorist attacks and plots such as the july 2005 attacks on londons mass transit system the foiled 2006 plot against transatlantic commercial aircraft ﬂights foiled plots in 2007 in germany and denmark and the 2008 arrests of terrorist suspects in spain these developments indicated that the insurgency in afghanistan had spread to neighboring pakistan and required regional solution most policymakersincluding those in the united states repeatedly ignore or underestimate the importance of locals in counterinsurgency operations counterinsurgency requires not only the ca p ab ili ty f th u t ed s ta t t co n d u ct co n v n nal war b u t most importantly the ability to shape the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces us military and civilian eﬀorts should focus on leveraging indigenous capabilities and building capacity in some areas such as air strikes and air mobility this may be difﬁcult the recommendations in chapter seven cover eight functional areas police border security ground combat air strike and air mobility intelligence command and control information operations and civilmilitary aﬀairs in some of these areas such as civil aﬀairs the us military should not be the lead agency and will need to coordinate closely with other states international organizations and ngos indeed the success of any counterinsurgency campaign over the long run ultimately requires combination of military political economic and other eﬀortsxvacknowledgments this book would not have been possible

cia forces air power and afghan indigenous troops overthrew the taliban regime in less than three months us forces suﬀered only dozen casualties 1 some individuals involved in the operation argued that it revitalized the american way of war2 however this initial success was quickly succeeded by the emergence of prolonged insurgency as the taliban hezbiislami the haqqani network foreign ﬁghters local militias and criminal organizations began sustained eﬀort to overthrow the new afghan government this study deﬁnes an insurgency as politicalmilitary campaign by nonstate actors seeking to

counterinsurgency operations this chapter outlines the research eﬀort and then provides brief outline of the book research design the research design adopted is straightforward it included conducting an exhaustive set of primary source interviews in afghanistan pakistan india the united states and europe including during multiple visits to afghanistan in 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 these included conversations with several hundred government oﬃcials from the united states afghanistan pakistan india and the north atlantic treaty organization nato as well as staﬀ from the united nations and several nongovernmental organizations ngos finally the research included review and analysis of hundreds of government documents from the united states afghanistan and coalition countries such as germany and the united kingdom as well as transcripts and videos from the taliban hezbiislami and qaeda to supplement the research on afghanistan several researchers at rand including the author built data set of all of the 90 insurgencies that occured since 1945 our goal was to identify the variables that can be correlated with the success and failure of insurgencies this research design oﬀers

comparison in paul gordon lauren ed diplomacy new approaches in history theory and policy new york free press 1979 pp 4368introduction 3 backs to relying solely on single case study such as this one5 single case is limited laboratory for identifying those capabilities that are eﬀective across range of counterinsurgencies since conditions can vary across countries for example several factors beyond the quality of the indigenous government and its forces can impact the outcome of counterinsurgency geography such as mountainous terrain degree of urbanization ethnic tribal or religious ﬁssures within the state and economic conditions 6 in single case study there is rarely variation across these factors afghanistan for instance has rugged mountains in much of the country large rural population range of ethnic and tribal groups and poor economic conditions consequently study of afghanistan cannot provide deﬁnitive assessment of what types of military and nonmilitary capabilities might be useful against insurgents operating among homogenous population living in the jungle or in major cities 7 what may work in afghanistan may not work in all other countries 5 on the costs and

there are several reasons why case study of afghanistan is useful first the outcome of the insurgency in afghanistan is of such intrinsic importance to the united states that its lessons are particularly important the attacks in washington dc new york and pennsylvania on september 11 2001 were planned in afghanistan and many of the hijackers received training there consequently us performance during the counterinsurgency campaign has signiﬁcant implications for us national security as the 911 commission report concluded us failure to stabilize afghanistan would decrease us security by allowing the country to become safe haven for terrorists and criminals 8 second single case provides good opportunity to carefully examine what worked and what did not sometimes referred to as process tracing 9 i t allows us to infer and test explanations of how us capabilities and strategies aﬀected counterinsurgency eﬀortsand why as alexander george and timothy mckeown argue case studies are useful in uncovering what stimuli the actors attend to the decision process that makes use of these stimuli to arrive at decisions the actual behavior that then occurs the eﬀect of various institutional arrangements on attention processing and behavior and the eﬀect of other variables of interest on attention processing and behavior 10 the focus of this research is on the us military and its capa bilities for conducting counterinsurgency warfare the actions of the white house the department of state the us agency for international development usaid the cia and other us government organizations are obviously critical during counterinsurgency opera 8 the 911 commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states new york w w norton

decision making p 35introduction 5 tions so are the actions of other states international organizations and ngos as david galula argues counterinsurgency operations are essentially of political nature this means that political action remains foremost throughout the war and every military move has to be weighed with regard to its political eﬀects and vice versa 11 nev ertheless the military plays particularly critical role in counterinsurgency warfareand will continue to do so in the future while the focus of this research is on the role of the us military and the development of its counterinsurgency capabilities the role of other agencies is noted where appropriate after all the success of any counterinsurgency campaign over the long term requires combination of political economic and military resources brought to bear by variety of governmental and nongovernmental actors outline chapter two critiques some of the current arguments about counterin surgency warfare and oﬀers an alternative framework for understanding it chapter three provides brief overview of afghanistans age of insurgency beginning in 1979 chapter four examines lessons that can be learned from the insurgents including the taliban hezbiislami foreign ﬁghters local tribes and criminal organizations chapter five outlines lessons from the afghan government and its security forces and chapter six examines lessons from the united states and coalition forces the focus in these chapters is primarily on the strategic and operational level rather than the tactical level chapter seven pulls together lessons from the three sets of actorsinsurgents the afghan government and the us militaryand then outlines key capabilities for counterinsurgency warfare 11 david galula counterinsurgency warfare theory and practice st petersburg fla hailer publishing 2005 p 97chapter two success in counterinsurgency warfare most military ﬁgures and policymakersincluding those in the united statesunderestimate the importance of the indigenous government and its security forces in counterinsurgency warfare this chapter argues that the focus of the us military should be to improve the competence and legitimacy of indigenous actors to conduct counterinsurgency operations achieving this goal involves increasing the capacity of indigenous security forces to wage military and nonmilitary operations improving governance and undermining external support for insurgents these steps are critical in winning popular support and ensuring legitimacy for the indigenous government this chapter begins by critiquing the current thinking on counterinsurgency warfare and then oﬀers sounder strategy for success the fallacy of external actors one of the key challenges in waging eﬀective counterinsurgency opera tions is understanding the variables that impact their success or failure most assessments of counterinsurgency operations tend to ignore or downplay the role of indigenous forces and mistakenly focus on how to improve the capabilities of outside forces to directly defeat insurgents this might include revising the us militarys organizational structure or increasing external resources such as troops to directly counter insurgents this approach assumes the recipe for successful counterinsurgency is adapting the us militarys capabilities so it can win the support of the local population and defeat insurgents the problem 8 counterinsurgency in afghanistan with this approach is that it ignores or underestimates the most critical actor in counterinsurgency campaign the indigenous government and its security forces this mistake is common in the counterinsurgency literature john nagl argues for example that success in counterinsurgency operations is largely function of an external militarys ability to adapt its organizational structure and strategy to win the support of the local population and directly defeat insurgents but he largely ignores the role of the indigenous government and its security forces 1 in assessing the british performance in malaya and the us performance in vietnam nagl concludes the better performance of the british army in learning and implementing successful counterinsurgency doctrine in malaya as compared to the american armys failure to learn and implement successful counterinsurgency doctrine in vietnam is best explained by the diﬀering organizational cultures of the two armies in short that the british army was learning institution and the american army was not 2 general frank kitson who participated in several counterinsur gency campaigns in africa europe and asia similarly argues that successful campaign needs to take into account three groups the insurgent groups political structure the insurgent groups military structure and the population kitson argues that external forces need to focus on defeating the insurgents political and military infrastructure and winning the support of the population 3 however he largely ignores the role of indigenous actors in his study of french counterinsurgency operations roger trinquier makes similar mistake he argues that the key to success is adapting the external militarys ability to directly 1 john nagl learning to eat soup with knife counterinsurgency lessons from malaya and vietnam chicago university of chicago press 2005 p xiv nagl later conceded that his book pays little attention to working withand throughindigenous forces 2 nagl learning to eat soup with knife p xxii emphasis added 3 frank kitson low intensity operations subversion insurgency and peacekeeping london faber and faber 1971 p 49success in counterinsurgency warfare 9 defeat insurgent groups the failure to adapt he notes was the main reason french forces were defeated in indochina and algeria the result of this shortcoming is that the army is not prepared to confront an adversary employing arms and methods the army itself ignores it has therefore chance of winning 4 in addition us army colo nel timothy deady argues that the united states was successful in the philippines because of direct us action using mao tsetungs aphorism that insurgents are like ﬁsh that need sea in which to swim he concludes that american strategy eﬀectively targeted both the insurgents strategic and operational centers of gravity as american garrisons drained the local lakes the insurgent ﬁsh became easier to isolate and catch 5 all of these works commit similar fallacy they ignore or down play the role of the indigenous government and its security forces this focus on winning counterinsurgency campaigns by improving the capabilities of external actors has become conventional wisdom among numerous military oﬃcials and counterinsurgency experts however such strategy is misplaced while improving the us militarys ability to directly counter insurgents may be necessary to successful counterinsurgency campaign it is not suﬃcient in particular it underestimates the importance of indigenous forces most counterinsurgency campaigns are not won or lost by external forces but by indigenous forces the quality of indigenous forces and government has signiﬁcantly impacted the outcome of past counterinsurgencies 6 shaping 4 roger trinquier modern warfare french view of counterinsurgency trans daniel lee new york praeger 1964 p 3 5 timothy k deady lessons from

orga nizational structure of an external military to unconventional war it requires an understanding of the nature of the local conﬂict and the ability to shape the capacity of indigenous actors to conduct an eﬀective counterinsurgency campaign this includes range of steps such as eﬀectively training police and improving governance capacity indeed there are dangers in focusing too heavily on lead us role and improving us military capabilities to directly act against insurgents first us forces are unlikely to remain for the duration of any counterinsurgency eﬀort at least as major combatant force 7 insurgencies are usually of short duration only if the indigenous government collapses at an early stage an analysis of all insurgencies since 1945 shows that successful counterinsurgency campaigns last for an average of 14 years and unsuccessful ones last for an average of 11 years many also end in draw with neither side winning insurgencies can also have long tails approximately 25 percent of insurgencies won by the government and 11 percent won by insurgents last more than 20 years 8 since indigenous forces eventually have to win the war on their own they must develop the capacity to do so if they do not develop this capacity indigenous forces are likely to lose the war once international assistance ends 9 second indigenous forces usually know the population and terrain better than external actors and are better able to gather intelligence third lead us role may be interpreted by the population as an occupation eliciting nationalist reactions

insurgents which include those groups that adopt unconventionaland sometimes conventionalmilitary strategies and tactics to overthrow an established national government or secede from it 11 the second is the indigenous government which includes the governments security forces such as the army and police as well as its governance capacity governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by central authority in timely manner including health care power transportation infrastructure and other basic services the third group of actors comes from outside these include states and nonstate entities which can support the indigenous government or the insurgents as explained in more detail below outside actors can play pivotal role in tipping the war in favor of insurgents 10 david m edelstein occupational hazards why military occupations succeed or fail international security vol 29 1 summer 2004 p 51 11 the department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms joint publication 102 deﬁnes unconventional warfare as broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations normally of long duration predominately conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized trained equipped supported and directed in varying degrees by an external source it includes guerrilla warfare and other direct oﬀensive low visibility covert or clandestine operations as well as the indirect activated of subversion sabotage intelligence activities and evasion and escape consequently conventional war refers to warfare conducted by using

counterinsurgency actors the taliban hezbiislami the haqqani network foreign ﬁghters criminal groups and host of afghan and pakistani tribal militias are the primary insurgent forces there are two sets of external actors the united states nato forces and other international actors such as the united nations are the primary external actors that support the afghan government the broad jihadist network individuals within the pakistan government and pakistani and afghan tribes are the primary external actors that support the insurgents in between the two sides are the afghan and to some degree pakistani populations which lie at the center of insurgent and counterinsurgent eﬀorts the population is particularly critical to insurgents because of their relative weakness insurgents generally cannot attack their opponents in conventional manner as the government forces are usually much more capable of waging conventional warfare this asymmetry in power forces insurgents to carry the ﬁght to an arena in which they have better chance of success to many insurgents the population oﬀers level playing ﬁeld if insurgents manage to alienate the population from the government and acquire its active support they are more likely to win the war in the end the exercise of political power depends on the tacit or explicit agreement of the populationor at worst on its submissiveness

control of government take power in region or use violence to change government policies 2 at least 1000 individuals were killed over the course of the conﬂict with yearly average of at least 100 and

success or failure of counterinsurgency eﬀorts capability of indigenous security forces especially policet quality of local governancet external support for insurgents including sanctuaryt in addition there are several other variables that correlate with the success of insurgencies such as the type of terrain and the size of the population 16 however these factors are outside the control of external and indigenous actors especially in the near term security forces the capability of the government security forces to defeat insurgents and establish law and order is paramount to the success of any counterinsurgency insurgents are better able to survive and prosper if the security forces they oppose are relatively weak and lack legitimacy with the population these forces may be badly

soldiers and the ability to learn and adapt during combat 18 as figure 23 illustrates there is some correlation between government 16 for example mountainous terrain larger populations and lower per

governments defeated less than third of the insurgencies when their competence was medium or low while military and paramilitary forces play key role the police are perhaps the most critical component of indigenous forces they are the primary arm of the government focused on internal security matters unlike the military the police usually have permanent presence in cities towns and villages better understanding of the threat environment in these areas and better intelligence this makes them 19 we assessed the capability of government security forces by making qualitative judg ment about how

guerrillas logistics support and ﬁnancial and political supportfrom the midst of the population 20 an eﬀective police force is also critical to the success of counterinsurgency because there are limits to the use of military forcethe enemy frequently holds little territory and refuses to ﬁght for the territory that it does hold counterinsurgent military forces may be able to penetrate and garrison an insurgent area and if well sustained may reduce guerrilla activity but once the situation in an area becomes untenable for insurgents they will simply transfer their activity to another area and the problem remains unresolved as david galula argues conventional operations by themselves have at best more eﬀect than ﬂy swatter some guerrillas are bound to be caught but new recruits will replace them as fast as they are lost 21 viable indigenous police force with permanent presence in urban and rural areas is critical component of counterinsurgency this poses challenge for the us military since it is not ipso facto the lead us agency for police training abroad in the early 1970s the us congress became deeply concerned that us assistance abroad frequently strengthened the recipient governments capacity for repression 22 consequently congress adopted section 660 of the foreign assistance act in 1974 which prohibited the united states from providing internal security assistance to foreign governments stating that the us government cannot provide training or advice or provide any ﬁnancial support for police prisons or other law enforcement forces for any foreign government or any program of internal intelligence or surveil 20 trinquier modern warfare p 43 galula counterinsurgency warfare p 31 21 galula counterinsurgency warfare p 72 22 michael mcclintock the

evidence that indigenous governance capacity impacts the outcome of counterinsurgencies 24 the stronger and more competent government is in providing services to its population the greater its ability to undermine popular support for insurgents and the more likely that it can defeat an insurgency governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by legitimate central authority in timely manner this provision of services can be impacted by such factors as the level of corruption the viability of the justice system and the inﬂuence of warlords and tribal militias 25

warfare 19 the absence of good governance is often root cause of an insurgency basic need of any insurgent group is an attractive cause as david galula argues the best cause for the insurgents purpose is one that by deﬁnition can attract the largest number of supporters and repel the minimum of opponents 26 all types of problems have been taken advantage of by insurgents sometimes the cause is social such as the exploitation of one class by another class exploitation motivated number of marxistleninist insurgencies in latin america africa and asia during the cold war sometimes it is economic the chinese communists capitalized on the plight of chinese farmers who were victims of exactions by authorities and the rapacity of local usurers poor governance may indicate disorganization weakness or incompetencecreating window of opportunity for insurgents to win popular support 27 corruption can be particularly invidious challenge it can under mine support for the government and increase support for insurgents corruption hampers economic growth disproportionately burdens the poor undermines the rule of law and damages government legitimacy it has supply side those who give bribes and demand side public oﬃcials who take them 28 at its core corruption is the misuse of entrusted power for private gain it can involve highlevel oﬃcials with discretionary authority over government policies or lowerlevel oﬃcials who make decisions about enforcing or not enforcing regulations corruption also slows economic growth it is often responsible for funneling scarce public

endogeneity problem of coding the government as popular if it wonand unpopular if it lost rather we relied on the judgments of area specialists and historians that covered each insurgency to determine how popular the government was independent of the insurgency success in counterinsurgency warfare 21 external support the ﬁnal factor that impacts counterinsurgencys success is external support to insurgents the ability of insurgent groups to gain external support is correlated with their success as figure 25 illustrates those insurgencies that received support from external states won more than 50 percent of the time those with support from nonstate actors and diaspora groups won just over 30 percent of the time and those with external support won only 17 percent of the time 31 support from state actors and nonstate actors such as diaspora population criminal network or terrorist network clearly makes diﬀerence this is intutive outside figure 25 external support for insurgents and

assistanceespecially from states which tend to have greater resourcescan signiﬁcantly bolster the capabilities of insurgent groups by giving them more money weapons logistics and other aid external support can take two forms first foreign governments diasporas or international networks can provide direct assistance training operations money arms logistics diplomatic backing and other types of aid 32 the rise of transnational jihadist network has cre ated particularly acute challenges as organizations such as qaeda tap into local groups these challenges include the ﬂow of tactics weapons ﬁghters ideology organization and leadership into and among local insurgencies the increased resort to suicide operations and the pivotal role of religious ﬁgures in either fanning or opposing violence given the basic constraints posed by numerical weakness insurgents need arms and materiel money to buy them or goods to trade for them they need supply of recruits and they may also need information and instruction in the practical details of waging an insurgency the second type of external support is the freedom to use foreign territory as sanctuary this is sometimes made more tenable by the presence of weak government where there is sanctuary the availability of territorial base for insurgents outside of their home state is correlated with the failure of counterinsurgency eﬀorts 33 as figure 26 illustrates external sanctuary is signiﬁcant help to insurgents often making the diﬀerence between their success or failure 34 insurgents have been successful approximately 43 percent of the time when they enjoyed sanctuary while success in counterinsurgency warfare ultimately hinges on the ability to work with the indigenous government and its security forces there are often signiﬁcant challenges in doing so the us military faces at least two challenges in this area first the security forces 32 daniel l byman deadly connections states that sponsor terrorism new york cam bridge university press 2005 pp 5378 33 fearon and laitin ethnicity insurgency and civil war 34 we assessed sanctuary using dichotomous variable yes if insurgents enjoyed signiﬁcant sanctuary in neighboring state or if they had little or sanctuary unpublished rand research for the us department of defensesuccess in counterinsurgency warfare 23 may be poorly trained or corrupt as daniel byman argues many us counterinsurgency allies have been characterized by poor intelligence lack of initiative little integration of forces across units soldiers who do not want to ﬁght bad leadership and problems with training and creativity 35 second the indigenous government may be illegitimate incom petent in providing basic services weak or corrupt at the outset of the afghan insurgency in 2002 for example the central government was extremely weak afghan territory has historically been controlled by tribes and warlords and its inhabitants have generally pledged loyalty to those with similar kinship ties and patrilineal descent rather than to the state authority 36 governance problems such as this can often be d i ﬃ c u l t t ﬁ x s p c i l l i n t h n r t r m i n t r n t i n l s s i s t n

these institutions have high transaction volumes are more deeply embedded in the social fabric are an important element of the states basis of legitimacy and are heavily inﬂuenced by the cultural norms and values that shape institutions in any society 37 conse quently establishing viable rule of law is an enormous challenge that can take long time to accomplish conclusion external actors can play an important role in insurgencies and coun terinsurgencies by tipping the balance in favor of either insurgents or the indigenous government however they usually cannot win it for either side since locals have to govern and establish order over the long run the indigenous force should be the default force of choice even if tactically successful unilateral operation by external forces may ultimately lead to failure by undermining and delegitimizing the very indigenous capability the external actor is trying to build 38 conse quently when the united states is involved in counterinsurgency warfare the primary focus of its eﬀorts should be to improve the performance and legitimacy of indigenous actors this includes improving the quality of the police and other security forces strengthening governance capacity and undermining external support for insurgents the rest of this study will further explore this argument 37 francis fukuyama statebuilding governance and

indigenous security forces and external support have been critical factors in the outcome of these insurgencies this ﬁnding has signiﬁcant implications for understanding the resurgence of the taliban

became president abolished the monarchy and forced zahir shah into exile in rome marxist army oﬃcers helped consolidate daouds position although this process was hampered by splits between the two main communist factions in afghanistan khalq the masses and parcham the ﬂag in 1978 khalq army oﬃcers engineered bloody coup which led to the death of daoud and his replacement by nur mohammad taraki violence between the rival factionsincluding the murder of tarakicoincided with wider rural revolts by islamist opponents of the communist regime moscow grew increasingly concerned about the deteriorating security situation and feared that tarakis successor haﬁzullah amin would turn to the west for assistance thus began afghanistans age of insurgency26 counterinsurgency in afghanistan legacy of war over the next three decades afghanistan experienced at least four major insurgencies the mujahideen wars against the soviet union 19791994 the rise of the taliban 19942001 the usbacked overthrow of the taliban regime 20012002 and the return of the taliban 2002present the objective of each of these insurgencies was to overthrow the existing regime and replace it with one more palatable to insurgent forces and their state sponsors many of the insurgent leadersincluding gulbuddin hekmatyar abdul rashid dostum jalaluddin haqqani and mullah mohammed omarplayed key roles in most or all of the insurgencies the mujahideen period in december 1979 the soviet union invaded afghanistan overthrew the afghan government and installed babrak karmal as leader but disparate collection of mujahideen insurgent groups resisted the soviet occupation the soviets were successful in controlling the major cities and provincial towns in the country but they never managed to take control of the countryside indeed the situation in rural areas worsened for the soviets and the afghan government as mujahideen forces steadily gained popular support support for the mujahideen from pakistan was critical variable pakistans interservices intelligence directorate isi provided money weapons training and other assistance to afghan insurgent groups funneling aid to the mujahideen from variety of other countries such as the united states and saudi arabia pakistan also provided sanctuary to mujahideen groups where they were generally safe from soviet forces 1 soviet losses mounted

name of their group taliban from the plural of talib an arabic word denoting an islamic student many members were drawn from madrassas islamic theology schools that had been established in afghan refugee camps in northeastern pakistan during the 1980s the taliban leadership headed by mullah omar presented itself as cleansing force that would rid the country of the factionalism corruption and violence that had predominated since the soviet withdrawal due to frustration and warweariness among the population in the south the taliban was initially well received its forces advanced rapidly

forces conducted series of oﬀensive attacks in kandahar khowst nangarhar kabul and other afghan provinces this marked the beginning of the latest insurgency after 2002 insurgent groups waged an increasingly violent campaign in afghanistan despite political progress in january 2004 for example afghans adopted new constitution in october 2004 they elected hamid karzai as president despite eﬀorts by the taliban and other insurgent groups to target those involved in the election in september 2005 afghans elected new parliament which included number of extaliban ministers at least several

steps however the insurgency continued to worsen key themes this brief overview of afghanistans age of insurgency highlights three factors that have contributed to the success of past insurgencies governance challenges external support and variations in the quality of security forces governance afghanistan has long history of decentralized governance following the second angloafghan war in 1880

various pashtun tribal coalitions however khan was unable to destroy tribal power and establish strong centrally controlled state 14 successive eﬀorts over the next century generally failed afghan territory has been controlled by tribes and local strongmen and its inhabitants have generally pledged loyalty to those with similar kinship ties and patrilineal descent rather than to central governing authority 15 one consequence of this power structure is that afghan governments have never been able to establish monopoly on the legitimate use of force inside the country the insurgencies that began with the 1979 soviet invasion and continued through the taliban conquests in the 1990s only served to increase afghanistans decentralized political structure in addition afghan governments have never established formal justice system in the absence of central government local shuras village councils and tribal elders developed an informal legal system that incorporated wide range of

taliban era the army was comprised of an assortment of armed groups with varying degrees of loyalties and professional skills there was formal military structure the army was not organized armed or commanded by the state 24 mullah mohammed omar was commander of the armed forces and ultimately decided on military strategies key appointments and military budgets military shura sat below omar helping to plan strategy and implement tactical decisions individual taliban commanders were responsible for recruiting men paying them and looking after their needs in the ﬁeld these ﬁeld commanders acquired much of the money fuel food transport and weapons they needed from the military shura the talibans military structure also included pakistani oﬃcers and qaeda members for example the elite brigade 055 consisted of pakistani sudanese and other foreign ﬁghters 25 conclusion this overview reiterates the argument laid out in chapter two gov ernance challenges external support and the capacity of indigenous security forces have been critical factors in the outcome of afghanistans insurgencies pakistan played two particularly important roles first the pakistan government especially the isi supported the victors of each insurgency the mujahideen taliban and us forces during the initial stages of operation enduring freedom since afghanistan and pakistan share 1160mile border pakistani leaders have historically viewed the ability to inﬂuence afghanistan as critical for strategic depth second afghan insurgent groups have repeatedly used pakistan as sanctuary these ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for understanding the talibans resurgence and assessing how they can be defeated the next three chapters will explore these ﬁndings and their implications by focusing on

coalition partners37chapter four insurgents and their support network this chapter examines afghan insurgent groups and their support network in the early stages of the insurgency it argues that critical independent variable in the success of any counterinsurgency is outside support for insurgents the insurgency in afghanistan included dangerous combination of local and transnational support afghan groups successfully acquired external support and assistance from the global jihadist network including groups with strong foothold in pakistan s u c h s q d th s c q u i r d s u p p r t f r m s m i n d i v i d u als in the pakistan government as well as local tribes criminal organizations and militias in pakistan and afghanistan this assistance enabled afghan insurgent groups to adapt their tactics techniques and proceduresto become in eﬀect learning organizationsand largely explains the resurgence of the taliban and other insurgent forces this chapter is divided into four sections the ﬁrst outlines the main insurgent groups the second examines their increasing ability to conduct violence the third section assesses why they have been successful in destabilizing the south and east especially their ability to gain external support the fourth oﬀers brief conclusion insurgent groups the insurgency in afghanistan included six main insurgent groups the taliban hezbiislami the haqqani network foreign ﬁghters mostly arabs and central asians tribes based in pakistan and afghanistan and criminal networks there is evidence of some coordination among 38 counterinsurgency in afghanistan these groups at the tactical operational and strategic levelsincluding through several shuras located in pakistan1 but there was uniﬁed leadership as figure 41 illustrates afghan insurgent groups fell into three loose fronts the northern front which included large hezbiislami presence was based in afghan provinces that include nurestan konar laghman and nangarhar as well as across the border in pakistan other groups such as lashkaretaiba and tehreekenefazeshariatmohammadi were also active on this front the central front included loose amalgam of foreign ﬁghters including central asians and arabs they were located in swath of territory near the afghanistanpakistan border from bajaur in the federally administered tribal areas in pakistan to khowst paktia and paktika in afghanistan the haqqani network was active in the central front against afghan and coalition forces finally the southern front which included large taliban presence was based in baluchistan and the federally administered tribal areas of pakistan as well around the afghan provinces of helmand kandahar oruzgan zabol and paktika in addition to the taliban several drug and tribal groups were also active in the southern front the taliban the taliban have historically been motivated to impose radical interpretation of sunni islam in afghanistan which is derived from the deobandi school of thought 2 their primary strategies for accomplish ing this objective have long been to overthrow the afghan government break the political will of the united states and its coalition partners 1 on

counterinsurgency in afghanistan the taliban has traditionally involved two main tiers the top tier included the leadership structure and key military and political guerrillas and commanders they were motivated by radical version of islam and saw the insurgency as ﬁght between islam and western inﬁdels and the wests puppet government in kabul the taliban leadership was comprised of mullah omar and his senior lieutenants many of whom were based in quetta pakistan 5 second shura was based in pakistans federally administered tribal areas and revolved around such individuals as sirajuddin haqqani who commanded several hundred ﬁghters and was loosely allied with taliban leadership 6 his base of support was in the afghan provinces of khowst logar paktia and paktika as well as in waziristan 7 haqqani cooperated with the paki stan government including the military and isi he enjoyed support base and ran madrassas in and around miranshah and mir ali 8 in addition the taliban organized parallel afghan government which ﬁnancial and political support network for insurgent groups making it virtually impossible to reliably estimate the total number of guerrillas and their support base these reasons make it more diﬃcult to estimate the number of insurgents than to estimate the size of state military forces on the taliban numbers the author interviewed us european and afghan oﬃcials

governors for afghan provinces and ministers for such areas as defense and justice9 the bottom tier of taliban guerrillas included thousands of local afghan ﬁghters they were primarily men from rural villages who were paid to set up roadside bombs launch rockets and mortars at nato and afghan forces or pick up gun for few days most were not ideologically committed to jihad rather they were motivated by unemployment disenchantment with the lack of change since 2001 or anger over the killing or wounding of local villager by afghan us or nato forces some fought because of grievances with the afghan government or because of abuse either actual or perceived by afghan or coalition forcessuch as bombings and intrusive house searches hezbiislami gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbiislami which included several hundred ﬁghters sought to overthrow the government of afghanistan and install hekmatyar as leader 10 hekmatyar is pashtun from the imam sahib district of kunduz and served as afghanistans prime minister from march 1993 to 1994 and again brieﬂy in 1996 his group has traditionally found support in the areas around the afghan provinces of konar nurestan nangarhar paktia and

assistance15 the success or failure of the guerrilla force depends to great extent on the logistics support networks ability to gain support from the tribal populations in afghanistan and pakistan individuals in this group assisted the insurgency by acquiring supplies including food water and ammunition conducting information and intelligence campaigns operating medical facilities conducting counter intelligence operations recruiting new guerrillas or supporters operating communication systems and acquiring and maintaining equipment the ﬁnancial and political support network was focused on acquiring money and other types of assistance from government and nongovernment sources and establishing political relations with friendly governments tribal leaders and other groups it also worked to recruit new members from madrassas tribes and foreign countries the guerrillas were the armed insurgents who conducted military and paramilitary operations insurgent groups also paid localsespecially youthsto conduct lowlevel operations such as harassing ﬁre at us or coalition forces the taliban often paid these local youths two or three times the daily rate of pay of ana and anp units suggesting that some insurgents were motivated more by ﬁnancial than ideological incentives 16 finally the commanders provided strategic orga nization commanders did not exert control in traditional military terms rather guerrilla units were often given tactical and operational autonomy 17 14 herd et one valley at time pp 6776 15 key afghan cities for the support network include those along the ring road such as kabul jalalabad ghazni gardez qalat kandahar and herat in addition the main auxiliary lines include the old trade routes and way stations that connect afghanistan cities to iran and afghanistan examples include the old silk road to tehran pepper route through peshawar and on to india route through the khyber pass to peshawar and route from spin boldak to quetta 16 in the summer of 2006 for example us and nato military oﬃcials reported that the taliban paid locals in some areas roughly 14 per day to ﬁght compared to approximately 4 for many ana soldiers 17 herd et one

an amalgam of loosely knit muslim extremists including qaeda forces their ranks were made up primarily of two major types individuals from the caucasus and central asia such as chechens uzbeks and tajiks and arabs such as saudis egyptians and libyans several waves of arabs settled in waziristan during the mujahideen wars against the soviets and more recently after the us and northern alliance overthrow of the taliban regime number of foreigners were directly or indirectly aﬃliated with qaeda though some were simply inspired by the broader jihadist goal of pushing the united states and its western allies out of afghanistan 18 qaeda played an important role as an enabler of the taliban and had close relations with several pakistan militant groups such as jaish muhammad harakat ul

pre911 qaeda organization19 osama bin laden and zawahiri relied on an informal infrastructure of militants and tribes to survive travel communicate and conduct operations first forged during the afghan jihad of the 1980s these relationships were institutionalized in the late 1990s when qaeda trained and catalogued tens of thousands of pakistani militants in camps inside afghanistan qaeda was deeply involved in suicide terrorism which will be discussed in more detail below for example croma yahya suicide bomber from mali who failed to kill balkh governor atta mohammad nur had qaeda links and came to afghanistan through pakistan 20 as lt general michael maples head of the defense intelligence agency argued qaeda will remain engaged in afghanistan for ideological and operational reasons taliban and other anticoalition militants are adopting qaeda tactics in afghanistan 21 the map in figure 42 illustrates pakistans tribal areas which stretch for 500 miles along the afghanistanpakistan border the foreign ﬁghters often acted as franchises to qaeda they had autonomy at the tactical and operational level but often took guidance from more senior qaeda or other commanders at the strategic level their strategic objectives were much broader than those embraced by hezbiislami and taliban forces they adopted strict interpretation of islam embraced jihad against the us and other allied governments and sought to eradicate western military forces and inﬂu 19 qaeda today can be conceptualized in several dimensions the ﬁrst includes qaeda aﬃliates and associates these are terrorist groups that have directly beneﬁted from osama bin ladens spiritual guidance and received substantial training arms money and other assistance the second includes amorphous groups of qaeda adherents who may have received some training in qaeda facilities some encouragement and direction and perhaps minimal amount of assistance the third dimension includes homegrown islamic radicals who have direct connection with qaeda but who nonetheless are prepared to carry out attacks in solidarity with qaedas radical jihadist agenda the ﬁnal dimension is qaeda central see for example bruce

diﬃcult for counterinsurgent forces to target insurgents who have retreated to these sanctuaries which allow the insurgents to regroup resupply and recruit new members statistical evidence shows that mountainous terrain can provide particularly useful sanctuary for insurgent groups because it is diﬃcult for indigenous and external counterinsurgent forces to navigate and easier for insurgents to hide in 47 this presented particular challenge in afghan istan since the border areas and sanctuary in pakistan included some of the worlds most rugged mountainous terrain 48 support from external states insurgen t groups were successful at leveraging assistance from exter nal statesespecially in pakistan there are indications that support from pakistan included two major components assistance from some oﬃcials in the pakistan government and the freedom to operate on pakistani soil oﬃcials in the pakistan government had ideological and geostrate gic motivations as pakistans former dictator

to the taliban in the 1990s and early 2000s to ensure that it had an ally in kabul the motivation of those in the isi assisting the taliban in the mid2000s was similar to increase the likelihood over the long term that the government of afghanistan or at least those controlling the areas of afghanistan near pakistan was controlled by allies balancing against india appeared to be particularly strong impetus for pakistans support of the insurgents pakistan and india have long been involved in balanceofpower struggle in south asia both lay claim to the kashmir region and fought at least three wars over kashmir since 1947 since september 11 2001 india provided several hundred million dollars in ﬁnancial assistance to afghanistan including funds to assist afghan political candidates

with the taliban government in afghanistan which it had nurtured since the 1990s half decade later pakistan was surrounded by hostile states consequently for some pakistani oﬃcials assisting insurgents in afghanistan was way to balance against indian inﬂuence in afghanistan maximize pakistans inﬂuence in the border regions and prevent the pashtuns on both sides of the border from developing uniﬁed front and pushing for integration into afghanistan some active and former pakistan government oﬃcials from organizations such as the isi and frontier corps provided logistical support to the taliban and helped secure medical care for wounded insurgents in cities such as quetta they also helped train taliban and other insurgents destined for afghanistan and kashmir in quetta mansehra shamshattu parachinar and other areas within pakistan to minimize its visibility these individuals appeared to supply indirect assistanceincluding ﬁnancial assistanceto taliban training camps nato oﬃcials uncovered several instances in which isi operatives provided intelligence to taliban insurgents at the tactical operational and strategic levels this included tipping oﬀ taliban forces

at safe houses in and around such provinces as kandahar the taliban used roads such as highway 4 in kandahar province to transport ﬁghters and supplies between afghanistan and pakistan 55 pakistans

in afghanistan military promised to end major operations in the area and pull most of its soldiers back to military camps the logic of these deals seems intuitive in areas where tribes exert political military and economic power the most eﬀective longterm solution was to create incentives for tribal leaders to police their areas after all these tribal areas had been ruled indigenously for hundreds of years and tribes often regard outside forces including pakistans military as unwelcome foreigners but there were several problems with this strategy first it rested on false assumption since it presumed that tribes actually controlled these areas closer look at the tribal areas indicated that insurgents and terrorists like the taliban increasingly exerted control in many cases they usurped the power of tribes expecting tribes to police areas they did not even control was wishful thinking second the tribal deals failed to curb crossborder activity and undermine the power of the taliban and other militant groups there nato oﬃcials i interviewed argued that insurgents crossed the border in greater numbers 57 as former pakistan foreign minister najmuddin shaikh acknowledged in pakistans dawn newspaper there is doubt that the waziristan agreement has led to increased taliban inﬂuence 58 third there was enforcement mechanism were the tribal deals to fail why should tribes cooperate assuming they could if there was penalty for defection pakistans military expressed deep unwillingness to enter the tribal areas again indeed afghan insurgents used pakistan as staging area for oﬀensive operations taliban insurgents that operated in the southern afghan provinces of kandahar oruzgan helmand and zabol had signiﬁcant support networks in such pakistani provinces as

pakistan was reluctant to conduct operations in baluchistan against taliban insurgents or their support network 65 as one pakistani journalist argued the pakistan govern ment plunges into action when they know they can lay their hands on foreign militant but they are still reluctant to proceed against the taliban 66 part of the reason may be that the pakistan government was preoccupied with other security concerns in such provinces as baluchistan where it was ﬁghting counterinsurgency campaign against baluch tribes 67 in addition to pakistan iran has historically been active in afghanistan iranian policymakers have long been interested in securing strategic depth and inﬂuence in afghanistan following the overthrow of the taliban regime in 2001 the iranian government funded reconstruction projects in afghanistan including road construction projects and provided aid to some warlords this behavior was consistent with the activities of such regional powers as pakistan india and russia indeed the iranian strategy in afghanistan after the overthrow of the taliban is perhaps best characterized as hedging strategy 68 64 pakistan strikes suspected qaeda camp associated press march 1 2006 65 there have been some notable exceptions such as the pakistani governments capture of taliban spokesman abdol latifollah hakimi in october 2005 the pakistani government has also closed

the taliban and other insurgent groups iran historically had poor relations with the taliban as one iranian diplomat noted in 1997 for example iran joined russia and the antitaliban alliance against pakistan saudi arabia and the taliban because it was concerned about the rise of sunni extremist groups like the taliban 71 jihadist support another source of support for the insurgency in afghanistan

their cooperation with jamiateulema islam this pakistani political party had its roots in the deobandi movement and had following largely conﬁned to the pashtun border belt of the north west frontier province and baluchistan although it also has support in several of pakistans urban centers the deobandi movement developed in britishruled india during the mid1800s it was an oﬀshoot of the sunni hanaﬁ legal school and took its name from the indian himalayan town of deoband the location of an inﬂuential religious school the deobandi movement aimed to reform and unify muslims preached strict adherence to the sunnah the way or deeds of the prophet muhammad and emphasized the importance of sharia law jamiateulema islam was split into two factions led by maulana fazal urrehman and samiul haq fervent supporter of osama bin laden the party ran an extensive network of madrassas that trained most of the leadership and much of the early rank and ﬁle of the taliban party links with the taliban

as training centers and labs where recruits experimented with ied technology these facilities were located in such remote places as the bush mountains khamran mountains and shakai valley qaeda received operational and ﬁnancial support from local clerics and taliban commanders in waziristan they recruited young pashtuns from the local madrassas and ﬁnanced their activities through religious racketforced religious contribution often accompanied with death threats some of this ied expertise came from iraqi groups which provided information to afghan groups on making and using various kinds of remotecontrolled devices and timers indeed there is evidence of cooperation between insurgents in iraq and afghanistan islamic militants in iraq provided information through the internet and facetoface visits on tactics to taliban hezbiislami and foreign ﬁghters from eastern and southern afghanistan and pakistans tribal areas in addition there is some evidence that small number of pakistani and afghan militants received military training in iraq iraqi ﬁghters met with afghan and pakistani extremists in pakistan and militants in afghanistan increasingly used homemade bombs

example insurgents posted video to qaedalinked web sites showing the decapitation of an afghan hostagethe ﬁrst time video of the beheading of an afghan hostage was shown 75 the taliban also acquired new commercial communication gear and ﬁeld equipment from iraqi groups and received good tactical camouﬂage and marksmanship training from them as well in addition afghan insurgents increasingly adopted suicide tac tics especially in major cities such as kandahar and kabul 76 the number of suicide attacks increased steadily one in 2002 two in 2003 six in 2004 and twentyseven in 2005 there were 139 suicide terrorist attacks in afghanistan in 2006 and 140 in 2007 77 the use of sui cide attacks was encouraged by qaeda leaders in pakistan such as ayman alzawahiri who argued for the need to concentrate on the method of martyrdom operations as the most successful way of inﬂicting damage against the opponent and the least costly to the mujahedin in terms of casualties 78 suicide bombers

its public rhetoric the taliban has tended to identify the suicide bombers as afghans since it suggests that there is signiﬁcant indigenous component of the insurgency insurgents and their support network 65 madrassas where they were radicalized and immersed in extremist ideologies80 several factors can be attributed to the rise in suicide attacks81 first the taliban successfully tapped into the expertise and training of the broader jihadist community especially qaeda jihadists imparted knowledge on suicide tactics to afghan groups through the internet and in facetoface visits with qaedas assistance these militants helped supply steady stream of suicide bombers second qaeda and the taliban concluded that suicide bombing was more eﬀective than other tactics in killing afghan and coalition forces this was direct result of the success of such groups as hamas in the palestinian territories hezbollah in lebanon the tamil tigers in sri lanka and iraqi groups 82 suicide attacks allowed insurgents to achieve maximum impact with minimal resources data show that when insurgents ﬁght us and coalition forces directly in afghanistan there is only 5 percent probability of inﬂicting casualties with suicide attacks the chance of killing people and instilling fear increased several fold 83 third qaeda and the taliban believed that suicide attacks increased the level of insecurity among the afghan population this caused some afghans to question the governments ability to protect them and further destabilized 80 author interviews with nato oﬃcials in kandahar afghanistan january

counterinsurgency in afghanistan the authority of local government institutions fourth suicide attacks provided renewed visibility for the taliban and qaeda which previous guerrilla attacks did not generate because of their lethality and highproﬁle nature every suicide attack was reported in the national and international media in sum the international jihadist network provided signiﬁcant support to afghan insurgent groups qaeda eﬀectively spread its extremist global ideology in afghanistan and pakistan it played critical role in providing encouragement and impetus for the utilization of suicide attacks and sophisticated ieds qaeda also paid up to several thousand dollars to the families of suicide bombers who perished in operations in afghanistan in addition some taliban units included qaeda members or other arab ﬁghters who brought with them tactics employed in such places as iraq and chechnya 84 conclusion external support from state and nonstate actors was critical to the return of the taliban and the rise of the insurgency in afghanistan beginning in 2002 support came from individuals in the pakistan government and the international jihadist movement including qaeda insurgent groups with signiﬁcant external support and wellestablished sanctuaries in neighboring states have frequently been successful this is recurring lesson across insurgencies since at least 1945 chapter seven will explore in more depth us capabilities that might be useful to counter external support networks 84 author interview with us government oﬃcials kabul afghanistan december 200567chapter five afghan government and security forces this chapter examines lessons from the conduct of the afghan govern ment and security forces it argues that two critical variables related to the indigenous government impact the success or failure of counterinsurgency operations the quality of indigenous forces and governance capacity key afghan forces include the anp ana and range of allied militia forces such as the afghan national auxiliary police building on the argument made in the previous chapter that insurgents were increasingly able to conduct violence in the south and east of afghanistan due in large part to external support and sanctuary this chapter contends that afghan forces were mixed bag as far as their ability to establish security the ana was relatively competent in combat operations while the police were largely incompetent and corrupt this chapter also contends that the weakness of afghanistans central government was problematic corruption within the government was detrimental to the counterinsurgency campaign and decreased popular support for the afghan government lessons from the afghan government and its security forces can be grouped into two broad categories the capability of indigenous forces including afghanistans intelligence agency and the governance capacity of national provincial and district government institutions capability of indigenous forces the competence of afghanistans indigenous security forces is diﬃ cult to judge for two reasons first many of the most useful metrics 68 counterinsurgency in afghanistan are qualitative rather than quantitative and diﬃcult to measure accu rately examples include the performance of security forces in conducting cordonandsearch operations patrols border security riot control intelligence collection and combat operations 1 second little data have been systematically collected for several decades in afghanistan for example there are reliable statistics on homicide

competent of the afghanistan government forces the ﬁrst team of german police trainers arrived in kabul in march 2002 to train police instructors this training was critical since afghan police had not received any formal training for at least two decades 2 the germans focused on training inspectors and lieutenants at the police academy in kabul oﬃcers went through threeyear training course and took classes on human rights tactical operations narcotics investigations traﬃc criminal investigations computer skills and islamic law 3 by 2003 however us oﬃcials from the department of state department of defense and the white house became increasingly unhappy with the german approach many argued that it was far too slow trained too few police oﬃcers and was seriously underfunded 4 consequently the

forces 69 united states concentrated on training lowerlevel recruits at cen tral training center in kabul as well as at regional training centers in outlying cities such as kandahar mazare sharif gardez and jalalabad the department of states bureau of international narcotics and law forcement contracted dyncorp to train the police and to help build training facilities 5 beginning in 2005 the us military took over the lead us police training role after rising concerns in the us department of defense about the eﬀectiveness of the police program key problems included the failures to conduct followon mentoring of afghan police to provide signiﬁcant institutional reform in the ministry of interior and to curb deepseated corruption in the police and ministry of interior 6 the us military provided training equipment and other assistance to anp and internal security forces through the combined security transition commandafghanistan the available evidence suggests that the anp was corrupt and often unable to perform basic patrolling conduct counterinsurgency operations protect reconstruction projects prevent border incursions or conduct counternarcotics operations multiple interviews with us and other nato oﬃcials involved in police training from 2004 through 2008 indicate that corruption was pervasive in the anp police regularly took bribes to allow drugs and other licit and illicit goods to pass along routes they controlled police chiefs were frequently involved in skimming money they received to pay their police oﬃcers 7 indeed corruption appeared to be more pervasive in the police than in other security forces 8 multiple interviews by the author with us oﬃcials in washington and afghanistan in 2004 and 2005 5 author interview with employees of dyncorp

inadequately armed 12 the anp was vital to establishing order in urban and rural areas but it was badly equipped corrupt poorly trained and lacked any semblance of national police infrastructure there

also security more broadly several factors contributed to the poor competence of the anp international training was not as good as it was for the ana the police were not an international priority in the early stages of the insurgency and received signiﬁcantly less money and attention than the ana interviews with us and german oﬃcials involved in police training suggest that there were signiﬁcant challenges with dyncorp the usbased company hired by the us department of state to implement police training at regional training centers across afghanistan one recurring criticism was wide variation in the quality of dyncorp police trainers some had signiﬁcant international police training experience and were competent in dealing with police in tribal society in the middle of an insurgency but many other dyncorp trainers had little experience or competence 14 the use of private contractors for police training or other tasks during counterinsurgency and nationbuilding operations has long been controversial 15 at the very least the us government should conduct thorough assessment of the performance and eﬀectiveness of contractors in police training in addition the lack of followon mentoring meant that police were given few weeks of training and sent back to their villages with oversight and assistance most had never received formal police training ana soldiers beneﬁted from embedded international trainers when they deployed into the ﬁeld and the ana almost always deployed with us and other coalition military forces but the anp lacked comprehensive mentoring program us oﬃcials argued even in 2008 that security concerns in the south and east precluded the deployment of mentoring teams to rural areas this meant that in areas where competent anp was essential because

afghanistan of the taliban there was virtually mentoring the lack of mentor ing made police more susceptible to local warlords indeed anp forces were frequently more loyal to local warlords tribal leaders and even criminal networks than to the central government this reﬂects the weakness of the central government and the strength of nonstate actors in much of the country in counterinsurgency operations the police need to be involved in the community at all levels such as monitoring border posts and patrolling cities villages and highways building the police in counterinsurgencies should be higher priority than the creation of the army because the police are the primary arm of the government in towns and villages across the country unfortunately this was not the case in afghanistan the anp needed to be at the forefront of ﬁghting insurgents illegal border incursions illicit drug trade warlords and organized crime in afghanistan but they were overwhelmed unfortunately the

were deployed throughout afghani stan to conduct combat operations against taliban and other insurgent forces and to oversee the cantonment of heavy weapons in july 2003 for example the ana launched operation warrior sweep with us forces in the paktia province against taliban and qaeda forces this was followed in november 2003 by operation mountain resolve in the nuristan and kunar provinces the

operation ticonderoga in number of provinces in the east and south including kandahar kunar uruzgan helmand and paktia in other provinces such as herat the government deployed ana and police forces to patrol roads secure government and buildings and institute curfew following the removal of ismail khan in 2005 ana forces participated in such campaigns as operation catania in kunar province which targeted insurgent hideouts prior to the september parliamentary elections 20 in 2006 ana soldiers played key role in number of oﬀensive campaigns to kill or capture insurgents including operation

intelligence about insurgents their support network and weapon caches third training from us and coalition forces was critical factor in improving the anas competence 24 despite their increasing competence however ana forces still suﬀered from lack of indigenous air support and the absence of selfsustaining operational budget they also relied on embedded international forces and us air support during combat the ana was underresourced which was major morale factor for soldiers they had shoddy small arms and there were numerous reports of soldiers using weapons seized from the taliban who some believe were better armed many soldiers had little ammunition and few magazines numerous ana units did not have mortars and had few machine guns few mk19 grenade machine guns and artillery they had almost helicopter or ﬁxedwing transport as well as attack aviation they had body armor or blast glasses kevlar 25 helmets up armored humvees or light armor tracked vehicles with machine gun cupolas and slat armor 26 this impacted their ability to conduct tained operations against wellequipped taliban forces other afghan security forces there is some evidence that afghan security forces

afghanistan dence that these local militia forces weakened the power of the central government the afghan national auxiliary police was established in 2006 because of the low quality of the anp the inadequate number of ana soldiers in the south and the growing level of insurgent violence in the south and east these developments led to calls within the afghan government and nato for paramilitary police force equipped and trained to ﬁght the taliban some also supported the creation of an auxiliary police force as way to lure young ﬁghters from local villages away from the taliban the auxiliary police force was designed to secure static checkpoints provide community policing and deploy with nato military forces during operations recruits were chosen by local tribal elders and many worked for local warlords field reports from the south indicated that they were competent in battle 27 how ever there were several concerns with the auxiliary force one was that they were legalized militia more loyal to local warlords than to the central government second was suspicion that taliban members inﬁltrated the auxiliary police force the afghan government and nato targeted ﬁghters that couldor perhaps already hadfought for the taliban but were not ideologically committed to deobandism or jihad against the west this strategy risked opening the door to taliban sympathizers third was the minimal training that recruits received auxiliary police recruits went through twoweek training course which included lessons on the afghan constitution human rights the use of weapons and basic police tactics at the end of the course the recruits were given an ak47 gun and sent to their home districts this training was not suﬃcient besides the auxiliary police the us and other coalition forces worked with or established number of local militias these militias performed wide range of missions including providing base camp security participating in direct action operations helping to hunt high value targets conducting counternarcotics operations and providing border security in paktika province for example single squadsize team of us soldiers recruited companysized element of afghans 27 author interview with nato and afghan oﬃcials afghanistan january 2007afghan government and security forces 77 to conduct combat operations and stabilization missions they also recruited another similarly sized unit that provided force protection at remote ﬁre bases from which the us soldiers operated 28 these units occupied the same areas of operation as the ana and had similar mission but they faced fewer organizational problems and desertion was practically nonexistent soldiers were paid well and regularly striking contrast from ana and anp forces incompetent leaders and undisciplined soldiers were often quickly and severely punished the best soldiers could expect to move up to positions of increasing responsibility and pay based on fair criteria as one us military assessment concluded afghan militia forces led every mounted patrol and most major operations partly because they knew the ground better and could more easily spot something that was out of place or suspicious 29 such forces were often used for the outer perimeter of cordonandsearch operations they surrounded villages and stopped insurgents from escaping in several operations such as the battle of deh chopan in august 2003 they were critical in providing intelligence and the bulk of the maneuver force 30 as discussed below however the us governments use of militia forces also weakened the central government and strengthened local warlords national directorate for security there is little unclassiﬁed data on the activities and performance of afghanistans intelligence agency the national directorate for security nds but its role is critical in counterinsurgency operations as david galula wrote in his book counterinsurgency warfare gathering intelligence in counterinsurgency campaign

population but the population will not talk unless it feels safe and it does not feel safe until the insurgents power has been broken 31 in afghanistan this posed challenge for nds activities in rural areas in which the taliban enjoyed support base in spite of these challenges nds agents became increasingly involved in intelligence collection and psychological operations in rural areas of the south and east including the use of informant networks one key target was mosques since the taliban was successful in coopting some mullahs the nds focused on inﬂuencing nationalist mullahs supportive of the afghan government or at minimum opposed to the taliban as nds director amrullah saleh argued we should put our weight behind the nationalist ones and not allow the militant or fanatic ones to take over this is only possible if we keep the nationalist ones on our payrolls 32 the nds also enjoyed some counterinsurgency success in urban cities such as kabul in late 2006 for example nds agents inﬁltrated and took down several suicide terrorism cells in kabul with assistance from western intelligence agencies 33 governance good governance is critical to eﬀective counterinsurgency operations over the long run because it helps to ensure sustained popular support for the government as an nds report concluded the ﬁrst requirement of countering taliban at the village level requires good

elections and 2005 parliamentary elections established democratically elected central government in afghanistan however they did not create strong central government indeed the weakness of afghanistans central government and the role of regional warlords and tribal militias posed signiﬁcant challenge to the counter insurgency campaign as the afghanistan national security councils national threat assessment concluded nonstatutory armed forces and their commanders pose direct threat to the national security of afghanistan they are the principal obstacle to the expansion of the rule of law into the provinces and thus the achievement of the social economic goals that the people of afghanistan their government supported by the international community to deliver 35 afghanistan has historically lacked strong central government but the reliance of usled coalition forces on warlords contributed to the empowerment of factional commanders and the weakness of the central government 36 this began in 2001 when the us military and cia cooperated with northern alliance and other military forces to overthrow the taliban regime and it continued over the course of the insurgency but the assistance supplied to warlords in the south and east by us and coalition forces as part of operation enduring freedom was doubleedged sword while some cooperation may have been

production as well as increased trade and transport routes through such neighboring countries as pakistan 39 in july 2000 mullah omar banned the cultivationthough not the traﬃckingof opium poppy which the taliban eﬀectively enforced the ban caused temporary decrease in the cultivation and production of opium poppy in 2001 but the damage had been done as afghanistan had already become major producer of opium poppy it was the worlds largest producer of poppy during the taliban rule when the country was the source of 70 percent of global illicit poppy the cultivation production and trade in opium

precursor chemicals for the conversion of opium into morphine base acetic anhydride which is the most commonly used acetylating agent in heroin processing was smuggled into afghanistan from pakistan india central asia china and europe the largest processing labs were primarily located in badakshan nangarhar and helmand 42 most of the opiates produced in afghanistan were smuggled to markets in the west although some was consumed in afghanistan as both opium and heroin afghan heroin was traﬃcked via many routes with traﬃckers adjusting smuggling routes based on law enforcement and political actions traﬃckers in afghanistan primarily relied on vehicles and overland routes to move drug shipments out of the country illicit drug convoys transited southern and western pakistan while smaller shipments of heroin were sent through the frontier provinces to karachi for onward shipment most of the afghan heroin that made its way to the united states originated in such provinces as nangarhar and transited pakistan 43 the drug trade has traditionally been source of revenue for war lords insurgents and criminal organizations as well as members of the afghan government 44 in june 2005 for example the us drug enforcement agency and afghan counternarcotics police raided the oﬃces of sher mohammed akhundzada governor of helmand province they found over nine metric tons of opium stashed there 45 it is diﬃcult to assess why cultivation numbers dropped brieﬂy in 2005 before rising again in 2006 but most of the reduction appears to have been the result of persuasion and coercion the

2004 to 2005 using prevention techniques and intimidation by afghan police the us government also provided economic assistance almost threefourths of the eradication 72 percent took place in nangarhar and helmand provinces where in 2004 poppy cultivation was ranked highest in the nation 47 viable and sustainable incomegeneration programs need to be established to support eradication eﬀorts and to help convince some farmers not to cultivate in some locations eradication was accompanied by alternative livelihood programs material support and signiﬁcant political persuasion the provinces where declines in cultivation were most striking in 2005 nangarhar96 percent badakshan53 percent or where cultivation remained relatively stable helmand10 percent were the three provinces that received the largest contributions for alternative development nangarhar received 701 million in assistance and badakshan and helmand received 47 3 million and 557 million respectively 48 in spite of these

governments inability to decrease the power of warlords and exert control over the country impacted justice sector reform warlord commanders who were allowed to maintain facto control over areas seized following the overthrow of the taliban regime established authority over local courts the factional control of courts led to intimidation of centrally appointed judges second the afghan governments inability and unwillingness to address widespread and deeprooted corruption decreased the eﬀectiveness of the justice system corruption has long been endemic in the justice system partly because unqualiﬁed personnel loyal to various factions are sometimes installed as court oﬃcials the supreme court and attorney generals oﬃce were accused of signiﬁcant corruption 51 the world bank concluded that afghanistan was one of the most corrupt governments in the world 52 corrupt judiciary is serious impediment to the success of counterinsurgency campaign it threatens to further

governance capacity was mixed in afghanistan as noted in chapter two the eﬀectiveness of counterinsurgency operations can be directly correlated with the competence of indigenous security forces and the strength of governance this has been recurring lesson across insurgencies since at least 1945 the recommendations put forth in chapter seve n will explore in more depth us capabilities that might be useful in improving indigenous capabilities 51 author interview with deputy minister of justice mohammad qasim hashimzai kabul afghanistan june 26 2004 rama mani ending impunity and building

examines us and coalition forces in afghanistan the united states initially played the lead role in the counterinsurgency campaign though command and control over most international forces shifted to nato in late 2006 whereas chapters four and five focused on such critical factors as the role of external support for insurgents the legitimacy and capacity of the indigenous government and the quality of local forces this chapter examines six areas related directly to us eﬀorts building indigenous capacityt direct action against insurgentst intelligencet information operationst coalition operationst civilmilitary aﬀairst it argues that us and coalition eﬀorts had mixed results first us counterinsurgency capabilities were most eﬀective when they leveraged the afghan government and indigenous forces provincial reconstruction teams prts and team village missions were eﬀective in rebuilding some infrastructure and garnering popular support special forces were particularly eﬀective in conducting kinetic and nonkinetic operations with afghan forces and building indigenous capacity human intelligence humint and civilmilitary operations were often most eﬀective when conducted using indigenous forces and indigenous leaders such as muslim clerics and tribal elders were helpful in con88 counterinsurgency in afghanistan ducting information operations second us forces were least eﬀec tive when they acted unilaterally and failed to leverage the indigenous government and its forces in some areas such as inside pakistan there were sustained counterinsurgency operations by pakistani or international forces the ability to integrate indigenous forces into operations and to conduct civilmilitary operations during the counterinsurgency campaign also varied depending on whether us conventional or unconventional ground forces were involved again special forces were particularly eﬀective building indigenous capacity chapter five focused on the quality and legitimacy of afghan security forces and argued that there were notable problems with the anp this section looks more speciﬁcally at the us light footprint approach and the use of indigenous forces during operations metaphorically counterinsurgency is about teaching people to ﬁsh not about doing it for them one of the most signiﬁcant lessons from us and coalition experiences in afghanistan is the importance of advising training and assisting the host nations ministries and security forcesand helping shift popular support from the insurgents to the host nation 1 for insurgent groups popular support is an overriding strategic objective as mao tsetung argued the richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people 2 counterinsurgency operations must separate insurgents from their support base the united states adopted twopronged strategy for counterin surgency operations in afghanistan the ﬁrst part involved the establishment of an indigenous rather than international government as noted in chapter five public opinion polls conducted in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated that roughly 85 percent of afghans interviewed had very favorable or somewhat favorable view of hamid karzai the 1 herd world war iii 2 mao tsetung selected military writings of mao tsetung peking china foreign lan guages press 1963 p 260us and coalition forces 89 ﬁrst posttaliban president of afghanistan3 the united states and its allies fostered the rapid creation of national afghan government that included representatives from major ethnic groups this new government began to form even before major combat operations terminated on december 5 2001 afghan delegates executed the bonn agreement which established an interim administration under hamid karzai and called for an emergency loya jirga to establish transitional authority karzai became head of state in june 2002 and president in october 2004 following the countrys ﬁrst national election the establishment of an interim indigenousrather than internationalgovernment gave the population sense of ownership as zalmay khalilzad special envoy and former us ambassador to afghanistan argued the fact that the afghans played key role in their own liberation gave them sense of dignity and ownership of their destiny 4 the second prong of the us approach involved maintaining light military footprint in afghanistan the united states did not invade afghanistan with large numbers of forces us oﬃcials adopted lightfootprint approach for several reasons they wanted to prevent largescale resistance similar to what the soviet union encountered in the 1980s they believed that small numbers of ground troops and airpower were suﬃcient to establish security and they were deeply reluctant to become involved in nationbuilding 5 indeed several great

ended our footprint had to be small for both military and geopolitical reasons i envisioned total of about 10000 american soldiers airmen special operators and helicopter assault crews along with robust incountry close air support 6 this strategy worked well during the overthrow of the taliban government but it had two drawbacks for the stability operation phase which began after the overthrow of the taliban regime first there were too few us and afghan government forces to stabilize the country 7 afghan militia forces had to ﬁll the security vacuum which in the long run undermined the power of the central government figure 61 illustrates the per capita level of external forces in 17 stability operations since world war ii the united states had one of the lowest per capita levels in afghanistan among all these operations which even included number of operations in africa and asia this created challenge in targeting taliban hezbiislami and qaeda insurgents in the early stages of the insurgencysuch as 2002 and 2003since there were virtually trained and legitimate afghan military and police nor were there suﬃcient forces to secure afghanistans borders insurgent forces beneﬁted from porous borders along the afghanistanpakistan frontier as well as from assistance from sources in pakistan and the muslim world channeled through pashtun tribesmen in the border region second this strategy drew the wrong lesson from the soviet expe rience the key lesson from the soviet experience was not the number of soviet forces deployed but rather how they were used the soviets fought the wrong war they fought conventional war against an unconventional opponent as one of the most comprehensive studies of soviet combat tactics in afghanistan concluded the soviet army that marched into

up an important dilemma lead indigenous eﬀort is critical over the long run for successful counterinsurgency operations even if tactically successful unilateral external operation may ultimately lead to failure by unseating the very indigenous capability that the external actor is trying to build but what if there is competent government force in the early stages of an insurgency in the afghan case there were afghan army forces and trained police while there are ideal options in these situations the most eﬀective strategy may be to work with those legitimate indigenous forces especially police that exist b eﬀectively train and mentor them as quickly as possible and c temporarily backﬁll indigenous security forces with suﬃcient numbers of us and other international forces to accomplish key security tasks these tasks include patrolling streets and villages monitoring borders and protecting critical infrastructure higher per capita levels of us and coalition military and police forces might have been useful in the immediate aftermath of the talibans overthrow preparations for the war in iraq made this increasingly difﬁcult because us troops were needed for combat operations there once counterinsurgency operations began the united states experienced varying degrees of success in working with indigenous forces special forces were particularly successful at integrating ana anp and afghan militia forces in virtually all aspects of combat and civilmilitary operations indigenous forces were involved in conducting strike operations interdicting enemy forces along the border participating in reconstruction eﬀorts and gathering intelligence 10 s m c n v n t i n l u n i t s w r l s s u c c s s f u l i n w r k i n g w i t h indigenous forces for example

knew the ground better and could more easily spot something that was out of place or suspicious11 but others were less successful during operation mountain sweep for example paratroopers from the 82nd airborne conducted operations unilaterally their heavyhanded tactics created signiﬁcant resentment among locals in khowst province 12 us soldiers angered afghan villagers on numerous occasions out of naiveté of afghan social and cultural traditions leading one afghan government report to conclude it will be diﬃcult for ever for the coalition forces to fully befriend the people instead they should try to minimize their contact with the local population and increasingly empower the afghan forces to do the job the more they try to be in touch with people the more they will be prone to make cultural mistakes 13 direct action against insurgents us military forces succeeded to varying degrees in four areas of combat operations the use of clear hold and expand approach the use of armed reconnaissance and raiding close air support and command and control arrangements direct action was most eﬀective when the aim was to reduce the use of force to use force in ways considered legitimate and to get locals to use force instead of us and coalition forces clear hold and expand counterinsurgents achieve success by destroying insurgent forces and their political organization in given area over the long run this involves the permanent isolation of the insurgents from the population 11 buﬀaloe conventional forces in lowintensity conﬂict p 12 12 hy s rothstein afghanistan and the troubled

strategy of insurgents and terrorists in afghanistan p 694 counterinsurgency in afghanistan ideally this isolation is not enforced on the population but maintained by and with them14 one of the most successful approaches in afghanistan when it was applied was clear hold and expand this has also been referred to as an inkspot strategy in which military forces set up secure zones and then slowly expanded them outward like ink spots on blotting paper forces were assigned to contested areas to regain government presence and control and then conducted military and civilmilitary programs to expand the control and edge out insurgents 15 the focus was on consolidating and holding ground that was clearly proafghan and procoalition or at least antitaliban protecting the government and other key resources such as lines of communication and major cities like kabul and deploying coalition counterinsurgency forces to conduct oﬀensive operations in contested areas of afghanistan especially in the south and east the deployment of forces into insurgent areas was designed to deny sanctuary interdict the border and expand government and coalition presence this is discussed in more detail in the next section us counterinsurgency forces were kept to bare minimum and supported with civil aﬀairs and psychological operations personnel company of infantry has sometimes been provided for area patrolling and to provide security against an immediate threat to the unit quick reaction forces in the form of close air support assets or reinforcing units have backed up the outposts whenever insurgent forces have threatened to overrun them clear hold and expand forces conducted operations in ever increasing zones or ink spots around their bases in the ﬁrst zone forces tried to target and eliminate the insurgents living within the area this required living among the local population for long durations to gain its trust and support and then trying to separate the locals from the insurgents the secondary zone was the transit and support zone for the insurgents clear hold and expand forces in afghani 14 galula counterinsurgency warfare p 77 15 the clear hold and expand section draws extensively from joseph d celeski operation alizing coin jsou report 052 hurlburt field fla joint special operations university 2005us and coalition forces 95 stan cast wide net of operations outside their force protection zone to disrupt and interdict insurgent operations this required patience and discreet intelligence work to ascertain the location of insurgent weapon caches safe houses and transit support systems the outer zone included remote locations or areas where the population was neither friendly nor hostile to the counterinsurgency units eﬀorts occasional operations were conducted in these areas to show the ﬂag and to keep the population neutral to the idea of supporting the insurgents battalionsized sweeps and clearing operations by conventional forces generally reaped far less than their eﬀort because of the diﬃculty of ﬁnding and ﬁxing elusive insurgents 16 however there were some challenges with clear hold and expand pakistani forces never attempted sustained clear hold and expand operations in the tribal areas or in baluchistan especially against high and middlelevel taliban members even in afghanistan clear hold and expand was limited to small areas of the country since there were too few us coalition and afghan forces to hold and expand large areas armed reconnaissance and raiding an additional lesson from the afghan counterinsurgency is the need to develop an armed reconnaissance capability and specialized raiding force armed reconnaissance is the patrolling of suspected insurgent areas to glean information on their activities initiate contact and conduct battle or conﬁrm that the area is clear armed reconnaissance in afghanistan was accomplished with variety of platforms and measures these were tailored for hunterkiller type missionssearch for hunt down gain contact with and keep contact with insurgents ac130 gunships operating generally at night tactical unmanned aerial vehicles and mounted ground reconnaissance patrols all served to accomplish this mission and keep insurgents oﬀ balance and disrupt their timing tactical unmanned aerial vehicles were somewhat help 16 celeski operationalizing coin 96 counterinsurgency in afghanistan ful in assisting reconnaissance force protection viewing avenues of approach and positive target identiﬁcation17 specialized raiding force was sometimes required to conduct timesensitive targeting beyond the scope of conventional forces these specialized raiding forces took various forms including counterterrorist units indigenous strike forces and specially formed and trained units with personnel drawn from organic forces in afghanistan raiding forces often required dedicated mobility platforms and high level of access to intelligence assets the sensortoshooter links worked best when noncontributing layers of decisionmakers were removed the numberone role for these units was to target the insurgents organizational structure and leadership they also had secondary role in the conduct of raids in sanctuaries in which political sensitivities precluded larger operations 18 close air support close air support provided signiﬁcant advantage to small groups of us and afghan forces operating against insurgents for example close air support was extremely eﬀective when us forces encountered unexpectedly strong resistance during operation anaconda in the shahikot valley this lesson may not be applicable to all counterinsurgency operations especially those conducted in urban areas also in cases in which there is suﬃcient indigenous air capacity the united states may choose not to provide close air support over the course of the afghan counterinsurgency variety of aircraft provided close air support to us and afghan forces operating

tipped the balance militarily 21 command and control perhaps the most signiﬁcant command and control lesson that can be learned from the counterinsurgency in afghanistan was the need to decentralize authority down to the small unit level command and control worked best when it was ﬂattened out from hierarchical to more horizontal levels the shorter sensortoshooter links were the better they worked quicker and more responsive arrangements for command and control provided ﬂexibility for forces on the battleﬁeld 22 this was not always well executed in december 2001 the com mander of task force dagger essentially the 5th special forces group plus supporting units was in direct contact with general franks the combatant commander the subordinate elements of task force dagger had the most current and accurate intelligence about the situation on the ground but this changed when the 10th mountain division assumed operations in afghanistan in march 2002 and again when 18th airborne corps

to be processed through six levels of command before being approved as one general oﬃcer put it too much overhead 23 tight command and control sometimes paralyzed initiative reports from some special forces members in afghanistan indicated that us forces had to obtain approval from the combined joint task force headquarters before conducting operations six kilometers beyond their ﬁre bases in addition all named operationsthose other than routine travelrequired approval from the combined joint task force headquarters which could take as long as 48 hours 24 the net eﬀect of these restrictions was to impede the ﬂex ibility and response of special forces the mission proﬁles of future counterinsurgency operations may require adapting organizational structures in several ways one is to empower operations at the lowest level welltrained smallunit maneuver is important to success 25 afghan insurgent groups frequently dis persed their forces making them smaller and more diﬃcult to attack they also used more secure communication better camouﬂage and more eﬀective diversions 26 us military operations most often suc ceeded when leaders at the smallunit level had enough leeway specialized assets and ﬁrepower to engage the population and develop their own intelligence 27 indeed us military doctrine needs to establish far looser and more broadly distributed networks that have high degree of individual independence and survivability 28 this means incorporat ing into counterinsurgency doctrine and training the preparation of company and battalion commanders to lead

historian wrote in his book small wars that it is very important feature in the preparation for and the carrying out of small wars that the regular forces are often working very much in the dark from the outset what is known technically as intelligence is defective and unavoidably so 30 intelligence is the principal source of information on insurgents and has usually come from the population 31 us

intelligence this was the case in various civilmilitary operations and local projects completed by members of the coalition joint civil military task force other government agencies and ngos tactical commander can greatly beneﬁt from intelligence gathered while helping civilmilitary soldiers accomplish their mission locals were often so thankful for receiving health care from us military forces

approval of it the ﬁrst basic need for an insurgent aiming at more than simply making trouble is an attractive cause with popular cause the insurgent has formidable if intangible asset that he can progressively transform into concrete strength 35 religion has been signiﬁcant part of insurgent rhetoric focused on gaining popular support as mullah dadullah taliban military commander killed in 2007 argued we are not ﬁghting here for afghanistan but we are ﬁghting for all muslims everywhere and also the mujahideen in iraq the inﬁdels attacked muslim lands and it is must that every muslim should support his muslim brothers 36 this argument was echoed by other insurgents such as former tali ban spokesman mofti latifollah hakimi the issue of afghanistan is connected with the ongoing war between islam and blasphemy in the world mullah mohammad is representing huge umma muslim community and large nation is behind him 37 portraying the united states and other western countries as dedicated to the destruction of islam was critical part of this eﬀort as mullah dadullah argued god be praised we now are aware of much of the us plans we know their target which is within the general aim of wiping out islam in this region 38 the taliban used young pakistantrained mullahs to glorify their cause in mosques in the east and south these taliban eﬀorts had mixed success in afghanistan with more success in pakistan since mosques have historically served as 35 galula counterinsurgency warfare pp 1819 36 interview with mullah dadullah jazeera tv february 2006 also see for example

are 107 mosques in the city of kandahar out of which 11 are preaching antigovernment themes our approach is to have all the progovernment mosques incorporated with the process and work on the eleven antigovernment ones to change their attitude or else stop their propaganda and leave the area 39 another major factor was the public campaign by afghan religious ﬁgures for example in july 2005 the ulema council of afghanistan called on the taliban to abandon violence and support the afghan government in the name of islam it also called on the religious scholars of neighboring countriesincluding pakistanto help counter the activities and ideology of the taliban and other insurgent organizations 40 number of afghan islamic clerics publicly supported the afghan government and called the jihad unislamic41 moreover the ulema council and some afghan ulema issued fatwas or religious decrees that unambiguously oppose suicide bombing they argued that suicide bombing does not lead to an eternal life in paradise does not permit martyrs to see the face of allah and does not allow martyrs to have the company of 72 maidens in paradise these eﬀorts to counter taliban propaganda were made easier by the populations lingering resentment of the taliban afghan support for the taliban through 2007 was low in one public opinion poll for example only 13 percent of afghans had favorable view of the taliban 42 insurgent groups also failed to successfully use ethnicityespe cially pashtun nationalismto gain support in spite of taliban information campaign that included dropping leaﬂets delivering

pashtuns 44 in the immediate aftermath of the december 2001 bonn conference the tajiks and uzbeks who comprised the northern alliance ﬁlled key government positions with their own personnel they also took control of the intelligence service and ministries of defense interior and foreign aﬀairs this meant that there was signiﬁcant absence of representation from the pashtuns as well as the shia muslim hazaras from the center one notable exception was the decision to name hamid karzai pashtun as interim president by late 2003 however the us government and president karzai made concerted push to redress the ethnic balance at the levels of minister and deputy minister for example president karzai appointed ali jalali pashtun as minister of interior who began to appoint ethnically diverse governors and police chiefs 45 in addition the afghanistan and pakistan governments encouraged the organization of traditional pashtun councils jirgas to solicit the aid of local tribes in ﬁghting extremists this included the use of tribal militias to help quell the growing power of the taliban in pashtun areas the expansion of good governance and strong state institutions is probably the most eﬀective longterm solution in sum indigenous actors were most eﬀective in conducting infor mation operations the us and other coalition governments tried to implement information operations to degrade insurgent decisionmak 43 taliban launch pirate radio station in afghanistan agence france presse april 18 2005 44 there are accurate statistics on ethnicity based on electoral results however pashtuns

carried out in bosnia following the signing of the 1995 dayton peace accords the international community created high representative to oversee reconstruction and stabilization this did not happen in afghanistan on either the civilian or military side on the civilian side there was unity of command among the international community or us agencies even on the military side there were separate us and nato chains of commandeven after nato took control over much of the counterinsurgency campaign in 2006 the result was several external forces operating in the same area with diﬀerent missions and diﬀerent rules of engagement civilmilitary activities in his book modern warfare french view of counterinsurgency roger trinquier argues that counterinsurgency requires an interlocking system of actionspolitical economic psycho logical militarythat aims at the insurgents intended overthrow of the established authority in country and its replacement by another regime 52 one of the most innovative aspects of the afghan counterinsurgency campaign was its civilmilitary programsespecially the use of prts53 prts were made up of roughly 60 to 100 soldiers including civil aﬀairs units special forces force protection units and psychological operations personnel us prts also included less than half dozen state department usaid and other us government personnel us prts were generally

agriculture representatives implement civilianfunded projects 54 the success of nato prts varied somewhat they tended to be more successful when working closely with the local population to coordinate reconstruction projects and secure their area of operations the ukled prt in mazare sharif helped mediate several instances of interfactional ﬁghting and was successful in helping stabilize the region in contrast the germanled prt in konduz could travel only within 30kilometer radius and avoided areas where there was signiﬁcant factional ﬁghting based on interviews with nato forces this variation in prt activity appears at least partly to be function of domestic politics in some countries such as germany the aversion to casualties impacted prt and broader civilmilitary operations as one german soldier argued the german government is risk averse especially for any thing more than peacekeeping operations so is our population this limits our abilityand willingnessto operate on the ground outside of our bases 55 both us and nato prts faced challenges one was staﬃng most prts were dominated by soldiers many of whom had little or development experience civilian agencies in all nato countries had diﬃculty convincing their personnel to spend time in wartorn underdeveloped country in addition short tours of dutyincluding threemonth toursmade it diﬃcult for prt members to gain full understanding of local politics and culture there also were too few prts five years after the overthrow of the taliban regime the united states and nato were able to put prts in virtually all major

areas of the province such as kandahar city and panjwari but it was involved in virtually reconstruction or development in most of the province because of the security environment ngos and state agencies such as usaid and the canadian international development agency were also not involved in reconstruction and development in most of the province the irony in this situation is that rural areas which were most at risk to the taliban and where unhappiness with the slow pace of change was greatest among the population received little or development assistance 57 team village missions

although these patients could be treated from the backs of the highmobility multipurposewheeled vehicles treatment was easier to administer when given in secure compound arranged by local elders also it was important to have female medic available to treat the women and children otherwise women would be either reluctant or forbidden to seek medical help and they were usually the ones who needed it

2004 for example roughly 65 percent of afghans had favorable view of the us government and 67 percent had favorable view of the us military 60 in 2005 nearly 70 percent of afghans rated the work of the united states as either excellent or good by 2006 nearly 80 percent of afghans strongly or somewhat supported the work of us military forces 61 however there were several indications that support for the afghan government began to decline in 2006 as levels of violence and frustration with the slow pace of reconstruction increased as amrullah saleh head of the nds concluded the taliban

better in some areas than others and better by some types of forces than others us special forces tended to be much better trained and prepared to ﬁght in an unconventional environment there were some areas such as close air support in which the united states had to provide most of the capabilities developing robust and technologically advanced afghan air force that could conduct air strike and air mobility operations proved impractical in large part because the afghan ministry of defense could not aﬀord it chapter seven will explore in more depth how these ﬁndings translate into capabilities for counterinsurgency warfare111chapter seven recommendations the counterinsurgency campaign in afghanistan oﬀers useful oppor tunity for the us military to develop capabilities to more eﬀectively conduct counterinsurgency operations the most signiﬁcant lesson from afghanistan is the importance of encouraging legitimate and eﬀective indigenous governments and security forces us military capabilities should focus on leveraging indigenous capabilities and building their capacity to wage successful counterinsurgency in some areas such as air strikes and air mobility this may be diﬃcult most policymakersincluding in the united statesrepeatedly ignore or underestimate the importance of locals to counterinsurgency warfare counterinsurgency requires not only the capability to conduct unconventional war but also the capability to shape the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces the recommendations cover eight areas policet border securityt ground combatt air strike and air mobilityt intelligencet command and controlt information operationst civilmilitary activitiest improvements in all of these areas would increase the capability of indigenous security forces assist in building governance capacity and target external support as noted in chapter two these variables 112 counterinsurgency in afghanistan are strongly correlated with the successand failureof counterin surgency eﬀorts table 71 highlights the eight areas by asking three questions who should be the lead actor in each area what should the us militarys role be what are key us military capabilities necessary to achieve success in this area while the indigenous government needs to develop an autonomous capacity in all of these areas over the long term this is not always possible in the near term it may lack critical capabilities legitimacy resources and political will across key areasespecially in the early phases of counterinsurgency under these conditions the us military or another external actor may need to play lead role until the indigenous government develops the requisite skills or the insurgency is defeated this table assumes that the indigenous government will not have suﬃcient assets in key areasespecially air strike and air mobility as figure 71 illustrates there may also be some variation in how quickly the us military is willing and able to improve indigenous capacity in some areas such as policing there is strong incentive to build indigenous capacity quickly there is evidence for example that the best and most eﬃcient way to prevent insurgents from gaining ground in the early stages of an insurgency is to have locals do it themselveswhat is sometimes called ingroup policing 1 diﬀerent communities know their own members particularly in tightly knit societies in the developing world these communities thus overcome the intelligence challenge and enable the use of arrests or other forms of pressure with far greater discrimination in other areas such as air strike capability it may not be feasible or desirable to provide the indigenous government with technologically advanced air capabilities police it should be key objective of the united states to give primacy to indigenous security forces as much as possible in some cases such as 1 james d fearon and david d laitin explaining interethnic cooperation

states unfavorably 3 this suggests that large us presence in predominantly muslim country may trigger widespread unrest finally lead indigenous role can provide focal point for national aspirations in tandem with competent security forces and good governance glaring deﬁciency in afghanistan was the poor quality of the police due to the nature of their work police are the ﬁrst line of defense against insurgents they have close contact with local populations in cities and villages and will inevitably have good intelligence picture of insurgent activity the failure of the police to combat insurgents and undermine their support base can be fatal to counterinsurgency eﬀorts this means that major focus of the us military and other government agencies should be to improve the competence of police through training mentoring and equipping there is currently plethora of us government agencies involved in police training and equipping such as the department of defense department of state department of justice usaid and cia 4 for example the us department of states bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement and the us department of justices international criminal investigative training assistance program have foreign police training programs however they are plagued by paucity of funding and civilian police this forces the united states to either rely on

abroad recommendations 117 corp or other states or organizations such as nato countries or civilian police unlike the police the anas competence improved in the early stages of the counterinsurgency campaign this was primarily result of training provided by us and other coalition forces as well as the integration of indigenous forces into kinetic and nonkinetic operations the same cannot be said for the anp which suﬀered from lack of attention low levels of initial funding initial mentoring corruption and paucity of loyalty to the central government the department of defense needs to be involved in rethinking police training there are at least three options first the department of defense could create specialized police units within the us military either the marine corps or the army or provide predeployment training for an activeduty army military police brigade second the us government could create police units within federal law enforcement agency such as the us marshals service that could be deployed abroad third the us government could fund additional positions within state and selected metropolitan police departments with the understanding that these oﬃcers would be available for deployment abroad as part of federal eﬀort additional analysis is necessary to assess these options 5 border security outside assistance was critical to the afghan insurgents success in the early stages of the insurgency support from the pakistan government pashtun tribes qaeda and the global jihadist network was crucial to the survivability of insurgent forces insurgent groups adapted their tactics and techniques during the counterinsurgency campaign and became veritable learning organizations they adopted suicide tactics increasingly sophisticated ieds and networked organizational structures involving small cells 5 see for example terrence k kelly options for transitional security capabilities for america santa monica calif rand corporation tr353a 2005118 counterinsurgency in afghanistan since the success of insurgent groups is highly correlated with their ability to acquire external support the us military needs to improve indigenous capabilities in denying support perhaps the most important is improving border security major part of the solution is diplomatic and involves negotiations with neighboring countries to curb crossborder activity in afghanistan the united states and other coalition partners failed to alter the will or capacity of the pakistan government to decrease crossborder activity some technological capabilities may improve border security for uncontrolled border areas such as the afghanistanpakistan border these capabilities might include range of sensors and platforms to detect insurgent movement eﬀorts along these lines might also include training and equipping indigenous forces to conduct patrols utilize range of technologies interdict insurgent forces and work with neighboring governments to enforce border security there are two related areas in which capabilities are needed to deny sanctuary and target external support one is countering insurgent recruitment the military and political authorities need to utilize diplomatic and other means to encourage neighboring states to curb recruitment campaigns for insurgents close training camps and conduct sustained counterinsurgency campaign that undermines popular support for insurgents and captures or kills leaders and guerrillas insurgents ability to maintain sanctuary in neighboring countries can be lethal to successful counterinsurgency eﬀort in afghanistan counterinsurgency eﬀorts were limited largely to afghan territory and did little to curb recruitment and other support in pakistan and other neighboring countries the second area requiring new capabilities is in countering the external ﬁnancing of insurgent groups the us government needs to continue pressuring foreign governments to curb the ﬁnancing of insurgent groups from diaspora populations and wealthy ﬁnanciers in such regions as the persian gulfin close cooperation with the department of state department of treasury and other us and coalition partners afghan groups received steady stream of assistance from wealthy individuals in the gulf and other regions this funding stream was an important resource for insurgent groupsrecommendations 119 ground combat military force is usually most eﬀective when used in ways that are sidered legitimate it is also more eﬀective when used by locals and not external actors the most eﬀective use of military force in counterinsurgency includes two types of ground combat capabilities first one of the most successful approaches in afghanistan which was used to varying degreeswas clear hold and expand this is sometimes referred to as an inkspot strategy forces are assigned to contested areas to regain government presence and control and then conduct military and civilmilitary programs to expand the control and edge out insurgents the focus is on consolidating and holding ground that is clearly progovernment protecting the government and other key resources such as lines of communication and major cities and deploying counterinsurgency forces to conduct oﬀensive operations in contested areas holding territory proved to be the most diﬃcult facet of clear hold and expand in afghanistan due to the low number of us and local forces 6 this suggests that suﬃcient numbers of forces are needed to hold territory once it is cleared or insurgents can retake it deploying forces into insurgent areas can deny them sanctuary interdict the border and expand government and coalition presence where possible us counterinsurgency forces should be kept to minimum and supported with civilaﬀairs and psychological operations units company of infantry can sometimes be provided for area patrolling and security for an immediate threat to the unit quick reaction forces in the form of close air support assets or reinforcing units should back up the outposts whenever insurgent forces threatened to overrun them clear hold and expand involves conducting operations in ever increasing zones around military bases the ﬁrst measure for force protection is to target and eliminate the insurgents living within the inner zonedeﬁned by mission enemy troops terrain and time around their base this requires living among the local population for long 6 on the low number of us and coalition forces see jones averting failure in afghani stan james dobbins seth g jones keith crane andrew rathmell brett steele richard teltschik and anga timilsina americas role in nation building from germany to iraq santa monica calif rand corporation mr1753rc 2003 120 counterinsurgency in afghanistan durations to gain trust and support and the ability to separate the locals from the insurgents the secondary zone is the transit and support zone for the insurgents it may include remote locations or areas where the population is neither friendly nor hostile to the counterinsurgency units eﬀorts occasional operations need to be conducted in these areas to show the ﬂag and keep the population neutral to the idea of supporting the insurgents in afghanistan battalionsized sweeps and clearing operations by conventional forces generally reaped far less than their eﬀort warranted because of the diﬃculty of ﬁnding and ﬁxing elusive insurgents 7 second is the development of an armed reconnaissance capability and specialized raiding force armed reconnaissance is the patrolling of suspected insurgent areas to glean information on their activities initiate contact or conﬁrm the area is clear armed reconnaissance can be accomplished with variety of platforms and measures such as ac130 gunships operating generally at night tactical unmanned aerial vehicles and mounted ground reconnaissance patrols 8 special ized raiding force is sometimes required to conduct timesensitive targeting beyond the scope of conventional forces these specialized raiding forces may consist of counterterrorist unit an indigenous strike force or specially formed and trained unit drawn from organic forces in afghanistan raiding forces often required dedicated mobility platforms and high level of access to intelligence assets the sensor toshooter links often worked best when noncontributing layers of decisionmakers were removed air strike and air mobility air strike and air mobility are also important the eﬀectiveness of close air support in counterinsurgency operations such as those conducted in afghanistan made it particularly useful for the united states to continue to develop technological capabilities such as gpsbased systems 7 celeski operationalizing coin 8 burda operation enduring freedom lessons learned recommendations 121 and soflams which were invaluable to ground forces for much the same reason it was also useful to continue to develop new and more sophisticated communication equipment including advanced receivers and transmitters that link forces in the ﬁeld to those in other areas satellite radios carried by combat controllers to call in air strikes and encrypted hf radio 9 air mobility capabilities are also likely to be important in most developing countries indigenous forces are unlikely to possess signiﬁcant air mobility assets and the united states or other external actors may need to provide air transport to move forces into and out of the area of operations close air support provided particularly signiﬁcant advantage to small groups of us and afghan forces operating against insurgents this lesson may not be applicable to all counterinsurgency operations especially those conducted in urban areas in afghanistan most of the ﬁghting occurred in rural areas in which close air support was possible and eﬀective variety of aircraft can provide close air support to us and indigenous forces including ah64 attack helicopters spectre ac130 gunships a10 and f14 ﬁghters and b52 bombers 10 intelligence the problem of destroying insurgent groups and their supporters is often one of ﬁnding them this makes access to reliable and actionable information of paramount importance the us military needs to continue developing capabilities for collecting analyzing and acting quickly on intelligence in afghanistan the us experience suggests that there are limits to applying technological solutions to intelligence challenges advanced technologies were sometimes helpful in identifying insurgents however insurgents were frequently able to adapt their tactics techniques and procedures to avoid these collection methods this makes humint particularly importantincluding humint 9 on the utility of soflams and communication equipment in afghanistan see berntsen

tribes and militias civilmilitary programssuch as those providing medical assistance to localscan also be utilized to build trust with locals the development of analytical tools to process information is also important for example the utilization of gridding system to map the location of insurgents and their support network has been helpful in processing intelligence into useful operational planning tool for the us military in afghanistan eﬀective analysis capability is critical component of any intel ligence capability counterinsurgency operations require the development of an analytical methodology to measure the insurgencys impact on the local populationespecially the impact of the security condition number of factors can make it diﬃcult to measure the eﬀectiveness of counterinsurgency operations progress cannot be measured by the advance of militaries across map as in conventional warfare focusing only on guerrilla ﬁghters misses the much broader support network complicated array of political economic social and military factors can fuel the insurgency and there are rarely ideal predeﬁned qualitative or quantitative target metrics unfortunately the counterinsurgency campaign in afghanistan often fell into two measurements traps 1 measuring success based on outputs and inputs rather than on broader strategic outcomes and 2 focusing on us rather than afghan metrics the us military needs to develop outcomebased metrics to assess performance during counterinsurgency campaigns inputs should refer to the amount of resources used in counterinsurgency operations such as the amount of ﬁnancial assistance and soldiers deployed outputs should be the ﬁrstorder results of the counterinsurgency program these include such metrics as indigenous forces trained and insurgents killed or captured outcomes are conditions that directly impact the local population they should not measure what the military does but rather represent the consequences of its eﬀorts 11 without such an ability to measure performance policymakers lack an objective method for judg 11 jones et establishing law and order after conﬂict recommendations 123 ing success and failure in ongoing crises making midcourse correc tions more diﬃcult despite these hurdles there are reasonable measures of counter insurgency eﬀectiveness key outcome indicators include the number and lethality of attacks against the local population over time and trends in public opinion polls metrics need to be tied to the security of the population the tools to assess counterinsurgency outcomes remain limited it is diﬃcult to measure popular support and security especially in countries such as afghanistan that have not collected systematic data however by building such assessments into current and future assistance programs and encouraging host nations to undertake such assessments the us military will be better placed to optimize counterinsurgency operations 12 based on the afghanistan case key outcome indicators might include tracking the following insurgent violencet the most useful indicators here are trends over time in the number and lethality of insurgentinitiated attacks against the population first how many attacks have insurgents conducted and where have the conducted them are they rising or declining over time and is their area of operations spreading or shrinking second how lethal are their attacks over time are they able to kill more people especially locals shortterm trends are generally not useful since the rate of enemy attacks can ﬂuctuate and decline in the rate may be caused by preparation for larger oﬀensive 13 crime data including homicide rates over time are also usefulpublic opiniont useful indicators in this area include trends in public opinion polls that capture the perception of security among locals does the local population feel more or less safe over time why public perceptions of security can be an important indica 12 for instance public opinion polling can be adjusted to address perceptions of corrup tion or judicial integrity international advisors can assist in the development of systemwide criminal justice metrics systems as they undertake routine projects 13 richard betts stability in iraq washington dc central intelligence agency 2005 p 4124 counterinsurgency in afghanistan tor of the eﬀectiveness of the security forces in establishing an environment in which people and goods can circulate freely and licit political and economic activity can occur without intimidation promoting disorder is key objective for most insurgents disrupting the economy and decreasing security help produce discontent among the government and undermine the strength and legitimacy of the indigenous government 14 v i d n c f relaxation of behavior stemming from fear can be particularly instructive do locals go out at night in their villages do they travel outside their villages at nightother indicators of securityt more tactical outcome measures may also be appropriate in somalia for example the us military collected such indicators as the death rate per day due to starvation new patients with gunshot wounds in hospitals and the street price of an ak47 15 all outcome measures however should be tied to the overall mission objectives the ability to electronically map territory to monitor insurgent sanctuaries and their support network is another critical intelligence capability 16 in afghanistan gridding system was used fairly success fully to cover large sectors of suspected insurgent territory as illustrated in figure 72 each square in the grid was covered by one method of surveillance and either conﬁrmed as empty or contained suspicious activity once suspicious activity was noted us or coalition forces continued to develop the situation sometimes introducing additional forces in the area to destroy the threat timing was critical long hours and numerous assets were required to ﬁnd insurgent forces hunterkiller platforms engaged insurgent forces immediately upon their discovery and then continued to maintain contact while reinforcements were sent to the area 14

united states in vietnam in vietnam secretary of defense robert strange mcnamara asked the cia in 1966 to develop technique to measure trends in paciﬁcation of inhabitants the result was the hamlet evaluation system which contained such objectives as whether government or insurgent forces were in hamlet however it relied heavily on subjective measures to gauge the quality of life of the people the hamlet evaluation system reported whether hamletdwellers lived in some tranquility or if they were subject to harassment intimidation and attacks from the viet cong or north vietnamese army the most important feature of the hamlet evaluation system was the fact that two separate parties prepared two separate reports figure 72 example of grid methodology rand mg59572guerrilla logisticsfinancial and political support126 counterinsurgency in afghanistan independently of one another the us senior district advisor and his counterpart the vietnamese district commander each

networks that have high degree of individual independence and survivability 21 this means incorporating into coun terinsurgency doctrine and training the preparation of company and battalion commanders to lead combinedarms warfare conduct civilmilitary operations and develop and exploit their own intelligence it also means giving infantry commanders the responsibility autonomy and distance from higher headquarters that is now held only by special forces ateam commanders commanders must empower smallunit leaders to deal with the challenges encountered during counterinsurgency operations including the authority to routinely make decisions currently made by battalion and brigade combat team commanders 22 command and control works well when it has been ﬂattened out from hierarchical to more horizontal level the shorter sensortoshooter links are the better they work quicker and more responsive arrangements for command and control provide ﬂexibility for forces on the battleﬁeld 23 this was not always well executed in afghanistan at the strategic level command and control presented three sig niﬁcant challenges in afghanistan one was overall coordination of the

chains of command from the indigenous government international actors need to support the preeminent role of the indigenous government the second strategiclevel challenge concerns command and control

1999 in which the us and australianled entry forces respectively were drawn down and incorporated into uniﬁed force with single chain of command 24 the third strategiclevel command and control challenge in the afghan counterinsurgency was lack of coordination within the us eﬀort successful counterinsurgency campaigns require combination of military and political capabilities but coordination between the us military and civilian agencies operating in afghanistan was problematic this suggests need to get civilian agencies better engaged and coordinated on the ground with the military overcoming this challenge will also require rethinking the organizational structure of the counterinsurgency campaign there are several potential options though additional analysis is necessary to assess them the ﬁrst is to put civilian in charge of the counterinsurgency eﬀort perhaps the us ambassador in the country in which the insurgency is taking place or following the model of several britishled counterinsurgencies it could be special envoy or high commissioner with command and control authority under both of these options the top military oﬃcial would be subordinate to the civilian ﬁgure indeed british civilian oﬃcials were in control of emergencies and were responsible for the broader political strategy the british army operated under civilian control and accepted the requirement of employing minimum force another option is to give the military command and control responsibilities for the counterinsurgency campaign the ﬁnal option is to establish an interagency working group which includes both civilian and military oﬃcials that has overall responsibility for the counter insurgency campaign 24 see for example james dobbins seth g jones keith crane and beth cole degrasse the beginners guide to nationbuilding santa monica calif rand corporation mg 557srf 2007recommendations 129 information operations indigenous groups are more likely to be eﬀective in inﬂuencing locals and countering insurgent ideology than the us military or other international actors are it is critical to understand who holds power who the local population trusts and where locals get their informationand then to target these forums in some cases such as in afghanistan religious leaders and tribal elders wield the vast majority of power this means providing assistance to credible indigenous groups such as muslim clerics or tribal elders that can eﬀectively counter jihadist propaganda these groups do not necessarily have to be supportive of the united states but they do need to oppose insurgents and have credible inﬂuence among the population much of this funding may have to be indirect to protect their credibility assistance could be directed to indigenous media political parties student and youth organizations labor unions and religious ﬁgures and organizations that meet at least two criteria 1 they have notable support base in the local population and 2 they oppose insurgent groups and insurgent ideology this approach has some parallels with us eﬀorts during the cold war to balance the soviet union by funding existing political cultural social and media organizations in areas such as central and eastern europe insurgents sometimes make religion signiﬁcant part of their rhetoric to gain popular support since mosques have historically served as tipping point for major political upheavals in afghanistan afghan government oﬃcials have targeted mosques the ulema council of afghanistan called on the taliban to abandon violence and support the afghan government in the name of islam they also called on the religious scholars of neighboring countriesincluding pakistanto help counter the activities and ideology of the taliban and other insurgent organizations number of afghan islamic clerics publicly supported the afghan government and called the jihad unislamic moreover the ulema council and number of afghan ulema have issued fatwas or religious decrees that unambiguously oppose suicide bombing indigenous eﬀorts to inﬂuence the population especially credible actors such as muslim clerics and tribal leaders were the most successful130 counterinsurgency in afghanistan civilmilitary activities the afghan government suﬀered from signiﬁcant governance prob lems such as its failure to stem the rising drug trade and corruption in key areas like the justice system while civilian agencies should lead eﬀorts to rebuild the justice system the military needs to play an important role as well this means establishing civilaﬀairs teams that can work in key areas of the justice system such as establishing courts to prosecute insurgents terrorists and major criminals involved in such activities as drug traﬃcking eﬀectively prosecuting spoilersincluding insurgentsis critical to the success of counterinsurgency campaign the failure to adequately deal with these individuals undermines counterinsurgency eﬀorts in addition pretrial detention facilities and prisons are often in poor condition in developing countries compounding this problem donor states may be reluctant to become involved in rebuilding system with reputation for signiﬁcant human rights violations the military can help ﬁll this gap reconstruction teams should be core component of counterin surgency operations and involve both military and civilian personnel 25 in the us government this includes personnel from such organizations as usaid and the departments of state justice treasury and agriculture these teams should become involved in wide variety of projects that range from assisting the local population with basic health care helping improve basic services such as water and electricity and rebuilding schools government buildings and hospitals reconstruction programs should be designed to gain support for the indigenous government rather than for the united states or other external actors as israeli general moshe dayan argued foreign troops never win the hearts of the people and generally do not gain support for the host government 26 in areas where there is signiﬁcant insurgent violence the us military may need to provide greater percentage of civil 25 khalilzad how to nationbuild ten lessons from afghanistan 26 quoted in wilensky military medicine to win hearts and minds p 132 also see general moshe dayan folder 488 131 may 1968 32 history file box 34 record group 319 national archives and records administration recommendations 131 military assistance since they are better prepared to operate in hostile environments these nonkinetic operations are critical weapon in an indige nous governments battle for popular support the us military should deploy civil aﬀairs units with training and experience in such areas as public administration public safety public health and legal systems again the focus of the us military and other international actors should be to improve the indigenous governments ability to rebuild and provide essential servicesnot to do it for them this is key aspect of any attempt to secure popular support and legitimacy for the government one of the most innovative aspects of the afghan counterinsurgency campaign was the inclusion of civilmilitary programsespecially the use of prts the prt concept can help strengthen the reach of the central government and rebuild essential services prts can facilitate reconstruction by funding projects such as school repairs or by helping department of state usaid and department of agriculture representatives to implement civilianfunded projects however there are several barriers to the successful implementation of prts one is staﬃng hurdles short tours of dutysuch as threemonth toursmake it diﬃcult for prt members to develop an understanding of local politics and culture second is scarcity of prts which need to reach beyond urban areas into rural areas where insurgent support may be strongest in afghanistan they had little operational reach in rural areas since insurgents are often better able to build support networks and capture territory in rural areas prts need to spread to rural areas this is where team village missions can be eﬀective in afghani stan team village unitswhich usually included mix of civil aﬀairs and psychological operations personnelwere tasked with conducting civilmilitary operations within larger campaign team villages also included tactical humint teams interpreters military police media and public aﬀairs personnel medical personnel and local afghan forces 27 health care operations can be particularly successful in winning 27 us army training and doctrine command observations and lessons learned task force devil p 12 buﬀaloe conventional forces in lowintensity conﬂict pp 1314132 counterinsurgency in afghanistan support among the locals local villagers can be treated for everything from mild bumps and bruises to more serious injuries and illnesses although these patients can be treated from the backs of the highmobility multipurposewheeled vehicles such care is better tended in secure compound arranged by the locals also it is key to have female medic available to treat the women and children good governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by central authority in timely manner this includes the process by which those in authority are selected monitored and replaced the political dimension the governments capacity to eﬀectively manage its economic resources and implement sound policies the economic dimension and the respect of citizens and the state for the countrys institutions the institutional dimension 28 the us military is generally not the primary actor for governance and institutionbuilding during counterinsurgency operations nonetheless it should play critical role in encouraging good governance by helping the indigenous authorities deal with corruption improve the criminal justice system and disarm militias in the long term poor governance can undermine counterinsurgency eﬀort by undermining popular support for the government thus it is important to ensure coordination between other actors involved in governance agencies such as the development programme regional organizations such as the asian development bank the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe and broad range of nongovernmental organizations the failure of governance in key provincessuch as helmand and kandaharhas seriously undermined counterinsurgency eﬀorts in afghanistan in 1940 the us marine corps small wars manual percep tively noted that the history of the united states shows that in spite of the varying trend of the foreign policy of succeeding administrations this government has interposed or intervened in the aﬀairs of other states with remarkable regularity it continued with the contention that since these types of missions would likely recur in the future it is well that the united states may be prepared for any emergency 28 kaufmann myths and realities of governance and corruption recommendations 133 which may occur29 this assessment is just as true today as it was in the 1940s indeed the united states has been involved in numerous counterinsurgencies throughout its history in latin america the middle east africa europe and asia the challenge is to improve its ability to engage more eﬀectively in counterinsurgency operations in the future 29 us marine corps small wars manual 135appendix insurgencies since 1945 china 19461950 greece
