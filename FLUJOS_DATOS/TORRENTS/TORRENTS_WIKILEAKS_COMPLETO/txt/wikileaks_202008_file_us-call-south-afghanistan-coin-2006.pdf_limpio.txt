these combat veterans over four deployments in support of operation enduring freedom form the basis for this publication this handbook is tailored for commanders and staffs of combinedarms formations but contains lessons pertinent to commanders and staffs of civil affairs engineer and combat support units as well of particular note is the balance of nonlethal and lethal operations integrated into single seamless operation like the sergeant first class of 13 commanders at all levels need to determine the defeat framework they will use against the enemy and ensure that all actions from soldier

without the written consent of the center for army lessons learned ii for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedintroduction this handbook provides guidance to the commanders and staffs of combinedarms forces that have primary mission of eliminating insurgent forces and discusses the nature of organized guerrilla units and underground elements and their supporters this handbook provides information on organization training and tactics techniques and procedures ttp combinedarms forces in conjunction with civil agencies can employ to destroy large wellorganized insurgent forces in active counterinsurgency coin conflicts the focal point is the coin fight in southern afghanistan many of the examples in this handbook are derived from actual experiences of united states special forces task force during its four deployments in support of operation enduring freedom the term insurgent broadly refers to all types of unconventional forces and operations insurgent forces insurgent activities and coin operations and includes guerrilla partisan insurgent subversive resistance terrorist revolutionary and similar personnel organizations and methods insurgent activities include acts of military political psychological and economic nature conducted predominantly by inhabitants of nation for the purpose of eliminating or weakening the authority of the local government or an occupying power and using primarily insurgent and informal groupings and measures an insurgent force is the outward manifestation of resistance movement against the local government by some portion of the population of an area therefore the growth and continuation of an insurgent force depends on support furnished by the population even if the insurgent force also receives support from an external power when an insurgent force is in its formative stage it may be eliminated by the employment of civil law enforcement measures and removal of the factors that motivate the resistance movement once formed an insurgent force is usually too strong to be eliminated by such measures stronger force such as military unit can destroy the insurgent force but the resistance movement will when convinced that it is militarily feasible to do so reconstitute the insurgent force unless the original causative factors are also removed or alleviated this handbook provides proven strategies that address insurgent forces their formation and motivations note the majority of the material in this handbook is derived from technical and tactical knowledge obtained from field manual fm 3115 operations against irregular forces fm 3120 operations against guerrilla forces and ttp adapted through the experience of four years of combating coin forces throughout afghanistan additional data was compiled from multiple sources for the purpose of creating singlesource document for reference by leaders for official use only 1southern afghanistan coin operationschapter 1 familiarize yourself with the enemy understanding the enemy the fundamental cause of largescale resistance movements stems from the dissatisfaction of some portion of the population whether real imagined or incited with the prevailing political social or economic conditions this dissatisfaction is usually centered on desire for one or more of the following national independence economic and social improvement elimination of foreign occupation or exploitation 1 relief from actual or alleged oppression elimination of corruption religious expression incountry factors may cause resistance movement to form locally or outofcountry elements that create and sponsor such movement as means of promoting their own cause may inspire resistance movement sometimes another country will lend support to an incountry resistance movement and attempt to control it to further its own aims resistance movements begin to form when dissatisfaction occurs among strongly motivated individuals who cannot further their cause by peaceful and legal means under appropriate conditions the attitudes and beliefs of these individuals spread to family groups and neighbors the population of entire areas may soon evidence widespread discontent when legal recourse is denied discontent grows into disaffection and members of the population participate in insurgent activities small dissident groups living and working within the established order gradually organize into underground elements that conduct covert insurgent activities as members of underground organizations are identified and as the spirit of resistance grows overt guerrilla bands form in secure areas and become the military arm of the insurgent force characteristically the scope of insurgent activities progress in this order passive objection individual expression of opposition sabotage individual violent action and organized group violent action once individuals have participated in insurgent activities should there be any change of heart they are usually forced to continue either by pressure from their comrades or by being designated criminals by local authorities the organization of insurgent forces varies according to purpose terrain character and density of population availability of food medical supplies arms and equipment quality of leadership amount and nature of external support and direction and the countermeasures used against them units or elements may vary in size from few saboteurs to organized paramilitary units of division size or larger with extensive support organizations large insurgent force normally for official use only 3southern afghanistan coin operationsconsists of three organized elements guerrilla element which operates overtly an underground element which operates covertly or clandestinely and an auxiliary element which operates covertly members of large guerrilla units are usually severed from their normal civilian pursuits while members of small guerrilla bands may alternately be either guerrillas or apparently peaceful citizens members of the underground usually maintain their civilian pursuits individuals and small groups who may or may not be formal members of either element but who furnish aid in intelligence evasion and escape and supplies usually support both elements such supporters are often considered to be part of the underground an individual may be member of two or more organizations and may participate in many forms of insurgent activity the underground elements of an insurgent force must conduct the majority of their activities covertly because of the countermeasures used against them and they are usually found in all resistance areas cells established for security reasons compartment successful organizations the cellular organization prevents captured member from compromising the entire organization organized guerrilla units are usually found in areas where the terrain restricts the mobility surveillance and firepower advantage of the opposing force2guerilla units vary from small groups who are lightly armed to large paramilitary units of division size or larger with extensive support organizations large organizations normally include guerilla and auxiliary elements for combat assassination and terrorism and underground elements for intelligence and counterintelligence civilian control and supply guerrilla units are composed of various categories of personnel civilian volunteers and those impressed by coercion military leaders and specialists deserters in time of active war military individuals or small groups such as those who have been cut off deliberate staybehinds escaped prisoners of war and downed airmen an insurgent force presents an elusive target since it will usually disperse before superior opposition and then reform to strike again however as the guerrilla elements of an insurgent force grow and approach parity with regular units in organization equipment training and leadership their capabilities and tactics likewise change and become similar to those of regular unit clandestine insurgent activities include acts of destruction against public and private property transportation and communications systems raids and ambushes against military and police headquarters garrisons convoys patrols and depots terrorism by assassination bombing torture mutilation and kidnapping provocation of incidents reprisals and holding of hostages 4 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learneddenial activities such as arson flooding demolition use of chemical or biological agents or other acts designed to prevent use of an installation area product or facility espionage criminal acts such as assassination armed robbery extortion blackmail theft and counterfeiting dissemination of propaganda and rumors delaying or misdirecting orders issuing false or misleading orders or reports and identifying individuals for terrorist attack insurgent ttp insurgent tactics vary from force to force and area to area some ttp are common to nearly all insurgent forces guerrilla tactics the tactics used by the guerrilla are designed to weaken his enemy and to gain support of the population guerrilla tactics follow wellknown precepts if the enemy attacks disappear3 if the enemy defends harass4 if the enemy withdraws or at any time is vulnerable attack5 guerrilla tactics are primarily smallunit infantrytype tactics which make full use of accurate intelligence detailed planning and rehearsal simple techniques of maneuver speed surprise infiltration specialization in night operations and the undermining of enemy morale speed is relative thing and is usually accomplished by such actions as marching rapidly two or three nights to reach the area of attack think of this type of action as swarming surprise is gained by the combined elements of speed secrecy selection of unsuspected objectives and deliberate deception infiltration is basic tactic of successful guerrilla units and they quickly develop great skill in infiltrating areas occupied by military units by specializing in night operations guerrilla force effectively reduces its vulnerability to air and artillery attack enemy morale is undermined by constant harassment exhibition of violent combative spirit fanaticism selfsacrifice and extensive use of propaganda threats blackmail and bribery guerrillas immediately attempt to break out by force at single point or disband and exfiltrate individually when surrounded or cut off if both fail individual guerrillas attempt to hide or mingle with the peaceful civilian population for official use only 5southern afghanistan coin operationsguerrilla base areas are carefully guarded by warning net6consisting of guerrillas and civilian supporters warning stations which are relocated frequently cover all avenues of approach into the guerrilla area indigenous activities facilitators include acts of groups of the population who are easily deceived by promises and communications systems raids and sabotage are common to all underground groups terrorist attacks such as assassination7challenge police or military control ideological propaganda8is disseminated by implanting rumors distributing leaflets and placards taking hostages and promoting demonstrations riots9strikes and work slowdowns auxiliary activities the auxiliary will seek to provide supporting network for activities of the other segments of the insurgency they will focus on providing the framework by which these forces can arm themselves in safety through early warning materials and services will be provided for operations they will not seek to engage coalition forces but rather avoid contact and activity that will bring attention to themselves however wherever there is insurgent activity there will be support auxiliary network to logistically support operations and spread the ideology of the insurgency movement leadership the present anticoalition militant acm leadership has evolved tribally by promulgating religious ideology in pursuit of extremist islamic beliefs over time provincial tribal dominance has facilitated the acquisition of influence and power by few individuals who ultimately have exploited islam for their purpose as the taliban regime fell senior leaders sought refuge in pakistan and formed the foundation of their shadow government they have established regional and local leaders that reside in afghanistan and travel in and out of their areas of operation to acquire orders supplies training and some minimal force structure from the senior leadership they select and promote tribally related individuals who are predominantly pashtun and supported by barakzi norzi and baluchi subtribes that form the auxiliary networks the cellular structure throughout each province enables acm forces to conduct random but focused and deliberate operations midlevel leaders are able to enter occupy an area recruit force and then begin organized operations to effect popular support and pursue strategic directives from their senior leadership when leaders are killed or captured delays in operational activities result as witnessed by the killing of pai mohammed the oruzgan province battalion acm commander six months passed before new leader was appointed and operations were reorganized this is not to say that the cellular structure of the leadership did not permit local area actions from occurring as witnessed in char cineh most senior and midlevel leaders have familial and tribal ties to oruzgan and helmand provinces and understand this is the ground they must retain for narcotics traffic their primary source of capital and sanctuary the leadership understands if this area is lost their capacity to sustain their cause is in jeopardy 6 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedas result of consistent combined kinetic and nonkinetic efforts tf 31 has learned that acm activity only decreases in those areas where their leaders perceive it is too costly in manpower and local popular support to continue in areas where they are able to reorganize and influence the populace without significant loss they continue to prolong the fight to achieve their strategic political objectives using the reconciliation program acm leadership is beginning to integrate into the islamic republic of afghanistan iroa where this is not possible they use preexisting tribal and mujahideenforged relationships to influence appointed and elected iroa leaders this integration and influence is very precarious situation and in the long term will be defined primarily by selfinterest and tribal loyalties units must thoroughly understand political and governmental architecture to facilitate appropriate stewardship of the developing government as well as to assess the influence of the acm this understanding is critical supporting effort to afghanistan national security forces combined kinetic operations endnotes 1 denotes afghani insurgent force motivations 2 afghanistan sanctuary areas such as the oruzgan northern kandahar and zabol provinces within regional command rc south 3 for example withdraw using terrain to their advantage assimilate into the local population within urban areas use hiding techniques such as thick blankets to shield against advanced coalition thermal sights 4 for example improvised explosive devices rockets mortars hitandrun tactics against bases sniper operations 5 for example direct attacks on fixed bases ambush of convoyspatrols 6 acm early warning signals range from something as rudimentary as releasing birds smoke signals mirrors and runners often children to more advanced techniques of flashlights flares integrated communication radios cellular and satellite phones 7 many procoalition mullahs and political candidates have been assassinated throughout afghanistan for the purpose of destabilizing the central government discouraging support of the central government and demonstrating the insurgencys ability to exert its power on key leaders 8 ideological propaganda includes night letters comments by mullahs countering the coalition psychological operations leaflets 9 in the summer of 2005 riot was instigated by few dissidents after an operation near bagram airfield this activity demonstrated the power of the insurgency to rapidly mobilize or press people into achieving their goals riot cannot be ignored and is typically widely reported by the press for official use only 7southern afghanistan coin operationschapter 2 planning operations against insurgent forces are designed to establish control within the resistance area eliminate the insurgent force and assist in the reconstruction rehabilitation and reeducation necessary for peaceful living these goals are concurrent but in specific instances priorities may be established the specific actions required to attain each goal are often the same and even when different usually planned and conducted concurrently lines of operations while eliminating anticoalition militants acm is central theme throughout all efforts planning will be focused on three primary areas 1 security 2 governance and justice 3 economic and strategic reconstruction by providing this detailed focus operations will be synchronized and have unity of effort special forces are primarily focused on establishing security by establishing this center axis of focus the other flanking axis will be able to flourish however attempting to achieve the other lines of effort before solid foundation of security is established will result in failure by applying fullspectrum approach to planning and operations all three lines of operations can be addressed in the daily activities and operations of special forces team security operations planning for security operations can be further broken down into several categories creating capacity in the security sector defeating the insurgency posturing for longterm growth and development creating capacity in the security sector building competent and capable afghan national security force ansf is the lasting legacy that special forces seek to achieve all operations must take into consideration the use of the ansf and how they can be best employed to develop them for eventually taking over operations the greatest threat to afghanistan is not from overland invasion from neighboring country but rather from within in the form of insurgents who wish to impose their religious ideals and ideology the primary security forces are the afghan national army ana afghan national police anp afghan highway patrol ahp and the afghan border police abp for official use only 9southern afghanistan coin operationsdefeating the insurgency operations against insurgent forces are planned according to these basic considerations the majority of operations consist of smallunit actions small mobile units are able to react quickly and decisively throughout their area of operations ao combined with ansf units are able to quickly and decisively evaluate and affect situations operations are primarily offensive in nature intelligence driven encompassing fullspectrum decentralized operations once initiated they are continued without halt to prevent acm reorganization and resupply1 lulls in activities or failure to establish contact with acm may reflect inadequate measures in the conduct of operations rather than complete success conducting operations that are limited to specific goals and are repetitive to the point of being predictable may allow the acm to template friendly forces operations operations are designed to find the enemy once contact is made forces must continue to pressure and pursue the acm forces to fix and finish them the primary vehicle by which operations are conducted in afghanistan is the combat reconnaissance patrol it is important to understand that intelligence drives operations time resources and efforts must be focused towards specific areas during the combat reconnaissance patrol to gain the maximum effect sought operations are designed to minimize the insurgent forces strengths and to exploit their weaknesses ºthe greatest strengths of an insurgent force lie in its inner political structure and identification with popular cause its ability to conceal itself within the civil population the strong motivation of its members and their knowledge of the resistance area2 ºthe greatest weaknesses of an insurgent force lie in its dependence upon support by the civil population its lack of reliable supply system for food arms and ammunition3and its lack of transportation4trained leadership5and communications 10 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedfigure 21 afghanistan is composed of 70 mountainous terrain which provides ample sanctuary areas for insurgent forces to regroup train and base operations posturing for longterm growth and development operations must set the stage for further expansion and development that means that operational planners must consider all of the elements of combat power at their disposal use of fires coalition forces enjoy large advantage in the availability of fires indirect and aerial to influence the battle using such fires wisely can dramatically affect the outcome of tactical engagements and offer tool which with careful use can alter the strategic outcome of the fight against the acm but careful use is an overarching consideration that must be carefully weighed and judged in fight for the support of the larger afghan population the damage from collateral casualties can far outweigh the benefits of resultant acm losses artillery terrain and the dispositions and tactics of guerrilla forces usually limit the effectiveness of artillery however the demoralizing effect of artillery fire on guerrillas often justifies its use even though there is little possibility of inflicting material damage ingenuity and departure from conventional concepts often make artillery support possible under the most adverse circumstances close air support cas the use of cas offers the best venue for bringing combined arms to bear on acm forces cas is delivered by three methods high medium and low altitude highaltitude approaches are for official use only 11southern afghanistan coin operations performed by b52s utilizing joint direct attack munitions to provide precision and pinpoint munitions on targets bombing runs are usually long in approach and do not allow the aircraft to visually identify the target they are engaging thus relying solely on the ground maneuver element to call for fire mediumlevel cas is derived in the form of a10s gr7s and other fixed wing aircraft of this type these aircraft are visually in contact with ground units and provide other capabilities of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr the visual and audible effect of these aircraft makes significant impact on the morale of acm forces lowaltitude cas is provided by rotary wing ah64s these aircraft are able to provide flexible and responsive cas and isr terrain throughout the ao will dictate the type of cas applied steep terrain can dictate the use of particular platforms to be able to engage acm forces while safeguarding friendly units all units should conduct detailed analysis of the best type of cas to support missions and have full understanding of the capabilities and limitations of cas mobility the rough terrain and limited road networks are limiting factors in mobility methods of moving on the battlefield are by rotary wing air by vehicle and by foot the ability to interface with the local populace should be considered in all movements by interacting units are able to offset the ideology and show firm presence by establishing more secure environment however because of early warning networks movement by ground presents loss of surprise rotary wing aircraft can mitigate this effect but because of the limited number of air frames operations lack the flexibility required to maintain an aggressive pursuit of the acm ground mobility movement by vehicle can be accomplished by performing operations in groundmobility gmv uparmored and nonstandard tactical vehicles each vehicle has advantages and disadvantages to operations clearly using the gmv provides mixture of heavy weapons communications visibility and mobility for operations with the new armament added on to the vehicles this system is the preferred choice some operations require movement into the green zones6 narrow roads require the more narrow vehicles movement by foot is mandatory throughout the mountainous regions to gain the upper hand on enemy forces and seize the high grounds to prevent lookouts and overwatches during summer months body armor and helmets will severely limit friendly rates of movement and hinder soldier loads while requiring increased water consumption rates aerial mobility the helicopter has wide application when used against insurgent forces subject to the usual limitations of weather and visibility its capability for delivering troops supplies and suppressive fires and its ability to fly at low speed to land in small clearing and to hover make it highly useful the helicopter used in the cas role is very effective particularly in the mountainous regions where fast moving cas has limited effects for troop movement infiltration is an excellent method but is limited to the amount of blade time per flight which decreases overall flexibility in operations logistics is by far the largest consumer of rotary wing aircraft medium lift aircraft fly on routine cycle supplying all the outlying fire bases with materials and personnel movements that would otherwise be difficult to achieve by ground methods 12 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedmorale and continuity of effort morale of forces engaged in operations against insurgent forces presents some planning considerations not encountered in other types of combat operations against force that seldom offers target disintegrates before opposition and then reforms and strikes again where it is least expected may induce strong feelings of futility among soldiers and dilute their sense of purpose activities between adjacent commands must be coordinated to ensure unity of effort7if command in one area carries out vigorous operations while neighboring command is passive guerrilla elements will move into the quiet area until danger has passed underground and auxiliary elements will either remain quiet or transfer their efforts temporarily coordination and synchronization between units is the key to overcoming the unity of effort the reciprocal risk must also be considered allowing acm forces to escape into quiet zones can only boost the enemys morale allowing this to happen allows the enemy to regain the tactical and operational initiative denying the enemy such sanctuary will degrade his morale specific areas of operational responsibility responsibilities for the entire ao must be specified using clearly defined boundaries to subdivide the area boundaries should not prevent hot pursuit of insurgent force elements into an adjacent area coordination should however be accomplished between affected commands at the earliest practicable opportunity boundaries should be well defined and should not bisect swamps dense forests mountain ridges or other key terrain features used by guerrilla elements for camps headquarters or bases similarly welldefined boundaries should be used to divide urban areas to ensure complete coverage the enemy has boundaries but will attempt to use our boundaries to their advantage planning factors planning for operations against insurgent forces requires detailed analysis of the area concerned and its population close attention is given to both the civil diplomatic information military and economic dime and the military situations the following specific factors are considered in the commanders estimate the motivation and loyalties of various segments of the population identification of hostile and friendly elements vulnerability of friendly or potentially friendly elements to coercion by terror tactics and susceptibility to enemy and friendly propaganda particular attention is given to the following ºfarmers and other rural dwellers ºcriminal elements ºadherents to the political philosophy of the insurgent force or to similar philosophies ºformer members of armed forces for

that have strategic impact the targeting process is continuous and undergoes ongoing scrutiny from intelligence analysis systems to ensure that targeting efforts remain relevant and always considerate of the special operations force mission criteria lethal and nonlethal strategy the strategy of search attack and assist is cyclic model combining lethal and nonlethal activities to achieve the desired effects on the enemy throughout the battlespace by balancing lethal and nonlethal activities one is able to achieve similar results regardless of what the enemy chooses to do if the acm elects to fight lethal strategy is prepared and postured to fix and finish them should the enemy elect to hide nonlethal strategy is prepared and postured to counter and find them moreover each facet of the strategy is complementary one may conduct an attack that leads to new search one may conduct search that leads us to an operation to assist each facet supports the next the entire lethal and nonlethal strategy is predicated on partnership with the afghan national army ana in everything the units do they must attempt to move from operations that have an afghan face to operations that are truly afghan led enabling the ana to eventually provide safe secure and stable environment for the afghan people below is model of several ttp that may be used in lethal and nonlethal strategy figure 23 16 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned endnotes 1 pressure pursue and punish the insurgent forces through relentless and continuous offensive operations 2 this is especially true with southern afghanistan the heart of religious factionalism and home of the taliban during their rule of the country 3 much of the insurgent forces resupply of weapons and ammunition within afghanistan comes from caches throughout the country that have been established from the mujahideen days of fighting the russians much of their resupply of food comes from the local populace or couchi tribes and their flocks of sheep and goats walking meat market 4 the main form of transportation for the insurgent soldier is by foot while leadership often rely on motorcycles and merchant vehicles for transportation many acm forces move with couchi tribes normally by force as deceptive measure 5 the acm have made great strides in training their leadership both from within and from foreign influences expect higherranking personnel to seek training and funding from outside sources 6 the green zones are referred to in the bear came over the mountain ltc us army retired grau foreign military studies office and other military books as the areas located along river basins these areas typically house people in long extending villages and promote the growth of trees and other agricultural crops because of this lush growth these areas are called green zones 7 simultaneous combat operations must be synchronized to maximize effects upon the insurgent forces for official use only 17southern afghanistan coin operationschapter 3 nonlethal as decisive operation it is longer sufficient to think purely in lethal terms friendly forces must think of nonlethal events and opportunities for execution across the entire battlespace executing traditionally focused combat operations and concentrating on training local security forces works but only for the short term in the long term doing so hinders true progress and in reality promotes the growth of the insurgent forces working against campaign objectives the objective is the population training and doctrine reinforce the simple directaction approach to accomplishing military objectives unfortunately given the complexity of the counterinsurgency coin and the dynamic between the afghans that openly support the insurgency and those within the area of influence otherwise known as fencesitters strict focus only on direct action or training the afghan national security forces ansf will lead to one result pushing those on the fence into the insurgent category rather than into the support category in effect by offering viable alternative shortterm wins ultimately cause the insurgency to grow the ideology of an insurgent can be drastically affected if nonlethal activities are employed effectively simultaneous lethal and nonlethal the reality is that there are cultural mechanisms at play that demand more integrated plan it is longer acceptable to think sequentially through stability operations and support operations believing that if you first establish the security environment you can work sequentially toward establishing critical infrastructure and governmental legitimacy and then drive toward economic independence if the only approach to coin is to kill bad guys and train others to kill bad guys the only effect accomplished is moving more people from the fence to the insurgent category there remains opportunity to grow the support base while killing insurgents is the best method of removing them from affecting the populace failing to consider and counter their ideology as the root cause of an insurgency will serve to boost it and increase their recruiting base friendly forces should seek to always make conditions in the environment as inhospitable to the insurgency as possible through populace resource control methods which will allow other lines of operations to be directed at countering the root cause and set longterm conditions which ensure success practical offsets ideological practical operations that assist the local populace serve to counter ideology these projects can provide medical assistance in areas lacking care or build schools and infrastructure to better living conditions while raising education levels all assistance operations are directed at helping those in need assistance must be rendered on conditional basis to the most deserving failure to identify the deserving will result in haphazard approach to assistance and provide care to the insurgents assistance can be used as rewardtype system in areas that provide intelligence or as way to sway support in areas that are neutral when possible assistance should be tied to larger systems to create networking effect across the entire battlespace this network would serve to promote commerce and assist in for official use only 19southern afghanistan coin operationssecurity building bridges roads clinics and schools serves to counter ideology and build support for the government enticing support longterm success in defeating the insurgency will only be achieved if the local populace supports the government of afghanistan the ansf and the coalition by revealing insurgent cells and denying the enemy sanctuary to achieve this end it is imperative to shape the populace by providing positive options through clear improvement in quality of life create symbols of progress by establishing basic local services demonstrating good governance and providing employment opportunities within villages and districts that are known for insurgent recruiting sanctuaries population security population security is the platform on which all other efforts must rest nonlethal operations are decisive in winning the support of the population the security of that population must be addressed to allow such nonlethal efforts to bear fruit the insurgents recognize this truism it is therefore important to keep an insurgency under control as insurgent activities typically match exactly the actions being taken to stabilize an environment the operational area military forces civil forces and the population must be organized to provide the following military and civil area administration static security posts and combat bases to facilitate operations from secure base security detachments for protecting critical military and civil installations essential routes of communication and key communities task forces for conducting police operations against underground elements task forces for conducting combat operations against guerrilla elements civil selfdefense units for protecting individual villages and small towns military and civil area administration the operational area is subdivided into geographic sectors or sectors coinciding with internal political subdivisions specific sector responsibility for administration and local operations should be delegated to single authority either military or civil static security posts and combat bases static security posts and combat bases are established to facilitate operations and not as the main focus

static security posts are organized to be as selfsufficient as possible reducing dependence on vulnerable land routes of communication combat bases combat bases are established as needed to facilitate the administration and support of company and battalionsize combat units combat bases are ideally located in secure area within or immediately adjacent to the units area of operation ao and are placed within established static security posts when practicable combat base is moved as often as necessary to remain within effective striking range of guerrilla elements and concentrically expand the secure area air and ground vehicles are employed extensively for deployment and support of troops to reduce the number of required combat bases all static security posts and combat bases are organized as both tactical and administrative entities to facilitate local security rapid assembly administration and discipline maintaining an offensive posture the ultimate objective of operations against an insurgent force is to eliminate the insurgent force and prevent its resurgence to attain this objective the following tasks must be accomplished establishment of an effective intelligence system to furnish detailed accurate and current knowledge of the insurgent force physical separation of guerrilla elements from each other their support base in the local population underground elements and any sponsoring power destruction of insurgent force elements by the defection surrender capture or death of individual members provision of political economic and social necessities and the ideological reeducation of dissident elements of the population to prevent resurgence of the insurgent force installation and community security critical military and civil installations and local communities must be secured against sabotage and guerrilla attack security is the key event that must take place to protect these vital areas to allow other operations to be taken against the enemy in sanctuary

size organization and equipment of local security forces security detachments in remote areas normally are larger than those close to supporting forces patrol requirements also influence the size of security detachments remote detachments maintain supply level to meet the contingency of isolation from their base for long periods and should be independent of the local population for supply

may be recognized as the informal seats of government within areas beyond the designated governmental seats of authority tribal lines also may follow geographical features and terrain identifying tribal boundaries is necessary to understand what lines and areas the local populace recognizes for guidance failure to understand where these areas are will result in loss of situational awareness and respect from the local populace using existing roads is another method of separating areas for operations however these roads are usually built into the centers of populations and are used to connect areas not to determine boundaries be aware that former occupations may have drawn boundary lines that contradict local customs or ideals for instance borders may be drawn along the tops of mountains and ridge lines however the local populace may recognize the rivers and valleys as the boundaries additionally boundaries may have been drawn to separate people instead of allowing them to be together basing strategy the ultimate goal of basing strategy is to develop bases that are ultimately turned over to the national army for continued operations and presence these bases are critical

to permit commanders staffs and troops to become thoroughly acquainted with the terrain the local population and the insurgent force organization and its techniques of operations military forces size the initial force assigned to combat an insurgent force must be adequate to complete their elimination initial assignment of insufficient forces may ultimately require use of larger force than would

rural areas to augment or replace civil police and their functions these patrols may vary from two men to squad in size military police units are ideally suited for employment in such role and light combat units are quite capable of performing the same functions with little additional training regular combat reconnaissance patrols are formed and employed in conventional and unconventional manner and for harassing operations in areas of extensive guerrilla activity these patrols are used to confirm or deny enemy presence and to pressure and pursue the enemy in order to find fix and finish extended combat patrols are employed in difficult terrain some distance from static security posts and combat bases extended combat patrols must be capable of employing guerrilla tactics and remaining committed from one to two weeks being supplied by air for the period of commitment and being equipped to communicate with base aircraft and adjacent patrols such operational detachment alpha oda

or guerrillas should be organized into auxiliary police and village selfdefense units those without such experience may be employed individually as laborers informants guards guides and trackers interpreters and translators civil forces will usually require assistance and support by the military force assistance is normally required in an advisory capacity for organization training and planning operations support is normally required in supplying arms ammunition food transportation and communication equipment police local and regional police are employed primarily to assist in establishing and maintaining order in urban areas local police are most effective in areas that are densely populated local police have greater 28 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned

regional balance leaders must consider the longterm effects of arming the populace versus disarming the populace in order to reduce violence paramilitary forces gendarmerie or other national paramilitary units are particularly effective in establishing and maintaining order in rural and remote areas because of their organization training and equipment they may also be employed in smallscale combat operations1 friendly guerrilla forces friendly guerrilla units that have operated in the same area as hostile guerrilla units are usually willing to assist in the counterguerilla effort such units may be effectively employed in extended combat patrol harassing missions in addition members of friendly guerrilla units can serve as trackers guides interpreters translators and espionage agents and can man observation posts and warning stations when friendly guerrilla units are employed they must be supported logistically and should be subordinate to the military force commander the military force commander maintains control and communication by furnishing liaison party to remain with the friendly guerrilla force and by controlling the support furnished special

provincial levels with some nesting taking place among the inclusive districts moreover the us special forces odas which are habitually located at fire bases within given district provide the extended outreach into the more remote villages where they must identify the inverse relationship between the expansion of government authority and the area of influence significant opportunities exist at the village level to affect the population and counter ideological support to the acm through infrastructure development and economic expansion the carrot and stick strategy functions at this level and provides significant leverage in the coin fight for example when fire base was being rocketed almost nightly team leader at the district shura meeting used the carrot and stick strategy by offering routine medical care and cashforwork programs as incentives for information leading to the identification of the source of these rocket attacks the rocketing of the fire base ceased teams shape an environment where the insurgency can longer rely on support from the local population as the local population shifts their loyalty to the national army and friendly forces who can provide better safer

there is an extremely low literacy rate in afghanistan especially in the rural areas therefore written products can be counterproductive some villages may have only one literate person to translate the written product for the other villagers depending on that persons motives he may or may not translate the product accurately therefore tf 31 psyop does not drop leaflets and is very selective when disseminating written products most written products can be understood by looking at the pictures and one does not need to read the text to understand the message listen to the radio radio is the most effective means of disseminating message to large number of people instantly radios have the ability to reach out to large audiences across wide and remote area to broadcast messages unlike leaflets the people themselves can decide on the message without relying on the insurgents to translate the message or bend the intended message towards their ideological interest kaito radios that can receive fm am and shortwave broadcasts are excellent methods to reach large audiences without information being filtered by the insurgency they operate on battery solar or windup power rolling radio stations one limitation of radio is that most of the broadcasts are targeted at people in the major cities much of their programming is fed from kabul therefore it is hard to target messages to specific villages the main limitation for radio is that some of the more rural areas cannot receive radio broadcasts because they are either too 34 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned normality indicators relative measures of the state of normalcy characterizing an element of the civil environment through data collected energy economy and commercegovernment public facilitiespublic safety security leadershipremote or mountains block the line of sight necessary to receive the signal forces are currently in the process of buying mobile radio stations that can be put in the more rural areas to negate this limitation these mobile stations will only have broadcast range of approximately 810 kilometers with sufficient numbers of these radios main population centers and centers of gravity can pass messages on to the most remote villages through word of mouth allowing friendly forces to tailor messages and programming to specific villages in addition mobile stations have the capability to announce locations for citizens to pick up humanitarian assistance supplies in the event of natural disaster themes and messages when coalition forces cf leave these radio stations will be turned over to afghans currently radio stations broadcast command information deception messages and psyop messages that follow approved themes an example of typical command io would be coalition forces will be operating in your area in cooperation with the legitimate government of afghanistan deception message might broadcast that cf will be operating in one area when in fact they will be operating somewhere else this deception may induce acm to move along known route thus allowing cf to ambush them or catch them if they flee to the actual area of operations or trick the acm into setting up ambushes in the wrong place approved psyop theme messages such as support the afghan national armygovernment of afghanistan report acm criminal activity or the government of afghanistan has done such and such for you what have the acm criminals done are the most common messages billboards tf 31 psyop built eight billboards throughout kandahar city the messages on these billboards can be changed every four to six months the billboards foster sense of pride among the ansf soldiers for their service and encourage them to reenlist however the current funding that pays for these billboards can only be used to support the ansf therefore the message on the billboard must promote proansf theme message necessary in kandahar where very few people join the ansf meaning very few pashtuns join the security forces this failure to enlist pashtuns leads some people to claim that the ansf is not truly national army mobile mullah another effective tool used by tf 31 psyop is the mobile mullah tf 31 currently uses one pashtun malowi district religious leader and one tajik mullah local religious leader these religious leaders are held in the highest regard among the afghan people making them extremely influential their words are considered to be the words of allah which is why acm use so many mullahs in their own psyopio campaign the differing tribal affiliations of the malowi and mullah add to their credibility especially when trying to encourage afghans to end their tribal fighting in support of peaceful nation having these two religious leaders work hand in hand with cf and ansf counters the acm message that cf forces are there to take islam away from the afghan people tf 31s current strategy for employment of the mobile mullahs is to preposition them during combat operations as part of cmo package this cmo package consists of medical team including female medics to conduct medcap any goa leadership that may be available such as for official use only 35southern afghanistan coin operationsthe governor cf psyop representative along with an ana counterpart to be discussed later approximately four interpreters and cf civil affairs representative along with an ana counterpart on conditional basis this cmo package infiltrates into the ao immediately following major combat operations cmo is only offered to villages on quid pro quo basis if villages report acm activity and refuse to voluntarily support the acm the tf provides them with cmo cmo cannot be used to support the acm by prepositioning this cmo flexpackage the tf is able to get inside the acm io turnaround time more than 2 to 4 hours and to simultaneously counter their ideology that cf and ansf are evil infidels loudspeaker messages tf 31 psyop employs several types of loudspeaker messages including deception operations surrender appeals and noninterference messages deception operations the tf plays gunfire helicopter or airplane sounds although not always very effective the deception sometimes causes them to fire on cf which identifies their location or the deception may cause an increase in integrated communications chatter which also helps identify their location the acm also monitors ansf radio chatter so sometimes the ansf are directed to say lets link up at point x when actually they will be meeting at point surrender appeals surrender appeals are used infrequently usually if the tf is on mission to capture or kill they do not want or expect the acm to surrender and by using surrender appeal they lose whatever element of surprise they might otherwise have achieved noninterference messages noninterference messages are often used during cordon and search missions and inform locals that if they cooperate they will not be harmed often times this is an effective way to conduct cordon and search operation without firing single shot program tokemesol program called program tokemesol pts operated by the goa encourages acm to turn themselves in and agree to stop conducting acm attacks and support the legitimate goa this program is not successful in southern afghanistan most of the acm in southern afghanistan are taliban and religiously motivated their allegiance is rooted in fanatical islamic beliefs that are not going to change their only reason for participating in pts would be to stop cf from targeting them which would allow them to survive until cf leave and they could reestablish themselves pts could also be used to facilitate their election to positions of political power and set up shadow government that could eventually overthrow the existing government pts may be effective against the lowlevel members of the acm who only participate to feed their families but it is not effective against guerilla underground or auxiliary taliban leadership dissemination operations for afghan national security forces ansf tf 31 psyop implemented training program for the ansf to teach them dissemination operations since it is illegal to teach the ana psyop tf 31 coined the term aido or afghan national army information dissemination 36 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedoperations these handpicked afghan soldiers received skilllevel 1 training to teach them to pass out novelty items and psyop products and to conduct loudspeaker messages this training falls under the foreign internal defense portion of

to augment other forces as governmental security forces have grown these forces have been reduced in mission and size original mission sets were offensive in nature but have been reduced to defensive force protection roles around the fire bases for official use only 39southern afghanistan coin operationschapter 4 combat operations applying lethal means the best method of separating an insurgent force from the populace is by killing the insurgent until the root cause of the insurgency is addressed insurgents will be replaced killing insurgents is not always feasible collateral casualties create insurgents faster than units can kill them therefore friendly forces seek to create an environment that is as inhospitable to the insurgency by gaining the support of the populace so that other actions can address the root causes combat operations overview find fix destroy combat operations are employed primarily against the guerrilla elements of an insurgent force however underground elements sometimes attempt to incite largescale organized riots to seize and hold areas in cities and large towns or fire bases combat operations are usually required to quell such uprisings rapid employment of civil affairs and psychological operations can be decisive in engaging these elements combat tactics used against guerrillas are designed to find the enemy in order to seize the initiative and destroy the guerrilla force by fixing and finishing defensive measures alone provide the guerrillas an opportunity to unify organize train and employ their tactics defensive attitude or failure to patrol outside of the area near fire bases also permits the guerrillas to concentrate superior forces inflict severe casualties and lower morale however the deliberate use of defensive attitude in local area as deceptive measure may prove effective constant pressure is maintained against guerrilla elements by vigorous combat reconnaissance patrolling and continuing attack until they are eliminated this keeps the guerrillas on the move disrupts their security and organization separates them from their sources of support weakens them physically destroys their morale denies them the opportunity to conduct operations and counters the attempt to spread their ideology once contact is made with guerrilla unit it is maintained until that guerrilla unit is destroyed surprise is sought in all operations but against wellorganized guerrillas it is difficult to achieve as networks are active and usually provide early warning surprise surprise may be gained by attacking at night in bad weather or in difficult terrain by employing operational detachments alpha odas with national army elements by varying operations in important particulars and by unorthodox or unusual operations counterintelligence measures are exercised throughout the planning preparation and execution of operations to prevent the guerrillas from learning the nature and scope of plans in advance lower echelons upon receiving orders are careful not to alter their dispositions and daily habits too suddenly tactical cover and deception plans are exposed to guerrilla intelligence to deceive the guerrillas as to the purpose of necessary preparations and movements force oriented the military force attacks targets such as guerrilla groups camps sanctuary areas lines of communication loc and supply sources unlike normal combat operations the capture of ground contributes little to the attainment of the objective for official use only 41southern afghanistan coin operationssince upon departure of friendly forces the guerrillas will reform in the same area specific objectives are sought that will force the guerrillas to concentrate defensively in unfavorable terrain and facilitate the surrender capture or death of the maximum number of guerrillas those guerrilla elements willing to fight in open battle are isolated to prevent escape and immediately attacked guerrilla elements that avoid open battle are forced into areas that permit containment once fixed in place they are attacked and destroyed holding cleared areas when the guerrilla area is too large to be cleared simultaneously it is divided into subareas that are cleared individually in turn this technique requires sealing off the subarea for the main effort to prevent the escape of guerrilla groups once subarea is cleared the main combat force moves to the next subarea and repeats the process sufficient forces remain in the cleared area to prevent the development of new guerrilla groups and to prevent the infiltration of guerrillas from uncleared areas pending the concentration of main effort in subarea sufficient forces are employed to gain and maintain contact with guerrilla units to harass them and to conduct reaction operations presence is important to countering ideological support to the enemy cordon operations the encirclement cordon of guerrilla forces is usually the most effective way to fix them in position to permit their complete destruction if terrain or inadequate forces preclude the effective encirclement of the entire guerrilla held area then the most important part of the area is encircled the encirclement is made in depth with adequate reserves and supporting elements to meet possible guerrilla attack in force and to block all avenues of escape surprise the planning preparation and execution of the operation are aimed at sudden complete encirclement that will totally surprise the guerrillas the move into position and the encirclement is normally accomplished at night to permit maximum security and surprise the encirclement should be completed by daybreak to permit good visibility for the remainder of the operation support and reserve units are committed as required to ensure sufficient density and depth of troops and to establish and maintain contact between units speed speed is emphasized throughout the early phases of the advance to the line of encirclement upon arriving on the line of encirclement units occupy defensive positions the most critical period in the operation is the occupation of the line of encirclement especially if the operation is at night large guerrilla formations may be expected to react violently upon discovering that they have been encircled the guerrillas will probe for gaps and attack weak points to force gap escape routes may be deliberately established as ambushes units organizing the line of encirclement deploy strong patrols to their front air reconnaissance is used to supplement ground reconnaissance use of helicopters provides flexibility and third dimension for cordoning off areas aerial reaction forces can be employed to quickly deny insurgents escape routes reserves are committed if guerrilla forces 42 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsucceed in breaking through or infiltrating the line of encirclement aerial reaction forces can be brought to bear against personnel or vehicles that have escaped finishing the enemy once the encirclement is firmly established the guerrilla force is methodically and thoroughly eliminated carefully controlled contraction of the perimeter may be conducted in any one of three ways 1 simultaneous controlled contraction of the encirclement 2 driving wedge through the guerrilla force to divide the area followed by the destruction of the guerrillas in each subarea and 3 establishing blocking force on one or more sides of the perimeter and tightening the others against the blockade do not underestimate terrain as blocking force it is effective but must be carefully considered since the local populace and guerrilla forces will have intimate knowledge of how to cross natural barriers and block your effective response looking under rocks units advancing from the initial line of encirclement must thoroughly comb every possible hiding place to locate guerrilla personnel and equipment successive echelons comb all the terrain again areas that appear totally inaccessible such as swamps rivers fields with crops rocky terrain and other areas must be thoroughly searched guerrilla ruses discovered during the operation are reported promptly to all participating units and agencies all local individuals including men women and children found in the area are held in custody and are released only after identification and on orders from appropriate authority after successful attack on guerrilla formation the area is combed for concealed guerrilla personnel and equipment documents and records are collected for intelligence analysis ambushes are retained along trails in the area for extended periods to kill or capture escapees and stragglers from the guerrilla force anticipate lack of time inadequate forces or the terrain may prevent encirclement operations surprise attacks followed by aggressive pursuit may prove successful in these cases the position probable escape routes and strength of the guerrilla forces must be ascertained before launching the operation ambushes should be established early on possible escape routes patrolling should be conducted in manner designed to confuse the guerrillas as to specific plans or intentions chances of achieving surprise are increased by using airmobile and by inducing trustworthy local guides who are thoroughly familiar with the terrain and guerrilla disposition to collaborate and guide the attacking force over concealed routes search attack assist harass and deny the most effective strategy for rooting out an insurgency and defeating them is by an aggressive search attack and assist operational strategy this strategy maintains strong focus on disrupting insurgent activities and countering their ideology by setting continuous tempo of searching and attacking followed by assisting friendly forces can set conditions for security in relatively short period of time for official use only 43southern afghanistan coin operationssearch operations search operations are designed to locate and identify enemy elements and areas of enemy support the method most frequently used for conducting this operation is the combat reconnaissance patrol patrol is given latitude to patrol an area to conduct proper assessment during these patrols forces typically meet with local village elders establishing rapport and gathering intelligence based on what is learned during search operations forces are able to continue offensive operations or assist the local populace searching operations are nonlethal however the posture maintained allows an immediate transition to lethal methods should the situation require or opportunity present itself attack operations based on intelligence gathered or information from search operations friendly forces may choose to attack enemy forces to inflict loss and destroy materials the only true method of separating an insurgent from the population is by killing him attack operations are lethalfocused operations while these operations are typically planned in extensive detail they may also result from enemy contact or reacttocontact situation when permitted attack operations are planned synchronized deconflicted and coordinated with all proper levels of command and resourced to the maximum extent operations that involve rotary wing aircraft give additional flexibility during initial infiltration for repositioning forces but may have limiting effects because of changes in the situation on the ground resulting in extraction before full exploitation of the objective area assist operations assist operations are designed to provide assessment assistance and support to the populace the primary objective during this operation is to counter the ideology of the enemy and gain support from the populace typical operations include medical assistance and veterinary assistance to help the people in areas where there is limited or infrastructure other operations assess populace and villages for projects eligible for commanders emergency relief program these programs typically provide wells for fresh drinking water new or refurbished schools or electrical generation the goal is to design and provide lasting infrastructure to the villages to offset the effects of enemy activity assist operations are also positive method of interacting with village elders and leadership harass operations harass operations prevent guerrillas from resting and regrouping inflict casualties and gain detailed knowledge of the terrain extended combat patrols and larger combat units execute these operations specific harassing missions include reconnaissance patrols to locate guerrilla units and camps raids against guerrilla camps1supply installations2patrols and outposts ambushes marking targets assisting major combat forces sent to destroy guerrilla groups 44 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedharass operations are conducted night and day3operations at night are directed at guerrillas moving about on tactical and administrative missions operations during the day are directed at guerrillas in their encampments while resting regrouping or training denial operations operations to deny guerrilla elements contact with and support by an external sponsoring power are initiated simultaneously with other measures denial operations require effective measures to secure extensive border or seacoast areas and to preclude communications and supply operations between sponsoring power and guerrilla units the method of contact and delivery of personnel supplies and equipment whether by air water or land must be determined at the earliest possible time border areas are secured by employing border control static security posts reaction forces ground and aerial observers listening posts equipped with electronic devices and patrols when time and resources permit wire and other obstacles cleared areas illumination and extensive informant nets are established throughout the border area radio direction finding and jamming and navy or air force interdiction or blockade elements may be required police operations commanders and friendly forces will usually be required to deal with local civil authorities and indigenous military personnel when the local civil government is ineffective the military commander will play major role in keeping order when possible efforts geared towards creating recognized legitimate civil authority will greatly assist in setting conditions for autonomous rule failure to develop competent police and other emergency services will result in increased crime corruption and failure to provide security safety and stability civil population controls the activities and movements of the civil population are restricted and controlled as necessary to maintain law and order and to prevent guerrilla forces from mingling with and receiving support from the civil population guerrilla forces will attempt to create underground and auxiliary support and spread their ideology when possible to support operations when the military commander is not authorized to exercise direct control of civilians he must tailor every legitimate action to influence the appropriate authorities to institute necessary measures either military or civil forces or combination of both may conduct policetype operations essential and enforceable restrictive measures are limited to those that are absolutely essential and can be enforced every effort is made to gain the willing cooperation of the local population to comply with controls and restrictions free movement of civilians is normally confined to their local communities exceptions should be made to permit securing food attending public worship and traveling as necessary in the event of illness rational and understandable punishment of civilians for criminaltype activities when authorized by the hn government must be applied with realistic discretion if the people become frustrated and alienated as result of unjust punishment the purpose is defeated take care to punish the true offender since subversive acts are often committed to provoke unjust for official use only 45southern afghanistan coin operationsretaliation against individuals or communities cooperating with friendly forces local police forces should be the force to distribute any punishment or law enforcement in these situations be aware that local customs for punishment may conflict with the rules of engagement and western values instituting human rights training and serving as role models are important to help develop legitimate local hn force that is respected and supported ttp police operations employ roadblocks and patrol search and seizure surveillance and apprehension techniques the following list is representative of the policetype controls and restrictions that may be necessary prevention of illegal political meetings or rallies registration and documentation of all civilians inspection of individual identification documents permits and passes restrictions on public and private transportation and communication means curfew censorship controls on the production storage and distribution of foodstuffs and protection of foodproducing areas controlled possession of arms ammunition demolition material drugs medicines and money patrolling operations patrolling maintains surveillance of urban and rural areas both night and day foot patrols are similar to normal police patrols but are usually larger vehicle patrols are used to conserve troops and to afford speed in reacting to incidents helicopters are employed to maintain overall surveillance in the form of aerial reaction forces and to move patrols rapidly improvised landing pads such as roofs of buildings parks vacant lots and streets are used be careful not to destroy property or upset livestock in populated areas patrol is show of force and must always reflect high standards of precision and disciplined bearing its actions are rigidly controlled to preclude unfavorable incidents understanding local customs and utilizing village elders with interpreters is an excellent approach when feasible surveillance operations surveillance of persons and places is accomplished both night and day by using combination of the techniques employed by military and civil police and counterintelligence agencies most surveillance activities are clandestine in nature and may require more trained agent personnel than are normally assigned or attached to army units surveillance operations must be highly coordinated among all participating agencies 46 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learneddetention operations facilities for screening civilians and interrogating suspects are established and maintained the requirements are similar to those for handling refugees line crossers and prisoners of war organization is on team basis and normally consists of military and civil police interpreterstranslators prisoners of war interrogators and counterintelligence agents each team is capable of operating at temporary locations to support operations against civil disturbances and largescale search and seizure operations take care to ensure all rules and regulations are followed following up with medical assistance can offset the effects of detaining people search and seizure operations search and seizure operations are conducted to screen builtup area apprehend insurgent force members and uncover and seize illegal arms communication means medicines and supplies search and seizure operations may be conducted at any hour of night or day establishing cordons is the key to preventing forces from escaping search operations may be conducted in daylight nighttime or following troops in contact situations limit inconvenience search and seizure operation is intended to be controlled inconvenience to the population concerned the persons whose property is searched and whose goods are seized should be irritated and frightened to such an extent that they will neither harbor insurgent force members nor support them in the future conversely the action must not be so harsh as to drive them to collaboration with the insurgent force because of resentment when possible use the village elders together with local hn police forces and hn military forces to assist and if trained and developed enough lead in this process use interpreters to explain to the local populace the purpose of the search to help prevent unrest or misguided perceptions against forces methodology builtup area to be searched is divided into block square zones search party is assigned to each zone and each party is divided into three groups search group to conduct the search security group to encircle or cordon the area to prevent ingressegress apprehend and detain persons and secure the open street areas to prevent all unauthorized movement and reserve group to assist as needed the population may or may not be warned to clear the streets and to remain indoors until permission is given to leave force is used as needed to ensure compliance each head of household or business is directed to assemble all persons in one room and then to accompany the search party to forestall charges of looting or vandalism be aware of cultural issues such as segregating females from the population or the searching of them religious buildings and materials should be handled in accordance with local customs buildings that have been searched are clearly marked by coded system to prevent false clearances combat in urban areas underground elements in cities and towns often incite organized rioting seize blockwide areas erect street barricades and resist any attempts to enter the area for official use only 47southern afghanistan coin operationsnonparticipants caught in the area are usually held as hostages the objectives of these operations are to commit the countering force to actions against the civil population that will result in gain of sympathizers for the insurgent force and make it appear that the insurgent force is promoting popular cause all of this serves to bolster the ideology of enemy forces and to sway people who are neutral for recruiting purposes when an urban area has been seized it must be reduced as soon as possible to prevent an apparent success or victory by the insurgent force to maintain popular support for the friendly cause and to free troops for use elsewhere the operations required to reduce it resemble normal street and housetohouse fighting overall the methodology used to deal with insurgents in urban or builtup areas is to isolate sweep cordon and search the following tactics are employed cordon is established to surround and seal the barricaded area the cordon is established at the next street or road out from the barricaded area that offers good visibility fields of fire and ease of movement all unauthorized personnel are cleared from the intervening area the cordon controls all movements into and out of the encircled area an announcement is made by loudspeakers and radio to the insurgents that the area will be attacked at given time unless they lay down their arms return their hostages safely and surrender peacefully amnesty and protection may be offered to those who surrender prior to the attack when possible contact the village elder for cooperation and assistance in conducting any type of search use of interpreters and national army forces to conduct the searches builds legitimacy and demonstrates their capabilities maneuver elements attack at the stated time and clear the area as rapidly as possible with minimum of killing and destruction of property avoid collateral damage the cordon remains in place to maintain security support the attack by fire where possible and receive prisoners and rescued hostages from the attacking elements use of helicopters to provide aerial cordon is effective and can also compensate for controlling anyone who evades the cordon if the area is large it is divided into sectors for control purposes as each sector is cleared the cordon moves in to exclude it close surveillance of cleared areas is maintained in case underground passageways are used as escape routes succeeding sectors are attacked and cleared one at time clear marking and understanding of maneuver forces are critical more so to prevent fratricide when national military forces from the army and police are involved roadblocks or traffic control points tcps tcps tcps are employed to control illegal possession and movement of goods check the adequacy of other controls apprehend members of the insurgent force and prevent free movement of insurgents along loc they help establish presence of law and order throughout populated areas and secure loc and logistics tcps can prevent 48 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedthe free movement of enemy soldiers and resources and can inhibit the emplacement of improvised explosive devices ieds roadblocks roadblocks are designed to halt traffic for search or to pass traffic as desired they are established as surprise checks because insurgent force members and their sympathizers soon devise ways of circumventing permanent checkpoints teams are trained and rehearsed to be capable of establishing roadblocks in matter of minutes at any hour local officials may be called on for assistance to include the use of official interpreters translators interrogators and local women to search women and girls when possible use local police or national military to conduct these operations to help establish legitimacy and show national presence roadblocks are established at locations that have suitable areas for assembling people under guard and for parking vehicles for search troops are concealed at the block and along the paths and roads leading to the block for the purpose of apprehending those attempting to avoid the block note conventional forces define roadblocks as barriers to stop all traffic all others are considered tcps inspection teams inspecting documents and searching persons and vehicles must be rapid and thorough the attitude of personnel performing these duties must be impersonal and correct because many of the people searched will be friendly or neutral when possible use local police or national army troops to conduct inspections ensure uniformity and visible presence duration consider how long it will take to establish the tcp some areas are desirable for emplacing permanent checkpoints while others are temporary depending on the situation permanent checkpoints or blocks can establish firm presence of law and order in areas and help set conditions for long lasting security the legitimacy provides the population with sense of responsible government that is concerned with their welfare temporary checkpoints serve as unpredictable measures in establishing safety and security carefully random tcps will disrupt insurgents and supporting activities all tcps most be monitored to prevent undue pressures on the local population and to prevent any type of extortion which would serve the ideology of an insurgent by showing that the government is repressive and overbearing block control block control is the constant surveillance and reporting of personnel movements within block or other small populated area by resident of that block or area who has been appointed and is supervised by an appropriate authority because of the civil authority and lengthy time required to establish block control system it is normally instituted and controlled by civil agencies an established block control system should be supported by the military force and in turn be exploited for maximum benefit be aware of the tribalism that may exist in areas and how this plays into the lines of division throughout the area block control typically works better in builtup areas for official use only 49southern afghanistan coin operationszones block control is established by dividing each block or like area into zones each of which includes all the buildings on one side of street within block resident zone leader is appointed for each zone and separate resident block leader is appointed for each block heads of households and businesses in each zone are required to report all movements of people to the zone leader to include arrivals and departures of their own families or employees neighbors and strangers zone leaders report all movements in their zone to the block leader the block leader reports daily to an appointed authority on normal movements the presence of strangers and other unusual circumstances are reported immediately informants the cooperation of leaders is secured by appealing to patriotic motives by pay or through coercion informants are established separately within each block to submit reports as check against the appointed block and zone leaders an informant net system is established using key informants for the covert control of number of block informants endnotes 1 the acm normally stay in remote villages deep within the sanctuary areas unless they are conducting deliberate operations raids either require air assets for infiltration or nightdismounted movements in order to cordon off the objective prior to the main combat force clearing the area 2 most of acm supplies are kept in caches within the mountains near villages rarely are large caches kept within villages due to the random cordon and search operations conducted by the ansf 3 due to the political constraints of the islamic republic of afghanistan government deliberate

logistics supply and maintenance adjust supply data to the operational environment these type operations may occur in wide variety of environments not reflected in the supply planning data consumption factors basic loads stockage levels and bases of issue must be adjusted to fit the area of operation similar factors must be developed for civil forces that may be supported in whole or part from military stocks the possible need for special items of material must be taken into consideration early local procurement should be practiced to reduce transportation requirements it frequently will be necessary to establish and maintain stockage levels of supply at echelons below those where such stockage is normally maintained static security posts and combat bases are examples of localities where stockage will be necessary on continuing basis training host nation hn personnel in logistical support must be conducted military support to civilians the military force must be prepared to provide essential items of supply to civilian victims of insurgent force attacks isolated population centers and groups which have been relocated or concentrated for security reasons these supplies may initially be limited to class i items and other survival necessities such as medical supplies clothing construction materials and fuel the distribution of indigenous supplies destined for civilian consumption must be supervised1because these supplies could be used by insurgent forces assembly storage and issue of these items to the civilian population must be strictly controlled local civilians are employed in these distribution functions to the maximum extent possible but in some situations all or part of the effort may fall on the military agencies civil affairs units are organized and trained for this purpose see civilmilitary operations in chapter 3 for details security of supplies security of supply installations is more critical than in normal combat operations not only must supplies be conserved for friendly consumption but their use must be denied to insurgent force elements2supply personnel must be trained and equipped to protect supplies against insurgent force attack and to guard against pilferage of supplies by the civilian population maintenance because the very nature of operations precludes the use of elaborate maintenance and support emphasize preventive maintenance provide time before and after each mission to effect repair and replacement direct support units dsu or direct support elements must provide rapid maintenance support at each static security post3and combat base although emphasis is upon repair by replacement direct exchange effort is made to repair items without complete overhaul or rebuild in planning for float items ensure that only fastmoving combatessential items are stocked emergency repair teams elements of the dsu are employed to meet special requirements usually experienced in reaction and harassing operations dsu for official use only 51southern afghanistan coin operationsteams accompany the combat elements and provide onthespot minor repair and limited direct exchange transportation key issues special transportation problems result primarily from the following factors abnormal distances between static security posts combat bases and combat units operating in the field difficult terrain and lack of signals communications in underdeveloped areas where operations against guerrillas are apt to occur probability that movements of troops and supplies will be subject to attack harassment and delay4 use all available sources organic transportation means may require augmentation from both military and local sources depending on the command conditions provision of adequate transportation may require such measures as recruiting indigenous bearer units for man pack operations organizing provisional animal pack units to include the necessary logistical support exploitation of available waterways and indigenous land transportation to include railway and highway equipment security considerations security will normally be provided to all surface movements appropriate security measures include intensive combat drivers training and arming vehicles involved aircraft route reconnaissance pending availability of aircraft convoy escorts aircraft will frequently be the most effective means of resupply because of their speed relative security from ground attack and lack of sensitivity to terrain conditions army aviation and aviation of other services are utilized the terrain tactical situation and landing area availability may require employment of parachute delivery5as well as airlanded delivery rotary wing assets deliver large portion of the supplies to the outstations within the sanctuary areas where ground delivery is more dangerous 52 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedmedical evacuation and hospitalization medical service organization and procedures will require adaptation to the type of operations envisioned medical support is complicated by distances between the installations where support must be provided use of small mobile units in independent or semiindependent combat operations in areas through which ground evacuation may be impossible or from which aerial evacuation of patients cannot be accomplished or will be significantly delayed vulnerability of ground evacuation routes to guerrilla ambush there are several factors and measures that may be utilized to overcome the complicating factors the following are examples of such measures establish aid stations with treatment and holding capacity at lower echelons including static security posts and combat bases patients to be evacuated by ground transport may be held until movement by secure means is possible use forwardstationed surgical teams for area medical support of both us and hn patients provide sufficient air or ground transportation to move medical elements rapidly to establish or reinforce existing treatment and holding installations where patients have been unexpectedly numerous ie mass casualty situations maximize use of air evacuation both casualty evacuation and medical evacuation to include both scheduled and oncall evacuation support of static installations and combat elements in the field provide small medical elements to augment extended combat patrols assign specially trained enlisted medical personnel special forces medical sergeants independent duty corpsman etc who are capable of operating medical treatment facilities for short periods of time with minimum of immediate supervision use hn medical assistance for supervised work and formation of indigenous litter bearer teams strictly supervise sanitation measures maintenance of individual medical equipment both personal aid items and combat lifesaver kitsvehicle kits and advanced firstaid training combat lifesavers or equivalent throughout

efforts during winter storms where ground and rotary wing assets are not viable option 54 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedchapter 6 special considerations intelligence general accurate detailed and timely intelligence is mandatory for successful operations against insurgent forces the insurgent force is normally ever changing compartmented and difficult to identify and it usually conducts extremely effective intelligence and counterintelligence ci programs consequently more intelligence and ci personnel are often needed than would be required for normal combat operations the nature of the enemy the tactical deployment of troops and the presence of both friendly and hostile civilians in the area dictate modification of normal collection procedures intelligence is the driving force in counterinsurgency coin environment intelligence activities are characterized by extensive coordination with and participation in police detection and penetrationtype operations such as search and seizure operations establishing and operating checkpoints and roadblocks to curtail enemy movement documenting civilians for identification with central files psychological operations psyop to counter the enemys ideology physical and electronic surveillance and tracking of suspects and meeting places maintaining extensive databases on events personalities and locations using funds and supplies to obtain information both from sources and cooperative villages intensive tactical interrogation of captured guerrillas or underground suspects local knowledge conducting intelligence operations requires an intimate knowledge of local customs languages cultural background and personalities indigenous police security and military and governmental organizations are usually the best available sources for this knowledge individual civilian liaison personnel interpreters guides trackers and clandestine agents are almost always required key personnel must be trained in the proper use of indigenous liaison personnel and interpreters the loyalty and reliability of such persons must be firmly established ci vetting process and periodic checks made to guard against their subsequent defection special effort is made to collect information that will lead to the capture of insurgent force leaders since they play vital part in maintaining insurgent force morale and effectiveness for official use only 55southern afghanistan coin operationsterrain intelligence coalition military force knowledge of the terrain must equal that of the insurgent forces terrain information is continuously collected and processed and the resulting intelligence is promptly disseminated current topographic and photo maps along with an extensive overhead imagery database are maintained and reproduced terrain models are constructed and used to brief staffs and troops intelligence planning should provide for suitable substitutes such as large scale photo coverage particular effort is made to collect the following information areas likely to serve as guerrilla hideouts such areas usually have the following characteristics ºdifficult access mountains box valleys or remote canyons ºeasily concealed from air reconnaissance caves ºcovered withdrawal routes ºlocated within one days foot movement of small settlements that could provide food intelligence information and warning the more isolated and uneducated the populace the better ºadequate water supply ºadjacent to lucrative targets roads and trails approaching traversing and connecting suspected or known guerrilla areas roads and trails near friendly installations and lines of communication loc location of fords bridges and ferries across water barriers location of all small settlements and farms in or near suspected guerrilla areas when insurgent force elements are known or suspected to have contact with an external power border areas must be sealed to prevent the enemy infiltrating from sanctuary nation denied territory insurgent data targeting packets on leaders and other key members of the insurgent force should be maintained and carefully studied frequently some of these individuals develop patterns which if recognized and analyzed may aid materially in the conduct of operations against them efforts are made to obtain rosters and organization data of insurgent force elements this information should be charted to graphically display the chains of command whenever possible derive the names and locations of families relatives and friends of known members these persons are valuable as sources of information and traps can be laid for other members contacting them in communities friendly to guerrillas some persons are usually engaged in collecting food and providing other aid such as furnishing message drops and safe houses for 56 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedguerrilla couriers auxiliary every effort is made to discover and apprehend such persons however it may be preferable in certain cases to delay their arrest in order to watch their activities and learn the identity of their contacts it is sometimes possible to recruit these persons as informants thereby gaining valuable information concerning the insurgent force organization and its communication system overt collection intelligence personnel troop units and special information services assisted by civilian agencies and individuals provide large part of the intelligence required for operations against insurgent forces reconnaissance and surveillance rs rs is indispensable to operations against the guerrilla elements great care must be exercised however so that such activities do not alert the guerrillas and warn them of planned operations whenever possible reconnaissance missions should be assigned to units with routine mission in the area of operations in order not to alert guerrillas of forthcoming operations tactical assets such as special operations teamalpha lowlevel voice intercept and small unmanned aerial vehicles can be used by ground forces to gain situational awareness in their immediate vicinity extensive use is made of nationallevel reconnaissance assets using all types of sensors signals intelligence and imagery intelligence with means for speedy exploitation of the interpreted results of such coverage and method for forwarding that information to forward operating bases in timely manner every soldier is an intelligence agent and ci agent when operating against an insurgent force each man must be observant and alert to everything he sees and hears he reports anything unusual that concerns the civil population and the insurgent force matter how trivial clandestine collection clandestine collection means are necessary source of information every effort is made to infiltrate the insurgent force with friendly agents indigenous agents are usually the only individuals capable of infiltrating an insurgent force such agents are carefully screened to ensure they are not double agents and will not relate information gained about friendly forces to the insurgent force the most intensive clandestine operations possible must be developed consistent with time available means and established policy agents are recruited among local residents of the operational area who have an intimate knowledge of the local populace conditions and terrain local residents also often have prior knowledge of or connections with members of the insurgent force if targeting force that operates base from denied territory sanctuary nation take care in selecting sources that are capable of conducting crossborder collection this type of collection will be crucial in determining enemy preparations and operations in and from sanctuary ci insurgent forces depend primarily upon secrecy and surprise to compensate for the superior combat power available to the countering military force since the degree of surprise will depend largely on the effectiveness of the intelligence gained by the for official use only 57southern afghanistan coin operationsinsurgent force intensive effort must be made to expose thwart destroy or neutralize the insurgent force intelligence system ci measures may include background investigation of personnel in sensitive assignments screening civilian personnel employed by the military surveillance of known or suspected insurgent force agents censorship monitoring or suspension of civil communications control of civilian movement as required checks on the internal security of all installations indoctrination of military personnel in all aspects of security apprehension and reemployment of insurgent force agents security classification and control of plans orders and reports ci operations are complicated by the degree of reliance placed on local organizations and individuals the difficulty in distinguishing between friendly and hostile

places strain on communications means throughout command augmentation by signal teams and equipment are invariably required to answer basic needs radio radio is the primary means of communication and radio nets are established between all echelons and as needed between military and civil agencies groundair radio communication is established for all airborne airmobile and airsupported ground operations typically radio nets are set up utilizing satellite communications satcom and highfrequency communications both of these forms of communications can be used to cover large distances and overcome obstacles such as large mountain ranges satcom is the preferred method for special operations forces as it is simple to use and can operate on the move visual communication can supplement radio communication between small units for groundtoair signaling and marking the use of flags lights smoke pyrotechnics heliographs and panels finds considerable application in such operations internet for daily base operations all fire bases use the secure internet protocol router network siprnet the standard setup at most fire bases requires that sipr traffic be encrypted and sent over the internet to the headquarters location where it is decrypted this setup allows email and file sharing of large file sizes that was not possible in the past communication equipment additional radios

appreciate the effectiveness of insurgent forces and the active and passive measures to be employed foreign internal defense training must be focused and directed against the threat the insurgency training can also be performed during the conduct of operations against insurgents troops who are seasoned can be employed more rapidly in these situations as time passes the unit develops reputation and ability to perform the challenge will be to train new troops who arrive at the unit your enemy is competent troops must never underestimate the guerrillas to look down on guerrilla forces as inferior poorly equipped opponents breeds carelessness which can result in severe losses training for operations against insurgent forces is integrated into field exercises and maneuvers as well as in individual and smallunit training programs aggressor force tactics in training exercises should include insurgent activities both clandestine and overt normal individual and smallunit training should emphasize the following physical conditioning tactics techniques and procedures appropriate to urban areas remote villages mountains and deserts extended combat patrol operations using only such supplies as can be transported by the patrol immediate reaction to unexpected combat situations employment of army aviation to include techniques of airmobile assault and casualty loading aerial resupply by army and air force aircraft to include drop and landing zone marking and materiel recovery techniques day and night operations techniques of raids ambushes and defensive and security

in manner that will not compromise actual operations but are conducted under like conditions of terrain and time of day or night 62 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedchapter 8 fire base construction general building and creating fire base is complex task that must be well thought out and have clear vision for expansion and development from inception multiple factors are involved this chapter will focus on actual general planning and construction factors the longterm goal is to build base that can be handed over to the government of afghanistan for continued security safety and stability in the area the number of personnel will initially determine the size of the fire base surge factors will allow for additional personnel and the growth and development of the fire base several planning factors for size are the number of us special forces attachments coalition partners afghan national army units afghan national security forces ansf and other base support requirements force protection site selection will play large role in the security requirements and manning of the fire base both external checkpoints and internal security most fire bases are situated to allow for standoff from local population centers yet provide easy access to lines of communication these factors must be balanced to achieve the overall desired effects fire base walls are typically initially constructed of hescos prefabricated multicellular defense systems but the goal is to replace the hescos with block walls to withstand the elements covering dead space and creating enough of safety zone to prevent rocket attacks mine emplacements along routes and observation must account for enemy considerations the hesco wall surrounding the living and working area is 8 feet high with two 4foot high bases concrete block guard towers are positioned at each corner and reinforced with sandbags chainlink screens are used to cover positions from rocketpropelled grenades and hand grenades subsequent fighting positions are constructed within the fire base and along the main wall vehicle fighting positions are created to bring to bear the most casualtyproducing weapons into the fight all living spaces are built within the inner perimeter personnel within the compound are safe from smallarms fire but vulnerable to rocket fire and indirect fire if possible helicopterlanding zone within the compound provides options for exfiltration infiltration resupply and medical evacuation buildings must be built to improve the quality of life and protect personnel from the seasonal elements as well as from the threat of attack buildings made of concrete and ibeam construction provide the best overall structures terrain terrain must be considered in the areas to provide maximum standoff best fields of fire and view and ultimate fire base expansion most fire bases use outer security checkpoints manned by ansf near the fire base concertina wire is strung to canalize in traditional fashions most terrain in afghanistan is open rocky terrain that is undulating with micro lines of drift areas that support helicopter operations possibly fixed wing unimproved runways and ranges for mediumcaliber weapons and indirect fire assets must be considered the enemys point of view of terrain must be strongly considered for official use only 63southern afghanistan coin operationselectrical generators provide power generation initial development of fire bases must be envisioned for the proper wiring and layout of zone power girds use of contracted electricians and construction workers can assist greatly in the development of this system establishing zones allows for proper wiring growth and development if possible primary and alternate generation site should be established in the event of fire or direct hit plumbing field sanitation is paramount to the health and safety of personnel on the fire base bulk water from locally drilled wells is typically the primary source of water if possible an alternate well should be drilled to have backup source well water is used for laundry showers and sewage all cooking and drinking water comes from bottled water planning considerations should be made to accommodate the number of personnel including surges for showers cooking and waste disposal showers can be constructed as part of existing buildings or as separate facilities wiring piping and hotwater heaters will be the primary requirements for these facilities when possible bringing in americanmade products will provide the reliability and longlasting capability needed locally purchased products do not have the same quality control standards waste treatment may take the form of septic tanks or burn barrels the soil type will determine the system used most remote fire bases do not have access to local sewage systems or water systems portable toilet services are typically not available throughout these regions fuel fuel stands are required for storing and distributing bulk fuel force protection of fuel assets is critical use established standards for handling and storing petroleum products to prevent contamination of the fuel and local drinking water initially fuel is typically stored in 55gallon drums and pumped with hand cranks emplacing fuel bladders is an effective technique for larger quantities of fuel developed fire bases have emplaced sealed containers express conexs underground and put in fuel pumps for delivery separate primary and alternate fuel sources in the event of an attack or direct hit if possible provide overhead cover base equipment standard equipment for the base includes kitchen sets motor pool assets gym sets power generators and earthmoving equipment priorities of work as well as access will determine how quickly these resources flow into the base camp as facilities are developed more equipment is brought into the base to continue improvements and quality of life accountability for these items on incountry property books is requirement as most of this equipment is handed over from one rotation to another storage storage is immediately created by using militaryowned demountable containers milvans milvans are used to ship in base equipment materials and other goods for building and sustaining the base as these containers come in they can be further used for storing and handling items common items requiring storage are munitions team equipment lumber and building material and any other item that 64 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedmust be secured milvans have also been used for bunkers portable housing and work units work areas work areas must be separated from sleeping and eating areas for sanitation and health concerns basing strategy that projects where facilities will be located
