the supreme court ruled that issuing policy of insurance is not transaction of interstate commerce united states v southeastern underwriters assn 322 us 533 1944 held that the federal antitrust laws were applicable to an insurance associations interstate activities in restraint of trade although the 1944 court did not specifically overrule its prior determination the case was viewed as reversal of 75 years of precedent and practice and created significant apprehension about the continued viability of state insurance regulation and taxation of insurance premiums congress response was the 1945 mccarranferguson act it prohibits application of the federal antitrust laws and similar provisions in the federal trade commission ftc act as well as most other federal statutes to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is regulated by state lawexcept that the antitrust laws are applicable if it is determined that an insurance practice amounts to boycott early mccarranferguson decisions mostly favored insurance companies after 1969 however the exemption for the business of insurance was generally limited to activities surrounding insurance companies relationships with their policyholders in 2003 the supreme court ruled that mccarran case law prohibiting the indirect application of federal antitrust or other laws to the business of insurance would longer control with respect to those areas over which congress has unquestionable legislative authority eg erisa civil rights securities notwithstanding insurancecompany invo lvement none of the bills introduced in the 109 th congress to limit or amend mccarranferguson were enacted but the issue is continuing to receive attention in the 110th congress senator leahy has introduced s 618 bipartisan measure to eliminate the antitrust exemption provided by mccarranferguson and to restore the ftcs authority to investigate the insurance industry representative defazio has introduced hr 1081 an identical and similarly bipartisan bill in the house both however would retain the exemption for the applicability of the ftc act as it relates to areas other than unfair competition even in the event the mccarran exemption were to be severely limited or totally eliminated however the stateaction doctrine in antitrust law has the potential to mitigate the consequences of either state action stands for the proposition that the federal antitrust laws do not apply to the states nor to private individual s acting either under state order or authorization to the extent that state regulation of insurance embodies clearly articulated state policy and regulators actively supervise the activities of insurance companies the industrys antitrust exemption could actually be broadened to include actions not clearly the business of insurance those phrases have been firmly embedded in the stateactiondoctrine jurisprudence in the antitrust law for more than 25 years this report will be updated

accordingly neither insurers nor state regulators could 1 invoke mccarranferguson as shield against federal regulation of variable annuities or 2 qualify as beneficiaries of the insurance exclusions in the federal securities laws moreover the case established that the definition of insurance under mccarran ferguson is federal not state question nationsbank v valic8 made similar determination concerning the sale of fixed annuities which are sold both by insurers and by banks the court agreed with the comptroller of the currency that in the provision of fixed annuities banks are essentially offering financial investment instruments of the kind congressional authorization permits them to broker hence it was reasonable to characterize the permission nationsbank sought as an incidental power necessary to carry on the business of banking9

whatever the exact scope of the statutory term it is clear where the focus was in mccarranit was on the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder only statutes aimed at protecting or regulating this relationship are laws regulating the business of insurance13 about 25 years after national securities limited the term business of insurance to activities involving only insurance companies relationships with their policyholders the court extended that ruling it held in us department of treasury v fabe that state laws addressing the liquidation of insurers constitute the business of insuranceand under mccarranferguson preempt conflicting federal statutes but only to the extent that they are necessary to protect the insolvents policyholders 14 the united states had argued that an ohio statute determining the order in which claims against an insolvent insurance company are to be paid15 should be preempted by the federal priority statute authorizing the payment of us claims against an insolvent entity16 the court disagreed however with respect to the payment of policyholder claims and payment of the administrative expenses reasonably necessary to the payment of policyholder claims and said the primary purpose of statute that distributes the insolvent insurers assets to policyholders in preference to other creditors is identical to the primary purpose of the insurance company itself the payment of claims made against policies17 later decisions continued the distinction made by fabe between statutes that address the business of insurance and may therefore reversepreempt conflicting federal statutes and those that will be preempted under traditional constitutional principles for example international ins co v duryee18 involved an ohio statute that effectively prohibited outof state insurance companies from removing cases from ohio state to federal court by barring such companies from further business in ohio the ited states court of appeals for the sixth circuit emphatically stated there that the mccarranferguson act was not meant to protect statute so tangentially related to insurance from the general rule of federal law supremacy19 the court first quoted from 1922 supreme court ruling terral v burke const co 20 state may not in imposing conditions upon the privilege of foreign corporations doing business in the state exact from it waiver of the exercise of its constitutional right to resort to the federal courts or thereafter withdraw the privilege of doing business because of its exercise of such right whether waived in advance or not 21 and then it quoted from fabe itself 13 393 us at 460 emphasis added 14 508 us 491 1993 15 ohio rev stat 390301 et seq 16 the federal priority statute is found at 37 usc 3713 17 508

the purpose of regulating the business of insurance necessarily encompasses more than just the business of insurance 22 group life health insurance co v royal drug co stands for the proposition that mccarran fergusons exemption is for the business of insurance not the business of insurers23 independent retail pharmacies charged blue shield of texas with price fixing in the negotiation of pharmacy agreements based on which the insurance company had issued policies that facially entitled policyholders to purchase prescription drugs from any pharmacy in reality the independents argued insureds were more likely to choose pharmacies that had entered into the pharmacy agreements because at those establishments mostly larger chain pharmacies policyholders were required to pay only 2 for each prescription drug purchased pharmacy agreementpharmacy would be reimbursed for its costs and the 2 charge would be its profit at nonparticipating pharmacies mostly smaller independent stores insureds would be expected to pay the entire cost of any drug and then seek reimbursement from blue shield for 75 of the cost the supreme court rejected blue shields argument that the mccarranferguson act made the pharmacy agreements immune to prosecution under the antitrust laws the court emphasizing that although the agreements between blue shield and the participating pharmacies may serve to minimize the costs blue shield incurs in fulfilling its underwriting obligations they do not involve any underwriting or spreading of risk are not integral to the relationship between the insurer and the insured and are not limited to entities within the insurance industry 24 in gilchrist v state farm mutual auto ins co 25 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit appeared not to continue the royal drug reasoning when policyholders challenged the practice of certain automobile insurers of improperly limiting the scope of insurance coverage for auto body repairs the court distinguished some earlier decisions concerning the scope of the mccarranferguson exemption the appeals court first emphasized that royal drug as well as later case in which chiropractors challenged the insurancecompany policy of peer reviewing chiropractic fees and practices 26 concerned challenges by non policyholders to insurance companies agreements with th ird parties but it noted gilchrist on

regulation needs to meet any particular standard to qualify as preempted regulationhas remained question30 in 1958 in federal trade commission ftc v national casualty co31 for example the court had already decided that mccarranferguson withdrew from the commission the authority to regulate insurers advertising practices in those states which are regulating those practices under their own laws32and that the ftc could not therefore order the multistateinsurancecompany defendants to stop using advertising that the commission deemed false deceptive and misleading in violation of section 5 of the ftc act33 but the court expressly declined to examine whether the states laws had been effectively applied finding it sufficient that each state in question had enacted prohibitory legislation which proscribed unfair insurance advertising and authorized enforcement through scheme of administrative supervision34 most decisions have found it sufficient for mccarranferguson regulated by state law purposes that state insurance departments have jurisdiction over insurance practices and the authority to act whether they exercise their authority or not35 in 1982 however federal district court in florida held that it is essential to conduct some sort of inquiry into the adequacy and effectiveness of state legislation asserted to preempt the antitrust laws36

malpractice policy in manner unfavorable to the doctors who were then unable to take their business elsewhere because the other companies refused to sell them malpractice policies of any sort this the doctors charged was the result of an unlawful conspiracy and constituted boycott in violation of the antitrust laws the district court held that the purpose of mccarrans boycott language was to protect industry members from being blacklisted38 the court of appeals reversed finding that the protection of insurance consumers by the usual reading of boycott coercion or intimidation does not pose grave danger to state authority39 the supreme court agreed holding that the conduct in question accords with the common understanding of boycott40 if congress had intended to limit the scope of the boycott exception to industry members the court said it would have done so explicitly41 in hartford fire ins co v california 42 however divided courtdifferentiating between conspiracy and boycott refused to find for the nineteen states which alleged that the practices of several us and foreign insurersacting to force other insurers to sell only policies with terms similar to those in the

at hand and mcca rranprotected mere concerted refusal to deal on certain contract terms deemed to be central to the insurance contract but noted that absent mccarranferguson either would violate the antitrust laws conspiracy is combination of two or more persons acting in concert to accomplish common unlawful purpose of course as far as the sherman act outside the exempted insurance field is

for mccarran act immunity is less than required for the state action doctrine aba ald at 1373 for example in at least one case decided at the administrative level using mccarran analysis and judicially using state action analysis although both opinions came to essentially the same conclusioncertain writers of title insurance were found to have violated federal prohibitions the state action analysis also faulted the quality and quantity of state regulation after the federal trade commission refused to find that the practice of setting rates for title searches constituted the business of insurance for mccarran purposes and so violated 5 of the ftc act 15 usc 45 which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in or affecting commerce see in the matter of ticor insurance
