bridge publications inc newsletter date the importance of granting beingness but above all those things is an individuals ability to grant beingness to the moment grant beingness to the past to the future grant beingness to others grant beingness to his own objects and grant beingness and then not be afraid of it and having granted beingness why go right on granting more beingness rather than stop granting beingness simply because some of it bit him one cannot become able in life be fearing to live it never and he cant be himself without being willing to grant beingness because hes the only one that can grant beingness to himself l ron hubbard excerpted from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lecture series ability to grant beingness an article by l ron hubbard from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lectures when mike angelo painted something or sculpted something it was quite perfect in its form but if it was just form that we were going on today just form alonesee were right up there on the border of not quite able to talk about this mest language sort of goes by the boards the form and line of the painting and of the statue is good its good enough so that you see photograph of it and you think thats fine and it isnt until you confront an original mike angelo vis√†vis that you realize that the fellow who painted this thing really meant it the amount of life in the statue itself which is being controlled and held down in some fashion or anotherthe thing is just about to become nova or something itsthe amount of vitality now we are into practically necromancy in other words that thing is alive and its life is quite apparent even to street urchin now i saw one time very beautiful white statue by an artist or by sculptor whose name i havent any inkling of at all and it was in perfectly strange and peculiar part of the world that you wouldnt expect an artist to have lived in and it was so simple as to form that it was hardly guilty of being statue at allwhich yet had impressed into it so much vitality of sort of calm and pervading nature that it was actually filling up whole patio full of calmness the thing was alive there was doubt about it at all and this was not something which gifted few would perceive those people who are completely dedicated to the plow might not have seen it very easily but every beggar and peddler and maid and person and gentleman and clerk on that street would come over by that patio and sit down and look at the statue for short time almost every evening there were many better places to sit but they would come in and theyd look at the statue see it was alive there was doubt about that and of course one could even say that they themselves by looking at it and granting it further being it kept up the tradition of its existence and so you had living something have you ever seen house that nobody lived in go to pieces and lose its beingness have you ever seen town lose its beingness or have you ever felt directly the beingness of town people keep up this beingness now an artist can come ina writer poet something of this sortand grant new beingness to town sort of out of whole cloth he just looks around and he says why you have beautiful town here and so forth and he tells the people all about it and theyve never granted any beingness at all theyre so busy trying to keep each other from eating each other up theyve never noticed this but this is something they can agree upon this town and the town comes to life just to that degree it is alive then l ron hubbard from the
