government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608tax issues relating to charitable contributions and organizations summary the value of tax benefits for charita ble contributions and organizations is estimated to be around 100 billion per year bout half of this cost arises from the deductions for charitable contributions and about half from exemptions of earnings of nonprofits while revisions to the treatment of charitable contributions and taxexempt organizations that receive contributions have been made in the past few years several issues may be considered in future legi slation of most immediate concern are the provisions that as part of the extende rs expired at the end of 2007 and may be considered for extension other issues th at may arise reflect concerns about donor advised funds and supporting organizati ons now under study at the treasury department nonprofit hospi tals provision of charity care and educational institutions use of growing endowments while current proposals are under consideration charitable contribution fl oors and extensions to nonitemizers were included in the presidents advisory pane ls tax proposals and in the congressional budget offices budget options study most of the charitable extenders were contained in legislation first introduced in 2001 some provisions were enacted mporarily in 2005 further provisions and extensions occurred in 2006 in the pensi on protection act pl 109280 these extenders include an individual retirem ent account ira rollover liberalized treatment of certain gifts of inventor and conservation pr operty and two more technical provisions one of these technical provisions relates to the treatment of corporations that elect to be taxed as pa rtnerships and the other to the definition of unrelated business income of taxexempt organizations which is subject to tax these extenders are being considered currently in various bills legislation primarily in th pension protection act also imposed restrictions on contributions and charitable organizati ons to address abuses the act made changes relating to donoradvised funds nd supporting organizations which receive charitable contributions for further donation that legislation also commissioned the treasury department to study this i ssue and make recommendations including whether minimum distributions should be re quired in addition some of the same concerns about whether funds were being pa id out at high enough rate were also directed at university and co llege endowments where co mbination of high returns and relatively low payout rates has led to ra pid growth issues have also been raised about whether nonprofit hospita ls provide enough charity car the senate finance committee has in the past investigated potential abuses raised by the internal revenue service or reported in the media these investigations have sometimes led to selfcorrection and some times led to legislation this report will be update d to reflect

charitable contributions and organizations the value of tax benefits for charita ble contributions and organizations is estimated to be around 100 billion per year while revisions to the treatment of charitable contributions and taxexempt organizations that receive these contributions have been made in the 108th and 109th congress number of issues remain unresolved several lib eralizations of tax benefits for charitable contributions including an individual retirement account ira rollover liberalized treatment of certain gifts of inventory and some other revisions expi red at the end of 2007 these extenders are being considered currently in various bills certain issues relating to donoradvised funds and supporting orga nizations which receive charitable contributions for further donation were addressed in 2006 the legislation also included directive to the treasury department to study this issue and make recommendations in addition some of the same concerns about whether funds were being paid out at high enough rate were also directed at university and college endowments where combination of high re turns and relatively w payout rates has led to rapid growth issues have also b een raised about whet her nonprofit hospitals provide enough charity care this report reviews those issues beginni ng with discussion of current tax benefits review of legislative changes in the past four years and discussion of potential future legislative issues it focuses on deductions for charitable contributions and on institutions that are generally eligible for deductible charitable contributions such as soci welfare organizations educational institutions non profit hospitals and churches along with conduits to those institutions such as private foundations donoradvised f unds and supporting organizations current tax benefits the tax system provides series of be nefits for taxexempt and charitable organizations the most widely estimated and discussed is the deduction for charitable contributions which is estimate d in fy2008 to reduce federal revenue by about 46 billion1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs2 1 continued with the remaining 8 unclassified see giving usa 2006 distribution posted at httpsforcebenevoncomimagesgivingusa2007htm another important benefit is the exemp tion of earnings on assets from the income tax as discussed below while this benefit is difficult to estimate it appears to be as large in the neighborhood of 50 billion per year for universities and colleges these benefits are severa l times as large as the sa vings by donors from deducting charitable contributions charitable contributions not all taxexempt organizations can receive tax ductible donations but religious educational social welfar health animal protection and similar organizations are eligible over the past several years seve ral revisions to the treatment of charitable deduc tions have been made bot h to expand benefits and address potential abuses so of the provisions that expand benefits have become part of the extenders provisions that expi re or have expired but are seen as likely to be extended or reinstated while charitable deductions are available to all taxpayers individuals who take the standard deduction do not have marginal tax incentiv to give the standard deduction does not impose penalty as it is an option that can be used when it is greater than the total sum of itemized deductions slightly over onethird of taxpayers itemize about 30 deduct ch aritable contributions individuals contributions are in general limited to 50 of income for most charities but are restricted to 30 for certain nonprofits including nonoperating foundations and institutions set up for the benefit of members such as fraternal lodges individuals can contribute property as well as cash and th contribution of appreciated assets has particularly beneficial treatment since the value of most appreciated assets can be deducted without including the capital gain s in income some contributions of property are limited to the smaller of basis or fair market value such as business inventory for that reason gift s of appreciated property are l imited to 30 of income for most general charitable organi zations and to 20 for organizations with more restricted giving limits such as nonoperating private f oundations corporate contributions are limited to 10 of taxable income individuals can also deduct costs of volunteering for charitable purposes incl uding outofpocket expenditures costs of using vehicle and travel costs when there is significant personal element the treatment of charitable contributions has been of legislative interest series of proposals to expand charitable bene fits were made beginning with president bushs 2000 presidential campaign and followe d by series of bills introduced in congress referred to as the community solutions act and the care act the centerpiece of the initial proposal was to allow charitable deductions for non itemizers this provision wh ich was relatively costly co mpared to other proposals was scaled back with ceilings and floors and ultimately not adopted number of more limited proposals were c onsidered and some were adopted largely on temporary basis these temporary provisi ons are now part of the extenders they expired at the end of 2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs3 2 the unrelated business income tax or ubit is imposed on business activities unrelated to the charitable purpose but it does not apply to investment earnings such as dividends and interest 3 for fy2007 ending in june of 2007 endowme nts of universities totaled 411 billion and earned return of 215 according to the national association of college and university business officers posted at httpwwwnac uboorgx2376xml at 35 tax rate this amount totals to 31 billion 411 billion times 0215 times 035 based on the allocation of assets about 60 to 70 in equity investme nts standard shares in capital gains 60 and shares of gains unrealized 50 about 20 would be unrealized capital gains the total loss would be about 25 billion 31 billion times 080 the only other readily continuedproposals and enacted legislation placing restrictions on charitable contributions were largely motivated by potential abuses which led to some changes in the law these included the lack of documentation of cash contributions but largely focused on gifts of property where the valuation of the property or even the existence of true gift may be questioned broad reform proposals have also suggested restricting charitable deductions in or der to make incentives more efficient both from an economic and administrative perspective by only allowing charitable deductions in excess of floor tax exemption of earnings less visible but neverthe less important benefit is that tax exemption allows organizations to accumulate assets without paying tax on earnings2 and estimates discussed below suggest that the revenue loss from this tax benefit is even larger than that associated with charitable contributi ons deductions if charitable contributions were spent quickly this benef it would be minimal if cont ributions are held as assets and invested tax exemption ma confer significant benefits there are several ways in which donations are invested rather than spent some types of active taxexempt organizations maintain assets in the form of endowments par ticularly educational institutions private foundations are often originally funded with large donation and pay out small share of assets required to be at least 5 however two other types of institutions are similar to privat foundations in that they do not directly engage in activities and accu mulate assets from whic h they make payments supporting organizations and donoradvised f unds all of these types of asset accumulating institutions have been the s ubject of legislative interest the revenue loss of this latter benefit has likely increased substantially with the growth of educational ins titution endowments particular ly by some educational institutions where earnings have been substantial relative to payout rates if university endowment earnings alone were subject to the corporate tax the revenue gain is roughly estimated at over 25 billi on per year for fy2007 which ended for most of these institutions in june 2007 it is more than three times as large as the revenue loss for charitable donations to ll educational institu tions which total around 7 billion while the ratio of revenue cost of the asset earnings to charitable contributions is probably smaller for other types of nonprofits the cost for all non profits would probably be ar ound 50 billion about the same size as the cost of the charitable deduction3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs4 3 continued available data source of assets and earnings of specific charities is in the survey of large charitable institutions in the chronicle of philanthropy special report jitters among strong returns pp 611 june 24 2008 addi ng the assets of institutions outside of education indicated that these large noneducational ins titutions had endowments about 40 the size of all educational institutions with about three quarters attr ibutable to foundations implying an additional revenue cost of around 10 billion for total of 35 billion this estimate is incomplete however as only limited number of charities are included and not all income is from endowments for mo re comprehensive number some estimates of passive income are included in the national income accounts earnings for educational institutions for fy2006 year with comparable data were 52 billion although the income concepts are not precisely the same in calendar year 2005 which ended approximately six months earlier total rents di vidends and interest reported in the national income and product accounts ascribed to nonprofits and retained were 64 billion mark ledbetter comparison of bea estimates of personal income with irs estimates of agi survey of current business november 2008 p 38 and if the share of capital gains were assumed to be the same as endowment investments total income would be 106 billion with the total for all nonpr ofits roughly twice the am ount of educational institution endowment earnings hence the total revenue cost would be about twice as large as the loss from exempting endowments or about 50 billioncongress also addressed some issues associated with taxexempt organizations themselves some of this concern was directed at circumstances where tax deductible donations are made to organizations that act as conduits and do not have charitable activities priv ate nonoperating foundations r ecipients of donations that make grants to active organizations are required to pay out 5 of assets donor advised funds and supporting organizations however had payout requirements these organizations were the subject of legislative interest not only because of concerns about payout rates but also about the possibilities of using these organizations which were not subject to selfdealing rules as restrictive as foundations for private benefit some chan ges for these organizations were adopted but major changes such as payout requirements were not in all cases instead congress has authorized treasury studies although legislation has not been introduced the taxwriting committees especially the senate finance committee have been examining the status of some other taxexempt organizations throug h hearings and studies these include nonprofit hospitals where issues about the amount of charity care provided have been raised the senate fina nce committee has also focused on the growing endowments of universities and colleges b ecause these educational institutions are considered active operations there are payout requi rements low payout rates relative to earnings however have led to rapid grow th of endowments at the same time that tuition rates have ri sen faster than inflation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs5 4 these documents can be found on the joint comm ittees website http wwwjctgov the legislation discussed in this report is summarized in two volumes general explanation of tax legislation enacted in the 108th congress jcs105 and general explanation of tax legislation enacted in the 109th congress jcs107 expanding benefits for charitable contributions and organizations legislative proposals involving expanded ta x incentives for charity began in the 107th congress with the community soluti ons act of 2001 hr 7 this bill passed in 2001 by the house had eight ne w tax provisions designed to benefit charitable giving including capped deduc tion for nonitemizers the president had proposed three of these tax provisions in his original 2001 tax proposal but these provisions were not included in the 2001 tax cut pl 10716 nate consideration also began in the 107th congress with s 1924 introduced by senators lieberman and santorum which would have provided temporary non itemizers deduction with higher cap along with other provisions the senate finance committee reported this bill the care act of 2002 with tem porary nonitemizers duction with both floor and ceiling but it was not considered on the floor containing some other provisions of hr 7 in the 108th congress similar bill s 476 was passed by the senate on april 9 2003 s 476 included some provisions that also would restrict charitable organizations aimed at concerns about abuse new version of hr 7 passed the house in 2003 further ac tion occurred in that congress 109th congress bill s 7 included charitable provisions some limited provisions largely aimed at disasters including the ts unami relief act of 2005 pl 1091 the katrina emergency relief act of 2005 pl 10973 and the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109 135 provided additi onal benefits the senate continued to propose some of these charitable pr ovisions along with revenue raisers which were enacted in 2006 in the pension protection act pl 109280 this section summarizes the tax proposal s liberalizing charitable contributions and briefly reviews the issues in most cases it is followed by section summarizing the tax proposals restricting charitable contributions and organizations each proposal considered in

congressional budget office budget options february 2007 p 272deduction for nonitemizers the most significant charitable contributions proposal in scope and reve nue considered in the st three congresses was deduction for nonitemizers which was directed at encouraging charitable contributions under current law taxpayer can either itemize deductions the major deductions are charitable cont ributions excess medical expe nses mortgage interest and state and local income and property taxe s or choose the standard deduction the standard deduction is adva ntageous if that amount is larger than total itemized deductions limited deduc tion for nonitemizers was fo rmerly available for 1981 1986 enacted as part of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 proposals for extending the deduction to nonitemizers were considered under various proposals in some cases including caps and floors president bushs initial proposal would have extende d the deduction to itemizers with restrictions that differed from those of itemizers the first version of the house bill in the 107th congress 2001 would have imposed cap on the deduction with phased in increase to 200 for married couples and 100 for singles the initial lieberman santorum plan s 1924 woul d have provided larger cap of 600 and 400 the senate finance committee repor ted version of s 1924 as substitute for hr 7 with temporary nonitemiz ers deduction with floor and ceiling 250500 for singles and 5001000 for joint returns th is provision with floor and ceiling was also in the 108th congress bills in its most recent budget options study the congressional budget office estimated that nonitemizers deducti on with 200 100 cap would cost 34 billion over five years and 79 billion ove r ten years while 500250 cap would cost 147 billion and 387 billion respectively5 while further proposals in this area we re considered in congress in 2005 the presidents advisory group proposing overall tax reform included in their plans an extension of the deduction to nonitemizers but added fl oor of 1 of income for both itemizers nd nonitemizers6 the congressional budget office also discussed 2 floor as separate provision in thei r budget options report indicating that such floor would gain revenue of about 20 b illion per year in the first year 100 billion over five years and 250 billion over ten years7 the main objective of this extension of the deduction to nonitemizers was to increase charitable giving charitable provi sions were however considered after the 2001 tax cuts which involved cons iderable revenue costs ca ps were seen as means to constrain the revenue loss at the same time while the deduction for non itemizers may increase giving its effects would be limited because of the cap and the dollars of charitable giving induced pe r dollar of revenue ss would be smaller particularly with small cap in addition the provision would increase complexity for taxpayers who do not itemize httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs7 8 see crs report rl31108 economic analysis of the c haritable contribution deduction for nonitemizers by jane g gravelle the effects of alternative approaches on revenues and charitable giving were also addr essed in congressional budget office effects of allowing nonitemizers to deduc t charitable contributions december 2002floors also limit the revenue cost but increase effectiveness per dollar of revenue lost relative to provision w ithout floor and simplify the tax code because taxpayers with small amounts of contributions would not qualify even without cap the deduction may not induce dditional giving as large as the revenue loss because the responsiveness of taxpayers particularly lower and moderate income taxpayers to incentives may be small8 reducing the foundation investment income excise tax current law imposes 1 tax on investment inco of foundations nd an additional 1 if the foundation does not ma ke certain minimum distribution based on average distribution rate over the previ ous five years or has been subject to tax for failure to distribute in the previous five years the house considered several bills that would have eliminated the extra 1 tax this provision accounted for 23 billion revenue cost over 10 years when last considered in 2003 the proposal was not included in the senate bills unde r consideration at this time private foundations whose contributors r their families retain the right to direct the distribution of funds have always been subject to greater scrutiny in part because of the possibility of the donor or family obtaining private benefit foundations are required to dist ribute 5 of their assets each year or pay penalty but the tax is credited against that distribution if the foundation is just making the minimum distribution every dollar of tax reduction should be funne led into distributions because the tax is credited against the deduction since the tax and the actual di stribution sum to fixed amount fall in the tax will result in rise in the am ount distributed to other organizations moreover the moving average rule which imposes the additional 1 tax if the foundation does not distribute at the average rate of the last five years discourages large contribution in particular year because it increases the hurdle for future avoidance of the tax the reduction in th investment tax should also make private foundations more attractive to givers in general although that increased attractiveness might in part induce mo re contributions and in part replace contributions that might have gone to ot her charities the effects should be small however because the tax is small proponents of reducing the tax also argued that it should be reduced because it brings in revenue that is in excess of irs audit costs which they indicate was the original purpose of the tax which was introduced in 1969 the revenue stream from this tax has however been quite vari able recently because it is heavily affected by the stock market in any case reading of the legislative history indicates that while the senate characterized the tax as an audit fee the house referred more generally to the notion that private founda tions should bear part of the cost of government generally because of their ability to pay as well as viewing it in part as user fee and both objectives were cited in the bills final explanati on it washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs8 9 crs report rs21603 minimum distributi on requirement for private foundations proposal to disallow

193213 reduced twice in 1978 and 1984 based on th argument regarding costs of audit versus revenue another argument made for eliminating the additional tax is the additional complication arising from it at the same time simplification does not require reduction in the tax it could be converted to larger flat fee the 2003 house proposal added new provision that limited the counting of administrative costs as part of f oundations minimum distri bution requirement foundations are required to make minimu m distribution of 5 but that 5 can currently include administrative costs which currently have to be reasonable as originally introduced earlier in 2003 th provision would have disallowed any administrative costs but the proposal as reported allowed deductions for most administrative costs with some exceptions the provisions affecting f oundations were not adopted9 moreover concerns about abuse ultimately led to some increases in taxes and penalties including those on foundations which ar described below raising the corporate ch aritable deductions cap under current law corporations can deduct charitable contri butions of up to 10 of income the 2003 house proposals would have gradually ra ised the cap to 20 by one percentage point each year beginning in 2004 reach ing 15 in 200811 and 20 thereafter the initial 107th congress provision would have raised the limit to 15 this provision was not in the senate bill this provision is relatively small and most corporate giving already falls well under th cap the average giving is less than 2 of income some question the appropr iateness of corporate charity since shareholders could make their own decisions about char itable giving allowing the deduction at the firm level is however more beneficial to the donor since both the corporate and individual taxes are eliminated in some views charitable giving by corporations is another management perk that might be excessive because of monitoring problems by shareholders this problem is also calle d an agency cost problem others argue that corporations should be encouraged to give to charity and to be socially responsible economists have studied models in which charitable giving is part of the firms profit maximizing be havior eg by gaining the firm good will evidence on the effectiveness of the deduction is mixed with time series studies showing positive effect and cross section results not finding an effect10 unrelated business income of charitable remainder trusts current law provides tax deductions fo r some portion of trust nd income tax

provisions were enacted in 2005 in response to disasters the tsunami relief act of 2005 p l 1091 allowed c ontributions made in january 2005 to be treated as made in the previous year and therefore deductib on 2004 tax returns to encourage giving for relief from the tsunami that struck in 2004 the hurricane katrina emergency relief ac t of 2005 adopted several pr ovisions effective through 2005 to encourage giving to katrina vic tims it allowed unlimited cash contributions for individuals normally restricted to 50 of income it also allowed unlimited contributions for corporations normally restricted to 10 of taxable income if contributions were made to aid katrina victims charitable contributions made after the disaster were not subject to the phase out of itemized deductions mileage rates for deducting costs of using vehicle for charitable purposes to aid katrina victims were increased from 14 cents to 70 of the business rate of 485 cents reimbursements for these costs in excess of the mileage allowance were not included in income if the activity was for the ai d of katrina victims the gulf opportunity zone act p l 109135 extended the benef its of higher limits to contributions to hurricanes rita and wilma provisions now part of the extenders seven provisions were enacted with expira tion dates they expired at the end of 2007 although one has since been extende

partnerships and provision eliminating the unrelated business income tax on armslength rental payments to taxexempt organizations from related entity contributions of conservation property another important set of provisions originated in the senate ex panded benefits for contributions for conservation purposes by lifting the cap on contributions as percent of income gifts of appreciated

that are not publicly traded to qualify land used or available to be used for agricultural or livestock production mu st remain available for such purposes this provision expired at the end of 2007 but has recently been extended for an additional two years in the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110234 as noted above lower income limits for gifts of

tement of fair ma rket value and the deduction of amounts that have not been included in income ira rollover provision all of the proposed charitable contribution proposals considered in congress included provision to allow tax free distributions from individual retirement accounts to char ities by individuals aged 70 and ½ or older this provision was adopted on mporary basis in the pension protection act in 2006 but expired at the end of 2007 the treatment be nefits nonitemizers who would not otherwise be able to take deduction although in the presidents original proposals nonitemizers would be allowed deduction in any case while this treatment may appear different for itemizers from simply including the amounts in adjusted gross income and then deducting them as itemized deductions it can provide severa l types of benefits even to those who itemize this treatment reduces adjusted gross income which can trigger variety of phaseouts and phaseins including the pha sein of taxation of social security benefits there are also income limits on charitable contributions individuals can contribute more than 50 of income in cash and more than 30 in appreciated property since iras tend to be held by higher income individuals the taxpayers might be somewhat more sensitive to the incentive to give however the law does not specify why this particular group of taxpayers was targeted for an expansion of charitable giving provisions this provision wa s adopted in pl 109280 w ith 100000 annual limit and expired at the end of 2007 it was projected to cost 238 million in the first year and 856 million over ten years extending the deduction for food in ventory to all businesses corporations that donate inve ntory to charity in general get deduction for the cost not the market value special rule allows businesses paying the corporate tax to also exclude half the appreciation half the difference between market value and cost of production if the inventor is given to an organizati on that directly passes it on to the ill the needy or infants as long as the total deduction is more than twice the cost an important category of donatio ns is food there have been disputes between taxpayers and the irs about how to measure the fair market value of food11 the charitable contributions proposal s would have allo wed unincorporated businesses or businesses that are incorporat ed but do not pay the corporate tax the additional deduction and th fair market value of wholesome food would be considered the price at which the firm is currently selling the item or sold it in the past although this deduction would be limited to the corporate percentage cap on deductions in general this provi sions cost was relatively small the provisions objective was to create more equity among different types of taxpayers and resolve disputes largely in the taxpayers favor however as with the deduction of appreciated property thes rules allow firms to deduct amounts that have not been included in income while the provision is limited by allowing only one half the appreciation thes products if sold would be taxed at full rates rather than the lower rates imposed on individual cap ital gains in addition as with giftshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34608crs11 of capital gain property an important concern is the potential overstatement of market value firms may only be able to sell donated inventory at much lower price because the product is damaged in appearance is older or has other characteristics that would require deep discounting to sell moreover firm with market power may not wish to sell all of its inventory because increasin g supply will drive the price down more for sale than donation it is possible that provision that is extended to noncorporate busin esses which are smaller and more numerous will be more difficult to monitor for compliance for inventory that cannot be practically sold the barrier to donation by the firm is the extra costs encountered in di stributing the product thus there is tradeoff between creating an incentive and pr oviding windfall for the firm the katrina emergency relief act of 2005 pl 10973 provi ded treatment to unincorporated firms not to exceed 10 of business income through 2005 but did not make the other changes the pe nsion protection act of 2006 pl 109280 extended the provision through 2007 contributions of scientif ic and computer property certain special treatment similar to that for food inventory is allowed fo r certain scientific property used for research and for contributions of computer technology and equipment provided the property is constr ucted by the taxpayer in concrete terms this rule requires that more than 50 of the cost is due to parts purchased elsewhere the issues surrounding this provision are the same as those related to other contributions of inventory such as food inventory this provision expired in 2003 the proposals would have allowed property assembled as well as constructed to be eligible and make the provision permanent although th senate proposal involved an extension the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 extended the existing provisions

the pension protection act of 2006 restrictions on charitable contributions series of restrictions on charitable donations aimed at re ducing abuse were adopted most of these provi sions related to

taxpayers with incomes above 10 million gifts of property account for 50 of contributions taxpayers with income s above 1 million account for 18 of cash gifts but 40 of property gifts18 this provision is especi ally beneficial to the donor because deduction is allowed for the full value while the appreciation is not taxed while the valuation of contributions such as publicly traded stock is straightforward the valuation of gifts where value is not easily assigned presents some issues for tax compliance if the taxpayer can value donated property at an excessive value it is even possible

donations of used vehicles and of patents and other intellectual property led to several revisi ons in the american jobs creation act of 2004 p l 108357 according to irs data in 2003 23 billion of deductions associated with vehicles was deducte d for those taxpayers who had noncash contributions of 500 or more21 often charities resold vehicles at much smaller value than the value deducted by the taxpayer22 the revision required that for vehicles with value of 500 or more th deduction is restricted to the value of resale if the vehicle is resold rather than used or refurbished by the charity the act also extended to corporations the requi rement of an appraisal for donation of property other than readily valued prope rty such as cash inventory and publicly traded securities of

make fractional interest donation only the right to physical possession26 the internal revenue service challenged this case but the court found for the taxpayer as result individuals could keep art work in their possession perhaps through their lifetimes or even pass the property on to their heirs while still securing charitable contribution deduction the s econd is concern that the possession or display of the art by the museum itself enhances the market value of the work effectively increasing the value of the art work and the value of future deductions or sales compared to an outright gift another set of issues relates to estate taxes estate taxes can be reduced by reducti on in value due to minority discounts the view taken by the courts that an ownershi p of minority interest in an asset loses some value because of lack of control the minority ownership does not however affect the value of the charitable deduction for income or estate tax purposes the pension protection act requi res physical possession by the donee requires the gift to be completed within 10 years or at the donors death whichever comes first disallows fractional donation of property that is not wholly owned by the donor or the donor and donee for later gifts the secretary of the treasury can make an exception if multiple owners donate simila r fractional shares and requires that subsequent fractional shares are limited to market value at the time of the original donation if these restrictions are not met the tax savings from the deduction are recaptured with interest and 10

add ition there is interest as indicated by hearings and by activities of the senate finance committee in the tax exempt status of nonprofit hospitals and in university endowments the finance committee has also in the past examined specific areas of the charitable giving and taxexempt charitable world including sp ecific taxexempt organizations these examinations were spurred by studies and by media reports most recently senator grassley has inquired of the finances of media related ministrie s finally there remains possibility that floor could be imposed on charitable giving as part

using temporary provisions for charitable purposes is that although the budgetary cost is smaller for provision extended only year at time the intention is to tinue the provision this practice causes the official projected budget deficits to be smaller than they will likely be takes up the time of the congress with considering the extenders and creates some uncertainty for taxpayers on the other hand an argument that c ould be made in fa vor of temporary provisions is that temporary provision ma kes reconsideration of the merits and design of the provisions more likely ev idence suggests however that relatively few temporary provisions have been revised only one extender of dozens allowed since the first extender was enacted in 1981 has been allowed to lapse most provisions are not revised ither although the rd tax credit has been the subject of some major revisions ne vertheless it could be argued that the temporary nature of these provisions is conducive to be tter tax policy because provisions are reconsidered even though they are rarely revised the issues surrounding the specific char itable extenders ar discusse d above history suggests they are likely to be enacted however and several bills have been introduced to extend all provisions that expired in 200730 donor advised funds and supporting organizations the two basic issues associated with donoradvised funds and supporting organizations were possibilities of receivi ng private benefit by donors and payout rates as noted above while some chan ges were enacted others remain possible although payout requirements are pla nned administratively for type iii supporting organizations there are payout require ments for donoradvised funds and for other supporting organizations these issues might be revisited when treasury completes its studies31 the treasury was directed to study sp ecific issues whether deductions for contributions to donoradvised funds and supporting organizations are appropriate given the use of the assets or benef its to the donor whet her donoradvi sed funds should have distribution requirement wh ether the retention of rights by donors means that the gift is not completed and whether these issues apply to other charities or charitable donors thus it is possible th at results of the studies could also have implications for charities in general

nonprofit hospitals were not required to demons trate specific standards for charity to qualify for exempt status and in some cases to be eligible to receive tax deductible charitable contributions rather they must meet community benefit standard that is not quantitatively defined35 university and college endowments universities and colleges are classified as charitable organizations eligible to
