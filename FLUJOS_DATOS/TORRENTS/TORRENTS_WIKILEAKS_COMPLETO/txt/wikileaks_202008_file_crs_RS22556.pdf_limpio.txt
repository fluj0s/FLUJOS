cushing notes in law and practice of gislative assemblies 1856 at 5455 that the exclusive and final right to termine membership in democratic legislative assembly is so essential to the free election and independent existence of legislative assembly that it may be regarded as necessary incident to every body of that description which emanates directly from the people behavior of its own members and it has the express constitutional authority to make the rules for its own proceedings2 under the general practice and operations in the senate as well as in the house personal incapacity of sitting member has not generated proceedings to declare the seat vacant several examples are often cited for this proposition including the example of senato r carter glass of virginia who was apparently away from the sena for four years before finally dying in 1946 the case of senator carl mundt of south dakota who af ter suffering stroke in 1969 was reportedly absent from the senate floor for almost thr ee years prior to his decision not to run for reelection in 1972 and the more recent ex ample of representative john grotberg of illinois who slipped into fiveweek co ma in january of 1986 from complications of cancer treatment and did not return to congress for the rest of the session3 authority and decisions over internal proce dural matters organization and structures within the institution and the determination nd seating of those who are members of the institution have been recognized to be within the exclusive purview of and properly made by the house or senate respectively unde r the express constitutional authority of each house4 in practical sense therefore because of the final authority over determining and seating those who are to be members of the institution it would be the particular house of congress that would have to either declare or at the least recognize any such vacancy because of any incap acity before giving the oath of office and seating anyone presenting himself or herself as having been chosen to fill that seat congressional precedents and declaring vacancies each house of congress may be said to be able to create vacancy in office in its own body through an expulsion of sitting member by vote of twothirds of the members of the bodyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22556crs3 5 see powell v mccormack supra note discussion of

several s itting members had vacated their seats and thus recommended resolution finding their seats vacant the house declined to consider the continuedpresent and voting or by an exclusion of memberelect from being seating as member of the house or senate because of failure to meet the designated constitutional qualifications for office or because of failure to be duly elected5 there are other instances however when each house of congress may be said to have recognized the existence of certain other vacancies in congressional office and declared seat vacant without death resignation or expulsion of the sitting member6 incompatibilities one class of such findings concerns sitting members or memberselect who have accepted an office incompatible with congressional office and thereby are deemed to have vacated their congressional seat under the us constitution at article i section 6 clause 2 person holding any office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office the house and the senate have thus in the pa st found vacancy in the office of member of the house or senate respectively w ho accepted an office under the united states including commission from the militia even when such members did not tender any resignation from congress7 in the senate the issue of whether sitting senator had by accepting military commission virtually re signed his seat in the senate it becoming vacant at that time was eventua lly resolved by the factual conclusion that his appointment while senatorelect di d not preclude him from electing to accept the office of senator by resigning the military office before the meeting of the senate and his qualification8 the acceptance or the holding of an office incompatible with congressional office does not nece ssarily act as an automati c forfeiture of ones seat but rather appears to require some act on the part of the house or senate respectively to formally recognize such incompatibility nd declare vacancy which the house or senate may or may not choose to do the precedents have shown that the house or senate may choose not to act upon such incompatibility9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22556crs4 9 continued resolution id at pp 620621 see also vi cannons precedents 6061 concerning judiciary committee report in 1916 with similar fi ndings it follows that the seats of those members of the house of representatives who shall accept commissions in the national guard of the various states under the act of congress of june 3 1916 will at once become vacant the only action necessary would be to declare such vacancy by resolution as matter of convenience and to aid the speaker and others in discharging their public duties id at 60 p 67 the

onstitutional provision at article i section 6 clause 2 raise issues of the stated qualifications or express disqualifications describe d in the constitution and thus apparently bear upon the authority of each house of congress to judg the qualifications of its own members under article i section 5 clause 1 in addition to dealing with the specific incompatibility provision in the constitution however there are other congressional precedents that have found that other offices such as state or local elective or ppointive offices are inherently incompatible with congressional office such precedents indicat that in choosing another office even if the member involve d does not expressly re sign his congressional office the institution of the house or senate has the apparent authority to find that vacancy in the congressional s eat is created in an early precedent the house in 1792 received from member joshua seney tter stating his acceptance of an appointment in the judiciary department of maryland w hich disqualified him for seat in the house and upon which the house then to ok action described as the house having assumed or declared the seat vacant10 in the case of member becoming governor the house found an inherent incompatibility in the offices and found that the member vacated his congressional seat upon assuming th duties of governor regardless of the fact or intent of any resignation11 senate precedents show s imilar determination or judgme nt by the senate of an inherent incompatibility between the office of governor of state and united states senator and indicate the recognition of the au thority of the institution of the senate to make such judgment but which noted that senatorelect may continue to exercise the duties of governor until he takes the oath of office as senator12 failure to appear to take oath of office vacancies have also been found when memberselect have not appeared to take the oath of office and because of their absence were presumed to be dead in the case of representative hale boggs of louisiana for example representative boggs plane wa s lost in alaska on october 16 1972 with representative nick begich of alaska and two others less than month before the representatives general elections under st ate election procedures their names remained on the ballot in both states and they both received the most votes in their respective general elections in alaska judicial inquiry was conducte d and concluded that although neither the aircraft nor the bodies were ever found the three alaskan men were presumed to have died proceeding or finding was made in louisiana however andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22556crs5 13 hres 1 93rd congress 119 congressional record 1516 january 3 1973 see also

clause 3no vacancy was declared in the office by the executive authority in louisiana at the beginning of the new congress on january 3 1973 the house adopted resolution taking note of the crash and the judicial findings in alaska concerning the other three victims of the crash and concluding that it is assumed from the evidence that representative boggs also died in the crash or its aftermath and therefore the house formally determines that there is vacancy in the ninetythird congress in the representation from the second congressional district in the state of louisiana because of the absence of representative elect boggs13 precedent of potentially more relevance in declaring vacancyexists in the house of representatives that involved th indefinite and apparently permanent incapacity of memberelect in the case of representative gladys noon spellman the memberelects physical inability to attend the session of congress was at issue representative spellman suffered cardiac arrest while campaigning for reelection in october of 1980 and fell into coma mrs spellman was then reelected in november but she remained in deep coma at the be ginning of the new congress in january of 1981 by february of 1981 it was becoming apparent that representative spellman might never come out of the coma and the attending physician to the united states congress on february 20 1981 when requested by the speaker of the house to make determination expressed the opinion to the speaker of the house that upon his consultations and observances there is likelihood that she will be able to serve out her term of office14 the house then adopted simple resolu tion noting that the most recent medical information provided to the speaker i ndicates that there is likelihood that representativeelect gladys n oon spellman will recover suffici ently to be able to take the oath of office and serve as member of this house and then declaring vacancy in the house from that congressional district15 triggering the vacancy provision for the state of maryland in looking at these precedents it is obvious that several features distinguish them from the situation and concerns regarding sitting member of either house who is deemed to be incapacitated initially in the case of the acceptance of incompatible offices the members involved arguably took so specific voluntary ac tion to in effect vacate their seats which may be considered tantamount t and was described in some precedents as virtual resignation and th senate or the house then recognized such actions by those members in declaring the s eats vacant in the case of representative hale boggs the late member was at the time of the declaration of vacancy member elect to the new congress who having not s hown up to take the c onstitutionally required oath of office for the new congress16 was presumed to be dead and the vacancy based on that assumption was declaredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22556crs6 17 there may be some argument that the decision of the house in the matter regarding representative spellman was not necessarily based entirely and exclusively on the inability to take the oath of office but arguably also on th very real likelihood of mrs spellman not being able to carry out the duties of office that is as stated in the resolution to serve as member hres 80 97th congress supra the house apparently recognizes temporary incapacities of memberselect who can not attend the beginning of the session of congress for swearing in because of illness or injury by authorizing the speaker or another than the speaker to administer the oath of office to the memberelect away from the house deschlers precedents supra at ch 2 5 p 117 and the senate has also authorized administration of the oath to an absent senatorelect in his home state on rare occasions deschlers precedents supra at ch 2 524 p 129 based on such an interpretation of the houses spellman precedent it would be argued that seemingl permanent incapacity could create similar impossibility of performing ones congressiona l functions state of facts of which the institution may also take cognizance although there has been precedent in support of this argument with respect to sitting member of congress 18 although an expulsion is generally in the nature of discipline or punishment of member of the senate the power to expel has been recognized first and foremost as an action based on the selfpreservation interests of the senate or the house that is for the protection of the institution its members and its proceedings cushing supra at 250251 257259 268270 story supra at 835 as discussed in deschlers precedents such proceedings are rooted in the judgment of the house as to what was necessa ry or appropriate for it to do to assure the integrity of its legislative performance and its in stitutional acceptability to the people at large as serious and responsible instrument of government deschlers precedents supra at 174 citing powell v mccormack 395 f2d 577 mcgowan concurring at 607 dccir 1968 revd on other grounds 395 us 486 1969 there are specif ic grounds for an expulsion designated in the constitution note bowman and bowman article i ction 5 congress power to expel an exercise in lfrestraint at 29 syracuse law review 1071 10891090 1977 because of the infamy of being an expelled member however and the fact that it requires 23rds approval expulsions are rare not occurring in the senate since the civil war era and the act of expulsion of disabled or in capacitated member is unlikelyin the case of the incapacity of representative spellman there was indication or finding that mrs spellman was not duly elected by her constituents nor was there any finding that she had not met the other three standing qualifications for office that of age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state from where elected similarly express constitutional nor inherent disqualification was cited and thus in light of powell v mccormack it would appear the action of th house in 1981 could not be fairly charactered as an exclusion of memberelect however mrs spellman was at the time of the house action memberelect to the new congress and was deemed not likely to recover sufficiently to be ab to take the oath of offi ce and serve as member if the decision were one taken merely and strictly on the basis of an inability incapacity or impossibility of taking the required oath of office as opposed to finding of general incapacity to perform the functions of the office then it is possible that this precedent distinguishes incapacities of memberselect prior to taking and which prevents them from taking the constitutionally required oath of office from those incapacities occurring with respect to sitting member of the senate or the house17 sitting member of the senate or the house who has ta ken the oath of office and is not merely memberelect who is alive and who has not resigned or voluntarily accepted an incompatible office would thus under current precedents appear to be removable only under the expulsion authority of each house18
