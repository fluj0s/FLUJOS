the great debate of 1991 lenore sek specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the last debate on whether or not to grant the president authority to negotiate trade agreements with fasttrack legislative procedures was in 1991 many issues that were raised in that debate are the same as those still being considered including the role of labor and the environment in trade negotiations and whether legislation to implement trade agreements should be amendable the result of the debate in 1991 was that congress allowed the president an extension of negotiating authority with fasttrack legislative procedures at the same time however it gave strong directives to the administration on issues to be addressed in the negotiations and threatened to withdraw the fasttrack procedures if its directives were not followed background trade negotiating authority with fasttrack legislative procedures was introduced in the trade act of 1974 it was approved for given period principally for the tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations 19731979 the fasttrack legislative procedures were part of an understanding between the executive and legislative branches whereby the administration agreed to consult closely with congress during trade negotiations and congress agreed to definite upordown vote on the trade agreement without changes trade negotiating authority with fasttrack procedures was extended in the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 trade act of 1988 principally for the uruguay round of multilateral trade talks 19861994 the 1988 act provided that if trade agreement was signed before june 1 1991 fasttrack procedures would apply to implementing legislation the june 1991 deadline was expected to be sufficient for the conclusion of the uruguay round if negotiators were making progress but could not meet the deadline the act allowed twoyear extension for fasttrack procedures congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the extension was automatic as long as the president requested it and neither house of congress disapproved it by simple resolution by early 1991 it was clear that president bush planned to request the twoyear extension the uruguay round could not be completed by the june 1st deadline further subsequent to the 1988 act mexico had requested talks on north american free trade agreement nafta on march 1 1991 president bush formally requested the twoyear extension and five days later disapproval resolutions hres 101 sres 78 were introduced in both houses there was widespread opposition to the talks with mexico because of concern about possible adverse effects of trade agreement on us wage levels working conditions and environmental standards on march 7 1991 senator lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee and representative dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee wrote joint letter to the president asking how he intended to address these concerns on march 27 house majority leader richard gephardt wrote to the president that worker and environmental issues should be objectives in the uruguay round and in nafta on may 1 the president responded with an extensive plan of action the plan of action included laborrelated provisions such as possible worker adjustment program and future cooperation with mexico on health and safety issues and environmentrelated provisions such as design of joint border environmental plan and appointment of environmental experts to trade advisory committees on may 9 majority leader gephardt introduced hres 146 which expressed the sense of the house that on the basis of the commitments in the presidents action plan and the expectation that the commitments would be carried out fasttrack procedures should be extended the 1988 trade act required that if the twoyear extension was to be disapproved vote on the resolutions of disapproval had to be taken before june 1 1991 issues in the 1991 debate several issues were raised during the 1991 debate on extension of fasttrack authority among these were 1 differences in how congress viewed the multilateral and regional trade negotiations 2 anticipated effects of trade agreement with mexico 3 concern over nontraditional topics such as worker rights and the environment and 4 delegation of congressional authority to the executive branch multilateral and regional trade negotiations the multilateral talks in the uruguay round and the bilateralregional talks on the nafta were tied together procedurally under the 1988 trade act the extension of fasttrack procedures would apply to implementing legislation for trade agreements reached between june 1 1991 and may 31 1993 therefore if one house of congress had disapproved the extension fasttrack procedures would have been denied in the case of uruguay round agreement nafta agreement and any other relevant trade agreement reached during that period the 1988 statute did not allow separate votes to extend fasttrack procedures for the uruguay round or nafta congress would have had to take procedural action to separate the two crs3 although both sets of negotiations depended on the same vote on extension it was the nafta specifically trade with mexico that was the magnet for most congressional interest from march to may 1991 the number of hearings on trade with mexico exceeded those on the uruguay round by almost 10 to 1 floor debate overwhelmingly dealt more with the effects of trade with mexico than with the more than 100 trading nations in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the predecessor of the world trade organization one reason why there was so much concern over the bilateral but not the multilateral talks might have been that the united states had different position going into each of the negotiations in the case of the uruguay round the united states was the chief proponent of the talks and was seen as pressing for concessions favorable to the united states in the case of mexico the united states did not initiate the talks in fact some members wanted the administration to move slowly on the idea because the united states was already absorbed in the uruguay round and because the proposal for talks with mexico seemed to be opening the us market to imports from country that had different set of rules another reason might have been that the potential effects of bilateral agreement are more easily discernible compared to an agreement with over 100 countries further the difference in us and mexican incomes was significant and many feared us jobs would be lost to mexico congress had not contemplated nafta when it approved fasttrack procedures in 1988 at that time congress had debated and voted on objectives and fasttrack procedures for the uruguay round the disapproval resolution votes and the vote on hres 146 were an opportunity to debate the trade talks with mexico there was some congressional interest in splitting the extension vote by providing separate ground rules for the uruguay round and the nafta if the two had been split the negotiations with mexico might not have been granted fasttrack procedures given the opposition to those talks however congress did not split the vote so it was possible that opposition to one set of negotiations could have caused disapproval of fasttrack procedures for all other negotiations in such case it probably would have been the nafta that halted the uruguay round situation where multilateral trade negotiations in the gatt were threatened by domestic opposition to us bilateral trade initiative was unprecedented effects of trade agreement with mexico central element of the opposition to trade agreement with mexico was based on the anticipated loss or deterioration of us employment during the debate some members argued that an agreement with mexico would seriously harm the us middle class some argued that manufacturing plants would move to mexico and that the industrial base of america would suffer in support of an agreement with mexico some members said that forming trading bloc would give the countries of north america competitive advantage against unified europe some said that the freetrade agreement with canada had resulted in economic benefits for the united states suggesting the same would be true of free trade agreement with mexico others said that an agreement would support us export industries aid the crs4 border region and help the us energy sector the administration argued that exports were major area of economic growth in recent years economic studies available before the fasttrack extension vote provided some understanding of the potential economic effects but like all studies of this type they did not provide precise forecasts of future events some major studies showed small but positive effects on the us economy of nafta and suggested that few sectors would be hurt by an agreement however central problem was that nafta was expected to have effects that were difficult to model such as how greater protection under patent laws could affect bilateral trade flows another weakness was that the models might have been based on the best possible assumptions about the amounts and conditions of capital flows but these assumptions might not have reflected the real world some research organizations at the time argued that capital flows would be major factor in the effect of nafta on the us economy several other subjects were discussed in the fasttrack debate one subject was the foreign relations aspect of mexicos request for freetrade negotiations some members argued that if the united states refused to negotiate with mexico or if congress denied fasttrack procedures there would be political repercussions another subject was political reform in mexico some members said that freetrade agreement would ensure economic improvement which would lead to political reform while others argued that the united states should use the trade negotiations to spur political reform and improved human rights in mexico the scope of the agreement was another subject some members argued that the negotiations should include illegal drugs and immigration while other members and the administration said that the negotiations should be limited strictly to trade issues expanded talks to include new issues traditionally labor unions and workers in importcompeting industries have been among the strongest opponents of trade negotiations that open us markets to foreign products in 1991 these groups were joined by others with different concerns but the same goalto stop the trade agreement with mexico they formed an effective opposition force that was new to the trade debate the key groups in the broad coalition were labor unions environmentalists human rights groups and consumer groups labor unions argued that the economic effects of nafta were not clearly understood and so the negotiations should be put on hold until more information was available they feared the loss of wages and jobs for us workers and advocated improvements in workers conditions in mexico environmentalists had become more active in the trade area during the uruguay round they had called for those trade negotiations to take into account the environmental effects of the changes resulting from an agreement and pressed for inclusion of discussions on the environment in the uruguay round and in nafta human rights groups wanted improvements in the political process in mexico consumer groups argued that health and safety standards in the united states would decline these groups influenced the agenda for the usmexico talks they appealed to members of congress to consider the differences in the us and mexican systems and the possible harmful results of such differences some of their arguments were economic crs5 lower environmental standards in mexico were an economic incentive for companies to move factories there other arguments were more socially oriented workers should have rights such as union participation and safe workplace congressional delegation of authority to the executive branch apart from the substance of the negotiations members also had concerns about delegation of authority under the fasttrack process they were concerned about retaining the right to amend legislation to implement trade agreements they saw the formulation and full consideration of such legislation as serious constitutional responsibility of the legislative branch arguing that since the constitution had given congress the power to regulate foreign commerce congress should not delegate this authority to the executive branch the fasttrack procedure is an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house and hence can be changed by either house with respect to its procedure for changing its rules in several other ways congress indicated that although it might delegate authority to the president to negotiate trade agreements with fasttrack procedures it still had the right to withdraw or modify those procedures for example in the 1988 trade act congress provided means for terminating the fasttrack authority delegated to the president and as mentioned earlier hres 146 tied fasttrack procedures to the presidents achieving commitments on labor and environmental issues some members introduced resolutions to modify fasttrack procedures to allow amendments on certain issues one resolution would have allowed amendments in the areas of labor standards environmental protection rules of origin dispute settlement and worker adjustment assistance other resolutions would have changed or modified the rules for consideration of legislation to implement trade agreements few members who argued for the prerogative to amend implementing legislation expressed suspicion about how the administration would follow directives from congress they believed that the consultation process was inadequate at least one member said that the administration had misled congress during the free trade negotiations with canada some members asserted that the fasttrack process was the best process possible given the need for us negotiators to reach an agreement and then submit the agreement for timely vote without changes that might undo the agreement package others said that members should not deny fasttrack procedures in advance because they could decide later after an agreement was reached whether or not to approve the agreement and implementing legislation they emphasized that congress retains the ultimate right to approve or disapprove the agreement others pointed out however that it would be more difficult to vote against an agreement once it was reached the sense of the discussion was that the question of delegated authority was an issue for continued debate crs6 outcome on may 23 1991 the house voted down disapproval resolution hres 101 and endorsed hres 146 the resolution that set out goals for the negotiations although large number of house members opposed the nafta negotiations if the talks were going to proceed they wanted strong congressional guidelines for us negotiators in the talks on may 24 1991 the senate defeated disapproval resolution sres 78 thereby assuring the extension of fasttrack negotiating authority for another two years the votes on the disapproval resolutions showed that opposition to the trade talks was stronger in the house neither the house vote nor the senate vote was an endorsement of nafta given the strong opposition expressed during the fasttrack debate and the clear intent in the house to monitor the trade talks any negotiations or final agreement probably would be scrutinized closely negotiators from the united states canada and mexico formally began nafta talks in june 1991 and reached final agreement in august 1992 in campaign speech in october 1992 thencandidate clinton said he wanted to negotiate supplemental agreements on the environment and on labor with canada and mexico after the clinton administration began negotiations on the environment labor and import surges were held from march through august 1993 and supplemental agreements on these three topics were signed in september 1993 legislation to implement these agreements was enacted in december 1993 and the nafta went into effect january 1 1994 with the extension of fasttrack procedures in may 1991 negotiators anticipated uruguay round final text by the end of 1991 they did not reach an agreement by that time nor by the mid1993 deadline of the fasttrack extension in july 1993 congress approved another extension of fasttrack procedures for uruguay round agreement with deadline for concluding the agreement by december 15 1993 final agreement was reached in time and countries had the formal signing on april 15 1994 legislation to implement the uruguay round agreement was signed into law in december 1994 and the agreement went into effect january 1 1995 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97885
