million people has been in political turmoil and ec onomic crisis intermittently since independence in october 19601 the current borders were demarcated by british colonial rulers in 1914 on the eve of world war i by merging the british dependencies of northern and southern nigeria into single territory with promising economic prospects the new nigeria as defined by the british placed over 250 distinct ethnic groups under single adminis trative system of this large number of groups ten account for nearly 80 of th total population and the northern hausa fulani the southwestern yoruba and the s outheastern ibo have traditionally been the most politically active and dominant since gaining independence from britain in 1960 nigerian political life has been sca rred by conflict along both ethnic and geographic lines marked most notably by northern domination of the military and the civil war fought by the separatist ibo of biafra against the central government from 1967 to 1970 questions persist as to whet her nigeria and its multitude of ethnic groups can be held together as one nation pa rticularly in light of the degree to which misrule has undermined the authority and gitimacy of the state apparatus but many nigerians feel significant degree of national pride and belief in nigeria as state nigerias political life has been dominated by military coups and l ong military imposed transition programs to civilian rule the military has ruled nigeria for approximately 28 of its 47 years since independence in august 1985 general ibrahim babangida ousted another

abubakar was suspended tem porarily from the pdp over corruption charges in late 2006 and was thus unable to participate in the pdps primary his supporters contend he was unjustly excluded because he

between political parties and candidates have already led to violence in some locations three gubernatorial candidates were ssassinated in 2006 the threat of vi olence is also high in the niger delta region and other hot spots incl uding lagos kano and kaduna another potential source for instability may be th impact of the 2006 census which has drawn controversy over how it may represent the regional breakdown of the population the census reportedly suggests th at 534 of the population lives in the north which would affect the countrys complex oil revenue distribution system this could also fan regiona l resentment between the nor thern and southern regions of the country and incite considerable unres t any of these factors could lead the government to postpone the april electi ons under the countrys 2006 electoral act which gives inec the authority to change the date of the election if the event might trigger unrest that threatens the countrys peace and stability
