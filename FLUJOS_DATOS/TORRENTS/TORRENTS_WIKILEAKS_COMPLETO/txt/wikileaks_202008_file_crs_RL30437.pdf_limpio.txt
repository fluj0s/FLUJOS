act cwa in 1987 but national water quality policy has evolved in the intervening years as result of implementation of the 1987 amendments and related administration initiatives intended to fulfill the requirements and meet the goals and objectives of the act agriculture which has been relatively minor component of national water quality polic ies and programs especially regulatory policies is now involved in several aspects of three recent initiatives in the clean water action plan clinton administration initiative intended to address the nations remaining water quality challenges several key actions focus on agriculture federal lands and forestry as part of the overall goal of the plan to more effectively control nonpoint source pollution specific outcomes requirements affecting agriculture if any and any possible deadlines will be evident as the key actions are set in motion one of the first administration actions to carry out the clean water action plan was national strategy for address ing waste management by one segment of agriculture animal feeding operations afos under the afo strategy all operators of animal feedings operation s are expected to develop and implement sitespecific comprehensive nutrient management plans while an estimated 15000 to 20000 large afos and those contributing to water quality impairments will be priorities for regulatory programs and enforcement third policy development separate from the clean water action plan is implementation of existing cwa requirements which concern measures to improve the quality of waters that remain pollutantimpaired even after application of traditional pollution controls by industrial and municipal point sources most of agriculture is classified as nonpoint source and is not subject to cwa controls these requirements are the acts total maximum daily load tmdl program as states implement the tmdl program where agricultural sources are identified as respons ible for water quality impairments they may be required to adopt control actions andor management measures determinations of impairments and required actions will be sitespecific and variable however there is controversy over whether nonpoint sources of pollution diffuse runoff that does not come from pipe ditch or similar conveyance are lawfully covered by the tmdl program if only point sources are covered impacts on agriculture would be considerably fewer regulatory changes proposed in 1999 to strengthen the tmdl program were widely criticized by agriculture and forestry groups other industry groups states and localities and environmental groups final changes issued in july 2000 dropped provisions that could have directly affected some in agriculture and forestry but the new rules remain controversial this

national water quality policy has evolved in the intervening years as result of implementation of the 1987 amendments and even more so as result of administration initiatives intended to fulfill the requirements and meet the goals and objectives of the act as whole one of the most visible of these initiatives is the clean water action plan cwap announced by president clinto n and vice president gore in february 1998 its purpose is to build on the environmental successes of the cwa since it was enacted in 1972 and to address the nations remaining water quality challenges through more than 100 actions now being developed or implemented by agencies of the government together with state local public and private partners somewhat less headlineworthy but likely to have widespread impact is implementation of an existing provision of the cwa called the total maximum daily load tmdl progr am reinvigorated and driven by lawsuits and recently issued regulatory changes the clean water acts traditional focus has been on controlling wastewater from manufacturing and other industrial facilit ies termed point sources which are regulated through discharge permits that statutory and regulatory focus on point source controls has enabled much progress towards the nations water quality goals yet as point source pollution has been controlled uncontrolled discharges in the form of runoff from nonpoint sources have become proportionally larger share of remaining water pollution problems nonpoint pollution occurs as surface erosion of soil by water and as surface runoff of rainfall or snowmelt from diffuse areas such as farm and ranch land construction sites and mining and timber operations except for large animal feeding operati ons most agricultural activities are considered to be nonpoint sources since they do not discharge wastes from clearly identifiable pipes outfalls or similar point conveyances nonpoint sources are not required to obtain cwa discharge permits consequently agricultural and other nonpoint sources are not subject to the compliance and enforcement regime that applies to point sources how is agriculture now involved in current water quality discussions agriculture which has largely been at the sidelines of national water quality policies and programs especially regulatory policies since much of its activities are not directly subject to the clean water act now finds its activities scrutinized in connection with several aspects of the recent water quality initiatives which are discussed in this report first one of the key goals of the cwap is more effective control of nonpo int source pollution and because water quality data identify agriculture as significant contributor to nonpoint pollution number of actions in the plan focus on agriculture as whole second one of the first clinton administration actions to carry out the cwap was national strategy for addressinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs2 1 us environmental protection agency section 319 success stories volume ii highlights of state and tribal nonpoint source programs epa 841r97001 october 1997 213 pwaste management by one segment of agriculture animal feeding operations afos this strategy will affect an estimated 15000 to 20000 of the largest animal feeding operations through regulation and it seeks to encourage all livestock producers with smaller operations to adopt improved waste management practices voluntarily third development separate from the cwap is implementation of the existing tmdl provision of the cwa which concerns measures to improve the quality of waters that remain impaired even after application of traditional polluti on controls it affects nonpoint as well as point sources of pollution from agriculture and other sectors where agricultural sources are identified as contributing to these continuing water pollution problems they may be required by states to take steps that will help correct impairments agricultural and other nonpoint sources have become increasingly prominent in debates over water quality policy in part because these types of diffuse sources are believed to be the largest remaining water pollution problem affecting united states waters to begin to address these problems congress added section 319 to the cwa in 1987 directing states to implement programs for managing nonpoint sources consequently under federal law agricultural sources could be subject to state developed plans requiring operators to use management measures to limit pollutant runoff from their lands there is anecdotal information that some state nonpoint pollution programs are addressing agricul tural runoff in various ways including technical and financial assistance1 in light of the several federal water quality policy initiatives discussed in this report questions arise concerning how specifically agriculture will be affected the answer it seems is that it will be affected substantially but not systematically in that the effects do not grow out of an integrated policy aimed specifically at agriculture the administration and the indivi dual federal agencies involved in these activities have produced voluminous reports and other documents detailing the overall cwap and separate actions but none describes holistically or comprehensively how agriculture or any other sector of the econ omy will be impacted overall still substantial effect seems likely by virtue of the greater scrutiny in general that is being given to agric ultures impact on water quality operators of large animal feeding opera tions are especially affected by the administrations afo waste management strategy remaining impacts especially of the tmdl program depend very much on sitespecific considerations of water quality impairments ie what are the sources contributing to impaired waters what will be the most effective ways to manage those sources and how states will respond to the requirements of implementing the tmdl provision of the law each of the three initiatives will affect agriculture in the clean water action plan several key actions address agriculture federal lands and forestry as part of the overall goal in the plan to more effectively control nonpoint source pollution specific outcomes requirements affecting agriculture if any and deadlines if any will be evident as the key actions are set in motionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs3 under the afo strategy all operators of animal feeding operations should develop and implement sitespecific comprehensive nutrient management plans while an estimated 15000 to 20000 operators of afos large facilities which are termed confined animal feeding operations or cafos and smaller ones contributing to water quality impairments will be priorities for regulatory programs and enforcement as states implement the tmdl program where agricultural sources are identified as responsible for wate r quality impairments agriculture may be required to adopt control actions for those in agriculture whic h are point sources andor management measures for agricultural nonpoint sources to help clean up waterways determinations of impairments and requi red actions will be site specific and variable however there is controversy over whether nonpoint sources are lawfully covered by the tmdl program if only point sources are covered impacts on agriculture would be considerably fewer this report consists of three major parts providing background on the three ongoing water quality initiatives the clean water action plan the unified national afo strategy and implementation of the tmdl provisions of the clean water act at the end of the report is glossary of terms and chronology of the key deadlines that can be identified in the initiatives linkage and coordination each of the three initiatives described in this report contains deadlines for actions to be taken by federal agencies states and others based on the public documents associated with each there is relatively little apparent coordination that would help agriculture or other sectors assess the aggregate impacts of all of these developments in the introductory part of the clean water action plan discussed in part 1 of this report the administration describes national data on water quality impairments and ongoing state efforts to identify pollutionimpaired waters as background for todays water quality challenges which the plan addresses regarding agriculture in addition to actions in the plan related to reducing pollution from afos discussed in part 2 several other key actions also described in part 1 specifically addre ss agriculture while others address federal lands and forestry none of these is specifically tied to the afo strategy the afo strategy is one key action under the clean water actio n plan and consequently has obvious links to the plan in the afo strategy the principal linkage between it and the current tmdl program of the clean water act see part 3 of this report is in the strategys discussion concerning the role of state and tribal governments which are responsible for using the tmdl process to identify pollution impaired waters there is explicit linkage of the afo strategy with the tmdl program in one area under the afo strategy where tmdl assessments identify the causes of water quality impairment as coming for example from animal manure orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs4 2 us department of agriculture us environmental protection agency unified national

identifying afos which should be priorities for inclusion in the strategys regulatory program2 however cwa regulations issued in july 2000 to revise the tmdl program are separate from activities under the clean water action plan including the afo strategy and contain discussion of actions under the plan part 1 the clean water action plan3 in october 1997 on the 25th anniversary of the clean water act cwa vice president gore announced an initiative intended to build on the environmental successes of that act and to address the nations remaining water quality challenges while much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals of the law to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of rivers lakes and coastal waters problems persist based on the limited water quality monitoring that is done by states it is estimated that about 40 of those waters do not meet applicable water quality standards the types of remaining water quality problems especially runoff from farms and ranches city streets and other diffuse sources are more complex than is controlling pollution discharged from the end of pipes at factories and sewage treatment plants the vice president directed the environmental protection agency epa and the us department of agriculture usda to coordinate the work of other federal agencies to develop an action plan within 120 days to improve and strengthen water pollution control efforts across the country4 it was to focus on three goals enhanced protection from public health threats posed by water pollution more effective control of polluted runoff and promotion of water quality protection on watershed basis the departments of commerce and the interior and the us army corps of engineers also have roles the purpose of the action plan is to coordinate federal efforts to achieve the three goals over all the initiative seeks primarily to address the wide range of activities that cause nonpoint source pollution polluted runoff including agriculture mining urban development and forestry epa and states believe polluted runoff causes more than onehalf of remaining water quality problems agriculture is believed responsible for the largest portion of todays water quality impairments due to polluted runoff70 of impaired rivers and streams and 49 of impaired lakes according to epahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs5 5 us environmental protection agency national water quality inventory 1998 report to congress june 2000 epa841r00001 1 vol broadly speaking impairment means that the waterbody fails to attain and maintain designated water quality standards 6 ibid p 65elements of the plan and early implementation president clinton and vice president gore released the action plan on february 19 1998 the text is available at httpwwwcleanwatergov the components of the plan more than 100 actions correspond to specific elements identified by the vice president in october 1997 it consists mainly of existing programs including some planned regulatory actions that agencies have had underway now to be enhanced with increased funding or accelerated with performancespecific deadlines components of the action plan announced in february 1998 are built around four key tools to achieve clean water goals waters hed approach using collaborative effort by governments the public and the private sector to restore and sustain the health of watersheds strong federal and state standards to protect public health prevent polluted runoff and ensure accountability natural resource stewardship calling on federal natural resource and conservation agencies to apply resources and technical expertise to state and local watershed restoration and protection informed citizens and officials calling on federal agencies to improve the information available to the public about the health of watersheds and safety of beaches drinking water and fish many of the specific elements of the plan are intended to address nonpoint source contributions to water quality impairments nationwide according to the plan and epa reports polluted runoff is now the major source of water quality problems in the united states epas 1998 national water quality inventory which is the most recent compilation of conditions summarizes state and tribal surveys of water quality it indicates that about 40 of surveyed us waterbodies are impaired by pollution with the leading source being polluted runoff about 60 of impaired rivers and streams and 30 of impaired lakes are impaired by runoff or discharges from agriculture5 in 28 states that specifically assessed impacts of agricultural activities on rivers and streams the leading categories of agricultural source impairments were nonirrigated crop production irrigated crop production and animal operations feedlots and animal holding areas6 these water quality data are limited because they describe only conditions in waters assessed by states and tribes but do not include all waterbodies for the 1998 report states surveyed 23 of river miles 42 of lake acres and 30 of estuaries since most states do not assess all of their waters during the twoyear reporting cycle required by the clean water act therefore the data should be used with caution nevertheless epa believes that the data point to major continuing water pollution problem coming from agricultural sources of all typescrop and pastureland rangeland and concentrated animal feeding operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs6 regarding agriculture prominent key action in the plan is reducing pollution from animal feeding operations see part 2 of this report in addition the plan includes several other key actions concerning agriculture such as usda will implement existing conservation reserve and conservation enhancement programs usda will work with agricultural producers to encourage the use of marketing and promotion orders to assist them in meeting pollution prevention objectives and usda will study the feasibility of providin g an insurance program to enable producers to offset risks of utilizing new technologies by managing fertilizers and pesticides to prevent pollution clean water action plan pp 5054 the plan contains other actions to enhance watershed managem ent on federal lands starting with developing by 1999 unified policy to provide framework to ensure that federal land and resource management activities demonstrate water quality stewardship related actions include substantially improving maintenance of forest roads and trails on federal lands publication of new forest transportation regulations by the us forest service in 1999 assessment by epa of whether to revise cwa permit regulations relative to forest roads implementation of an accelerated program to restore stream corridors actions by federal land managemen t agencies to implemen t forest health strategies and improved management of public rangelands clean water action plan pp 3236 early implementation of the clean water action plan the presidents fy1999 budget identified the clean water action plan as high priority for environmental programs it requested total of 25 billiona 609 million or 33 increase over 1998 base funding levelsfor multiagency clean water and watershed restoration initiative by october 1998 congress had passed fy1999 appropriations bills to fund the plan over all the enacted bills provided 20 billion less than 10 of the increased funds sought by the administration epa received close to full funding for its requested action plan activities but usda received less than 4 of requested increases for its activities under the plan in the presidents fy2000 budget the administration requested 450 million in increases 245 billion total for the plan appropriations bills provided 217 billion128 million more than in fy1999 but 322 million less than was requested for fy2001 the presidents budget requested 276 billion for activities under the plan 27 increase above the fy2000 enacted funding level federal officials estimated in february 1998 that the ambitious agenda in the plan would require 25 years for full implementation they believe that the plan will be implemented even though appropriations have been less than requested lack of new resources will mean 50 or 100year implementation schedule they now say the administration has issued two reports in february 1999 and february 2000 the anniversary of the release of the action plan describing accomplishments to date many of the accomplishments however are only first steps in processes that will be lengthy especially in terms of impacting water quality improvements since many of the specific items in the plan and half of the budgetary resources are focusing on partnerships with states localities and individuals accomplishments depend greatly on actions taken by multiple stakeholders changes in water quality conditions may not be apparent for many yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs7 epa activities of the 100plus actions in the plan many involve core clean water programs for which epa is primarily responsible significant aspect of the plan is focus on watersheds as the basis of water quality problem identification and decision making in june 1998 epa released unified watershed assessment framework to assist states tribes and others with the process called for in the plan of identifying watersheds that do not meet clean water and other natural resource goals and where prevention action is needed to sustain water quality and aquatic resources in response states submitted watershed assessmen t reports by october 1 1998 funding increases provided since fy1999 for clean water grants to states have focused on priority waters identified by these assessments state water quality reports indicate that overenrichment of waters by nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus is the biggest overall source of impairment of the nations waters epa is to publish numeric water quality criteria scientific information concerning harmful levels of pollutant for nutrients for three groups of waters lakes and reservoirs rivers and streams and estuaries and coastal areas by the end of 2000 and for wetlands by the end of 2001 in june 1998 epa released national strategy for developing criter ia and standards for nutrients states will use these criteria to develop nutrient provisions of enforceable state water quality standards joint or other federal agency activities many actions in the plan involve other federal agencies either alone or jointly with epa key purpose of the plan is to coordinate the several federal agencies and their state partners that have water quality program responsibilities among the areas that involve agriculture key element of the plan minimizing public health and environmental impacts of runoff from animal feeding operations afos into rivers lakes and estuaries was addressed when epa and usda issued national afo strategy in march 1999 the strategy itself is not new regulation or substitute for existing regulations nor does it impose binding requirements on federal agencies states tribes localities or the regulated community it presents an overall approach and timetable for curbing pollution from livestock operations however many of the details and hence many of the specific impacts on operators states and others will only become clear with the issuance of guidance and regulatory changes in the coming months see discussion below the conservation reserve enhancement prog ram crep is statefederal conservation partnership program targeted to address specific state and nationally significant water quality soil erosion and wildlife habitat issues related to agricultural use as of octoberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs8 7 wyoming association of conservation districts v browner dcolo 99s1179 june 23 1999 2000 usda has approved programs in 13 states and is considering nine other proposals in october 2000 epa usda the departm ents of agriculture commerce defense energy and the interior the tennessee valley authority and the army corps of engineers adopted unified federal policy on watershed management it is intended to provide framework for watershed approach to ensure that federal land and resource management activities meet the goals of the clean water act on the 800 million acres of land managed by the federal agencies and ensure that the federal government serves as model for water quality stewardship the plan encouraged tempora ry moratorium on new road construction in americas national forests in october 1999 president clinton directed development of an environmental impact statement and regulations to permanently prohibit new roads in certain roadless areas on national forest land regulations were proposed in may 2000 the proposal has been praised by some criticized by some for not being farreaching and criticized by others for being too restrictive final rules are expected to be issued by the end of the year litigation challengi ng the clean water action plan in june 1999 the wyoming association of conservation districts joined by more than 60 groups representing state conservation districts and agric ulture industry challenged the clean water action plan in lawsuit filed in us district court in colorado7 the lawsuit alleges that the plan violates three federal laws the national environmental policy act nepa by not requiring an environmental impact statement on the plans cumulative impacts the administ rative procedure act apa by not providing enough oppor tunity for public comment and the clean water act by trying to regulate nonpoint source water pollution the plaintiffs seek to block implementation of the cwap pending full compliance with the three laws the litigation asserts that because the cwap is major federal action it should have been subject to the public notice and comment and intergovernmental coordination processes under the apa and nepa in response epa has argued that the plan itself is strategy for actions that the government plans to take and thus does not fall under federal public input requirements any epa regulatory actions resulting from the plan will be subject to such requirements epa has said in october 1999 the federal government filed motion to dismi ss the case citing lack of jurisdiction and lack of subject matter us magistrate appointed to analyze issues presented in the case recommended in october 2000 that the governments motion to dismiss be granted by the district court the plaintiffs oppose the recommendation and the case is continuinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs9 8 other than this senate oversight hearing congress has considered the cwap primarily through the appropriations process where spending decisions about requests to fund the plan have been considered 9 for information see crs report 98451 animal waste management and the environment background for current issuessenate oversight hearing on the cwap on may 13 1999 the senate environment and public works committee held an oversight hearing on the cwap the first such congressional involvement outside the appropriations process8 the committee heard from administration and public witnesses epa and usda witness defended the plan as comprehensive blueprint for restoring and protecting the nations water resources environmental group witnesses endorsed the plan because in their view it focuses significant federal resources on polluted surface runoff state witnesses were divided one from maryland supported the plan saying it reinforces strong ongoing water quality programs in that state witness from wyoming which has been in dispute with epa over the states water quality program said the plan has disrupted ongoing state activities agricul ture industry witnesses challenged the scientific basis of the plan especially epas contentions that nonpoint sources generally and agriculture specifically are the major sources of water quality impairment these groups argue that because existing water quality data are limited and are based on partial state assessments of surface waters the premise of the plan is flawed better data are needed before undertaking such broad initiative they said others said that requirements and deadlines of actions in the plan are unrealistic particularly the animal feeding operations strategy see part 2 part 2 animal feeding operations and the clean water act9 as noted previously in this report most agricultural activities are considered to be nonpoint sources and thus are exempt from cwa regulatory programs this includes most animal feeding operations afos or feedlots where livestoc k are confined reared and fed however large confined animal feeding operations cafos are specifically defined in the cwa as point sources rather than nonpoint sources cafos are treated in similar manner to other industrial sources of pollution such as factories and municipal sewage treatment plants and are subject to the acts prohibition against discharging pollutants into waters of the united states without permit in 1974 and 1976 epa issued regulations defining the term cafo for purposes of permit requirements 40 cfr 12223 and effluent limitation guidelines specifying limits on pollutant discharges from feedlots 40 cfr part 412 discharge permits issued by epa or qualified states 43 states have been delegated this responsibility implement the part 412 requirements for individual facilities under the existing permit rules cafo must meet all of the following criteria to be subject to epa ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs10 10 as defined by usda an animal unit is 1000 pounds of live weight of any given livestock species or combination of livestock species this term varies according to animal type one animal is not always equal to one animal unit epas regulation of cafos covers afos consisting of 1000 beef cattle 700 mature dairy cattle 2500 swine weighing over 55 pounds 500 horses 10000 sheep 55000 turkeys or 30000 laying hens or broilers with liquid manure handling system 11 the concentration that has occurred in the animal agriculture sector is illustrated by changes over time in the number of cafos when epas current cafo regulations were proposed in 1975 usda analyzed the potential impacts and reported that 95000 or 136 of the 700000 animal feeding operations in the country would be subject to those rules source us department of agriculture implications of epa proposed regulations of november 20 1975 for the animal feeding operations washington dc jan 30 1976 26 p the smaller number of total operations and smaller number of cafos today suggest that those that are regulated currently are on average much larger than 20 years agoanimals are stabled or confined and fed for 45 days or more in 12 month period vegetation is not sustained during the normal growing season on any portion of the lot or facility ie animals are not maintained in pasture or on rangeland feedlots hold more than 1000 animal units 10 or between 300 and 1000 animal units if pollutants are discharged from manmade conveyance or are discharged directly into waters passing over across or through the facility also animal feeding operations that include fewer than 300 animal units may be designated as cafos if they pose threat to water quality or use based on the usda 1992 census of agriculture epa estimates that 6600 feeding operations qualify as cafos considering the number of animal units alone only 15 of the 450000 operations nationwide that confine or concentrate animals11 epas effluent limitation regulations apply to operations that raise beef and dairy cattle poultry swine sheep and horses the rules essentially prohibit discharge of wastewater from cafos into navigable waters except when caused by the worst 24 hour storm that would occur in 25year period these regulations do not specifically address discharges that may occur from wastewaters or solid manure mixtures which are applied to soil nor do they address odor control or groundwater impacts from animal agriculture operations these topics if regulated at all are subject to varied state and local authority not federal law or regulation in addition to the cwa the coastal zone act reauthorization amendments of 1990 czara imposed waste management requirements on most livestock producers in the coastal zone of the 32 states and territories that participate in the coasta l zone management act czara is the first federal program to require specific measures to address agricultural erosion and runoff and other major sources of coastal nonpoint pollution its requirements are implemented by states through plans that they develop under czara federal czara guidance for agricultural sources specifies minimum management measures including retention ponds solids separation basins and vegetative practices such as filter strips between productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs11 12 parry roberta agricultural phosphorus and water quality us environmental protection agency perspective journal of environmental quality vol 27 2 1998 258facilities and nearby surface waters cafos with as few as 50 animal units may be subject to these and other requi rements federal agencies have fully approved czara programs in three states california maryland and rhode island and conditionally approved czara programs in 26 other coastal states and territories three others are under development livestock and poultry producers there will begin to be regulated by state requirements in the near future neither the law nor the implementing regulations specifies timeline for implementation problems with cafo regulation number of problems with the current cafo regulatory system under the cwa have limited its effectiveness in preventing environmental problems from livestock production fewer than 30 of the cafos with over 1000 animal units had or have cwa permits today ie about 2000 out of 6600 one explanation is the historic emphasis by federal and state regulators on other large industrial and municipal dischar gers over agricultural sources since most of agriculture is not subject to the act epa estimated that only 760 permits were current at the end of 199512 another factor is disputes between regulators and agricultural operators over whether particular facilities meet the regulatory threshold such as whether the regulations apply to feedlots that claim to have discharge some sources went unregulated because the epa rules now more than 20 years old do not reflect more recent changes in animal waste management technology in particular epa defines feeding operations with 100000 laying hens or broilers that use continuous flow watering systems and facilities with 30000 laying hens or broilers that use liquid manure systems as cafos however the poultry industry has moved away from such wet systems since the 1970s many broiler producers now use dry litter waste systems where water is not applied and there is discharge they have argued that they are not subject to the rules producers of layers generally still have liquid waste systems federal regulations and guidelines contain requirement for nutrient or manure management plans cafo inspections by federal and state regulators and compli ance enforcement activities have been limited often occurring only after citizen complaints or accidental releases following large rainfall events or equipment or facility failureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs12 13 cwa section 304b requires epa to review and if appropriate revise effluent limitation guidelines at least annually the

feeding operations mar 9 1999 46 p text of the strategy is available at httpwwwepagovowmafohtminitiative under the cwap the national afo strategy epa has not lacked authority to address water quality problems associated with animal feeding operations but doing so has not been priority13 for several years agency officials discussed the need to revise the cafo regulations and in 1997 plans were announced for two initiatives one dealing with cwa enforcement against livestock producers and one dealing comprehensively with all sources of nonpoint source pollution including farm operations however neither included implementation details several events combined to raise the priority of these topics one was increasing attention to pollution incidents resulting from or believed to be associated with animal waste spills another was the growing number of lawsuits filed by environmentalists against states and epa involving nearly 2 dozen states seeking to compel action against remaining sources of water pollution including agriculture under the clean water acts tmdl program see part 3 of this report third came in february 1998 with the administrations release of the clean water action plan the national afo strategy in march 1999 epa and usda jointly issued major program to implement the clean water action plan unified national strategy for animal feeding operations to minimize the water quality and public health impacts of afos14 the strategy consists of multiple elements and is based on national performance expectation that all afo owners and operatorsregardless of the size of their operationswill develop and implement by 2009 sitespeci fic comprehensive nutrient management plans cnmps intended to protect water quality and public health having all afo owners and operators undertake comprehensive nutrient management planning will accomplish the goal of minimizing water pollution from confinement facilities and land application of manure according to the strategy with the exception of large afo operations which are considered to be cafos and thus are subject to cwa requirements about 5 of total afos nationwide the agencies expect that the vast majority of cnmps will be developed and implemented voluntarily in general terms cnmp will identify actions or priorities to meet clearly identified nutrient management goals at an agricultural operation and typically will address manure handling and storage land application of manure land management such as tillage crop residue management and other conservation practices recordkeeping and other utilization options for example when manure is sold to other farmers plans will be developed by qualified specialists nrcs estimates that at least 330000 afos need to develop cnmps or revise

discussed additional resources in the administrations budget to be directed at such assistance15 the strategy views regulatory programs as complementary to voluntary approaches that will apply to 95 of the total 450000 afos in the nation the strategy says that under existing cwa authority the discharge permit program in the cwa called the npdes program will be used to address the relatively small number of afos 5 of the total that cause measurable water quality or public health problems or that pose significant risk to water quality or public health it identifies the following priorities for permits and enforcement large facilities those with great er than 1000 animal units which produce quantities of manure that can be risk to water quality and public health these already are considered to be cafos and therefore are point sources already subject to ndpes permit requirements some facilities with fewer than 1000 animal units which can pose risk of water pollution or public health problems because the facilities have manmade conveyance to discharge manure and wastewaters into streams other individual facilities or collections of facilities with fewer than 1000 animal units that based on water quality monitoring are contributing significantly to impairment of waterbody or watershed such facilities will be designated as cafos and will be priority for permit issuance and enforcement epa expects that the total number of cafos meeting these three priorities for npdes permits will be 15000 20000 facilities these facilities will be required to develop and implement cnmps and their permits will include specific performance measures monitoring and reporting under the strategy states and epa should identify the universe of cafos and inspect all cafos in highpriority areas by 2001 and all other cafos by 2003 permitting will occur in two phases first by 2005 epa and authorized states will issue npdes permits under existing regulations to priority facilities epa expects that this will occur mainly through general permits either issued on statewide basis or for specific geographic areas such as watersheds individual permits will be issued to exceptionally

permitting regulations and effluent guidelines using input from usda states tribes other federal agencies and the public epa currently is under courtordered schedule to issue revised guidelines for poultry swine and beef and dairy cattle by december 2002 in compliance with that schedule epa proposed revised guidelines for these sectors on decemb er 15 200016 the proposed rule would increase the number of facilities required to obtain clean water act permits and would restrict land application of wastes in the proposal epa asked for public comment on two options for defining cafos subject to npdes permitting the first option would consider facility to be cafo if it has 500 cattle or comparable animals units compared with 1000 animal units under current rules the second option would define facility as cafo if it has more than 1000 animal units or has 300 to 1000 animal units and meets certain conditio ns such as if they are located within 100 feet of waterway however under either of the proposed options permittin g authorities would have discretion to designate smaller facilities ie below 500 or 300 animal units respectively for inclusion in permit programs in other changes in the epa december proposal permitting requirements would be extended to drymanure poultry operations and standalone immature swine and heifer operations the agency proposed to require that permitted facilities develop and implement sitesp ecific permit nutrient plans which identify the amount of nutrients generated at the facility and determine rates for the application of the waste to agricultural land epa also proposed to lift the current regulatory exemption for facilities that only discharge during 25year 24hour storm under the 1999 afo strategy in the second phase of npdes permitting after 2005 following expiration of permits issued between 2000 and 2005 epa and states will reissue permits from the first round and will incorporate any new requirements that could result from regulatory revisions completed in the interim the afo strategy also addressed corporate integrators owners of livestock that contract out to farmers to raise the animals or poultry it recommended co permitting system in which permits would cover not just the grower or farmer but also the corporate owner and epas december 2000 proposed cafo rule changes would require copermitting of facilities covered by those regulations in such system liability for handling the animal waste and for any environmental violations would be shared by the farmer and any corporate owner that exercises substantial operational control over cafo environmental groups in particular have urged co permitting arguing that it could go long way to improving waste management by involving integrators in ensuring that their contract growers are environmentally responsible while some states already recognize that corporate owners share responsibility with farmers industry groups have generally opposed this as national requirement in their view it is inappropriate to hold the corporate entity responsiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs15 17 nrcs policy for nutrient management part 402 text of the

strategy will enable epa through clean water rules to control economic activity and landuse decisions of farmers21 most would prefer that any animal waste program focus on voluntary approaches that encourage operators to utilize good environmental practices with regulation and enforcement limited to only known problems of poor resource management agricultural groups criticized many parts of epas draft permit guidance to implement the strategy contending for example that epa lacks authority to require copermitting from the states perspective many have questioned the need for national program key concern for states has been that many already have difficulty providing resources for feedlot inspections and enforcement thus they are wary of new regulatory requirements that could impose additional resource burdens states also say that they need flexibility to coordinate and prioritize implementation of the federal strategy with other equally important state programs epas concern is to balance the states desire for flexibility with the federal agencys desire to have state programs be accountable and provide an opportunity if needed for federal

groups were highly critical of epas draft permit guidance in their view the guidance document inappropriately delegates responsibility to set nutrient waste management standards to usda which the

appropriations requirement in the conference report accompanying epas fy2000 appropriation pl 10674 hrept 106379 conferees directed epa in conjunction with usda to conduct cost and capability assessment of the afo strategy and ordered that the report be submitted to congress by may 15 200123 part 3 related water quality initiative tmdls24 the clean water act cwa contains number of complex elements of overall water quality management foremost is the requirement in section 303 that states establish ambient wate r quality standards for surface waterbodies these consist of the designated use or uses eg recreational public water supply or industrial water supply and the water quality criteria which are necessary to protect the use or uses through permits states or the epa impose wastewater discharge limits on individual industrial and municipal facilities to ensure that water quality standards are attained howe ver congress recognized in the act that in many cases pollution controls implemented by industry and cities would be inadequate due to pollutant contributions from other unregulated sources or insufficient regulation of cities and industrial facilities under section 303d of the act states must identify lakes rivers and streams for which wastewater discharge limits are not stringent enough to achieve established water quality standards after implementation of technologybased contr ols by industrial and municipal dischargers for each of these waterbodies state is required to set total maximum daily load tmdl of pollutants at level that ensures that applicable water quality standards can be attained and maintained if state fails to do the tmdl analysis epa is required to develop priority list for the state and make its own tmdl determination httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs18 section 303d provides the analytical and regulatory means for using water quality standards to upgrade waters that remain polluted after the application of technologybased requirements tmdl includes quantitative assessment of water quality problems pollution sources and pollutant reductions needed to restore and protect river stream or lake tmdls may address all pollution sources including point sources such as municipal sewage or industrial plant discharges nonpoint sources such as runoff from roads farm fields and forests and naturally occurring sources such as runoff from undisturbed lands the complexity and cost of developing tmdls will vary depending on the geographi c area number and complexity of pollutants and distribution of sources the tmdl program first and foremost affects states territories and indian tribes authorized to administer the clean water act it requires these entities to adopt and implement measures needed to attain and maintain water quality standards it is up to states territories and tribes to identify waters that do not meet this goal and adopt policies and measures applicable to individual sources as appropriate to attain water quality standards in the early years of implementing clean water programs states and localities were largely focused on water pollution problems associated with point sources industries and municipalities the tmdl requirements of the law effectively force an examination of all sources contributing to water quality problems thus epa states and the public are looking beyond traditional point source controls to assess all measures needed to attain water quality standards this broader assessment is occurring as result of litigation which has forced action by states and epa and more recently by changes to the tmdl regulations tmdl is not selfimplementing and does not itself establish new regulatory controls on sources of pollution however when tmdls are established municipal and industrial wastewater treatme nt plants may be required to install new pollution control technology states and epa enforce the tmdls through revisions to existing permits which include the pollutant limits and schedule for compliance for waters impaired by nonpoint source runoff including runoff from agriculture because there are federal controls over these sources under the clean water act the primary implementation measures are staterun nonpoint source management programs coupled with state local and federal land management programs and authorities for example farmers and ranchers may be asked to use alternative methods in their operations to prevent fertilizers and pesticides from reaching rivers cities may be required to control and treat runoff from their streets implementation tmdls are one element of water quality management programs conducted by states to implement the cwa other activities include standard setting monitoring issuing permits and enforcement integrating them with the tmdl program may well be difficult because of factors such as different program purposes schedules and even different definitions for key terms most states have lacked the resources to do tmdl analyses which involve complex assessment of all identified point and nonpoint sources to ascribe and quantify enviro nmental effects for particular discharge sources baseline water quality monitoring data for the analyses to identify impaired waters and pollution sources is limited epa has both been reluctant to intervene in the states and has also lacked resources to do so itself thus there has been littlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs19 25 for information on tmdl litigation by state see epas web site httpwwwepagovowowtmdllawsuit1html 26 this is

provision which was enacted in 1972 for many years epa did little even to prod states to identify waters that remain pollutionimpaired much less undertake analyses to develop tmdls as required by the act the first tmdl regulations were issued in 1985 but only in 1992 did epa issue regulations requiring states every 2 years to list waters that do not attain water quality standards and establish tmdls to restore water quality under this schedule states submitted their most recent 303d lists in april 1998 from these 1998 submissions epa estimates that approximately 20000 waterways nationwide are impaired and require tmdls lawsuits have driven the greatest attention to tmdls responding to the failure of both states and epa to meet the statutory requirements environmental groups have filed 40 lawsuits in 38 states in the last few years the first such lawsuit was filed in 1986 the bulk have been filed since 1992 environmentalists see implementation of section 303d as important both to achieving the overall goals and objectives of the act and to pressuring epa and states to address nonpoint and other sources which are responsible for many water quality impairments nationwide courts in number of states have ordered or approved settlements for expeditious development of tmdls25 because of the lawsuits and existing requirements of the law in august 1997 epa issued policy which for the first time called on states to develop longterm schedules for implementing tmdls under that policy epa directed states to establish tmdls in order to meet water quality standards within 8 to 13 years26 one observer commented on this time frame whether even this pace can be maintained and whether it will produce load allocations and plans of sufficient quality to be effective are legitimate and difficu lt questions27 following listing of impaired waters pursuant to section 303d development of tmdls is being initiated at an increasing pace in some states but most tmdls remain to be completed epa estimates that about 1500 tmdls have been developed evidence of cleanup of waterways will take much longer to identify estimating when individual waters will actually be cleaned up following development of tmdl is difficult the amount of time required for waterbody to reach water quality standards can vary considerably depending upon the complexity of the pollutants the uses of the land surrounding the waterbody and the commitment of the community or upstream dischargers to reducing pollutants epas current regulations do not contain cleanup deadlines or

criteria for states territories and authorized indian tribes to identify impaired waters and establish all tmdls within 15 years the proposal incorporated many of the recommendations of federal advisory committee act faca group which the agency convened in 1996 to help develop consistent national program29 at least two aspects of the proposal were controversial 1 an explicit requirement that waterbodies impaired wholly or in part by nonpoint sources of pollutants be identified and that tmdls be developed for such waters and 2 new requirement for an implementation plan further explicit inclusion of nonpoint sources of pollution and potential impacts on agriculture and silviculture sources became highly contentious30 vigorous challenge to all parts of the proposal came from states and various industry groups arguing that epas proposed expansion of the current tmdl program is not clearly authorized in the law epa responded that it does have ample authority for the proposed changes because of wide interest in the proposal epa exten ded the public comment period on the tmdl rule by 90 days to jan 22 2000 for total comment period of 150 days the agency received an estimated 34000 comments epas 1999 proposal had few strong supporters for varying reasons states which would be directly affected by the proposal criticized the burdens that new requirements would place on them they are concerned that they lack the resources to meet tight deadlines to develop and implement tmdls further states say that tmdls should not necessarily be prioritized over other elements of existing water quality management programs industry groups are concerned about impacts of new pollution control requirements but municipal and industrial point source groups urge states and epa to ensure that tmdl requirements do not fall disproportionately on their discharges while possibly failing to address nonpoint source contributions to impaired waters farm groups and others associated with nonpoint discharges question epas authority to include nonpoint source pollution in the tmdl program the forestry industry vigorously criticized the potential impacts of the proposal on its activities number of environmentalists who support the need for stronger tmdl program objected to the lengthy time periods in the proposal before water quality improvements are likely to occur

current law and the existing tmdl program require states to identify waterbodies where water quality standards are not being attained and to establish total maximum daily load of pollutants at level that will attain water quality standards by allocating further required pollutant reductions among sources the key changes proposed in august 1999 included new requirement for more comprehensive list of impaired and threatened waterbodies new requirement that states territories and authorized indian tribes establish and submit schedules for establishing tmdls new requirement that the listing methodologies be more specific subject to public review and submitted to epa clarification that tmdls include nine specific elements new requirement for an implementation plan as required element of

ways revising the identificationlisting methodology establishing schedules for tmdl development increasing public participation and providing the identificationlisting methodology in new format for some interested parties what is most of interest is what was not included in the final rule epa dropped several provisions that were most controversial in the proposal including some potentially affecting agriculture and forestry agriculture and forestry the final rule entirely dropped provisions that could have affected some agricultural and forestry activities and could have required some of them to obtain cwa discharge permits if they are contributi ng to water quality impairments much of the criticism of the tmdl proposal had focused on possible impacts on these sources most of which currently are exempt from the acts permit and enforcement requirements that apply to point source discharges from industries and municipalities these parts of the proposal especially those potentially affecting forestry generated vigorous criticism and according to epa more than onehalf of the 34000 public comments submitted on the tmdl proposal and much of epas response since august 1999 focused on explaining and clarifying provisions that were in fact small part of the full tmdl proposal in 1999 epa proposed that some forestry operations animal feeding operations afos and aquatic animal production facilities not currently subject to cwa permits could be required by states to obtain permits epa justified the proposal on the basis that state water quality data indicate that pollutants from agriculture and forestry are causing water quality problems that prevent waters throughout the nation from meeting standar ds the proposal detailed narrow set of circumstances when this might occur for example only where there is an identifiable source of discharge only where the discharge is causing water quality impairment only where the source is determined to be significant contributor of pollutants to the impaired waterbody and only where epa is developing the tmdl in lieu of state however agriculture and forestry groups strongly criticized the possibility that even some part of their activities could be subjected to cwa regulations concerns of the forestry industry included challenging whether forestrys water quality impacts are significant enough to warrant epas proposed changes suspicion that the reach of epas program would be broader than the agency indicated and general fear of becoming subject to cwa regulation and enforceme nt before finalizing the revised rules epa first indicated that the provisions affecting forestry would be withdrawn for reproposal at later date but in the final rule the agency indicated that the forestry afo and aquatic animal facilities provisions were dropped and that epa does not intend to repropose any of them treatment of nonpoint sources in the tmdl program one of the most contentious tmdl issues has been whether

associations challenged epas authority to control pollutant allocations to waters impaired solely by nonpoint sources plaintiffs in the lawsuit claimed that the cwa does not give epa the authority to regulate nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff in march 2000 federal district court rejected the plaintiffs arguments and held that it would be impossible to carry out the tmdl program and implement water quality standards without taking nonpoint sources into account pronsolino v marcus 91 fsupp2d 1337 nd cal 2000 the case has been appealed nonpoint sources are included in the program or whether it is limited to point source impairments of waterbodies epa points out that agency policy and rules since 1985 have fully included identification of waters impaired by all sources point sources nonpoint sources and combination of both further administrative guidance documents on tmdl implementation likely have included all sources practically speaking however nonpoint sources have infrequently been affected by tmdl requirements at least until recently because of several factors 1 limited state and federal implementation of section 303d especially before recent litigation and epas response to lawsuits and 2 epas and states longstanding focus on controlling pollution from point sources which has changed in part as result of data indicating that nonpoint pollution is significant source of water quality impairments nationwide epas 1999 proposal and the final rule clarify that states are to identify waters impaired by all sources and to establish tmdls whether the impairments are due to pollutants from point sources nonpoint sources or blend of sources in the proposal epa explained 64 federal register 4602046 021 its view that section 303d provides ample authority to list waterbodies impaired by nonpoint sources of polluti on and to establish tmdls for those waterbodies in epas view this is primar ily because there is express exclusion of nonpoint sourceimpaired waterbodies from the tmdl requirements of section 303d and because the definition of pollutant in the act is not limited to point sources some agriculture and forestry interests fear that by including nonpoint source pollutants in tmdls epa will regulate nonpoint sources pursuant to section 303d by requiring pollutant reductions from nonpoint sources in response epa acknowledged in the july 2000 final rule that the clean water act does not authorize the agency to regulate nonpoint sources and that nonpoint source load reductions can only be required by states through their implementation of the act epas only ability to affect or encourage implementation of tmdls involving nonpoint sources is indirect by conditioning grants to states eg cwa section 319 grants34 inclusion of nonpoint sources in the tmdl program remains controversial topic35 however groups representing major point source dischargers are concerned that if arguments against including nonpoint sources are successful point sources will be unfairly and inequitably targeted to achieve more stringent water quality controlshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs24 if epas views that section 303d applies to nonpoint source pollutants are ultimately rejected by the courts or policymakers impacts of the tmdl program on agriculture would be considerably less and fewer agricultural sources would be affected by tmdl requirements however barring change in the current policy agriculture and forestry sources are not sheltered from the substance of the tmdl program as states continue to implement both the current program under existing rules and the revised progr am in the future if agricultural and forestry nonpoint sources are identified as contributing to water quality impairments states may seek controls or management practices by those sources in order to attain water quality standards under both the existing and revised tmdl program states are responsible for identifying impaired waters and allocating pollutant reductions needed to attain water quality standards the revised program adds details specificity and deadlines to the existing program but in eithe r case where nonpoint sources are associated with water quality impairments states may call for measures voluntary or otherwise that will achieve necessary pollutant load reductions moreover concerning animal feeding operations

litigation challenging the july final tmdl rule has been filed in the federal district court for the district of columbia lawsuits have been filed by several industry and trade association groups representing nonpoint source dischargers these suits argue among other points that epa exceeded its authority in seeking to regulate agricultural and other nonpoint source operations two lawsuits have been filed by groups representing point source dischargers some in these groups raise legal issues about listing of impaired waters and similar implementation problems that could adversely affect utilities and other industries finally several environmental groups have filed to intervene for the defense in some of the lawsuits and have also filed lawsuits of their own challenging parts of the

pollutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30437crs27 is the byproduct of variety of land use practices including farming timber harvesting mining and construction it also results when rainfall and snowmelt wash pollutants in urban areas into sewer systems and storm drains nonpoint sources are not subject to npdes permit requirements under this law they are managed primarily through the acts section 319 program which requires states to assess the extent to which nonpoint sources cause water quality problems and develop management programs to address them point source under the cwa means any discernible confined and discrete conveyance such as pipes ditches channels and tunnels from which pollutants are or may be discharged point sources are subject to npdes requirements the term does include cafos but does not include agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture total maximum daily load tmdl quantitative assessment of water quality problems pollution sources and pollutant reductions needed to restore and protect river stream lake or coastal waterbody as required by section 303d of the cwa watershed approach an approach to resource
