divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33746hedge fund failures summary the growth of hedge funds private highrisk unregulated investment pools for wealthy individuals and institutions has been striking development in financial markets there are now bout 8000 funds with perhaps 15 trillion under management both figures are roughly 10 time s what they were decade ago hedge funds are said to acc ount for 2030 of trading volume in us stocks and at times even higher proportions in more sp ecialized instruments such as convertible bonds and credit derivatives th eir trades can move markets since hedge fund investment is limited by law to the very wealthy who are presumed to be capable of understanding th risks and bearing the losses of financial speculation the traditional view has been that there is public interest in regulating them many still hold this view however as their size and presence in the markets has grown hedge funds have attracted scrutiny from regula tors and congress does hedge fund trading now create risk exposur outside the relatively narrow circle of their principals and investors th ere are two ways this could happen first the failure of large fund or number with similar tfolios could pose risks to banks and other creditors if he dge funds had to liquidate large market position quickly prices could fall sharply wide ning the circle of losses it was to avoid such an outcome that the federal re serve organized rescue of the longterm capital management ltcm hedge fund in 1998 because it judged that default posed an unacceptable risk of disruption to the financial system since financial turmoil began in mid2007 however there have been relatively few hedge fund failures and none that has pos ed systemic threat hedge funds are one focus of the securities and exchange commissions sec investigation into abusive short selling of financial stocks second investor protection concerns have emerged as the popularity of hedge fund investment has grown hedge funds are open only to accredited investors defined as those with over 1 million in assets in the past this standard seemed high enough to exclude the small unsophisticated investors who provide the rationale for government regulation however since the 1 million figure includes the value of an individuals residence rising home pri ces and inflation have lifted many who are not necessarily expert in financial matters over the accredited threshold at the same time institutional inve stors like pension funds nd university endowments are placing more of their money in hedge funds which means that rankandfile workers retirees and others ma be unwittingly exposed to hedge fund losses this report lists major hedge fund failu res since ltcm because hedge funds are

ltcm neardefault and on hedge funds generally see crs report 94 511 hedge funds should they be regulated by mark jicklinghedge fund failures background in 1998 the federal reserve bank of new york organized rescue of long term capital management l tcm hedge fund that was on the brink of collapse in exchange for providing about 3 billi on to meet th funds shor tterm cash obligations 14 of ltcms chief creditors including some of the bestknown wall street firms became the ne w owners of the hedge funds portfolio the feds intervention was very unusual because i nvestment in hedge f unds is by law limited to wealthy individuals and institutions who are presumed to be capable of understanding the risks and bearing the losses of speculation regulators do not normally view hedge fund failure as cause for government action their strong preference is to let hedge funds collapse rather than send signal to other market participants that they too might be rescued from their mistakes in the ltcm case however the fed concluded that fault might have repercussions far beyond the losses that w ould accrue to the hedge funds principals and investors1 investors had about 3 billion in ltcm but the fund had borrowed to accumulate bond portfolio of about 100 billion and had assumed derivatives positions with notional valu of about 1 trilli on the fed feared that default might have jeopardized the solvency of ltcms creditors which included several of the worlds largest financial institutions and its numerous derivatives counterparties moreover if ltcm had been forced to liquidate its positions quickly prices of bonds and other instrume nts might have been severely depressed and other holders would have suffered unexpected losses even though they had had dealings whatsoever with ltcm give n that global markets were already under stress at the time russia had defaulted on its sovereign debt and asia was experiencing second round of financial cr ises and investor confidence was low the fed chose to intervene rather than risk widespread disruption to the financial system the possibility that the failure of single institution could set off cascading failures throughout the financia l system is known as syste mic risk the classic case is banking crisis where trouble in one bank can trigger runs on others including financially sound institutions if enough depositors decide to withdraw their funds as precaution with ltcm regulators recognized that hedge funds can also be source of systemic risk ther are several possible scenarios first single hedge fund could grow large enough to pose sy stemic threat if its investments were concentrated in single market and constituted significant share of that of thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33746crs2 2 this was the case with ltcm the fund was able to borrow extensively and on very favorable terms in part because the lenders wanted information about ltcms strategy which was devised by nobel prizewinners and executed by legendary wall street traders 3 see senate permanent subcommittee on investigations excessive speculation in the natural gas market staff report june 2007 135 p 4 us securities and exchange commission

countries blamed hedge funds for manipulating currenc prices and doing serious harm to the real economies in addition some obser vers believe that hedge fund speculation played role in high and volatile us energy prices in 2005 and 20063 in 2008 as share prices of financial institutions plung ed short selling by hedge funds perhaps abetted by the spreading of false inform ation became focus

more popular new investor protecti on concerns have emerged hedge funds are open only to accredited investors defined as those with assets worth over 1 million in the past this standard seemed high enoug h to exclude the small unsophisticated investors who provide the rationale for government regulation of securities markets however since the 1 million figure includes the value of an individuals residence rising home prices have lifted many who are not necessarily expert in financial matters over the accredited threshold decade ago most hedge funds required minimum investment of 200000 or more beyond the reach of most households whose assets were concentrated in their homes as result of competition and the growing number of hedge funds howev er there are now funds that w ill accept

legislative interest table 1 below provides basic information about the most prominent he dge fund failures since the ltcm episode the list is not comprehensive many f unds fail each year without attracting much notice because the list has been generated by searching periodical literature databases principally proquest nexis and factiva the cases included have been newsworthy for one reason or another ge nerally because of their size the amount of investor losses the risky or exotic tr ading strategies employed or because fraud was involved and thus should not be ta ken as representative of the entire hedge fund industry why hedge funds fail although some employ very conservative investment strategies hedge funds can generally be characterized as highrisk highreturn operations pursuit of risk implies high failure rate various studies have estimated that from 7 to 10 of hedge funds fail each year6 estimates of the number of hedge funds range from 7000 to 9000 which suggests that several hundred funds cease operations each year recent study7 distinguishes between three reasons for hedge fund failure financial issues or losses stemming from unfavorable market moves operational issues such as errors in trade processing or mispricing complex opaque financ ial instruments and fraud or misbehavior by fund management the most common cause is undoubtedly the fi rst when hedge funds fail to earn the hopedfor returns they are generally unable to attract new investors and managers find it unprofitable to continue the normal cour is to dissolve the fund in accordance with the partners hip agreement and return f unds to investors in many cases investors suffer loss at all other than the opportunity cost of their failure to select more profitable fund and the end of the hedge fund receives public notice such failures are not captured in the table below when financial losses to hedge funds ar sudden or severe investors are likely to suffer major losses and the event is more likely to be reported in the press several such cases are listed below it is noteworthy however that none of the post ltcm failures has appeared to pose such risk to the financial system that

of events are of course commonly disputed 10 implications of the growth of hedge funds sec staff study september 2003 p 76 11 christory daul nd giraud quantification of hedg fund default risk p 76 the authors define default as loss large enough to prevent the manager from pursuing his strategy with his existing inve stors resulting in investors exiting the fund at significant loss as opposed to dissolutions where f unds return all money to investors because of poor performance ibid p 72federal reserve has had to intervene nor have there been waves of hedge fund failures stemming from major market movements such as the bear market in stocks of 20002002 the subsequent sharp fall in inte rest rates or the energy price volatility that followed the invasion of iraq the most recent episodes however show that problems in the subprime mortgage mark et and perhaps other corporate debt markets have caused difficulties for num ber of funds around the world when the market turmoil that began in the summer of 2007 has subsided the multiple failures may be seen as having constituted significant risk to the system the incidence of failure as result of operational issues is probably much lower but is difficult to judge because hedge funds disclose so little information about themselves operational cerns have been addressed by regulators however in october 2005 the federal re serve bank of new york convened meeting of 14 major credit derivatives dealers to address backoffice problems and to set goals to reduce the backlog of unprocessed trades in that market where hedge funds play significant role8 where fraud is involved in hedge fund failure legal and regulatory actions ensure that an unusual amount of informa tion is made public bout the fund and the circumstances of the failure9 thus cases of fraud are likely to be overrepresented in any tabulation of failures while the sec has noted many times that the lack of disclosure makes hedge fund fraud potentially serious problem10 there is consensus as to whether actual fraud is mo re common among hedge funds than other types of private investment vehicles limited information is available about the relative frequency of these three reasons for failure christory daul nd giraud categorize 109 cases of hedge fund default between 1994 and 2005 and find th at 54 involved fraud 33 involved financial issues and 13 involved operational issues11 sometimes the categories may overlap some cases of fraud begin with financial losses that fund managers seek to cover up by reporting false earnings data to
