patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary during meeting with ambassador january 31 nawaz sharif confirmed he was ready to work with the pakistan peoples party in postelection coalition government and described this union as the best thing that could happen in pakistan he dismissed reports of threats against his life as attempts by the government to dissuade him from campaigning noting that emotions remain high in sindh he predicted violence if the election was seen as being rigged for musharrafs party as proof of his proamericanism nawaz reminded ambassador that he had overruled his chief of staff to deploy pakistani forces with the us coalition in the first gulf war nawaz remained firm in his belief that all of the deposed judiciary must be reinstated end summary 2 c ambassador and polcouns met former prime minister and pakistan muslim leaguen pmln leader nawaz sharif january 31 for an hour during nawazs recent visit to islamabad pmln leader chaudhry nisar ali khan also attended the meeting nawaz met with eu ambassadors the same day and urged them to take preemptive action to prevent rigging in the upcoming election 3 c ambassador noted the reports about threats to nawazs security and said we were pleased to have briefed his staff on measures that could be taken to enhance his safety nawaz responded that the gop has said he is number one on the hit list of the militants but he is not convinced citing the belief that an ied planted on the road he was to travel to rally in peshawar lacked detonator nawaz insisted he had received information from credible sources that the device was planted by security services to go off hours after the rally this was another attempt at government intimidation to convince him not to campaign ambassador cautioned him to remain vigilant as it was clear that militant extremists wanted to disrupt the election pmlnppp the best thing that could happen 4 c in response to ambassadors question about whether pmln could work with the pakistan peoples party ppp in possible coalition government nawaz recounted how he had immediately gone to the hospital when he heard benazir bhutto had been shot and he had made special effort to pay condolence call on asif zardari in larcana ambassador said that zardari had noted his appreciation for this gesture of support pmlnppp alliance would be the best thing that could happen to pakistan if it materialized said nawaz the pmln had reached out to the ppp and time would tell what alliances could be built they could also work together in the provincial government of sindh or punjab he predicted that the ppp could win enough seats to rule in sindh with or without the muttahida quami movement mqm 5 c nawaz expected both ppp and pmln would do well at the polls if the elections were free and fair he dismissed the pakistan muslim league party saying that pervaiz elahi would get few if any votes claiming he had vendetta against president musharraf nawaz said the pmln had also reached out to the pakistan muslim league and they in turn had contacted pmln ref note he then launched into long description of his mistreatment after musharraf overthrew nawaz in 1999 the pmlns goal in government would be to reinstate the deposed judiciary and restore the law and order situation without restoring the judiciary nawaz argued you cannot restore law and order and rule of law 6 c ambassador said we continued to support an independent judiciary and wanted to work with the new government on this issue it was simply too difficult to tackle before elections we believed there should be way to restore some of the deposed judges but not the former chief justice nawaz insisted that without restoring the chief justice there was point to filling other slots on the bench ambassador disagreed noting that many of the provincial judges could be restored for the benefit of pakistans judiciary islamabad 00000483 002 of 002 emotions high 7 c despite the decreased level of campaigning due to security concerns nawaz and khan both said that voter emotions were higher than they have ever seen sindh in particular remains very tense and could erupt if the election outcome is perceived as being rigged nawaz noted that civil society and student groups were politicized in ways they have not been before the pmln did not want violence but it might be impossible to control the people if they felt they had been wronged nawaz expressed concern that extremists could take advantage of and exacerbate tensions he warned that what he described as negativelypreceived us support for musharraf could create backlash of antiamericanism if the public perceives that the government rigged the elections we could be sitting on volcano and the next fourfive weeks will be critical for the region and for pakamerican relations 8 c the best thing america has done recently said nawaz was arrange to have general kayani named as chief of army staff this appointment is helping army morale and raising the level of public respect for the army noting that musharraf met the uk equivalent to the chairman of the joint chiefs khan said the us and the uk need to stop treating musharraf as if he still ran the military centcom commander admiral fallon would have met with musharaf if the president had not been travelling asserted khan ambassador replied that we had excellent relations with the pakistani military and meet them all the time at various levels we are proamerican 9 c nawaz and khan both repeatedly said that the pmln was proamerican nawaz recounted his decision to override his chief of army staff and deploy pakistani troops to saudi arabia in support of the us coalition in the first gulf war meanwhile khan noted the ppp and its leaders were organizing street demonstrations against pakistan joining with the us coalition now nawaz said he was hurt that the us did not remember nawaz said he understood that 911 had changed things but urged that the us apply some balance to the relationship in the past the us was known as the power that rejected dictatorships that fought for independence of the judiciary and the rule of law why he asked did we continue to support man who fired the supreme court abrogated the constitution and arrested civil society activists 10 c comment the fact that former prime minister believes the us could control the appointment of pakistans chief of army staff speaks volumes about the myth of american influence here based on our understanding of the current situation we believe nawaz can and should take the threats to his life seriously it comes as surprise that nawaz exaggerated his partys election prospects his willingness to deal with the ppp is however good sign he is ready to cooperate on government formation patterson
