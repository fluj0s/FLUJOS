clean air and drinking water issues summary as gasoline prices have risen in ma rch and april 2006 rene wed attention has been given to methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe gasoline additive being phased out of the nations fuel supply many argue that the phaseout of mtbe and its replacement by ethanol have been major factor in driving up prices mtbe has been used by refiners since the late 1970s it came into widespread use when leaded gasoline was phased out providing an octane boost similar to that of lead but without fouling the catalytic converters used to reduce auto emissions since the mid1970s mtbe has also been used to produce cleanerburning reformulated gasoline rfg which the cl ean air act has required in the nations most polluted areas since 1995 the act di dnt mandate the use of mtbe ethanol or other substances could have been used to meet the acts oxygenate requirement but price and handling characteristics of the additive led to its widespread use under the energy policy act of 2005 p l 10958 the rfg programs oxygen mandate terminates on may 6 2006 and refiners are sc rambling to remove mtbe from the nations gasoline supply by that da the phaseout of mtbe like its use is not required by federal w but gasoline refiners ve focused on the may 6 date because of concerns over their potential lia bility for its continued presence mtbe has contaminated drinking water in numbe r of states and about half have passed legislation to ban or restrict its use hundreds of suits have been filed to require petroleum refiners and mark eters to pay for cleanup of contaminated water supplies the cost of which has been estimated to be in the billions of dollars the petroleum industry has maintained that it used mt be to meet the rfg programs oxygen mandate and therefore should not be held liable that position could become more difficult to maintain once the oxygen mandate is removed to replace mtbe refiners are switching to ethanol as swiftly as they can leading temporarily to supply shortages and higher prices the ethanol industry maintains that there will be sufficient ethanol to meet demand but concedes that temporary shortages exist in some parts of the country th at could affect prices until the end of june these shortages and high er prices have led to renewed discussion by some of exempting gasoline refiners from liability for mtbe cleanup socalled safe harbor provision others have re newed their call for federal legislation to stimulate the construction of new refining capacity besides removing the rfg programs oxygen requirement congress provided major incentive to the production of et hanol in the energy policy ac t of 2005 under renewable fuels standard an incr easing amount of the nations motor fuels must consist of

water quality issues associated with it and reviews options available to congressional and other policymakers concerned about its continued use it incl udes discussion of legislation in the 109th congress under the clean air act amendments of 1990 numerous areas with poor air quality were required to add chemicals called oxygenates to gasoline as means of improving combustion nd reducing emissions the act had two programs that required the use of oxygenates but the more significant of the two was the reformulated gasoline rfg program which took effect january 1 19951 under the reformulated gasoline program areas with severe or extreme ozone pollution 124 counties with combined populati on of 736 million must use reformulated gasoline areas with less severe ozone pollution may opt into the program as well and many have in all portions of 17 st ates and the district of columbia use reformulated gasoline see table 1 and figure 1 about 30 of the gasoline sold in the united states is rfg the law required that rfg contain at least 2 oxygen by weight refiners could meet this requirement by adding num ber of ethers or alcohols any of which contain oxygen and other elements becau these substances are not pure oxygen the amount used to obtain 2 oxygen level is greater than 2 of the gasoline blend for example mtbe is only 19 oxygen and thus rfg made with mtbe needed to contain 11 mtbe by volume to meet the 2 requirement by far the most commonly used oxygenate has been mtbe in 1999 87 of rfg contained mtbe as restrictions on mtbe use took effect in california new york and connecticut at the end of 2003 this number was reduced but even with these state bans 46 of rfg na tionally contained mtbe in 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32787crs2 table 1 areas using

1970s in gasoline as an octane enhancer mtbe use grew rapidly in th 1980s as it replaced lead in gasoline and was used in premium fuels as result gasoline with mtbe has been used virtually everywhere in the united states whether or not an area has been subject to rfg requirements air quality benefits resulting from mtbe use state and local environmental agencies and epa attribute marked improvements in air quality to the use of fuels containing mtbe and other oxygenates but the exact role of oxygenates in achieving these imp rovements is subject to debate in angeles which has had the worst air quality in the country the use of reformulated gasoline was credited with reducing gr oundlevel ozone by 18 during the 1996 smog season compared to weatheradjuste d data for the same period in 1994 and 1995 use of rfg also reduced the cancer ri sk associated with exposure to vehicle emissions by 30 to 40 according to the california epa largely because it uses less benzene known human carcinogen2 whether the oxygenates themselves should be given credit for these improvements has been the subject of deba with the answer depending to some extent on what one assumes would replace the oxygenates if they were removed asked to look at the ozoneforming poten tial of different oxygenates used in reformulated gasoline national academy of sciences panel concluded that the addition of commonly available oxygenates to rfg is likely to have little airquality impact in terms of ozone reduction3 an epa advisory panel by contrast concluded that the use of oxygenates app ears to contribute to reduction of the use of aromatics with related toxics and other air quality benefits4 less controversy exists regarding oxygenates role in reducing carbon monoxide emissions both epa and

are significant and that these reductions help to protect the public from the adverse health effects associated with high levels of co in the air6 the agency based its conclusions both on its own analysis nd on report prepared for two industry groups the latter using hourly data fo r more than 300 monitoring sites gathered over nineyear period concluded that use of oxygenated fuels was associated with 14 reduction in ambient co concentrations7 healthrelated questions the improvements in measured air quality have not come without questions after oxygenated fuels containing mtbe were introduced residents in several cities complained of variety of health effects from exposure to mtberfg exhaust headaches dizziness nausea sore eyes nd respiratory irritati on some complaints centered around the use of mtbe in cold w eather two of the principal areas noting complaints were alaska and milwaukee wisconsin the interagency task force examined these complaints and concluded with regard to exposures experienced by the general population and motorists the limited epidemiological studies and controlled exposure studies conducted to date do not support the contention that mtbe as used in the winter oxygenated fuels program is causing significant increases over background in acute symptoms or illnesses8 additional health effects research is being conducted by ep universities and others under the authority of section 211 of the clean air act epa has requested refiners to conduct health effects studi on conve ntional reformulated and oxygenated particularly mtbeoxygenated

on whether mtbe has the potential to cause cancer although there are studies on the carcinogenicity of mtbe in humans epas office of research and deve lopment ord reported in 1994 that inhalation carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats show evidence of three types of animal tumors testicular liver and kidney these particular studies are difficult to interpret because of some highdose general toxicity nevertheless ord believes the inhalation carcinog enicity evidence would support placing mtbe in group c as possible human carcinogen9 also one metabolite of mtbe formaldehyde is considered probable human carcinogen and another metabo lite tertiary butyl alcohol tba induces male rat kidney tumors10 based on animal studies epa has concl uded that mtbe poses potential for carcinogenicity to humans at high doses however because of uncertainties and limitations in the data epa has been unable to make confident estimation of risk at low exposure levels11 the interagency task force assessing oxygenated fuels concluded that the weight of the eviden ce supports regarding mtbe as having carcinogenic hazard potential for humans12 in 1998 the international agency for re search on cancer iarc and the us national toxicology prog ram determined not to list mtbe as known human carcinogen the iarc noted that mtbe was not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity in humans based on inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals13 in 1999 californias nvironmental protection agency determined that the mtbe carcinogenicity studies were of similar quality to studies on many other carcinogens and tablished public health goal for mtbe in drinking water based on cancer risk14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32787crs7 15 us environmental protection agency

anderson test rule development branch re division director briefing fo r methyl tertbutyl ether mtbe april 1987 which notes that the tendency for mtbe to separate from the gasoline mixture into ground water could lead to widespread drinking water contaminationregarding noncancer effects california advisory committee determined that there was not clear scientific evidence to support listing mtbe as toxic substance affecting human developmen t or reproduction in reviewing the research on cancer and noncancer effects these groups generally noted that research gaps exist and that the data were particularly limited on health effects associated with mtbe ingestion in response to the need for research to evaluate the potential health risks from exposure to mtbe and other oxygenates in drinking water epa in 1998 published document that identified the most critic and immediate research needs the document was intended to serve as guide to planning future research however epa has not pursued research to addre ss the needs identified in this document15 for practical purposes the interpretation of any health risks associated with the addition of mtbe to gasoline could benefit from comparison to the health risks associated with conventional gasoline th interagency task force epa and some environmental groups have all argued th at current knowledge suggests that mtbe is less serious pollutant than the gasolin components it replaced according to the ostp report the cancer risk from exposure to mtbe is substantially less than that for benzene minor constituent of gaso line that is classified as known human carcinogen and more than 100 times less th an that for 13butadiene carcinogenic emission product of incomp lete fuel combustion16 such comparison might be of limited usefulness however given the data gaps regarding mtbes health effects and mtbes ability to reach water supplies more readily than conventional gasoline water quality and drinking water issues major issue regarding the use of mtbe concerns its detection in ground water at thousands of locations nationwide and us ually at low levels in various municipal drinking water supplies private wells nd reservoirs althoug h mtbe has provided air quality benefits the inclusion of mtbe in gasoline has been growing concern as an environmental risk since the 1980s for several reasons specifically compared to other gasoline components mtbe 1 is much more soluble in water 2 has lower taste and odor threshold 3 has high er transport rate nd 4 often requires more time to be remediated and must be treated by more complicated and expensive treatment technologies17 mtbe is extremely solubl and once released it moves through soil and into water more rapidly than other ch emical compounds present in gasoline once in ground water it is slow to biodegrade and is more persistent than other gasolinerelated compounds in rface water it dissipa tes more rapidlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32787crs8 18

mtbeuse areas and in 23 of samples in low or nomtbe use areas27 mtbe has been detected most frequently in ground water associated with leaking underground storage tank ust s ites the california environmental protection agency has estimated that based on monitoring information available for these sites mtbe can be expected to be found in shallow unused ground water at thousands of ust sites in the state and ofte n at high concentrations in the parts per million range28 moreover report by the lawr ence livermore national laboratory found that mtbe was not significantly degrading in the monitoring networks for these leaking ust sites29 the situation in other states may be similar in september 2000 survey of state leaking underground storage tank lust programs 31 states reported that mtbe was found in ground water at 40 or more of gasoline contaminated sites in their states 24 stat reported mtbe at 60 to 100 of sites30 2003 update to that survey found that averaged among the

some vary depending on the use of ground water some states apply these levels to groundwater cleanup at leaking undergr ound storage tank sites where ground water is used for drinking water 33 epa drinking water advisory p 2 epas responses to mtbe occurrence in water safe drinking water act initiatives mtbe has not been regulated under the safe drinking water act sdwa but to address concerns raised by the detection of mtbe in ground water and dr inking water supplies epa has pursued several initiatives in december 1997 the ag ency issued drinking water advisory for mtbe based on consumer acceptability for taste and smell epa issues drinking water advisories to provide info rmation on contaminants in drinking water that have not been regulated under sdwa32 advisories are not enforceable but provide guidance to water suppliers and ot her interested parties regarding potential health effects or consumer acceptability while the mtbe advisory is not based on health effects epa notes that keeping mtbe levels in the range of 2040 gl or lower for consumer acceptability reasons woul d also provide large margin of safety from adverse health effects specifically the advisory states that concentrations in the range of 20 to 40 gl are about 20000 to 100000 or more times lower than the range of exposure levels in which cancer or noncancer effects were observed in rodent tests this margin of exposure is in the range of margins of exposure typically provided to protect against cancer effects by the national primary drinking water standards under the federal safe drinking water act this margin is greater than such standards typically provided to protect against noncancer ffects thus protection of the water source from unpleasant taste and odor as recommended will also protect consumers from potential health effects33 in addition epa has taken steps that could lead to the development of an enforceable drinking water standard for mtbe in february 1998 epa included mtbe on list of contaminants that are potential candidates fo r regulation under the safe drinking water act compounds on the contaminant candidate list are categorized as regulatory determination prio rities research priorities or occurrence priorities because of data gaps on mtbe health effects and occurrence epa placed mtbe in the category of contaminants fo r which further occurrence data collection and health effects research are priorities thus while epa has not selected mtbe for regulation to date the agency is pursuing research to fill the existing data gaps so that regulatory determination may be made the safe drinking water act also dir ected epa to publish rule by august 1999 requiring public water systems to conduc t monitoring for list of unregulatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32787crs12 34 64 federal register 50555 september 17 1999 the law requires monitoring by all large public water systems serving more than 10000 people and requires

200134 the occurrence data generated under th unregulated contaminant monitoring rule combined with the results of ongoing health effects studies are intended to provide information needed by epa to ma ke regulatory determination for mtbe under sdwa the next round of regulatory determinations w ill be made in 2006 epa typically requires roughly three and onehalf years to promulgate drinking water regulation thus the earliest epa woul d be expected to issue drinking water regulation for mtbe is 2010 underground storage tank regulation key epa and state contamination prevention effort involve s implementing the underground storage tank program established by the 1984 amendmen ts to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra under this program epa has set operating requirements and technical standards for tank design and in stallation leak det ection spill and overfill control corrective action and tank closure as of 1993 all ta nks were required to comply with leak detection regulations additionally all tanks installed before december 1988 when standards for new tanks t ook effect were required to be upgraded replaced or closed by december 22 1998 federal and state regulators anticipate that as tank owners and operators comply with these requirements the number of pe troleum and related mtbe leaks from ust systems should decline significantly however mtbe has been detected at thousands of leaking tank sites and this additive is proving more difficult and costly to remediate than conventional gasoline ke concern for states is that as testing increases it is likely that the number and scope of needed cleanups may increase as well 2003 state survey found that many s ites have not been tested for mtbe and most states do not plan to reopen previ ously closed leaking underground storage tank lust sites to look for mtbe alt hough 32 states reported that mtbe plumes are often or sometimes longer than pl umes from conventional gasoline leaks35 key concern for community water suppliers and well owners is that fewer than half of the states are taking steps to ensure that mtbe and other oxygenates are not migrating beyond standard monitoring boundaries for

reduction in the use of mtbe she also stated her commitment to work with congress for targeted legislative solution that maintains our air quality gains and allows for the reduction of mtbe while preserving the important role of renewable fuels like ethanol40 on march 20 2000 the former administrat or announced that epa would begin the process of issuing regulations to redu ce or phase out use of mtbe recognizing that this process could take several years to complete she renewed her call for congressional action to amend the clean air act to provide the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of mtbe to ensure that air quality gains are not diminished and to replace the exis ting oxygen requirement contained in the clean air act with renewable fuel standard for all gasoline41 in its few public statements on mtbe the bush administration has not indicated any change in the clinton admin istrations policy although epas effort to regulate mtbe using its existing authority slowed noticeably and now appear to have been terminated five years afte r epa began the development of regulations to reduce or phase out mtbe the agency quietly published note in the

public hearin gs governor davis issued finding that on balance there is significant risk to the environment from using mtbe in gasoline in california and required the states energy commission to develop timetable for the removal of mtbe from gasoline at the earliest possible date but not later than december 31 2002 this date was am ended in march 2002 to december 31 2003 the governor also required the ca lifornia air resources board carb to make formal request to us epa fo r waiver from the requirement to use oxygenates in reformulated gasoline and required three state agencies to

june 2004 updated july 2005 by crs alternatives to mtbe the major potential alternatives to mtbe are other oxygenates oxygenates possess several advantages in cluding high octane and the ability to replace toxic components of conventional gasoline oxygenates that could replace mtbe include ethers such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe and alcohols such as et hanol these other oxygenates may pose health and environmental impacts but inadequate data make it difficult to reach definite conclusions epa s blue ribbon pa nel concluded the other ethers eg etbe tame and dipe have been less widely used and less widely studied than mtbe to the ex tent that they have been studied they appear to have similar but not identical chemical and hydrogeologic characteristics the panel recommends accelerated study of the health effects and groundwater characteristics of these compounds before they are allowed to be placed in widespread use46 ethanol and other alcohols are consid ered relatively innocuous on their own they generally do not persist in ground wate r and are readily biodegraded however research suggests that the presence of ethanol in gasoline plume can extend the

ethanol the most likely substitute in reports approved in janua ry 2000 the agencies concluded that if ethanol were substituted for mtbe there would be some benefits in terms of water contamination and substantial effects on publichealth impacts of air pollution48 more recent article based on the california ethanol review focused specifically on the relative risks of ground wa ter contamination by spills of ethanol blended gasoline mtbeblended gasolin and nonrfg gasoline the authors concluded that relative to risks associated with standard formulation gasoline there is an increase in the risk that wells will be contaminated by rfg using either mtbe or ethanol as an oxygenate emphasis added with ethanol the risk of contaminating wells decreases after approximately five years however the risk continues to grow for mtbe because of the assumption that this chemical is not degraded in the subsurface the conservative approach used in this analysis including the low biodegradation rates and assumption that the gasoline source areas are not remediated results in an ov erstatement of the risks associated with these additives to gasoline neverthele ss the relative trends do favor ethanol when considering risk associated with rfg spills49 the switch from mtbe to ethanol is not without technical problems as well ethanol costs substantially more to produce than mtbe and it poses challenges to the gasoline distribution system it separates from gasoline if transported long distances by pipeline so it must be mixed with nonoxygenated gasoline blendstock close to the market in which it is to be sold50 because most ethanol is produced in the midwest whereas most rfg is consumed on the east and west coasts transportation of ethanol to markets poses logistical problems and

elements as result controls on the use of mtbe and liability for cleanup of mtbe in ground water and drinking water w ill be left to the states and the courts respectively the reasons why these provisions were left out of the final version are complicated the conferees faced time pr essure as the result of white house demand that energy legislation be delivered to the president by august 1 for that deadline to be met the conferees needed to reach agreement on range of issues quickly the safe harbor and the provisi ons on the phaseout of mtbe described in more detail below were not amenable to quick compromise thus the path of least resistance was to remove them in the enacted version congress did address two issues that w ill affect future mtbe use the act removes the clean air

however mt be manufacturers and those who blend fuels would likely have been more difficult to reach under these other bases of liability56 state attorneys general local governme nts and drinking water suppliers noted that providing products liability shield would effectively leave only gas station owners liable for cleanup and because th businesses often have very limited resources the effect of the safe harbor pr ovision would have been that the burden for cleanup would fall to local communities dri nking water utilities and the states in light of this the congressional budget ffice
