in the past to see if any increase in dues is necessary i have misplaced cheque for dues and brother metcalfe will approach the brother to have it replaced you will also notice decrease in postage this year due to the emailing of monthly notice papers we have on hand 425 prestamped envelopes which should be enough postage to cover us until october 2008 entertainment account this account

increases in our number of dinners we all know that these events are of great benefit to the social life of our lodge this year we have also made another investment and put 350000 into money m aster
