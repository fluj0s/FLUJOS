policy division january 11 2008 abstract this report reviews the various databases that provide information on layoﬀs it then more closely examines results from the abovedescribed bls program in brief the bls series shows that outsourcing particularly of work moving oﬀshore is uncommon in extended mass layoﬀs and accounts for fairly few separated workers relocation of work most often occurs within the united states and within the same company most workers separated in extended mass layoﬀ events involving domestic or oﬀshore outsourcing had been employed by manufacturers employer restructuring bankruptcy business ownership change ﬁnancial diﬃculty and reorganization within company typically accounts for majority of these layoﬀs as well in extended mass layoﬀs associated with the movement of

but the form of unemployment that policymakers have shown they are most concerned about involves workers who have involuntarily lost jobs through fault of their own unemployment through layoffs ebbs and flows with the business cycle but involuntary job loss is everpresent because firms displace workers for reasons other than temporarily weak demand employers also layoff employees for reasons specific to the firm or the industry in which the firm lies eg corporate restructuring and seasonality one means of restructuring worknamely outsourcinghas spread from employers contracting out functions to other affiliated or nonaffiliated employers in the united states to employers contracting out activities to affiliated or nonaffiliated employers located outside us borders the latter business practice is referred to as offshore outsourcing or offshoring offshoring is driving much of the current interest in job loss and economic insecurity more generally it also is driving the demand for statistics on the number of employees who have lost their jobs because firms decided to move work abroad as result of an internal corporate reorganization or financial difficulties for example database exists that provides anything approximating complete count of workers separated from payrolls because their company relocated their functions beyond us borders starting in middecade the us bureau of labor statistics bls mass layoff statistics program began to query firms in the private nonfarm sector that call longlasting largescale layoffs about whether these events involve the offshoring of work in addition to excluding layoffs at small firms and in the public sector the series does not cover layoffs in which fewer than 50 employees are terminated it thus likely to understate layoffs associated with offshore outsourcing generally and with those involving whitecollar workers in the service sector particularly eg accounting clerks at financial services firms radiologists at medical services providers this report briefly reviews the various databases that provide information on layoffs it then more closely examines results from the abovedescribed bls program in brief the bls series shows that outsourcingparticularly of work moving offshoreis uncommon in extended mass layoffs and accounts for fairly few separated workers relocation of work most often occurs within the united states and within the same company most workers separated in extended mass layoff events involving domestic or offshore outsourcing had been employed by manufacturers employer restructuring bankruptcy business ownership change financial difficulty and reorganization within company typically accounts for majority of these layoffs as well in extended mass layoffs associated with the movement of work offshore jobs most often are shifted to mexico and china

develop in number of ways such as an individual reentering the labor force and being unable to immediately find job or person quitting job at one firm before having obtained job at another firm the form of unemployment that policymakers have shown they are most concerned about occurs when businesses layoff employees congress has demonstrated its desire to help workers who have involuntarily lost their jobs through fault of their own and are presumed to face an indeterminate spell of unemployment by its provision of income support under the unemployment insurance ui program and the trade adjustment assistance taa program training for dislocated workers under the workforce investment act wia and taa and advance notice of mass layoffs and plant closings under the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn although involuntary nofault displacement from jobs is always with us this form of unemployment increases when the economy is sluggish and decreases when the economy is robust in other words there is cyclical component to layoff activity however firms lay off workers not only due to temporarily weak demand throughout the economy but also due to factors specific to them or their industry eg company reorganization and seasonal work the current interest in involuntary job loss springs from the practice of us firms sending work to firms located in other countriescommonly known as offshore outsourcing or offshoring this report focuses on unemployment through layoffs it first briefly provides context for the offshore outsourcing phenomenon and its relationship to gross and net employment change the report next examines the available sources of data on layoffs to determine whether they provide information on the reasons that underlie those events it then analyzes the trend in severity of and explanations of extended mass layoffs the report concludes with discussion of those extended mass layoff events that involve movementofwork actions to other us locations of the company that has called the layoff to other us firms to foreignbased affiliates of the us company andor to foreign businesses

few decades been restructuring their operations to be more competitive in the global marketplace by downsizing their workforces outsourcing functions ranging from performing janitorial services to developing computer software to firms located within and outside the united states and utilizing contingent workers such as independent contractors and temporary workers the term downsizing was coined during the 1980s to describe practice among typically very large old economy manufacturers to become more efficient international competitors by each laying off thousands of employeessometimes in multiple rounds of mass layoffsand closing entire facilities since then downsizing has spread to new economy manufacturers eg computer hardware producers and to companies in the service sector eg telecommunications firms and financial enterprises httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30799g23g151g142g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g22g145g155g152g158g144g145 g561g14g138g162 g152

spread from relocating work to other companies in the united states to moving work to firms located outside the united states it has been suggested that employers have been able to achieve efficiencies through offshore outsourcing due to improved internet telephone and transportation links with countries eg india whose educational systems have expanded the worldwide supply of welleducated workers who possess information technology it and other whitecollar skill sets1 as result the kind of us workers susceptible to involuntary job loss has changed whereas displacement once occurred primarily among traditionally layoffprone bluecollar factory workers the risk of job loss has increased among traditionally stable whitecollar workers consequently concern about job security has spread from bluecollar to whitecollar workers who make up the majority of all employees in the labor market by definition restructuring achieved through downsizing produces net loss of jobs at firms this is not necessarily the case at companies that utilize contingent workers or outsource work if these employers are laying off workers they may be hiring greater equivalent or lesser number of people overlaid on these ongoing changes in how firms organize their operations is the business cycle during the long economic expansion that characte rized much of the 1990s for example net job growth and layoffs occurred simultaneously according to data from the us bureau of labor statistics bls more than 20 million private sector nonfarm jobs were added between 1991 and 2000 nonetheless in 2000 employers permanently displaced almost two million workers from their private sector jobs through mass layoffs job losses usually have not persistently exceeded job gains at the national level thereby yielding net decrease in employment except during re cessions however after employment contracted by almost 300000 jobs in the private nonfarm ctor during the 2001 recession 19 million more jobs were lost than gained in 2002 2 in contrast although remaining high by historical standards the number of workers who permanently lost their private sector jobs through mass layoffs dropped by nearly 300000 in 2002 despite employment starting to grow during 2003 signaling the end of the jobless recovery the net change in employment for the year was negative some 400000 private nonfarm jobs in contrast the number of workers permanently displaced from their private sector jobs as part of mass layoffs continued to fall in 2003 not until 2004 did the private nonfarm economy record net increase in employment of almost 15 million jobs while the number of employees separated from payrolls through mass layoffs continued to trend downward

monthly survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived it includes question on reason for unemployment unemployed persons are categorized as job losers if they report they are on temporary layoff meaning that their employer has given them date to return to work or that they expect to return to their jobs within six months or they have permanently involuntarily lost their jobs individuals are not asked why they were laid off the other reasons for unemployment are having left job voluntarily having completed temporary job and newly entering or reentering the labor force in all cases the individual must currently be looking for job to be classified as unemployed thus if job losers become discouraged about their reemployment prospects and stop searching for work their reason for being jobless would not be tallied

reported source of information on substantial staff cutbacks has been announcements of impending actions that are issued by individual firms however several drawbacks exist in using the timely layoff announcements to gauge the actual circumstances of workers firms and communities companies make announcements about their expectations but these may or may not come to pass as planned although firms sometimes include statements in financial reports about how their restructuring plans have been implemented there is neither readily available nor comprehensive information on their actual outcomes in addition layoff announcements commonly are interpreted as calling for involuntary job cuts but some employees

accept transfers to jobs within their own firms or to reorganized entities moreover the announcement of layoff in given month does not mean that affected workers are displaced immediately or terminated as group instead layoff might involve varying numbers of people being released at different intervals over many months or years this scenario would have considerably less of an adverse impact on communitys labor market which could more easily absorb the displaced workers who had not found new jobs before their termination the impetus for issuance of these announcements was passage of the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn pl 100379 which went into effect in 1989 the act requires firms with 100 or more employees to provide notice to employees or their union representatives and to localstate government officials 60 days before initiating major layoff or closing plant because smaller businesses do not have to issue these notices some unknown number of mass layoffs cannot be detected from this source 3 comprehensive database of these announcements does not exist because there is legal requirement that the notices be filed with single entity some of these announcements are reported by the media or other informationgathering organizations these reports might include only the most newsworthy layoff events eg those involving the nations or geographic areas largest employers moreover these reports might not mention the hiring expectations of some of the same firms that issue layoff announcements there is likely to be considerable variability in what if any information is provided about the reasons for the anticipated layoffs

layoff or closing in light of the increased interest in offshoring and the lack of data bls began in 2004 to ask employers who called extended mass layoffs questions about whether movement of workeither within or outside the united stateswas as sociated with these events because the mls quarterly series excludes layoffs of government employees layoffs called by small firms and layoffs in which fewer than 50 employees are terminated it is likely to understate job loss associated with offshoring generally and job loss involving whitecollar workers in the service sector particularly eg accounting clerks at financial services firms radiologists at medical services providers thus database exists that provides anything approximating complete count of workers separated from payrolls because their company relocated their functions beyond us borders with these caveats the bls series shows that outsourcingparticularly of work moving offshoreis uncommon in extended mass layoffs and accounts for fairly few of the workers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30799g23g151g142g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g22g145g155g152g158g144g145 g561g14g138g162 g152
