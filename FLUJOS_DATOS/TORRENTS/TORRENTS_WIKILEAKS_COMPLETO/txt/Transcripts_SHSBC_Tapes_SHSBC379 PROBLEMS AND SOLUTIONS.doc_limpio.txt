problems and solutions lecture given on 21 april 1964 how are you doing today audience fine good this is the what audience twentyfirst of april twentyfirst of april and we have lot of wind blowing out here today twentyfirst of april ad 14 all right well youre going to get very complex offbeat lecture here today very complex very offbeat nothing simple today tired of talking about simplicities you just never seem to latch on talk to you about complexity here and see if we cant do so as you may know not contained in the body of scientology but standing aloof there are series of research maxims or data which i have really never bothered to collect youll find some trace of them in of all things dianetics evolution of science its got quite few of them in it its you know the rationale and the how of how you figure it out theres whole book that was devoted to this was excalibur is how you went about figuring it out and every once in while one of these things cracks through and you get grip on the put together of existence and that sort of thing which is extremely useful these things vary im not giving you big mystery these things vary all over the place they go from the sublime to the ridiculous one of the maxims ill give you an idea is take body of knowledge which has produced very bad effects and results and if thats the case then you move it out and dont pay any further attention to it take the one which is least productive of results and rule it out and you can eventually corral truth on this type of an approach lets take all those things that havent worked and lets throw them out see thats this type of data see and this is of assistance on analyzing cases you know like mad you do it all the time you say well this fellows been run on this and hes been run on that and hes been run on something else and nothing happened in those instances so it must be something else see well this can be done on broad philosophic basis but lets take something of an unworkability and lets throw it away now thats research datum doesnt sound like much does it but it has broad workability the reverse doesnt happen to be true because something has worked on case is reason it will work on all cases isnt that an interesting thing that is to say because something is true in one instance is reason its true in all instances youve got to have it applied in several instances and directions before you have any confidence in it thats one that an auditor misses all the time he gets tremendous win hes got recall being drunk see and he ran this on this old lady and she got tremendous send out of this whole thing and it gave him big win and now he fails to apply this little research datum this truth of the matter you see hes only gotten workability on one case here series of one and he has real idea yet whether or not that is applicable more broadly and yet out of the enthusiasm of his win he goes ahead and runs recall being drunk on this one and that one and the other one the village parson and all of these sort of things and he doesnt get any more wins with it you see so he feels very defeated well what hes done is fail to apply the other side of the thing just because it had workability in this instance is reason its broadly workable see thats the maxim that goes back of that there are lot of these lot of these theyre sort of idiots delight sort of things and rules of thumb by which you progress but once in while one of them turns up that has tremendous value and this may or may not have some value to you this lecture by the way is about levels this may or may not have some value to you as technical datum but it certainly has tremendous value as research datum to such degree that i was able to crack through some of the wildest webwork that i think i have ever gotten mixed up in with this you see you can get certain things to read on meter you get in the vicinity of create gpms let us just mention that in passing and you can get on monday this combination to read on tuesday this other combination to read on wednesday this other combination to read and on thursday you get an entirely new combination to read by that time youre pretty caved in so the only thing you can run on is whether or not youve got creak so you try then to rule out the creak and you go back over these things and it just gets to be one of the wildest swamps that you ever got mixed up in trying to pilot through the basic morass of the individual because you can get so many things that contradict so many things now in view of the fact that pretty welloff auditor i doubt very much could pilot his way through goals plot and still have pc sitting across from him pc would probably be dead by the time he got the goals plot halffinished and there wouldnt be any point in finishing it this is grim this is real grim i mean you see the tiger here hes got teeth see you get everything checked out and then it doesnt check out tomorrow see its something different and so i had to have datum which would pilot through this and i finally managed to tailor make datum which piloted through this and we get maxim that doesnt sound like very much to begin with but its its very very pervasive and that is problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions how many how many wild ramifications has this problem got well you want to know how many wild ramifications its got how many potential solutions has it got and that gives you an immediate index of how complex the problem is thats interesting isnt it all right well lets say this perhaps has some workability theres some more to this which ill just go into in moment but lets dispose of this first one first lets say this pc this possibly has use in the field of figuring out whats wrong with your pc so the pc comes in to you and hes been to the chiropractors and hes been to the doctors and last result last last last result why he went and saw something practically nobody who is decent would do he went and saw psychiatrist and he went even further downscale and he saw medico and hes taken up goodluck charms and so forth well all of this kind of thing dont you see is those are all potential solutions arent they potential solutions now medicine just gets rid of this fellow by saying hes hypochondriac and ive run into lot of hypochondriacs and they were sick they were sick enough to be worried about i remember one famous case of very dear lady and her husband was practically ruined through this he was quite famous writer and she always used to be worrying about her health and shed worry about her health and worry about her health and all of his writing friends and all of their wives simply wrote her off as hypochondriac and he was dearly devoted to her and doted on her and probably only the reason he kept on writing was because she encouraged him you know and she so on but nevertheless she was always worried about her health and everybody was very sure that she was hypochondriac labeled it as such brushed it all off as such right up to the moment when she up and died on them its quite interesting that was the end by the way of his career he went down and went to work for the government he started writing herbert hoovers reorganization of the government or something like that and he quit writing and the clique that this girl more or less held together all broke up and so forth but it left everybody absolutely stunned you know she was sick you know well she was some people are sicker than others and some people talk about it more than others you see and handy way of getting rid of it you see if you cant solve it or do anything for it yourself just say well hes hypochondriac you know and dust the whole problem off you see and in this case this was all very handy but the patient died do you see kind of grim look at the situation you get awful tired of somebody who keeps nibbling around and worrying about this that or the other thing and you get awful tired of this person they and so forth but the problem theyre presenting can be measured by the complexity of the solutions so this hypochondriac who has tried everything under the sun quote hypochondriac unquote hes probably hes actually got problem thats that complex do you follow that i mean theres that complicated thing wrong with him see you got the way this works this is another way of looking at it all right now this defeats forever the idea that youre going to slip somebody pill 62 and have an ot now you see the error this used to be introduced to about once week or once month and we even have clich√© that comes forward from that time its called oneshot clear see it means one process clear or something like that see and for years why i was interested in this particular line and everybody was always dreaming up with this beautiful dream all you did was sock somebody in the gluteus maximus with couple of ccs of whizzo or something you see and they immediately went bing wont ever happen why if this datum is true it never can happen in other words the problem theyve got is complex as the number of solutions that are pushed in its particular direction or have gone around its edges you see the problem of government then must be terribly complex because you think of the number of solutions look at the number of political solutions there have been to the problem of government well that gives you an immediate index of how complicated is this problem of government how complex problem is it well it must be terribly complex dont you see now this thing which has just one little old whizzo solution dont you see and it surrenders to that that must have been very simple problem in other words theres comparable line between the complexity of the problem and the number of solutions see it isnt the complexity of the solution its the number of solutions solutions quantitative and complexity in the problem i want you to differentiate that rather cleanly see its not big solution big problem see its complex in the problem and numerous in the solution see something you should look at so this tells you at once that when pc comes in there and sits down in the chair and you have to start running up the solutions to his case you see see and it isnt surrendering easily you always blame yourself on the basis you havent used the right process or something of the sort whereas you merely may be looking at this mechanism this is terribly complex case its very complex case and therefore is going to require numerous solutions do you see so youre just defeating yourself if you say youre going to run one process thats going to resolve this particular guys problem in life see youre defeating yourself because youre going to run that one process and thats not going to defeat his problem in life just make up your mind that if his problem in life has received many solutions then it is itself complex problem and will therefore require complexity of processes to resolve it see elementary all right and lets go on from there now solution must be as complex as the potentials of the problem theres the other whizzo here now lets look at it in reverse here how complex does solution have to be well it has to be as complex as the potentials of the problem in other words here is again not oneforone here you have the solution being complex dont you see this is another view were looking at another maxim the solution has to be complex because of the potentials of the problem you get the idea now what do you mean potentials well lets just take old survive this problem has this potential of knocking out of existence survival along various fronts or in various areas you see its threat see heres problem that is big problem so the thing to solve that you look for simplicity in the solution to solve this big threatening problem and heres the way you get defeated like that this bird comes in hes got this dangerous problem now were about dangerous problem see potential of problem dangerous potential he comes in and hes got this very dangerous problem you see theyre going to throw him out on the street tomorrow very dangerous going to throw him out on the street tomorrow and hes going to lose his job as result you see and hell probably be sued in court for something or other but he comes in and he tells you hes going to be thrown out on the street tomorrow all right now you give him simple solution you say well ill loan you five pounds or five bucks you see and you can pay your rent did you ever have it happen to you that you found out that he all of sudden told you then well yes but then how does this take care of maizie well what about maizie well shes pregnant you get it so youve set up defeat for yourself hes got dangerous problem you offer him simple solution thats an immediate way of setting up defeat for yourself youre going to be defeated in this you can sit and talk to these fellows eventually you say theyre completely ungrateful you just sit there and you give them solution after solution after solution and they cant seem to buy any of them because they always say well theres always this other thing too see and then theres this other thing too and then theres also this other thing too and then they finally shyly look at you and say well actually the reason they cant marry the girl is because theyre already paying alimony to wife elsewhere you see you never knew this either this all has to do with their being thrown out on the street tomorrow see this thing just travels miles in other words nothing ever really becomes dangerous problem which is very simple or the guy would have solved it in the first place problems only become dangerous that are quite complex they require then complex solution well what we have to do i guess is so forth and we your level of solution this guy is going to be thrown out on the street tomorrow and so forth well lets see maybe i could get you job with united fruit and we could change your name take little doing wed have to get you forged passport and then lets see i happen to know joe that will require that and you better in order to get financed for this you better rob bank tomorrow and so forth i mean you get the idea this thing is going to mount up into this if you were going to be real in your solution to match the thing see well its got to be this is dangerous problem if youre going to be real in your solution why give them real complex solution see its got to take care of all these ramifications this way and that and its put together the like of which because in order to become dangerous problem the thing had to coast practically into an unsolvable condition and therefore it must contain many quote unsolvable unquote points its quite amusing to look at advising human beings from the basis of these maxims see if you recognize those two maxims youd always be whiz this girl comes in and she says well im going to leave my husband im going to have to leave my husband because so forth things have gotten too tough for you to say at once like marriage counselor oh well i think we could just patch all this up you better watch it man because this is complex solution required here because thats dangerous problem well shes got two kids she has means of support shes going to leave the guy shes going to have home well lets just look at this look at what shes threatening to do here see it isnt just matter of blow dont you see its matter of shes got this very very dangerous problem she cant stay with him and cant go dont you see but this thing is pretty grim see not just grim in her own mind it must be that grim then your solution to that must be very complex so if you just say well ill just run little ow on him and her and then straighten it all out youre going to get yourself in for lose see because theres tremendous number of things surrounding that problem shes not saying well im mad at joe and im not going to serve him any supper see thats not very dangerous see it could be few pots and pans blow up but this is going to be bust up of some kind or another this is big stuff well marriage counselor always gets it when its right on the edge of the precipice dont you see so you offer any simple solution you know to this youre being fool and youre going to have big lose it necessarily requires very complex solution nice complicated solution so the thing you had better sit down and do is not give her little bing you know and say im going to do that sit down and find out all the items that have to be solved in this problem now that would be your real action how many how many angles to this are there see not just glib oh well ill just run little ow on it you can go home and so on theres this gertrude his former wife who is in tallahassee and then theres the matter of his mother and father and so forth and theyre bringing pressure on her mother in law because you see they own the mortgage on the house and you get the idea this thing builds up and youll just be stonied to find out how many dead ends see that there are in this thing its just big see its not little so if theres big problem dangerous problem and so forth then you can just count on the fact that this thing has tremendous number of little things begging to be solved out here in the woods that youre not aware of at all and we get that just out of this maxim here solution must be as complex as the potentials of the problem you can get yourself big win on this sort of thing you know this person comes in oh god theyre going to blow their brains out see well man thats pretty wild solution its all right for you to say all right hes in gpm destroy self all right thats all so well just fix that up and so on maybe so and maybe you would get to first base on it except for this the individual is not up to running at this level and the individual has personal pressures in his immediate environment which would distract his attention to such degree he probably couldnt sit still and what are we dealing with here were dealing at level 0 arent we so hes going to come in and hes going to blow his brains out good hes going to blow his brains out boy thats dangerous solution you know people get hurt doing that and you didnt get that gag and you just better decide at that point just better decide that this is begging for very complex solution very complex this solution is going to be awful complex by the time you get through with this threatened suicide my god this goes back to world war ii and the orphan asylum and the girl who is writing letters that unless and it goes to this and it goes to that and its something else and its over here someplace well why why get all worn out by saying well theres just one more see youre getting in the same frame of mind hes getting into just take your original assumption which is the correct assumption to begin with and then work with it well its very dangerous problem this guy is involved with well lets see how complex the solution is here lets just find out how many things have to be solved in this problem lets see lets roll them off here all right well all right lets begin youre going to blow your brains out good all right now now ahem whats the immediate and direct pressure thats causing you to do that he wont give you the immediate and direct but hell give you something or other well hes worried about his income tax he keeps figuring it out and the government keeps unfiguring it on him and so forth and you say all right very good well you say well theres got to be some solution to income tax is that it and you dont offer solution theres got to be solution to income tax for him oh yeah yeah but definitely has to be one all right fine now lets see whats the next one here is there anything take it by dynamics you see any group youre connected with or anything like that and so on oh well yes i havent paid my union dues and theyre going to beat up next week if i dont ive already been posted for being thrown out and of course that makes lose my job and that sort of thing ah well there has to be some solution there too how many how many of these are problems being beaten up is that all one problem or is several problems well being beaten up well thats problem yeah and uh yeah theres two or three problems involved there and id have to go and get job in some house that doesnt insist that it be union members and so forth and you been posted and so forth for your dues and that requires money that comes down to there all right now how many solutions do you think we have to have here and he adds it up see all right thats fine you got that out of the road all right now lets see is there any sex mixed up with this any sex mixed up with this threatened suicide oh well yeah thats what its all about thats what its all about and all right well how many things are there there and so forth and there has to be this and there has to be that and there has to be something or other oh all right fine now is there any other condition youre about to go up to the sixth dynamic you see are you going to lose your possessions or youre trying to hold on to possessions or yeah well i threequarters completed for the payments on all the furniture in the house and theyre going to take it away ah there has to be some solution to that doesnt there all right solution to the payments time payments on the house by the time you finish up youve got big sheet of paper here see its just scribbled all over but the funny part of it is he wont be blowing his brains out you didnt give him single solution you just said where theywere needed takes him out of the confusion of course because it puts up the buffer needed solution in front of every one of these problems dont you see and hell come down to it then and hell be able to think his way through to that and then you can pull it off well lets see we could start these things one by one couldnt we we could take these things one by which one of these things could be solved now and then run gradient scale on the thing straighten out his whole life see if you know this you could handle level 0 like breeze and level 0 is the rough one to handle man what makes it rough well these guys problems are so great they dont even know they got them thats how great that problem is this fellow is walking around in body he thinks hes an animal he doesnt even know hes spirit he doesnt even know his right name he doesnt even know where he is or what hes doing and he doesnt look at the fact of the importances in his vicinity at all hes looking at bunch of cotton pickin little pieces of nonsense here that wouldnt have anything to do with anything see level 0 this guys in trouble but thats the way it is thats life huh everybody else is like this so i couldnt possibly be in trouble because everybody else is like this see im not in trouble blah lah ruh ruh so you see his problem is so complex he doesnt even know hes in trouble solutions possible in any particular direction and the mans state is that way because solutions have been possible in any state all right now any time you dream up simple solution to complex problem youre going to go appetite over tin cup square on your cranial capital simple solution to complex problem nyaaaa this is how guys go politically bug eared see you got to have something complex as complex as the problem i want to point out to you that the international city international city and so forth you start looking at this confounded thing its terribly complex you start getting into complexities you see my heavens youre into economics and youre here and youre there and banking and boy this thing is complicated see well actually if you just blow up each one of its simple mentions into all the potential complexities youve got the size of the problem its trying to solve and it might have show now let show you the simple solution vote republican we have democrat in vote republican now that solves everything and thats all you got to do see and we have another four years with things just going worse see all right now the solution is to vote democrat get that republican out and get the democrat in that is the solution to all our affairs see the idiocy of the simple solution see complete idiocy first place youd have to go find statesman someplace i dont know where youd find him going to have to find him then you might set him up with big team of guys that had some inkling of what they were doing and they might figure out for little while and if they worked for year or two like beavers they just might be able to cut the fringe off of the problems that the country has they just might be able to come into some thing now all right this is levels do you recognize im talking to you about levels now as you go on up through the levels youre actually apparently confronting more and more complex problems and more and more complex auditing but that is not the case at all youre actually confronting less problems and you have less demanded solutions now previously people in motivation i mean psychoanalysis people have been asking for years do you have any contacts with industry or doing any work for industry i never really realized that they were asking psychologists and that sort of ilk whenever i ran into them and so forth i go slumming every once in while i have to admit it but theyre always asking theyre always asking if were doing work for industry i didnt quite understand what they were talking about until i read review of what psychology was doing for industry psychology is big business now because its moved in hand in glove with industry it is little bit into government but mostly into industry and its hiring and firing their employees for them and its selling all their goods for them and its telling them how to advertise and package their goods and thats what it is doing and that is all it is doing it isnt doing anything else for anybody its testing services and so forth are all in this line now thats where its money is coming from and of course were cutting their throat on testing by simply giving it free in several large cities this really upsets them the point here however is not any rant against the psychologist he after all has his cross to bear this bird is not even vaguely concerned with any of the problems of existence hes completely out of touch man but he thinks and the psychiatrist thinks that you go down in mans psyche now let introduce to you brandnew principle brandnew principle you dont go down through three levels of subvolitional unawarenesses and so forth to rock bottom motivation and that sort of thing the way theyve got it dreamed up see youre there man thats the one point theyve never grasped theyve not grasped that point the guy is there you have to go up through heightened awareness in order to progress through these deeper states as they call them in other words guy has got to be more and more aware of these various levels of awareness hes got to have better insight into existence before he can see it at all see in other words his perception has got to improve hes at the bottom rung of the ladder and the only route he has available is up he really doesnt have any down route left there isnt any hidden deep motivation all you have left is the individual and he is motivated you have motivated individual you dont have somebody who is unaware of his motivations he really is at point where he is motivating anything he is being motivated and that is it what are these areas now the psychologist and the advertiser and so forth trying to stir up these things which motivate the individual to that degree they are aware of this but they think that they are proceeding through lower levels of awareness of less awareness to reach these things these things are reached through heightened awareness in other words as they try to research to find out this is why they never get anyplace with processing why they dead ened in the whole field of therapy and actually jettisoned it it had been jettisoned if you want to know the truth of the matter now this fellow hasnt got an unconscious to be probed hes unconscious you see he hasnt got one to be probed he is simply the effect of all of this there isnt any place you go below his level of awareness they get this idea because person can go to sleep you see and they get this all mixed up with the fact that he can not be aware and be aware and theyve got sleep and awake which has nothing to do with it now they want to know what motivates this guy so they put him out further or they search deeper or they plumb into the hidden recesses of his hidden gone man hes the fellow thats hidden see theyre looking for the wrong thing theyre looking for the deeper areas of unconsciousness when as matter of fact they already have arrived there theyve got it sitting in the chair in front of them now in order to discover anything more about this individual at all you can only go up you cant discover more about this individual you see by putting him in deeper or something like this you see its hard for to make this point because its so ingrained in us that we go deeper all the time see now lets look at it from another point of view see youve got to make him more aware in order to find out anything about him at all so there is shortcut as we have eventually learned we even jettisoned dianetic reverie but there is shortcut by which you can get this guy half baked up on peyote or something like this so that you get to deeper level of awareness which you can then examine to find out whats wrong with him you see that as complete detour youre going exactly place ill give you the actual experiment on this thing you could run this experiment on almost anybody you say what have you been upset about lately or why are you nervous theres good one why are you nervous and then the fellow says uhh i i dont know am i nervous well you look so you keep going like this all the time uh well i i i i dont know i i didnt didnt do dont know whats making nervous i i if if i am nervous i dont know whats making nervous run this little test like this well what considerations have you had about your state run it for few minutes and then ask him whats making nervous and he tells you at once well thats very interesting because in other words you had to heighten his awareness by pulling charge off of this subject of his state of beingness and now he knows he can tell you well this isnt him going into his subconscious you see this is opening up little bit upper strata above him youve made his awareness little bit better so he can look better and youve gotten him up to point of where he can look at little higher condition of beingness and thats the route that you take with pc and you can very easily get terribly confused and upset by current nomenclature freudian nomenclature and current understanding about having to go into the lower levels of consciousness of the mind in order to there is spook theres bogy sitting down below you see its like on ship you see its like youd walk down through all the ladders of the engine room and you finally run into this black grimy character covered with coal dust and he is sitting there staring into huge roaring maw of fire and you say im looking for the fireman and he starts accommodatingly looking all over the whole fireroom to find the fireman you see this is the exact idiotic thing that theyre doing with regard to the mind see and he will be very accommodating hell go into every corner of that fireroom hell go all through the engine room hell look under the gratings hell look in the bilges and hell cheer you up on the road and everything else and hes looking for the fireman now if you were scientologist and you just ran few considerations about his identity see made him little bit more aware of things and so on hed say haha oh im the fireman you see whats going on here you see so we must be careful not to fall into this same parallel line of balderdash youre looking for mans spirit see great men will be very accommodatingly theyll accommodatingly walk with you almost every place to find mans spirit you see and there he is right there see hes it yet how many times have you had to explain to somebody were not interested in your soul you are your own soul see everybody says what i duh uh see thats the same gag as the fireman duplicate gag the guy is there see there are rungs try to go further south than the bottom plating of the ship theres ladder going down there because theres nothing there so the fellow is almost total effect he has lost his identity hes lost his true beingness hes associated himself with other things now youve got to increase his awareness to find out anything there is reason why and by the way ive made tremendous experiments in this particular direction in all ways and directions you cant shoot him full of scopolamine or truth serum or something like this or hypnotize him and ask him something or other all youd restimulate is the gpm to create the past or something like this you know and hell create nice past for you because hes less aware now than he was before so you reduce awareness you find less person and youre looking for the fireman and you already got him see and thats all there is there and youre at the complete bottom rung of the ladder all right now how do you get anyplace else this is your problem as the auditor see well there are seven levels up and these levels are determined only by this only by this an increased awareness of his beingness and his relationship to existence and the problems and solutions of life you just increase his awareness of this what is problem to this man and if you simply ask that of each one of the seven levels as you go up you could draw those levels very nicely what is problem to this man and when you raise him up the line in some horror you get up about four levels up oh yes hes calmer about everything now but he can take look at the problems he has got man hes better able to confront them so that he doesnt shudder with horror but if you were to pull him out of 0 and put him at level iv with one dull thud and say now look at look at the problems you really do have brother he is not going to be able to look at those problems at all one he has never climbed single line of the stairs because youve never increased his awareness of his relationship to existence only by increasing the individuals awareness of his relationship to existence can you bring about any heightened condition of ability performance livingness or anything else now this seems to be argued with by the fact that some guy can fill himself up full of bromo seltzer or heroin or something like that and perform very fantastic feats in some direction or other and you know i think theyre all fairy tales i did tremendous amount of research with drugs back in 49 50 and so forth and the only thing that ever happened people went to sleep ive never seen any of these marvelous experiments that i see written up with such glibidity i never see the results of these experiments i read all about them but scientific experiment is something that can be duplicated in laboratory and apparently none of these experiments so advertised can be duplicated in laboratory thats an interesting one isnt it yes you hear about this fellow he drinks half gallon of rum and therefore he can lift up horse you know ive seen guys drink half gallon of rum ive seen them think they could lift up horse i havent seen any horses rising off the ground man their coordination gets worse there are some writers that think they can write better when they have some drinks old dash hammett used to have ring one of these fancy service things that has shot glass in six or seven holes all in little wheel and all of the thing beautifully rigged up here so all you had to do was turn it around and you could pick out the next shot glass you know these little salon presentation pieces of stuff and he used to set that down at the side of his desk and when he would finish chapter hed pick up the next shot glass you see and down it and go so i heard all about this and how well he did it but i ran into some other writers that werent so good this way and one finally put the cap on the whole thing he says you know he says i cant write when i cant spell that actually wipes out the whole theory of how much better i write when guy thinks he writes better because hes less aware if he were little more aware hed realize that what he was writing stunk i dont know if youve ever risen in the middle of the night and written some deathless prose or poetry lets say your sense of appreciation was heightened by being half out see we hear about all these things but in actual performance and so forth we dont see these things get delivered we dont see the half drunk guy suddenly capable of magnificent feats of something or other and we dont see this and we dont see that but we see guys saying that they are this way so we can see here that theres bit of hole in some of the logic that is presented to us whereby if we just became little less conscious of everything why we would be lot better off well naturally that rationale is very current rationale because its been extant since the beginning of this universe and is probably the basic rationale that lies back of solutions to all problems is become unaware of them and that is the final solution become totally unaware theres one just before you become totally unaware and that is whatever youre doing makes you right regardless of how irrational what youre doing is its this last point of assumption that well youre doing right you see completely irrational action well just below that as the next solution down is simply become unaware thats gradient scale of solutions if you want to know the truth of the matter now where youve got then an individual who is trying to improve himself and so forth he has two routes open one is to become more aware of existence so as to cope with it and the other is to become less aware of existence become less aware and hope that you dont get run over or become more aware and be jolly sure that you dont so the dwindling solution the solution which is going out the bottom and so forth is full of hope full of lot of things but actually doesnt lead anyplace and it is very treacherous solution because it is simply hoping it will be all right well ill just forget about it and hope that it doesnt bother we see this type of philosophy if you want to know why you are overworried remember what you were worried about yesterday and realize that you arent worried about it today and im very glad that all the things i have been worried about never happened this kind of philosophy well its very witty philosophy but is it at all factual how do we know that that fellows worry and the actions he took as regard in relation to that worry did not prevent the total catastrophe see were not sure of that at all so this other solution is complete slipshod one and is hardly any solution at all which is just become less aware as one is standing there and the lion is charging down on one of course its always offered as solution faint see in the nineteenth century its practically the only solution womankind had she was not in position she was still in state of chattelism she was not in position where she could fight back in any particular way her word wasnt really very good in court and that sort of thing but she could still faint she fainted like mad and she fainted by degrees she camilled also so this is solution of sorts dont you see if you cant confront it and you cant move away from it why you can become unaware of it the black panther mechanism i think we used to call this in dianetics some such ignore it you see this is worse than the black panther mechanism this is just become unaware now therefore it becomes somewhat terrifying to people when you reverse the flow on them and this is one of the reasons why its difficult for you to do this although you can do this as an auditor very very easily its still sometimes quite terrifying and youll have some people wondering whether or not they should run out their gpms or something like this see almost anybody will hit that one you know youve got him running pretty good if about the third time you start to audit him he becomes not quite sure that this is good idea youre asking him to reverse the flow of the universe which is gradient unawareness this universe has simply been progress of less and less awareness its the route to the total sleep and the trick of the whole thing is its so rigged that you never get to sleep the lower you go the more problems youve got because now the littler problems seem bigger and nobody ever looks at this parallel route as they go down the route of unawareness actually their becoming unaware of the big problem brought them less power or force it reduced their confront and so now they are less able to confront little problem at that level so therefore it seems as big now as the big problem seemed and just one stage back and it seems far more dangerous and threatening and because it is whats the condition of some individual who because theres slight wind blowing goes into terror what is this condition you know theres little bit of wind blowing not much just little bit of wind and this individual is in white blanched terror well now lets map exactly what happened to this fellow there was some bigger problem on the same gradient that he ceased to confront he became unaware of it almost purposely and this put him into confront of slight wind see he came down to where he could only confront this little breeze but the big problem was full of terror so the breeze is full of terror and theres your trick when you uncover hidden memories and this is the big invitation to go uncover hidden memories because you often can uncover hidden memory and incidentally increase the individuals awareness slightly you see and uncover this memory by some kind of trickery and the individual will lose this particular little fear that he shifts over to another fear now and doesnt go any further than this is something they never really bothered to investigate well i could take almost anybody who had phobia and most of you too put them on the meter you old smoothie put them on meter and start figuring out well what are you afraid of you know oh youre afraid of this oh all right and lets just find the bigger fear that made them prone to the lesser fear this that im telling you then has direct application actually wraps up psychoanalysis freud can go back quietly to sleep in his grave this was what he was looking for this mechanism i am telling you right now is what he was looking for the only mechanism he was really looking for all little fears are irrational and are based on bigger fear thats what he considered see he said the little fear is irrational so therefore weve got to find the bigger fear that promotes the littler fear and he went off into all kinds of symbolism and everything else he got lost in the rat race he got lost in the maze before he got through but he nevertheless was on this thing now why does that work it works because the individual solved the bigger fear by becoming less aware thats the solution to the bigger fear and let tell you because ive practiced in the field of psychoanalysis you can throw the individual back into the bigger fear and knock him galley west you can sit here with your meter and you can smoke the whole thing out very carefully not processing him see not getting any charge off ta action or anything like that just sort it out on the meter this fear you have of cheesecakes now does this associate with your mother your father okay cheesecakes and so forth all right were you afraid of your father did your father ever eat cheesecakes and all of sudden the pc has got two directions to go one cognition he blows some charge you see and he feels better about it thats almost totally an accident from your point of view because im talking to you out of experience you can just as easily throw him over into complete gibbering terror and the reason why in psychoanalysis 33 13 percent of their patients commit suicide is because theyve put their foot into the wrong bin they have accidentally pressured the individuals awareness up to point of intolerance and the individual explodes without increasing his ability at all to become aware they suddenly confront him with the tiger and he goes boom see theres two things he can do one is suddenly blow some charge at this point becomes more aware and says oh ho im afraid of cheesecakes merely because the old man hit my mother over the head with some when i was two all right fine thats thats haha pretty good yeah oh thats thats very good yeah yeah feel much better now i dont have to be afraid of cheesecake i can be afraid of tiepins now see thats one route thats one thing that could happen to him but remember this other thing can happen to him too youre steadying him down youre saying father and so forth and mother all of sudden horrified look comes into his eye and he begins to shake whats the matter i dont know im really just terrified see you could play hell trying to push him any further down that track now he got some horrible idea oh my mother is dead and all of sudden he starts screaming and howling and goes into complete dramatization and crawls up in ball and you call the men in the white coats im not saying you could do this accidentally because you dont process this way im just giving you little bit of warning about processing this way reaching into the deeper states of consciousness in order to discover the fears that motivate this individual blooey thats from nowhere theres route because the dwindling spiral of consciousness has brought him to ignore his problems see and the bigger problems are less and less and less ah let give you practical example not boxing around with nothing here let give you very practical example first time i binged out of bean in recent times here and started looking around about three hundred miles up and that sort of thing i thought hey what do you know you know ho woo woo wait minute you know and arent these clouds high everythings fine you know and all of sudden problem hit about eight miles high see id forgotten about that this was one of the prices of freedom well it was totally unintentional getting out of ead anyhow see and it was just flip in that particular direction and we were taking off some charge in another area and i got hit in the face with problem that i had buried beautifully it had sod all over it i wasnt in any gradient up to being able to confront this problem see oh look im free hurray hurray im free everything is fine what the hell is that interesting see another instance of this id forgotten that some time ago id had fear of being drawn into the sun reverse light vector see id forgotten this completely unbraced all of sudden theres the sun here i come you know beams screech you know rubber burning whats this you know gradient see that was just being unwontedly brave now of course one ordinarily retreats the reason person exteriorized see and then went back into the head and you couldnt get them out again with can opener im giving you what exactly this mechanism is see without taking off the charge of why they were in their head you took them out of their head and they suddenly confronted the problems that they had long since dwindled down on unawareness so theyre longer aware of these problems they had those nicely handled you all of sudden bang him out of his head he all of sudden looks these problems square in the teeth like you know little things like how do you keep yourself centered in room i dont know i cant keep myself centered in the room i keep going one side of the room whats all this black stuff around here i didnt know i had all this black stuff around pang back into his head see or gee theres my body down there and my car is caught in traffic jam what am i going to do bang im liable to suddenly lose my car and lose my body too to hell with this racket you see hed forgotten that he had to retain certain skill to run body remotely see so back into his head he goes now you try to get him out of there again bluooh he knows better now ho ho he knows better hes smart now come on just one more time out of your he even sometimes gives you tremendous reality being outside just vivid see everything 3d and all set up man hes all set hes all roaring to go something like this happens to him you see he confronts some of the old problems that hed become unconscious of carefully he made himself less conscious so he wouldnt be aware of this problem he never solved that problem he just became unaware of it he took that line of solution see so back into his head he goes when he confronts that problem again only this time he now has the awareness that there was some reason this still sticks at him there was some reason he went into his head he cant quite spot what it is but there is some reason so now you give him the business you see you say to him all right but you had good reality on it while you were outside you know then that you are spirit that you are not body you know all this youve got this all ho ho i havent got any reality on that outside when was that when was that i didnt do it not not oh i know we thought something happened but probably just my imagination you ever have anything like this happen well now this is why this happens its the dwindling spiral of unawareness now youre all of sudden going to take this individual that youve walked down into the bowels of the ship and asked him wheres the fireman and he accommodatingly searched for two hours when he was it youre going to take this individual and you say all right its very nice in the crows nest you can see every place now were going to put you in the crows nest swump glump into the crows nest crows nests have their disadvantages they reel they are not warm they are lonely they are dark when one falls out of them one splashes you havent got him in that crows nest two minutes hes saying why hey look how nice it is around here you know hes saying gee whiz oo oo id forgotten there was such thing as the sea gosh you know and all this fresh air golly i coal dust in it hey what do you know and hes enjoying all this and all of sudden hes starting to look sort of haunted and he says take out of here and you say whats the matter oh dont bother with whats the matter take out of here you get him back down in the stokehold you could come down and offer him thousand pounds cash to sign on not back in the crows nest but even on the deck force and he wouldnt have anything to do with it what happened well actually he didnt become aware enough of what happened for him to really be aware of what happened he came to an area of something he didnt understand and this was alarming to him and he saw that his position was insecure and he was very unsafe and that he compared it to how safe he had been if uncomfortable down there in the bowels of the ship so hes now his vote is in with great big x on the ballot box for in front of furnace door coal dust everywhere i at least knew by experience that i survived there and i know that its impossible to survive in crows nest this is his total rationale in other words you put him into higher level of awareness there is deeper subconscious for the individual to go in you put him in this higher level of awareness one of the things he becomes aware of is the problems he has not handled so this alone makes it necessary for the forward progress of the individual to be by gradients and you can make it as long as you gave him chance to sit down occasionally and admire the new view in the first place hes victim of charge self created tremendously restimulated or quiescent masses of charge he is not aware of these things really at all but the second he becomes more aware he starts to get aware of them he doesnt really want anything to do with them so he ducks out on them again you do nothing about these things you do nothing about this charged up atmosphere you do nothing to take just take charge off what am i talking about im talking about you process this guy without tone arm action take charge off get tone arm action on this individual as he is getting tone arm action he gets about so much tone arm action hes moved up to new level of awareness having moved up to this new level of awareness hes able to look around and he is perfectly comfortable where he is actually the preclear who is progressing just looks little better and little better and little better it is not spectacular activity now youve got him up to point of where you can take more charge off per unit of time and the charge is more fundamental thats why you have levels now actually the charge which you can take off at one fell swoop at level iv would practically kill somebody if you tried to do anything about it at level 0 see now as they move up the line their problems are apparently greater their problems arent greater they can see better actually their problems are less and they are more capable of handling them and so it stays in better balance theyre more satisfied but they can handle more breadth of problem than they could before as they go up they can handle more problem the problem is less upsetting to them as they go down they can handle less problem and these problems are more upsetting to them thats just the awareness of the problem as you go up and down now the complex individual who requires the complex solution is the guy at level 0 there is the boy who has to have the complex solutions his problems are terribly complex and his solutions have to be numerous and the potentials of the problem are dangerous in the extreme to him and therefore the solution that is handed to him must be relatively complex now how do we get around all this just let give you this in very very rapid rundown here how do we get around this you know that solving somebodys problems doesnt do anything for him because the new solution becomes new malady the old solution is all he is sick from now everything is cure for cure cures cure cures its gradient scale of curing somebodys old cures i can tell you what fellow has been man wars man or something like this by his reaction to rum this was about the only cure he had it was cure for fear and it was cure for this and cure for that cure for being wet never had any dry clothes they just gave him drink of rum rum now turns on chills gives him cold and makes him terrified why it restimulates rising to the zone of these old problems which it cured so now you have to put him through course of treatment to cure him of rum now what gets us away from this its just this we are not giving people solutions what is the only thing that divorces us from this in processing how is it that we can get around this at all well its elementary how we get around it the basic error is the most fundamental part of the problem that can be asised the basic error that you want to asis is fundamental part of the problem because of this chain of solutions you as an auditor are attacking it at problems level you are not giving the pc new solutions for his livingness you are taking out of existence old solutions which now exist in the form of problems in other words youre asising past solvents youre asising what has been solved in the past youre taking him in the same direction up see see youre backtracking the same track he came down youre not giving him new solution to the condition he is in but youre taking out of his think the old solution which made him drop down and become more unaware youre taking this out of his perimeter of existence in other words youre not attacking the problem by giving the pc new solutions youre attacking the problem by asising old problems that they in their turn were solutions is beside the point from an auditors point of view just for simplicity simply attack the problems the fellows had well you run this gorgeously in what 1c 1cm r1cm and so on problems solutions what problems has he had what consideration what has he done about these problems what considerations has he had about these problems any such action as this and particularly how has he solved these problems what solutions has he had to these things and you start backing the guy up and youre actually backing him through yesterdays problems when you start running solutions on somebody youre running yesterdays problems see if you run it as problem you are running it below its point of awareness and it wont asis ill let you in on little trick here you have been told that you must not run problems at r1c well that is simply blunt technical statement and its perfectly true and valid and workable but lets ask what the devil is problem youre told that you can only run solutions on this person ah but whats solution solution is way you dont have to confront the problem and problem is something you dont want to confront by definition what is problem problem is something you dont want to confront thats why its problem so your effort to handle it is solve it in some way and when you solve it in the direction of becoming less aware of it or turning your back on it when that comes in as solution you have now moved into less levels of awareness so the way you as an auditor are backtracking this thing youre actually looking at yesterdays solutions and you start to ask the pc what problems have you had what problems have you had what problems have you had hes just saying this i couldnt confront that i couldnt confront this other i couldnt confront and so you dont get any meter see you dont get this but you say what solutions have you had hes saying this problem and this problem and this problem that i could confront do you see that its the difference between running confront and running confront see todays problem was yesterdays solution so you inevitably are running solutions regardless of whether you call them problems or not but if you call them problems then youre saying the individual couldnt confront them if youre saying solutions then youre saying he could confront them you see this you got to backtrack this boys solutions because then youre getting rid of the problems which he set up so that he couldnt confront anything and this is how this all degenerated so youre actually cutting in at an entirely different area youre cutting in at the solutions the fellow has had which of course in their turn were problems and therefore processing can solve the way back up the whole track you see and he becomes more and more aware hes more and more capable of confronting so therefore these terrifying things you know like going out and seeing the street these terrifying things are less and less terrifying to him and whats the final there he just graduates up through these various levels of awareness up to point of where he can confront the problems that made him start getting unaware in the first place and he finds those in turn were solutions so there hes all set and he moves on out to freedom and this is the route to freedom through becoming more aware its expressed on your tone arm its expressed on the fact that youre attacking the various solutions of the past and this holds through even to gpms at class vi what were these things but very complex solutions extremely complex solutions well there must have been hell of problem back of it man thats obvious there must have been quite problem back of all that well the problem back of all that and so forth was only problem because the individual wasnt confronting it so he took an extraordinary solution way out called gpm it was pretty wild thing to do but theres where the areas of confront go now he got himself so thoroughly bogged down in all the charge and mass that his chances of becoming aware enough to even know what this problem was became very remote indeed if he were suddenly to walk back and face this old problem hed fold up like tent with its tent peg pulled crash just ask him go ahead and face this old problem hhahh you say get rid of these gpms you got rid of the charge now which were the solutions and all of sudden he suddenly turns around and confronts the problem that he had hell confront that portion of it that he can confront you start handling this and work him through that and he can confront more and more of it and then hell finally laugh at himself but thats what levels are thats why theyre there and it just behaves on this basis on the operating principle that the individual at any given time is at his lowest level of awareness matter what level hes in and youve got to walk him up into further awareness further comprehension understanding for him to be able to hold his own in the environment that he has now entered thats the rationale of levels and why you bring the individual back up thats how to process an individual thats how you keep from stampeding an individual in some particular direction that also explains why you occasionally turn on manic on pc oh its wonderful every wonderful and three days later the pc collapses he was put in there too fast too quick with too much you see you dont need tougher processes now see you need more adroit use of the processes youve got and you walk an individual up this track he might tell you he wants to become ot tomorrow but thats solution whats an ot its person whos totally unaware of anything and has buttoned the problem up you see how that would work so when we when we look into this when we look into this we see how an individual can be made better how an individual can recover and we see the direction were trying to put him and we see that trying to put him there in disorderly fashion and not knowing what were doing would arrive at very little gain for the individual and lot of loss for the auditor if you just realize that youre simply increasing the individuals level of awareness youre getting off the charge which debars him from confronting the problems which he had deserted and if you look at it from that point of view with that degree of simplicity then it doesnt matter how complex problem is it doesnt matter how complex the solution is but always remember that problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions and the man down there in the firehold youd be surprised how many solutions it takes to keep him alive and keep him going man theyre just fantastic these start to drop off as you walk the individual back up the most complex being that you confront is the pc at his lowest level and therefore this requires the most complex solutions but you bypass that as an auditor by having the key to the gates you start getting rid of the solutions he has had and therefore the complexity of the solutions he is now adding on reduces reduces because the problem all the time is less and less complex see reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions and this is how processing works and this is what handles it and this is the direction you steer it if you steer it in any other direction you will have severe loss but this way if you understand it this way then let add one little point here now the thing it takes to drive this home real good is to ask that little proposition i gave you ask some individual for an answer to something he wont give you the answer then take some charge off his considerations or solutions hes had to it and then ask him again for that datum and hell give you the datum well how come he could give you the datum now when he couldnt give you the datum then he was barred from the datum before he had retreated from the datum before you raised his level of awareness you got the charge off you got him upped his confront upped his awareness and he all of sudden could give you the datum nothing is more positive than this than trying to get an individual to understand an item or something like this in gpm you start this one and the guy will sit there how do dogs bring about masters you know i couldnt imagine that what do dogs have to do with masters dogs dont have anything to do with masters and so forth doesnt dogs doesnt bring masters oh it doesnt make any sense to at all dogs masters connection connection whatsoever you say what considerations have you had about it in other words what solutions have you had to this and what have you been doing about it and you run this for few minutes and say all right would dogs bring about masters he says of course you fool anybody would know that well you say what was that all about well what that was all about very simple thing overcharged area too mucked up with solutions guy couldnt think he couldnt see couldnt be aware in that particular area and for you to get him anywhere at all you had to take him through the charge so the road out is not by spectacular open sesame or wave the wand or something like that you take them back out through the charge they came down to avoid whats that charge consist of it consists of the solutions they had to other charge they couldnt avoid they didnt want and became unaware of see so the road into this universe is successive unawarenesses and the road out is successive awarenesses but not just bare breasting your chest to the whole universe you have to find out why the individual didnt want to be aware at those points and he didnt want to be aware because he solved it well whats this solution well that was yesterdays problem yesterdays solution problem solution problem solution theyre all the same line of cat he got himself into trouble by solving himself into trouble and when he has solved himself all the way into trouble totally hes here and hes the fireman down in the stokehold and therefore there are lower levels of subconscious for you to explore there are only upper levels of awareness thank you thank you
