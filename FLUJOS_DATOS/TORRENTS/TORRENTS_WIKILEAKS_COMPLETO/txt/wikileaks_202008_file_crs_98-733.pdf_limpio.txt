radical extremist and terrorist financier usama bin laden pharmaceutical plant in sudan making critical nerve gas compone nt was destroyed as well this is the first time the us has unreservedly acknowledged preemptive military strike against terrorist organization or networ k this has led to speculation that faced with growing number of major attacks on us persons and property and mounting casualties us policymakers may be setting new direction in counterterrorism more proactive and global policy less constrained when targeting terrorists their bases or infrastructure questions raised include what is the nature and extent of any actual policy shift what are its pros nd cons and what other policy options exist issues of special concern to congress include 1 us domes tic and overseas preparedness for terrorist attacks and retaliatory strikes 2 the need for consultation with congress over policy shifts which might result in an undeclared type of war and 3 sustaining public and congressional support for long term policy which may prove costly in dollars b initial upfront loss of human lives and c potential restrictions on civil liberties whether to change the presidential

sudan identified by us intelligenc as precursor chemical weapons facility with connections to bin laden was hit as well the united states has bombed terrorist targe ts in the past in retaliation for antius operations libya in 1986 following the berlin disco bombing and iraq in 1993 as response to plot to assassinate former pr esident bush and an increasingly proactive law enforcement policy has resulted in bringin g roughly 10 suspected terrorists to the us for trial since 1993 however this is the first time the us has given such primary and public prominence to the preemptive not just retaliatory nature and motive of military strike against terrorist organization or network this may be signaling more proactive an d global counterterrorism policy ss constrained when targeting terrorists their bases or infrastructure 1 is there policy shift and what are its key elements the proactive nature of the us response if official administration statements are to be taken at face value can readily be interpreted to signal new direction in anti terrorism policy series of press conferences tv interviews and written explanations given by administration officials reveal what appears to be carefully orchestrated theme that goes well beyond what could characterized as onetime isolatedshowofstrength statements defense secretary william s cohen in words similar to those of nationa l security adviser sandy berger characterized the response as the long term fundamental way in which the united states intends to com bat the forces of terror and noted that we will not simply play passive defense secretary of state albri ght stressed in tv interviews that we are involved in long term struggle this is unfortunately the war of th future and national security adviser sandy berger stressed in public medi appearances that you cant fight this enemy simply in defense you also have to b prepared to go on the offense in what some see as warning to other terrorist groups who may seek weapons of mass destruction president clinton in his august 20 statementthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98733crs3 see for example the policy we are ready to act again editorial by defense secretary2 william s cohen washington post august 23 1998 p c1 and us hints at more strikes at binladen by eugene robinson and dana priest washington post p a1 august 22 1998 an excellent series of excerpts from press conferences and tv interviews by administratio n officials which could be used to support the premise of policy shift are found in the pb s television series jim lehrer newshour report of august 25 1998 see also new rules in new kind of war by peter grier and jonathan s landay christian science monitor august 24 1998 p1 from mart has vineyard gave as one of four reasons for ordering the attacks because they are seeking to develop chemical weapons and other dangerous weapons 2 statements aside the fact remains that this is the firs t time the us has 1 launched and acknowledged preemptive strike against terrorist organization or network 2 launched such strike within the territor of state which presumably is not conclusively actively and directly to blame for the action triggering retaliation 3 launched military strikes at multiple terrorist targets within the territory f more than one foreign nation and 4 attacked target where the avowed goal was n ot to attack single individual terrorist but an organizational infrastructure inst ead moreover in the case of the facility in sudan the target was characterized as one that poses longer term danger rather than n immediate threat inherent in admini stration statements and actions are allusions to terrorism policy which in response to immediate casualties and global vision of higher levels f casualties is 1 more global less defensive and more proactive 2 more nationa l security oriented and less traditional law enforcement oriented 3 more likely to us military force and other proactive measures 4 less likely to be constrained by national boundaries when sanctuary is offered terrorists or their infrastructure in instances where vital national security interests are at stake and 5 generally more unilateral when other measures fail particularly if other nations do not make an effort to subscribe to like minded policies up front policy with such element s can be characterized as one shifting from long term diplomatic economic and law enforce ment approach to one which more frequently relies on employment of military force and covert operations implied in such policy s hift is the belief that though terrorism increasingly poses threat to all nations all nations may not sign up with equal commitm ent in the battle against it and bear the full financial and retaliatory costs of engagement in such an environment the aggrieve d nations with the most at stake must lead the battle and may need to take the stronges t measures alone what are the pros and cons of such shift arguments in favor of proactive deterrent policy such policy 1 show s strength and w orld leadership ie other nations are less inclined to support leaders that look weak and act ineffectively 2 provides disincentives for other would be terrorists 3 is more costeffective by thwarting enemy actions rather than trying to harden l potential targets waiting for the enemy to strike and suffering damage 4 may truly damage or disrupt the enemydry up his safehavenssources of funds and weapons and limit his ability to operate and 5 provi des governments unhappy with the us response an incentive to pursue b ilateral and multilateral diplomatic and law enforcement remedieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98733crs4 see covert action an effective instrument of us foreign policy crs 96844f3to remain active players arguments against proactive militarycovert operation s oriente d deterrent terrorism policy such policy 1 undermines the rule of law violating the sovereignty of nations with whom we are not at war 2 could increase rather than decrease incidents of terrorism at least in the short run 3 leaves allies and other nations feeling l eft out or endangereddamaging future prospects for international cooperat ion 4 may be characterized as antiislamic and 5 may radicalize som elements of populations and aid terrorist recruitment and 6 may result in regrettable and embarrassing consequences of mistaken targetting or loss of innocent life what other policy options exist the us government has employed wide array of policy tools to comba t international terrorism from diplomacy international cooperation and constructiv engagem ent to economic sanctions covert action protective security measures an d military force implementation of policy is often situationdriven and military response is more likely in close time proximity to terrorist attack when public world outrage i s high and credible accountability can quickly be established when combating nonstat sponsors of terrorism like bin laden s networks direct economic or political pressure on sanctuary states and indirect pressure through neighboring states may be an effectiv policy tool in restricting activities and sanctuary locations as well creating favorabl climate for legal approaches such as criminal prosecution and extradition which is gaining prominence as an active tool in bring terrorists to trial working with other victim states through the and the organization of african unity are options which would build on the march 1996 sharm alsheikh peacemakerterrorism summit enha nced intelligence targeting of nonstate amorphous groups and intelligence coordination and sharin g among agencies governments and with the private security community is critical bu t mechanisms to achieve such intelligence objectives must be in place all agree that more effective human intelligence sources must be develo ped in this regard other nations such as saudi arabia and kenya may be more effective in penetrating terrorist groups than the us another option is not to overpersonal ize conflicts against terrorist organizations and networks publically focusing on individuals lik bin laden instead of on their networks or organizations too often glamorizes such persons drawing funding and recruits to their cause and misses the purpose of countermeasures eg disabling terrorist capabilities enhanced unilateral use of covert operations though not without downsides holds3 promise as an effective longterm policy alternative to high profile use of military force seeming indust rial explosion at factory believed to be producing nerve gas chemicals draws less formal criticism and political posturing by other nations than an openl announc ed missile attack the dangers here are that the united states is not especiall competent at secretkeeping and that counterterror can be misequated to terrorism effective use of covert policy alternatives requires institutionalization of covert actio n capability tapping into the best that each agency has to offer in world where stat sponsor ship for terrorism is drying up private funding becomes critical to the terroris t enterprise terrorist front businesse s and banking accounts could increasingly become the target of creative covert operations to support such efforts and effective w enforcement oriented approaches to curbing money flows assisting personnel in othe r countries in tracing and stopping money flows to terrorists their organizations and fronthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98733crs5 see terrorism the media and the government perspectives trends and options fo r4 policymakers by raphael perl crs report 97960 f key question here is whether afghanistan should be on the terrorism list in light of the5 talibans enhanced consolidation of control over the country and its harboring of binladen and associated terrorist groups facilities and individuals g iven the wild west nature of afghanistan today is it fair to hold afghanistan liable as viable country for state action also would such action legitimize the taliban government which so far only 3 nations have recognized man suggest that diplomatic initiatives and the threat of sanct ions and further military retaliation against the talibans harboring known terrorists and supporting or countenancing terrorist trainin g activity on their soil will continue to prove to avail should such assertions bear out then strong argument can be made that the adminis tration pursuant to section 6 j of the 1979 export administration act pl 9672 must place afghanistan on the department of states list f countries supporting terrorism list impos ed would be restrictions of foreign aid and severe export controls on dual use and military items see also crs report 98722f previously cited companies may warrant consideration socalled grey area or black area information operati ons which bring to light vulnerabilities in the personalities of key terrorist leaders ie corruption deviant sexual behavior drug use promote paranoia and inter organizational rivalries warrant inc reased attention as well one can assassinate person physically only once but character ssassination in the media can be done daily us4 terrorism policy lacks multifaceted information offensive aspect which is not merel reactive in nature issues for congress issues of special concern to congress include 1 us domestic and oversea s preparedness for terrorist attacks and retaliatory strikes 2 the need for consultation with congress over policy shifts which might result in an undeclared type of war and 3 sustaining public support for longterm policy which may prove costly in dollars b initial clearly seen loss of human lives as well as c p otential restrictions on civil liberties whether the presidential ban on assassinations should be changed and whether afghanistan should be placed on the terrorism list warrants consideration as well5 an important issue brought to the forefront i n the wake of the us military response to the august 7 1998 embassy bombings is that of us preparedness for domestic and oversea s terrorist and retaliatory attacks there is absolute preparedness determined terrorist can always find soft target somewhere thus advance intelligence is perhaps the most critical element of preparedness good working relationships wit h foreign intelligence services are important here other key elements of preparednes s include 1the ability through law enforcement channels and covert means to activel thwart terror ist actions before they occur 2 high profile physical security enhancement measures 3 and the bility to limit loss of life and mass hysteria confusion and panic in the face or wake of t errorist attacks particularly in situations involving weapons of mass destruction effective mechanisms to minimize pan ic and ensure coordinated dissemination of critical life savin g information is important as is planning on practical matters such as how to dispose of bodies essential is the ability to maintain and promptly dispatc h emergency teams to multiple disaster sites central issue of concern is admin istration consultation with congress over policy shifts which may result in an undeclared war to paraphrase familiar congressiona lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98733crs6 according to press reports

henry h shelton met with senators and available house members to discuss th planning and rationale of the bombings housefocused follow up briefings are plannedadage w need to be there for the takeoffs if you expect us to support you on the crash landings it can be argued that gi ven the need for secrecy and surprise and given the fact that the administrations timing of the miliary r esponse was dependent to large degree on the configuration of events and the activities of terrorist operatives on the ground th administration made reasonable efforts to inform congress in advance of the augus t action to be taken as well as the targets and rationale of the pending missilestrike response notwithstanding administration efforts to brie f congress on the attack has the6 administration been remiss in its failure to consult with and brief congress on any new policy or major change in policy emphasis or direction questions for congressiona l inquiry might include what is the policy how exactly is it different how does it fit in with other policy options what consequences are foreseeable how is it to be implemented how is effectiveness to be measured how is it to be coordinated what funding organizational mechanisms or legislative authority are req uired to implement it effectively and how is international support for and cooperation in this strategy to be pursued in justifying the us missile response under article 51 of the charter sel f defense the clinton administration has invoked 22 usc 22377 note otherwise known as section 3244 of the antiterrorism and effective death penal ty act of 1996 pl 104 132 which provides the congress fin ds that the president should use all necessary means including covert action and military force to disrupt dismantle and destro international infrastructure used by international terrorists including overseas terroris t training facilities and safehavens does 22 usc 2377 as passed by congress in 1996 amount to the counterterrorism nalogue to the vietnam era gulf of tonkin resolution some analysts suggest that ch authority is too broad and openended and may pave the way for quagmire of unconventional violent exchanges and consequently amendmen t of the statute may be warranted others however feel that such broad authority i s essential to allow president maximum flexibility to coun ter mounting terrorist threats and stress that potential for abuse can be checked through active congressional oversight and reporting to congress another issue involving presidential authority is how th presidential ban on assassinations eo 12233 fits into any policy shift and if it should be modified or rescinded more proactive terrorism policy may prove costly in dollars even in relatively quiet times as well as in potential restrictions on civil liberties unresolved questions include 1 what is the potential dollar cost and is the public prepared to accept the loss of lives and other consequences of such war of the future in this regard should there be more active federal role in public education an informed involved and engaged public is critical to sustain an active antiterrorism response the american public will be more likely to accept casualties if they understand why they will be sustained and that sometimes it is cheaper to pay the cost up front
