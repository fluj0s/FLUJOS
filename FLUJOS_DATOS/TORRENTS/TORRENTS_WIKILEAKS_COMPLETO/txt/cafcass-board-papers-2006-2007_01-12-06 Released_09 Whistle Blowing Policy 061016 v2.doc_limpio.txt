blowing as key component in our strategy to challenge inappropriate behaviour at all levels in the organisation it is both an instrument in support of good governance and manifestation of more healthy and ethical organisational culture 3 the public interest disclosure act 1998 provides employees with statutory protection against victimisation or dismissal should they reasonably and in good faith report concerns or blow the whistle 4 this policy makes it clear that you may come forward with concerns without fear of victimisation disciplinary action subsequent discrimination or disadvantage

contractorsworkers who follow the procedures laid down in the legislation in disclosing specific categories of malpractice 42 disclosure will qualify for protection under the legislation if in the

disclosures to prescribed persons such as regulatory bodies wider disclosures eg to the police the media or mps 44 cafcass has range of other policies that may be more relevant to other categories of malpractice or concern such as the grievance performance and conduct complaints and dignity at work procedures 5 whistle blowing procedure 51 how to raise concern if you have concern about malpractice we hope you will feel able to raise it with your line manager however dependent upon the seriousness and sensitivity of the issues involved and who is thought to be involved in the malpractice another person may be more appropriate eg the designated whistle blowing officer who is the head of hr or regional or corporate director or head of function if you believe that senior management is involved you should raise your concern with the chief executive or member of the board if your concern is about the chief executive you should raise it with the chair of the board if it is about board member or the chair you should raise it with the chief executive 52 board members should raise their concern with the chair or with the board as whole and may take forward serious criticisms and concerns which they do not think have been effectively dealt with by the board to senior official in the dfes 53 if you are unsure about the nature of your concern and would prefer to talk it through with someone internally before raising it with senior manager you may contact your regional hr advisor andor trade union representative 54 concerns are best raised in writing you are invited to set out the background and history of the concern giving names dates and places where possible and the reasons why you are particularly concerned about the situation your statement should be signed to confirm that it is true and accurate to the best of your knowledge if you do not feel able to put your concerns in writing you can telephone or meet with the appropriate officer the earlier you express your concern the easier it is to take action 55 you may invite companion who may be from your trade union or professional association or friend or have legal representative raise matter on your behalf you may also have such companion to accompany you at any meeting that is held relating to your concern meetings may be held during or out of work hours and on or off the premises 56 further advice and guidance on how matters of concern may be pursued can be obtained from the head of human resources 6 confidentiality 61 cafcass will do its best to protect your identity when you raise concern and will not disclose your identity without your consent it must be appreciated that the investigation process may reveal the source of the information and statement by you may be required as part of the evidence particularly if the police courts or external auditors become involved in order to take effective action cafcass will need proper evidence which may be required to stand up to examination in courts or tribunals but we will always discuss this with your first 7 anonymous allegations 71 this policy encourages you to put your name to your allegation and will support you to do so unless there is particular set of circumstances that make this especially difficult for you 2 anonymous concerns are harder to investigate and substantiate without the whistleblowers open evidence but nevertheless you are encouraged to raise your concerns and be assured that they will be taken seriously factors we would take into account would include the seriousness of the issues you have raised the credibility of your concern the likelihood of confirmation of the allegation from attributable sources 8 how cafcass will respond once you have told us about your concerns we will look into it to assess initially what substance it has 81 action taken will depend on the nature of the concern matters raised may be investigated by management internal audit or through the disciplinary process or appropriate channels be considered under cafcass child protection procedures if the matter falls within these be referred to relevant external body be referred to the police form the subject of an independent inquiry be dealt with by other agreed action without investigation 82 some concerns may be resolved by agreed action without the need for an investigation if urgent action is needed this will be taken before any investigation is conducted 83 within ten working days of concern being received your immediate manager or appropriate person will write to you to tell you who is handling or has handled the matter indicate how it is proposed to deal with the matter give an estimate as to how long it will take to give final response tell you whether any initial enquiries have been made and whether your further assistance will be required explain why further action is proposed if that is the decision cafcass accepts that you need to be assured that the matter has been properly addressed thus subject to legal constraints you will receive information about the outcomes of any investigations 9 untrue allegations 91 if you make an allegation in good faith and genuinely believe your allegation to be founded action will be taken against you if your allegation is not confirmed by the investigation if however you make malicious or vexatious allegations that are for other purpose than to either cause trouble or for personal gain or to discredit cafcass or an officer an investigation will take place to determine whether disciplinary or other appropriate action should be taken against you 10 recording concerns 101 the head of hr with support from the regional hr advisors will maintain register of all concerns raised under the whistle blowing policy and monitor the progress and the outcomes this register will form part of the periodic reports made to the audit committee regarding the use of the policy all information contained within the report will be in strictest confidence and the name of the complainant or location will not be disclosed the head of hr will also periodically report to the board on how the policy works in practice awareness levels and how much trust and confidence people have in the policy board members will be particularly keen to see that there is demonstrable commitment from the most senior managers in cafcass to uphold support and appropriately respond to whistle blowing concerns 11 public interest disclosure 111 whilst we hope that this policy and procedures gives you the reassurance you need to raise concerns internally we recognise that there may be circumstances where you may need to report matter as qualifying disclosure under the public interest disclosure act to an outside body if you have good reason to believe that in raising concern inside cafcass you will be victimised or evidence will be destroyed in making such disclosure you are protected from unfair dismissal such disclosure must be made within the meaning of the act 112 for example if your concern has been dealt with through this policy and you are still dissatisfied with our response and there is higher level of management with whom the concern can be raised you may raise your concern to prescribed regulator such as the health and safety executive hmrc her majestys revenue and customs the national audit office which covers the proper conduct of public business value for money fraud and corruption in relation to the provision of centrally funded public services or with for example senior official in the dfes the sponsor department who manage and monitor cafcass 113 it will be safe to raise concern outside cafcass eg with the police provided that one of the following conditions is met you believe you would be victimised if your raised the matter internally or with prescribed regulator you reasonably believed that coverup was likely and there was prescribed regulator you had already raised the matter internally or with prescribed regulator you do not make the disclosure for the purpose of personal gain 12 independent advice 121 if you are unsure about whether to use this procedure or if you want independent advice
