recordings decision of the copyright royalty board summary on march 9 2007 the copyright royalty board crb announced new statutory royalty rates for certain digital transmissions of sound recordings for the period january 1 2006 through december 31 2010 implementation of these new rates marks the expiration of previous royalty rate agreement specifically designed to benefit small internet radio broadcasters or webcas ters the new rates went into effect on july 15 2007 in an effort to reach compromise payment arrangement to serve as an alternative to the royalty rate scheme provided by the crb decision private negotiations are currently ongoing between webcasters and the entity representing sound recording copyri ght owners and ar tists soundexchange two similar bills hr 2060 and s 1353 both titled the internet radio equality act were introduced in the 110th congress the bills would nullify the crbs decision change the ratemaking standard and institute trans itional rates for the current rate cycle which is retroactiv to 2006 although c ongress has addressed the interests of small comme rcial webcasters in the pa st the proposed legislation appears to emphasize rate parity among statutory licensees who use different transmission technology ie satellite cable and the inte rnet the bills however permit webcasters to choose between differe nt payment formats fo r the current cycle including one based on percenta ge of revenue method s ought by small webcasters the webcaster settlement act of 2008 hr 7084 was introduced on september 25 2008 then approved by voice vote in the house on september 27 and by unanimous consent in the senate on ptember 30 it was signed by president bush on october 16 pl 110435 the pur pose of the webcaster settlement act is to authorize soundexchange to negotiate and enter into alternative royalty fee agreements with webcasters that would replace the rates blished under the crbs decision while congress is in recess unde r current law such privately negotiated agreements are not effective without congressional approval after the crb has issued decision on royalties the act termin ates soundexchanges authority to make settlements on february 15 2009 the act also provides that the terms of an agreement may be effective until the nd of 2016 the act also permits any agreement to be precedential in future crb

through analog means need not comp ensate recording artists or record labels or obtain their permission to perform the work to the public the performance rights act introduced in the 110th congress hr

protects are sound recordings1 which the copyright act defines as works that result from the fixation of series of musical spoken or other sounds 2 owners of copyrighted sound recordings have exclusive rights to reproduce adapt or distribute their works or to perform them publicly by digital means3 normally anyone who wants to exercise any of the copyright owners exclusive rights must obtain the copyright owners permission to do so typically by direct negotiations between copyright owners and users however the copyright law also provides several types of statutory or compulsory licenses for sound recordings these licenses allow third parties who pay statutorily prescribed fees to us copyrighted sound recordings under certain conditions and according to specific requirements without having to negotiate private licensing agreements4 in 1998 in the digital millennium copyright act dmca5 congress amended several statutory licensing stat utes to provide for and clar ify the

webcaster i in essence both the previous carp and the current copyright royalty board attempt to implement the statutorily mandated standard to reach royalty rate explaining its interpretation of the govern ing language the crb wrote webcaster i clarified the relationship of the statutory factors to the willing buyerwilling seller standard the standard requires determination of the rates that willing buyer and willing seller would agree upon in the marketplace in making this determination the two factors in section 114f2bi and ii must be considered but neither factor defi nes the standard they do not constitute additional standards nor should they be used to adjust the rates determined by the willing buyerwilling seller standard the statutory factors are merely to be considered along with other relevant fa ctors to determine the rates under the willing buyerwilling seller standard27 the board considered the proposals of representatives for small webcasters that rates be structured as percentage of revenue but ultimately rejected them in short among the parties on both sides who have proposed rates covering commercial webcasters only small commercial webcasters propose fee structure based solely on revenue howeve r in making their proposal this group of five webcasters clearly is unconcerne d with the actual structure of the fee except to the extent that revenuebased fee structure especially one in which the percent of revenue fee is single digit number ie 5 can protect them against the possibility that their costs w ould ever exceed their revenues small commercial webcasters focus on the amount of the fee rather than how it should be structured is further underlined by the absence of evidence submitted by this group to identify basis for applying pure revenuebased structure to them while at times they suggest that their situation as small commercial webcasters requires this type of structur there is evidence in the record about how the copyright royalty judges woul d delineate between small webcasters and large webcasters28 and in substantive footnote the board expressed its view that it lacks statutory authority to carve out royalty ra niches for the emergent business models promoted by small commercial webcasters it must be emphasized that in reaching determination the copyright royalty judges cannot guarantee profitable business to every market entrant indeed the normal free market processes typically weed out those entities that have poor business models or are inefficient to allow inefficient market participants to continue to use as much music as they want and for as long time period as they want without compensating copyright owners on the same basis as more efficient market participants trivializes the property rights of copyright owners furthermore it would involve the copyri ght royalty judges in making policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34020crs7 29 id note 8 at 24088 30 id at 24092 31 see eg robert
