from thomas c peterson thomascpetersonnoaagov to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd jones et 1990 date wed 20 jun 2007 082750 0400 fascinating thanks for keeping in the loop phil i wont pass it on but i will keep it in the back of my mind whenif russ asks about appropriate responses to ca requests russ view is that you can never satisfy them so why bother to try it seems to that what they are saying is the equivalent of accusing doctor of malpractice for not seeing broken bone in chinese xray taken in 1985 when the break is clearly visible in state of the art 2005 canadian mri scan examined while wearing their special problem finding glasses they also dont seem to understand the collaborative nature of the work equivalent to accusing you of faulty reading of metadata at the ushcn station in reno because you quoted general ushcn statement that wasnt fully applicable to reno good luck tom phil jones said the following on 6202007 359 am tom p just for interest dont pass on might be precedent for your paper to j climate when it comes out there are few interesting comments on the ca web site one says it is up to to prove the paper from 1990 was correct not for keenan to prove were wrong interesting logic cheers phil weichyung tom i wont be replying to either of the emails below nor to any of the accusations on the climate audit website ive sent them on to someone here at uea to see if we should be discussing anything with our legal staff the second letter seems an attempt to be nice to and somehow split up the original author team i do now wish id never sent them the data after their foia request cheers phil xymailosg wrt8waevm1mybgklj9hailvnyw9gqqfcbarmyvxdn17eho1e0vf5esq4wigjljnsew from steve mcintyre 1stephenmcintyreutorontoca to phil jones

temperature set jointly collected by the us deparment of energy and the prc academy of sciences stating in respect to the chinese stations the stations were selected on the basis of station history we chose those with few if any changes in instrumentation location or observation times this data set was later published as ndp039 3httpcdiacornlgovepubsndpndp039ndp039html coauthored by zeng zhaomei providing station histories only for their 65station network stating that station histories for their 205station network which includes many of the sites in jones et 1990 were not available s 5 unfortunately station histories are not currently available for any of the stations in the 205station network therefore details regarding instrumentation collection methods changes in station location or observing times and official data sources are not known s 7 few station records included in the prc data sets can be considered truly homogeneous even the best stations were subject to minor relocations or changes in observing times and many have undoubtedly experienced large increases in urbanization fortunately for 59 of the stations in the 65station network station histories see table 1 are available to assist in proper interpretation of trends or jumps in the data however station histories for the 205station network are not available in addition examination of the data from the 65station data set has uncovered evidence of several undocumented station moves sects 6 and 10 users should therefore exercise caution when using the data accordingly it appears that the quality control claim made in jones et 1990 was incorrect i presume that you did not verify whether this claim was correct at the time and have been unaware of the incorrectness of this representation since the study continues to be relied on most recently in ar4 i would encourage you to promptly issue an appropriate correction regards steve mcintyre from dj keenan 4dougkeenaninformathorg to steve

xueaspamflag steve i thought that i should summarize what has happened with the wang case first i concluded that the claims made about chinese stations by jones et nature 1990 and wang et grl 1990 were very probably fabricated you very likely came to the same conclusion second some investigation showed that phil jones was wholly blameless and that responsibility almost certainly lay with wang third i contacted wang told him that i had caught him and asked him to retract his fabricated claims my emails were addressed to him only and i told one about them in wangs reply though jones karl zeng etc were ccd fourth i explained to wang that i would publicly accuse him of fraud if he did not retract wang seemed to not take seriously so i drafted what would be the text of formal accusation and sent it to him wang replied that if i wanted to make the accusation that was up to fifth i put draft on my web site 7 httpwwwinformathorgapprisea5620htm and emailed few people asking if they had any recommendations for improvement i intend to send the final version to wangs university and to demand formal investigation into fraud i will also notify the media separately i have had preliminary discussion with the fbibecause wang likely used government funds to commit his fraud it seems that it might be possible to prosecute wang under the same statute as was used in the eric poehlman case the simplicity of the case makes this easierno scientific knowledge is required to understand things i saw that you have now emailed phil ccd above asking phil to publish retraction of wangs claims 8httpwwwclimateauditorgp1741comment115879 there could be couple problems with that one problem is that it would be difficult for phil to publish anything without the agreement of wang and the other coauthors nature would simply say another problem is that your email says that you presume phil was unaware of the incorrectness of wangs work i do not see how that could be true although the evidence that phil was innocent in 1990 seems entirely conclusive there is also the paper of yan et advances in atmospheric sciences 18 309 2001 which is cited on my web page phil is coauthor of that paper phil this proves that you knew there were serious problems with wangs claims back in 2001 yet some of your work since then has continued to rely on those claims most notably in the latest report from the ipcc it would be nice to hear the explanation for this phil kind wishes doug douglas j keenan 9httpwwwinformathorg phone 44 20 7537 4122 the limehouse cut london e14 6n uk prof phil jones climatic
