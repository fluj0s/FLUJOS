statute the fmsa are legally deemed to be references to the aeca crs2 purposes other than those for which furnished unless the consent of the president has first been obtained section 3c of the arms

arms export control act stipulates in part that credits including participations in credits may be issued and guarantees may be extended for any foreign country under this act as hereinafter provided if such country uses defense articles or defense services furnished under this act or any predecessor act in substantial violation either in terms of the quantities or in terms of the gravity of the consequences regardless of the quantities involved of any agreement entered into pursuant to any such act2by using such articles or services for purpose not authorized under section 4 or if such agreement provides that such articles and services may only be used for purposes more limited than those authorized under section 4 for purpose not authorized under such agreement section 3c1b of the aeca adds that under the above conditions cash sales or deliveries pursuant to previous sales may be made section 3g of the arms export control act enacted in november 1999 further requires that any agreement for the sale or lease of any article on the united states munitions list entered into by the united states government after the date of enactment of this subsection november 29 19993 shall state that the united states government retains the right to verify credible reports that such article has been used for purpose not authorized under section 4 or if such agreement provides that such article may only be used for purposes more limited than those authorized under section 4 for purpose not authorized under such agreement purposes for which military sales by the united states are authorized section 4 of the arms export control act the purposes for which sales of defense articles and services by the united states are authorized are detailed in section 4 of the arms export control act this section of the act states that defense articles and defense services shall be sold to friendly countries solely for internal security legitimate selfdefense enabling the recipient to participate in regional or collective arrangements or measures consistent with the charter of the united nations 2 emphasis added the statute makes clear that any sanctions that may be applied are for substantial violation of an agreement entered into with the united states pursuant to the aeca or any predecessor act and not for violation of the aeca itself or its predecessors 3 added by section 1225 of the security assistance act of 1999 title xii of hr 3427 enacted by reference in section 1000a7 of pl 106113 113 stat 1526 crs3 enabling the recipient to participate in collective measures requested by the united nations for the purpose of maintaining or restoring international peace and security enabling the foreign military forces in less developed countries to construct public works and to engage in other activities helpful to the economic and social development of such friendly countries it should be stressed that the arms export control act as amended the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended and predecessor acts do not define such critical terms as internal security and legitimate selfdefense it remains for the president or the congress as the case may be to define the meaning of such terms as they may apply to the question of possible violation by foreign country of an applicable agreement governing the sale of us defense articles or defense services presidential report to congress on possible violations section 3c2 of the arms export control act requires the president to report promptly to the congress upon the receipt of information that substantial violation described in section 3c1 of the aeca may have occurred this presidential report need not reach any conclusion regarding the possible violation or provide any particular data other than that necessary to illustrate that the president has received information indicating specific country may have engaged in substantial violation of an applicable agreement with the united states that governs the sale of us defense articles or services procedures for making foreign countries ineligible for receipt of us defense articles and services should the president determine and report in writing to congress or if congress determines by joint resolution pursuant to section 3c3a of the arms export control act that substantial violation by foreign country of an applicable agreement governing an arms sale has occurred then that country becomes ineligible for further us military sales under the aeca this action would terminate provision of credits loan guarantees cash sales and deliveries pursuant to previous sales the president could under section 3c3b of the aeca continue to permit cash sales and deliveries pursuant to previous sales by certifying in writing to congress that termination of such sales and deliveries would have significant adverse impact on united states security such presidential waiver could not be invoked however if congress under section 3c3a had adopted or were to adopt joint resolution finding that country ineligible the president retains the prerogative of vetoing any such joint resolution congress would then have to override the veto in order to impose its will congress also has the option of adopting regular legislation imposing varying degrees of penalties upon any country for violations of the conditions of an applicable agreement regarding use of ussupplied defense equipment such legislation would also be subject to the veto process4 4 it should be noted that the obligations restrictions and possible penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act also apply to the retransfer by foreign recipients of us supplied defense articles defense services and related technical data to another nation should such retransfer occur in the absence of prior approval by the president of the united states to do so then the nation making such transfer could be determined to be in continued crs4 restoration of eligibility once country is made ineligible for sales or deliveries under the arms export control act provisions it can regain its eligibility only when 1 under section 3c4 of the act the president determines that the violation has ceased the violation which led to the status of ineligibility in the first place and 2 the country involved has given assurances satisfactory to the president that such violation will not recur alternatively congress could pass regular legislation that would exempt the particular country from specific sanctions imposed through aeca procedures although that legislation would be subject to presidential veto suspension or cancellation of contracts andor deliveries by the united states it should be noted that the united states has additional options to prevent transfer of defense articles and services for which valid contracts exist short of finding foreign country in violation of an applicable agreement with the united states authority for suspension of deliveries or defense items or cancellation of military sales contracts is found in sections 2b 42e1 and 42e2 of the aeca section 2b of the arms export control act permits the secretary of state under the presidents direction to among other things determine whether there shall be delivery or other performance regarding sales or exports under the aeca in order that the foreign policy of the united states is best served thereby section 42e1 of the arms export control act states that each contract for sale entered into under sections 21 22 29 and 30 of this act and each contract entered into under section 27d of the act shall provide that such contract may be canceled in whole or in part or its execution suspended by the united states at any time under unusual or compelling circumstances if the national interest so requires section 42e2a of the arms export control act further states that each export license issued under section 38 of this act shall provide that such license may be revoked suspended or amended by the secretary of state without prior notice whenever the secretary deems such action to be advisable thus all governmenttogovernment agreements or licensed commercial contracts for the transfer of defense articles or defense services may be halted modified or terminated by the executive branch should it determine it is appropriate to do so use of this authority does not prejudice the larger question of whether substantial violation of an applicable agreement governing use of us arms did in fact occur that question can still be answered affirmatively or negatively or left unanswered depending on how the president or the congress chooses to deal with it to date the president has never taken the next step and actually determined that 4 continued violation of its agreement with the united states not to take such an action without prior consent from the us and therefore could be subject to the penalties provided for such violation set out in section 3 of the aeca see section 3a2 of the aeca where the re transfer prior consent obligation is set out 22 usc 2753 a2 crs5 violation did occur thus necessitating the termination of deliveries or sales or other penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act illustrative responses of the united states government to possible violations of agreements on use of us provided defense articles argentina on april 30 1982 powell moore assistant secretary of state for congressional relations reported to congress that the president had determined that argentina through its use of ussupplied military equipment in its occupation of the falkland islands islas malvinas on april 2 1982 may have substantially violated the applicable agreements with the united states governing use of this equipment in his april 30 report assistant secretary moore noted that in light of these circumstances the united states was suspending until further notice all deliveries to argentina of defense articles and services for which commitments were made prior to october 1 1978 other restrictions on military aid to argentina were already in place the reagan administration removed the suspension on september 24 1982 israel questions raised regarding the use of ussupplied military equipment by israel in lebanon in june and july 1982 led the reagan administration to determine on july 15 1982 that israel may have violated its july 23 1952 mutual defense assistance agreement with the united states tias 2675 concerns centered on whether or not israel had used ussupplied antipersonnel cluster bombs against civilian targets during its military operations in lebanon and the siege of beirut5 the pertinent segment of that 1952 agreement between israel and the united states reads as follows the government of israel assures the united states government that such equipment materials or services as may be acquired from the united states are required for and will be used solely to maintain its internal security its legitimate selfdefense or to permit it to participate in the defense of the area of which it is part or in united nations collective security arrangements and measures and that it will not undertake any act of aggression against any other state it should be noted that none of the critical terms such as internal security legitimate selfdefense or act of aggression are defined within this 1952 usisraeli agreement the house foreign affairs committee held hearings on this issue in july and august 1982 on july 19 1982 the reagan administration announced that it would prohibit new exports of cluster bombs to israel this prohibition was lifted by the reagan administration in november 19886 5 see us congress house committee on

of americansupplied military equipment in this raid may have constituted substantial violation of the applicable 1952 usisraeli agreement as consequence and pending review of the facts of the case the president chose to exercise the authority set forth in sections 2 b and 42e1 of the arms export control act to suspend for the time being the shipment of four f16 aircraft that had been scheduled for delivery to israel as the result of this decision the subsequent delivery of 10 f16 and 2 f15 aircraft to israel was also suspended however on august 17 1981 the reagan administration lifted its suspension on deliveries to israel and all of the planes were transferred on two other occasions april 5 1978 and august 7 1979 the carter administration chose to find that the israelis may have violated their 1952 agreement with the united states through the use of americanorigin military equipment in operations conducted in lebanon however the us did not suspend or terminate any israeli arms sales credits or deliveries in either of these cases in two notable instances questions concerning the improper use by israel of us weapons were raised but the president expressly concluded that violation of the agreement regarding use of us supplied equipment did not occur on october 1 1985 israel used ussupplied aircraft to bomb palestine liberation organization plo headquarters in tunis tunisia the reagan administration subsequently stated that the israeli raid was understandable as an expression of selfdefense although the bombing itself cannot be condoned on july 14 1976 following the israeli rescue mission at entebbe uganda in early july 1976 the department of state declared that israels use of ussupplied military equipment during that operation was in accordance with the 1952 usisraeli agreement indonesia and east timor following the military intervention of indonesia in east timor on december 7 1975 the ford administration initiated policy review in connection with the us military assistance program with indonesia because of the possible conflict between the indonesian use of usorigin equipment in east timor and the provisions of us law and usindonesian bilateral agreements the ford administration placed hold on the issuance of new letters of offer contracts and military assistance program map orders to indonesia however military equipment already in the pipeline continued to be delivered to the indonesians the policy review was completed in late may 1976 military assistance and sales resumed in july 1976 formal finding of substantial violation of applicable usindonesian agreements involving use of usorigin military equipment conditional or otherwise was made by the administration or by the congress turkey and the congressionallyimposed embargo

independently suspended the issuance of new foreign military sales credits and guarantees and major new cash sales for turkey from late july until october 17 1974 the president did permit routine cash sales of spare parts and components for items already purchased by turkey during this same period the congress imposed an embargo on military sales credits assistance and deliveries to turkey with the enactment of hjres 1167 the continuing appropriations resolution for fy75 pl 93448 however section 6 of hjres 1167 gave the president the option to waive the effect of the embargo until december 10

30 1974 continued the turkish embargo and made it part of permanent law yet it also gave the president the option of temporarily waiving the embargos effect until february 5 1975 president ford used this waiver to suspend the embargo from december 30 1974 until february 5 1975 at which time the turkish embargo was restored on october 6 1975 president ford signed into law pl 94104 which partially lifted the arms embargo on turkey successive statutes modified military aid and sales levels for turkey while partial embargo remained in effect finally on september 26 1978 president carter signed
