listing lines lecture given on 20 september 1962 thank you well here we are on the what audience twentieth where did the 19th go oh i was auditing that night thats right so this is the 20th of september ad 12 im going to talk to you right now about lines and listing its only four days deep into this week and six goals have been found were running at rate of one and half goals per day those of you who have had the halfgoal found six goalsjust like that theyre rolling off now at highly rapid rate all youve got to do is learn how to do it so that it happens with everybody you address in under twentyfive hours thats what i want to have you do and that way you can run coaudit and that way you can do terrific amount of this and that okay audience mmhm all right now i want to talk to you about goals and listing listing is problem you have not yet wrapped your wits about none of you were listing on the right lines i doubt theres anybody listing on the right lines your lines are probably wrong i have tried to develop formula for lines without much success which could be rattled off boppityboppitybop the formula is probably create curious desire enforce inhibit you know the cdei scale with create on top of it thats probably the formula and that goes positive and negative and oppose and notoppose and then it goes cause and effect on the goal line well that if added up give you forty lines look it over thats forty line listing rig now i havent listed one out totally on those lines because ive just youre as usual trodding upon my heels very tightly and i have to fixi have to get the backs of my shoes fixed more often than any other person anyplace but the essence of this is that if you had one create do you see causative then of course there is create effect youll understand more about that in minute see so thats group of four create causative immediately becomes group of four ill give you an idea who or what would make catfish see now thats fine who or what would make catfish all right now that of course goes into not make catfish would oppose making catfish and not oppose making catfish instantly and immediately we have group of four its always on group of four you always have the plus and the minus and the plusoppose and the minusopposealways there will be some version of that and it must be in multiple of four now if you have causative end of the lineyou know who or what would make catfish then youve got this is very crude example and i should tell you right here that the problem is not as critical as youre making it out with four lines it was terribly critical you had to get these things to fire you had to get everything all set and whooo it was really sharp and so forth well were handling it quantitatively now who cares see you dont have to get these linesyou dont have to prepcheck these lines you dont have to get these lines to fire you dont have to do anything you just take the goal put it to it and list and the weird part of it is youre operating on plus margin youre way over what it takes to make him clear you understand and ill go into that more but lets take look at this now youve got the effect end which gives you another four now if youve got cause four you must have an effect four you got the idea who or what would make catfish see youve got to have what would catfish make do you see that and what would catfish not make and what would catfish oppose making and what would they not oppose making you understand that just because youve got an object in the goal is reason that the effect end is settled you got the idea we had somebody once who had goal that had the word empire in it well this saddled everybody an empire was an empire and that was all there was to it you know the object end of the goal the effect end of the goal is all taken care of in the goal thats obvious isnt it its got an empire on the end of the goal so therefore whod want to run an empire you see ah well have to get over to the other side of this thing what empire would want to be run dont you see that dont take it for granted that because the goal has an object in the sentence that that is fait accompli and that is never alterable or anything or youll leave your pc there with stacks of extra answers now how did all this come about it came about this way having to alteris the command to squeeze the answers in sideways you got it audience mmhm and they were always left with extra items and these sometimes would pile up to point where the tone arm would start rising and would go up and stick and those were just piledup suppressed items that there was line for them to go on alterations of line alterations of the auditing command you see these are all disobediences of the basics of auditing must be clear auditing question and it must be clean auditing answer to that question dont you see all right now the answer to that is of course give them more lines than they ever heard of they always got someplace to put the extra item now furthermore even though you have somebodys goals already all fixed up see and its already grooved in and youve got this all taped and everything and he all of sudden comes up with rabbit and he tells you after youve gone through sixteen consecutive lines of listingwhich is all you had for his goalthat hes still got rabbit well you dont throw this rabbit away but let tell you the rabbitthe rabbit is what he would make do you see and there just is place to put this rabbit and heres this poor old bunny sitting out there on the side and it drives your pc halfway around the bend well you cant put in an extra line which accommodates the rabbit if you put in an extra line to accommodate the rabbit you of course have to put in eight lines so actually the minimal number of lines that you can add to anybodys list is eight not four but eight it must be subject and it must be object you see the cause and the effect you see that so anyway if your pc cant accommodate rabbit then youd better give this thing good study not evaluate for him and tell him where it belongs but tell him what he thinks this rabbit would have to do with what he is doing and he says well he says the rabbit of coursethe rabbit would wouldwellthe rabbiti guess the rabbit wouldwell hed be impossible to make and maybe the goal was to make things rabbit would just be impossible to make well youre off to the races just put the word impossible into eight lines you see how youd do that and youll accommodate the rabbit and youll find out theres whole bunch more that will come in on top of it and i dont care how many sets of lines you use but if you do that dont try to catch the lines up to the other lines just add them in the normal course of events you understand youll always find extra items now theres an oddity here as any pc that has been run on it and is jostling around can tell you who or what would want the goal to catch catfish who or what would not want the goal to catch catfish who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish and who or what would not oppose the goal to catch catfish all of those get different answers than anything else who or what would catch catfish and all of that bracket actually you get different answers when you say the goal thats an interesting ramification see if you say who or what would want the goal to catch catfish dont you see well that gives you four lines that sort of stand out now what would be the object of this is what catfish you got the idea youd have to add the other four in some haphazard fashion to make it balanced eight do you understand but itd all be the goalthe goal the goal the goal that would be eight lines all devoted to the goal you understand if you were going to run it that way actually youre now riding in clover youre way out on the wideopen sands and youve got such abundance of places to put things that youre riding on quantitative cushion you might say the pc can put anything anything hes got anyplace without that one the goal but im just giving you an idea see this by the way ive seen boggle pc im not advocating that you use this one see the pc would be saying who wants this goal and who wants this goal and so forth well just gratuitously add eight more lines got the idea each one with the goal in front of the thing and youll get whole bunch more answers you understand youre always at liberty to do this now i dont care how many lines you list you can list 128 lines if you want to but theyre all listed in the same way they must be answerable and each line is put down at the top of sheet of paper and you add 4 items to that list and put check mark and go to the next page not five not three four that is what you want just exactly four and what if he gets an extra item he says butbutbutbut ive got this item here i got this rabbit iheres this rabbit iii got this rabbit i got this rabbit you say good ill write the rabbit down in the margin you can have him the next time around got the idea and this disciplines and puts the pc at cause over these wild automaticities that you so far have been accommodatingtoo accommodating about got the idea four not three not five four and that leaves the auditor at cause over the session see because listing sessions tend to become too uncaused they go wild the guy writes three sessions on who or what would not want to have made catfish see and it goes on and on and on and on and on actually jams himself up by doing this too now why do i say four well four appears to be fairly optimum number but i would not be surprised to have you come down sometime or another with real jammedup case to one now why would you drop you wouldnt drop on the case after youd started if you started with four youd continue with four if you started with one youd continue with one but one that isnt very quantitative but you might get it so jammed up that the guy cant do anything about it now what happens exactly if you overlist first you get comm lag and then you get fishing for the right item these occupy lot of session time of whichtheres value in occupying that session time see has value at all and then the next phenomenon is oh that isnt it you got it all right its first comm lags therestheres waterbuck and tiger and uhhuhhmuhhuhhuhh at twentyfive dollars an hour thats crazy you dont want that you get the idea see hes listed sixteen items and then he goes on to uhhuhhuhh and the next thing you give him you say all right give another one on that line if you did that you ought to make this as an experiment some day just to see how it works because it always works out this way hell say well its bigno small largean enormous huge uhuha bigmmmmits certain type of waterbuck its largewho who big small it isnt big small couldnt be so on and so on so on oh i finally got it the item is certain type of waterbuck yeah thats great now if you said give some more items he would be saying waterbuckno that isnt it tigerno that isnt it giraffeno that isnt it dont put that down uh that wouldnt be it tiger that isnt it and so on youve got to run them all out in invalidations on prepcheck to hell with that racket see thats good whats happening whats happening on the ahhahhahhahhahh what youve got is the line has flowed in one direction you see these flowsyoure listing flowsand youve run one of these flows to point where its idling at the end you see its idling and it isnt reaching anything and its kind of trying to come back so hes kind of saying uhhuhhuhh it cant strike anything because he cant reach in that direction anymore the flow is now stuck and the next phenomenon is he does manage to reach something but he knows kind of that its undescribable youre asking him to reach too far dont you see and its too far in that direction its undescribable and therefore the right thing and all of that and so forth now if youif he goes past that and manages to describe it hes already overreached himself considerably the next phenomenon is that the backflow on that same line starts to hit and so he more than announces something than he is invalidated you see the backflow has started youre trying to reach out and its trying to come in or youre trying to reach in and hes trying to flow out you get the idea its selfinvalidative and if you run line too long in one direction you will get this isnt it isnt it isnt it catfish isnt it waterbuck isnt it tiger isnt it you get the idea and all youre running into there is bank phenomena the comm lag the indescribable the invalidated and that is the cycle that those listings go so you want to stop short of that and keep the pc fluid now the way you can keep him running properly in these lines is to get large number of lines and let him put definite number on each line thea good average number is four but if you start in with four then he damn well gives you four and thats all there is to it and youll find very shortly he gets totally educated on the thing hell give you fourone two three four next line one two three four next line one two three four next line one two three four and then hell say ahhahhahh on the next line and then one two three four and one two three four and one two three four and one two three four and man youre getting items man and that guys going clear in hurry savvy none of this ahhahhahhahhahh you know auditing is not an exercise in gargling now thats how to get fast listing done now the funny part of it is the more lines youve got the shorter your listing will be the more lines you list the less listing youre going to do let give you an idea this isthis is suppositional that on four lines you would have had to have listed twenty thousand items to free needle so we list eight items and you would only have to list on all that isthis is total number of itemsmaybe eighteen thousand see we list sixteen lines and we only list twelve thousand items you get the idea you see it isnt per line thats just the gross number now perhaps you could go too far out on this and the only way you could go too far out on this is by failing to sandwich the causative and the effective properly now you can have eight causative and eight effective without getting into trouble but if you start up from that number you had better have four causative four effect you understand four cause four effect now you understand what i mean by cause and effect who would want to be goddess and who the hell would want goddess you get the idea see get that as cause and effect see whod want to be one whod want to have one thats your four lines in sequence one to the next you savvy now oddly enough you can do this rather badly and still win lucky lucky that its that way on the four lines you had to be very precise you had to keep your mid rudiments in you had to do this you had to do that you had to checkprepcheck everything you had to prepcheck it every time you turned around you had to do this why well in looking into this to find out why i found out that the items were being stacked up in alteris so if the items are being stacked in alteris why then of course you had to prepcheck often now why did the items themselves have to fire well they had to fire because you didyou didnt have any abundance of lines you were running on an economy of lines which gave you of course you had to get those lines which fired most and then you had chance but by listing large number of lines why youre all set now i dont know what the proper number of lines is i know very easily that sixteen you could undoubtedly get by with you could get by with sixteen lines twentyfour linesthats your next number up thats dandy theyre fine thats fine thirtytwookay okay fortyfine see its almost matter of who cares but you get those together and you determine the number of lines youre going to have unless the pc hadstarts having leftover rabbits case of leftover rabbits why you wouldnt have to form up any more lines but now heres the precise way in which you list one of these things im going to go worse then im going to go over this again with you formation of linesbecause this is headache but let tell youlet get it in so i wont forget it here is an exact proper listing session i want to tell you what an exact listing session is exactly what it is you sit yourself down you sits the pc down you adjust his chair and you get the can squeeze and you put him into model session you got that now all right and then the firstest thing you do is you supertiger drill the goal till it reads see you get that goal reading now the magic phrase in auditing on the goal or since blank whenever the goal was found or since the last time he was prepchecked up to are also usable in that tiger drill in auditing on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed in auditing on the goal to catch catfish is there anything youve been careful of you understand and you drill that thing back into read before you start thing in that session and after that you dont do darn thing with it you dont do anything with lines you dont do anything with anything you just list you got it to read thats it now of course if your session goes to hell you get your mid rudiments in but you dont do anything else with the goal if your session goes to pieces why you get your middle rudiments in thats when you use middle rudiments now middle rudiments are best put in with this line not in this session but since the last time i audited you got that theyre always put in best that way since the last time i audited you i know its right in the middle of the session and the guys all out of session and everything else and so forth well you figure this must have gone wrong between sessions why why is this well i discovered new phenomenon theres new phenomenon you miss withhold on the pc in session itll key in withhold that happened before the session now thats hell of thing this had to happen to us see ill give you an idea you saythe pc says to you one of his items is buttercake see and he says to you buttercake and you say blossom youre muttering to yourself and he says aa buttercake and you say splutterbath and he says buttercake buttercake buttercake thatthats what i want on there buttercake and you say all right waterbuck now then you finally wake up seethis was warm dayand you say oh buttercake and you put down buttercake and you say everything is all right but now the middle rudiments are little bit out so you say in this session yipyap yupyup whoopwhop and you straighten it all out and the pc is still out of session well whats taken place here something very interesting has taken place because you missed see thats withholdyou made him have withhold called buttercakeyou will key in missed withhold that wasnt registering in the beginning rudiments heehhh this would happen to us now the liability of ityou must understand thisbecause the liability of it is this that it didnt happen between sessions but is missed withhold from eighteen years ago ooooh well if you just know that one can happen you can also get it from eighteen years ago but thats why pc appears to stay arc broke even though you get in the middle ruds you got it in other words when you missed withhold in the session it keyed in missed withhold weird business you see you hadnt missed it up to then you had missed part of it because it had never come up well because you missed one in the session you key in one and miss it you got that audience mmhm yes so good prevention of thisbut not the perfect prevention of thisis of course since the last time i audited you now that will catch most of them but sometimes you just got up and drunk the wrong brand of coffee it must be because its just unlucky you keyed in one when he was five years old and it doesnt even get included into the problems intensive run on him you know and theres missed withhold sitting there staring everybody in the face and the pcs all arc broke and nobody can make anything out of it now also you could have gone past something or other about his goal or missed an item or hes suppressed one and that will operate as missed withhold and key in an earlier missed withhold you get the idea in other words he gets in snarl but its still under the heading of missed withholds the only thing youve got to solve when pc continues to be arc breaky is the whenness of the missed withhold see its the whenness of the missed withhold that will louse you up in listing session or goals finding session you missed something so you keyed in an earlier one that you hadnt missed you know he stole piece of cake off of you two months ago and its never come up youve been auditing right across this thing youve been just doing fine in the session and everythings been going along dandy and session after session never come up never disturbed him hes in good arc with you never been critical and then one fine day he says buttercup and you say all right waterbuck and here we go youve missed withhold in session he keys it inall of sudden the pcs all chopped up very arc breaky and you finally get very very clever and finally find the stolen cake two months ago and you say how in the name of common sense could i have been auditing this character for two months well it wasnt keyed in it just stayed there you know there it was you know an engram never becomes anything unless its keyed in well thats the same thing with missed withhold see withholda potential withhold does not do anything to anybody until he withholds it and you or somebody else misses it you got the idea it takes the action then the pcs withholdingness and then somebody missing the withhold for this thing to really go up in cloud of blue smoke you see that its sort of the way you fire depth charge you can put 16inch shell through depth charge without exploding the thing but tack hammer hammered against one end of it igniting primer igniting groundup tnt then ignites solid tnt and you get an explosion and youd never get an explosion unless it went exactly on that route and thats the way missed withhold goes together its been sitting there ready to be withheld and ready to be missed see so getting in your middle rudiments on pc in listing session particularly or goals finding session its very important that when youve had an arc break or its big chopup or you dont understand whats going on with the pc and hes still arc broke that you get your middle rudiments in in such fashion as to get any withhold which might have been keyed in outside the area of the session see because the boob probably keyed in something earlier got that thats quite important so all right you just go right on to the end of the session you list list list list listjust carrying on with what i was telling you how to run listing session you go right on to the end of the session right up to theto the clock and give him the business with the end rudiments and bring him right on out of session in other words you check nothing else you prepcheck nothing else you do nothing nothing nothing except list got it all right now thats all listing sessions consist of now what happens if you go to free needle on line you go to free needle on line well you ask him the question and it doesnt disturb it well now this is why four four are never going to jam nothing see just four items it isnt going to jam anything but you might be careful toward the end of the thing and only get one item if you were starting to run into lots of free needles got the idea you could do your four straight on through without ruining the pc see you would just gothe waya listing session has very little to do with the meter see you can watch your meter and watch your ta action make sure your ta action is continuing because your ta action isnt continuing your pcs out of session middle rudiments are out see andor you didnt tiger drill the goal to read see its mostly tiger drilling the goal to readthats the important thing in beginning the session you get ta action if you get to keep that goal tiger drilled all right now it has got thatyouve got the goal to read and then you list it and youve got written across the top of the sheet of paper you can usually double column these you write the title of the line you seethe whole line wording across the top of the sheetand then you come down here over on the left and you write four items and then you put tick and that tick goes just below and to the left of the fourth word its just little strike of the pencil why thats because you then never have to add up the lines to find out if youve got four or not see its always apparent that the unit is four and thats counting the next four because you can very easily see if you have four without doing any numbering and then you write those four and then you flip the sheet see to the next page and you write the four and you flip the sheet to the next page and you write the four and so forth and you can have whole mass of things and you can putif you can make ittwo columns to the sheet and then of course each sheet has back with two columns on it and you have as many sheets as you have lines and this makes very neat listing and the pc gets monotonously used to having piece of paper flipped over in front of his face you got it all right now it becomes embarrassing when you start running out of captioned things in the middle and nobodys had solution to this yet ivewe might have mirror clip or something that reads the line on the back of the sheet while youre writing on the front of it or something you get what i mean i mean you havent got any lines prepared and youve got sheets prepared and where are we going now you see well you solve that the best you can right now the technology concerned with that is summatable in four letter word cope now youll find out that one listing session isnt going to knock the goal badly out of read and in fact will improve its read and ordinarily unless youve run very lousy session indeed whyyou know run it with the rudiments all out and you never got them in in the first place and you missed all the reads and all this sort of thingyoull find out ordinarily that if you read your goal at the end and you ought to do this time or two just to see the facts of the case to catch catfish pow to catch catfish pow you know i mean that thing is really reading then and youll find out at the beginning of the next session it isnt reading at all well what happened well pcs think its unfortunate but they do some pcs are awful busy i almost say this to pcs sometimes and i think ive been known to is my god youve been busy you know what busy busy pc you know think think think think figure figure figure figure invalidate invalidatesuggest suggest suggest suggestfail to reveal fail to reveal fail to reveal fail to revealmistake mistake could it be mistake mistake mistake mistakemistake mistake well id better suppress the whole thing now if im very careful until the next session nothing will happen to the goal you see pretty wild busy anyhow its very strange what listing goal will do for goal but remember this about goals remember this about goals that listingthis is by actual testlisting will not polish up goal all by itself in other words you cant take goal which is totally out of read and then list on it for while and make it read now ive already seen that tested and i have finally come to that conclusion that conclusion might be based on firmer evidence i might have examined it longer but ive just examined three pcs whose goal had been found long time ago whod had the goal listed but nobody had ever polished up the goal for period of months and monthsin one case whole yearnobody had ever polished up that goal it had only been listed it was totally submerged the pcs tone arm was way up and stuck the pc looked like hell and nobody could make the goal read you understand so that was good enough evidence for because when i went in and rolled up my sleeves and tiger drilled the thing i got it to total flat then i did dynamic assessment and came right back to the same goal and got it firing like crazy but it took that much to get that goal firing again see it took that much and it also took whole lot of in auditing on the goal blanketyblank has anything been suppressed you know whole lot of that type of tiger drill and i finally got that goal firing again but remember that goal had been listed in the interim thats interesting isnt it so listing in absence of tiger drilling at the beginning of every session is liable to find your pc getting lumpy in other words theyre liable not to go clear unless you do this thats the secret back of it youve got to keep the goal firing and keep the listing constant and regular and routine now lets get into selfauditing on listing can it be done yes if somebodys around to tiger drill the goal and if somebody holds the club over the pc and says you list these lines and that is it you dont list any other lines but these you could do this this is not necessarily optimum its probably long way from optimum but i can tell you already it can be done now how far this can be done is determinable by somebody sitting down and tiger drilling the goal into action at routine and regular intervals see but thats sort of on the emergency basis you understand thats getting out there to an emergency it can be done it isnt done well and one of the reasons it isnt done wellone of the reasons it isnt done well is because the pain and sen will appear on the wrong lines you got that sounds funny but the guy auditing himself is going into different valences and theres auditor to give him the commands so he skips over into other valences to give himself the command and he gives the command to another valence you got the idea and therefore you louse up where the pain and sen belong you got that figured out you know he goes into the oppose line to list the want you understand he goes into the want line to list the oppose so he gets the sen and the pain in the wrong places and this gets him awfully confused you see theres liability to that so selfauditing is different than being listed on it but theres possibility of doing so okay emergency situation all right now theres great deal to know about goals and goals listing and so forth and id better give you what i can think of right here in an awful hurry because it isnt down anyplace else now when you are proving out goal you will find that sen occurs sensation by which we mean motionsensation is pressureand misemotion and by the way sexual sensation all of those things occur on the suppress careful of and fail to reveal buttons and on invalidate suggest and mistake you get pain now youre somewhere close to the guys right goal or somewhere close to his goals channel when it behaves that way but on checkout of an actual goal you get pain the only place youll get sen is when youre hitting suppress careful of and fail to reveal youre liable to get some sen when youre running those but otherwise youre going to get pain and pain is dominant in checkout if youre checking out the right goal the pcs got pain thats dominant theres more pain there than there is sen and when you finally got it all the way checked out there is senno sen at all and only pain got that because just to some degree you havent tiger drilled it enough if hes still got sen you gotyou see how this is now dont worry about this too much if your imperfections of auditing and pcs outofsessionness and another thing leaves some sen on his right ear while his throat is being cut with very sharp knife repeatedly see dont worry about this just make sure for the rule of thumb that its lots of pn see hes got to have pn the pc who has pain while the goal is being checked out is not being checked out on his goal thats one very fast way of knowing about it but that by the way isnt enough to stop checking out goal you are honorbound to check goal until it neither has pain nor sen and that will keep you from erring anyway as long as hes got pain or sensation that began at the time you started checking the goalthat began during the course of your checking youve got to continue until there aint none in other words that doesnt mean youve got to continue the session till there isnt any but youve got to keep on that course of events session after session until there isnt any you understand because some goals might possibly go as long as six and half hours to fade thats horrible isnt it i did goal in washingtonwas marvelous made horrible liar out of i checked it for about an hour it wasnt firing beautifully but it sure looked like goal man it sure looked like goal it was to be totally aware man did that look like goal well i said thats good enough for nothing to it turns out that it was the principal ending on the pcs old goal it was modifier the pcs old goal went just before it it sounded just like goal you understand so of course it checked out hard and it moved back into the pcs old goal and of course it dropped out and the old goal stayed in but that was only because it was consecutive goal you got the idea it followed all the rulesmy god it had rocket reads and everything else thatdont make that shiver you to death on this because it only took anotherabout another half an hour or so took about an hour and half of fooling before that thing did fade and then this was all being done in the face of found goal see this wasnt verywould never be true of new goals this is patching it up youre running across all sorts of oddities in patching things up but you could hammer and pound away at goal and pound away and hammer at goal and have the thing fade have it go oh dear and youre about ready to pass in the checks and hand in your thetan and so forth when you all of sudden remember i told you in lecture in auditing on the goal to catch catfish and you brighten up and start tiger drilling it on that and it comes back and reads again and it is the goal after all and goals are heartbreakers to this degree they go in and they go out now pain this is the absolute rule if we can get as close to an absolute but it is an absolute to that degree just within this framework must be present pain must be present during checkout whatever else is happening some pains got to be there and in listing pain must be present when the goal has not been adequately tiger drilled listing occurs without pain even on the right goal and isnt running out anything you understand that you just set off and you dont tiger drill this goal and you just go on and listmmmm pc gets sen sen sen sen sen sen sen theres pain anyplace now thats also true of wrong goal dont you see right goal with the goal made to read at the beginning of the session on listing will give the pc pain there will be some pain and there will be some sensation but it must have pain whatever else happens there must be pain during the listing you understand you got to be alert to this so thats something else you have to look for while youre listing is the pc occasionally letting out feeble little yips if he isnt hes not all right oddly enough soundssounds funny you know but its true you say always before in this universe we have carefully avoided pain now we carefully avoid those things which dont give people pain probably youll have hard time raveling i think its about time though for the whole flow to reverse so youll probably do this very comfortably now theresthere are some musts there are some musts you start worrying during listing session when the pc is getting pain now understand we dont care what line the pain occurs on you understand just wipe out the old rule that its got to occur on one and three we dont care what line it occurs on as long as it occurs pain can occur on one and three pain can clearcan occur on two and four of any series why because pcs get in wrong valences they can be totally switched around on this and have pain gorgeously occurring on two and four and sensation roaring on one and three that is not meaningful its just the pc is stuck in another part of the bank at the moment and probably feeding the auditing command through to an old friendly valence that he had you know some old witch theres some circuitry going on some other things are occurring but these are the things to know about listing tiger drill it in run good smooth session ratatattat pocketapocketapocketapocketa pocketa and youll find out its very easy to do but the four per linefour items per lineand sixteen or more lines solve any problem youre having with listing it just goes off dead easy theres fumble theres sitting there waiting for the pc to think of another answer and arc breaking him because he went to sleep and you woke him upthere isnt any of this nonsense occurs in the session and of going on and on and on and running out of paper on one line and then having to go back and find some paper on another line and how many did you list where andpooey see this is all for the birds youll find listing is as easy as you keep it pocketapocketapocketa at an even groove see you say who or what and he gives you one and he doesnt seem to be in the mood to give you anymore you want to watch pc dont give him the command as hes saying one or youll get him all suppressed see and he gives you one and you give him the command and he gives you one you give him the command and he gives you one you give him the command and you give him onethats all and of course you acknowledge him each time he occurred and youll find the pc very rapidly gets up into this frame of mind you give him the command once he gives you four answers and you acknowledge see remember the answer doesntthe question never asks him for one see so its not disobedience of the auditing it doesnt ask him for one it says who or what and both of those are plural so normally he gets into groove like this you say who or what would want to catch catfish he gives you four who or what would not want to catch catfish he gives you four who or what would oppose catching catfish he gives you four who or what would not oppose catching catfish he gives you four you got it and you just acknowledge and write them down your pencil flying cheerio cheerio cheerio cheerio now some auditors wont like this they havent anyany boiloff periods in which to catch up their notes but you can really keep it flying and thats very fast clearing now what happens toward the end of this listingwhole series of sessions what happens what happens on the meter well it starts to go free what is free needle youll know it when you see it is free needle quarter of an inch wide is free needle half an inch wide is free needle dial wide does free needle have pattern to the left and right does free needle have pattern to the right and left well then what is free needle well free needle is free needle youve never seen anything like it till youve seen free needle theres describing it it looks like its floating on air or something its disconnected the auditorsone of the auditors first responses when he first sees free needle is to get hold of the cable see and check the cable and plug it in and out and then his worst mistake is to say hey hey hey look i got free needle on you when he turns it back again it isnt free it just floats thats all it doesnt float in any pattern that is what is peculiar about it see it doesnt have any pattern once in blue moon free needle appears to hit heart beats or it appears to hit breathing or it appears to hit something else but tight needle can also hit these things we dont care what it hits its free youthis would not happen but you could say the pc has just murdered his grandmother you ask him the question have you murdered your grandmother and the needle wont register see its nonregistering needle thats all it is and it floats now should the pc always be at his clear read as you come toward the end of listing sessions nope the thing will fly around as much as one and half divisions on the tone arm dial just before he goes clear totally the last two daysnow lets take up the grimness of listing sessions the last two days or three days of listing sessions are the worst the pc gets better and better and better and then stays along and is doing all right and is doing all right and is doing all right and then gets better and better and then is doing all right and is doing all right and then gets bit worse and then gets little more worse and then is doing better and hes doing fine and hes getting along all right and hes doing better and hes doing better and then he gets little bit worse and then he gets little bit worse and then he gets little bit worse and then he gets little bit worseand then he gets very worried and he gets very invalidated and hes not sure that youre the right auditor or those are the right lines or this is the right universe youve brought him down to point of stand and deliver youre within just probably dozens of items of the goal springing and hes thinking of this goal as really something this goal is real valuable all kinds of wild ideas are going through his head why did he ever start this clearing in the first place because look he obviously will never be able to catch catfish again if he gives this thing up and its terrible situation that hes run into and furthermore he wont have any game thats whats worrying him if he gives this goal up now then he wont have any game anymore and theres game to play except catching catfish and if he gives up the goal this is his logic if you want to call it such idiots logic seeif you stopped catif you gave up the goal to catch catfish then you would stop catching catfish then youd longer be interested in catching catfish so therefore theres only one game in the world which is catching catfish so this means therefore that you would only have one game and that would be gone which would leave you as gameless and this is not tolerable and this is something thats too horrible to contemplate and the pc giving up just the last last struggling linea few lines see few items so forth getreally gets in terrible state and you really have to persuade him through this then all of sudden why he says oh well there it goes therestheres thethereszazazazazatheres nothing there i guess he expected to meet somebody george washington because its just nothing and it just all went pfiff see theres nothing left and he says well geewhiz you know i feel good i feel wonderful this is terrific if youd ask him at that time would you like to go out and catch some catfish hed say sure ill go out and catch catfish its as good as doing anything else however i want to try whistling at blondes because hes already thinking about putting in the next postulate but thereitd take him long time to get it stacked up like that again and hes really not in good enough shape to put it in the way he did the first time anywayfortunatelythe situation isthis i want to impress this on youis the listing out of goal is not smooth snore it has its rough spots the pc will start to get somaticssharp impersistent that feel exactly like the original accident you know being stabbed in the back with knife feels like being stabbed in the back with knife and they get flinchy sometimes on somatics and then this passes away and then they dont care about it and they have to run out but they get flinchthey get so they flinch on these things and so forth and they do various things now the course of action of somatic is early on they tend to be rather dull and persistent dull and persistent fellows got head somatic and hell tell you day after day after day after day week after week after week after week aboutthis all depends on how long hes being audited or whether he is being audited at the timeabout how this pain in his head or this pain in his foot or this pain in his stomach is pretty bad you know its persistent and then you get to about the middle part of listing and they come on and they go off you know its they come on like turning up light by rheostat you know and they go off by shutting it down by rheostat you know it just gets dimmer and dimmer and there it goes all right now you get down to the end of the thing and man theyre on and theyre off with click of the switch see bang you know its gone it was here and it left that is symptom of winding up youre getting on down toward the end of listing when this is occurring and theyre getting sharper and theyre getting swifter and the pcs actually much more able to brace up to them and you know he doesnt care about them as much in spite of the fact it hurts like hell they occasionally will say yipe you know and this of course is why they resist getting clear its those last residual somatics now they actually are not resisting going clear at all they just dont quite like to face up to that thats why its good idea to have an auditor on listing somebodys going to list by himself off in northern saskatchewan or someplace and all thats very fine but hell hit one of these bogs or hell hit wonderful spot you know i feel wonderful theres nothe guy isnt clear yet but he feels wonderful be suspicious because its probably like inhaling the air and throwing out the arms on the upper edge of the grand canyon without watching where youre going that expansive outfling of the arms and that gorgeous inhalation of the ozone is very often accompanied by pale scream as he goes southward he hits the manic and he hits the depressive dont you see and hell be up feeling good again but halfway through with the lines not even vaguely listed out pc who begins to feel wonderful he just feels wonderful watch it man hes going to drag himself into session in the next day or so saying i feel terrible hes gone over these manic ridges and that sort of thing but he goes all the way through those things now of course when its allout clear you know when its clear because its blown hell tell you its blown many times too ii forgot to tell you that one its blown yeah comes in in the morning well we neednt list on that anymore i havent any more items for these lines because its blown you know you put him on the needle you know and there he is with good old stuck sticky needle you know you say well good just list enough to get let check this out you see and about the first two items hell give you itll be yipe ouch yaah and he wont mention anymore its having blown yeah anyway anyway the beauty of it is it all comes to pass and when he when hes through thatwhen hes through that series of jumps hes through it when the goal is actually clear the needle will stay free and continue to be free if youve listed all the lines all the way out it will continue to be free up till the time you find the next goal now in view of the fact that he knows youre going to find the next goal dont be too upset if he starts to look for it before you start to look for it and find the needle all going gummy its not going gummy on what you did its going gummy on what youre going to do and thats thats the way that goes how many goals it takes to go to ot i dont knowcant tell you at this time but its probably some finite number anyway there is the whole course of listing theres items theres the lot and thats listing session and thats how you do it listing can be done by hcas listing is not necessarily class iv auditor activity but it takes smooth auditing it takes very nice auditing it takes very good tr 2 to carry it through and of course the guy has to be kind of sharpie to keep the thing tiger drilled now if listing is being done on an hca level why there must be somewhere around supervising auditor that can occasionally take look at it because god knows what stream they will go aground on or howwhat shape those lines will get into and with bursts of enthusiasm theyve all of sudden added two extra lines onto the end of it and the goal to catchcatfish the pc also had an idea that he might have goal to be soulful see and theyve got dover sole and other things written down on this other line theyre liable to go astray you understand so you have to keep your eye on it and just keep them on the groove i gave you and the fellow will go clear and of course you know that free needles to date have been going clear on the four lines and just give you one idea of this they also have stacked up bit those people who have been fourline listed to free needle beon being given an indifferently patched up sixteenline list whistled sigh of relief and were very happy because parked someplace over on the northeast sector of the bank they had all these rabbits they hadnt been able to dispose of and they were very very happy to write those rabbits down on the list so that tells you that we were right in going in this particular way okay thank you
