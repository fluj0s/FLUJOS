what is credit default swap basically in credit default swap contract one party promises to pay another party if third party defaults the more technical definition of credit default swap is bilateral derivative contract that transfers from one party to another the risk that specified reference entity will experience credit event credit events may include default bankruptcy restructurin g or credit rating downgrade1 typically the protection buyer pays periodic fee to protection selle r in return for compensation if reference entity experiences credit event the reference entity such as large firm that has issued bond or trust that has issued mortgageback ed security mbs is not party to the credit default swap contract the original protection buyer does not need to have ever owned the reference debt being protected ther efore it is not necessary for the protection buyer to realize an actual loss in order to be eligible for compensation if credit eventhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22932crs2 occurs the maturity of the credit default swap does not have to match the maturity of the reference asset that is 10year bond may be protected by credit default swap that provides protection for only one year how are credit default swaps used historically credit derivatives were primarily used by banks to manage their credit exposure to large loan customers banks and other institutions transfer some or all of their credit risk to other parties through cr edit default contracts because the buyer is paying for protection against uncertain events credit default swaps perform similar economic function as insurance however there are differences first credit default swap contracts can be traded more easily than in surance policies second the protection buyer need never have had any asset at risk in order to purchase the swap and does not have to experience an actual loss from the credit event in order to collect the payment because credit default swaps can be originated bought and sold by parties with direct exposure to the reference asset credit default swap markets are sometimes compared to gambling however specialized lender that is overe xposed in one economic sector may wish to participate in credit default swaps for bonds of firms in other economic sectors in order to manage risk therefore it can be difficult to distinguish gambling from diversification what is an example of credit default swap financial institu tion buys 1 million bond issued by large manufacturing company the financial institution wants to protect itself from the credit risk of the bond but wants to retain other features the fi nancial institution coul d pay third party to protect the bond in case of credit event such as actual default or merely downgrade of the manufacturing companys bonds by credit rating agency for the sake of this example assume the financial instituti on pays the protecti on seller 1000 annually in return for promise from the protection seller to pay the financial institution the cash value of the loss from the credit event cash payout the protection contract is credit default swap and can be trad ed in derivatives markets in this scenario trouble in the manufact uring industry causes credit rating agency to lower the rating of the bonds after two years as result the market value of the bonds falls by 12000 in this case the financia l institution will have paid two 1000 payments and had the value of its bond asset fall by 12000 it would receive 12000 from the protection seller the net result for the financial institution is loss of the value of the 2000 in nnual fees rather than the 12000 loss from the credit event note that the financial institution does not ve to sell the bond at the new lower price and experience an actual loss in order to collect the credit default swap payment although it is common practice to create cr edit default swap that fully covers the loss due to the credit event parties can contract for any payment they wish in the example the parties could have set the protection payment ahead of time such as 10000 payment in case of the credit event rath er than the change in the value of the bond 12000 the parties may also contract for physical delivery of the reference asset the bond at prespecified pr ice that has the same effect as protecting the protection buyer from loss in valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22932crs3 2 credit default swaps into the mainstream ge asset management spring 2005what is notional princi pal or notional amount in general the notional principal or tional amount of derivative contract is hypothetical underlying quantity upon which intere st rate or other payment obligations are computed for credit default swap the tional principal is th reference amount set in the contract note that the notional am ount is significantly different from the dollar value the credit default swap puts at risk in the above example the notional amount was 1 million but the promised payment amounted only to 12000 the market value of credit default swap is more closely linked to the relative values of the annual fee and the protection payment than to the notional am ount the aggregate notional amount of credit default swaps has grown significantly according to the bank of international settlements bis the total notional amount of cred it default swaps was 579 trillion in december 2007 the gross market value of those swaps was 20 trillion which was 35 of the notional amount what is reference entity the reference entity in credit default swap contract is the entity that is the subject of credit event in the above example th reference entity is the manufacturing company because the trigger for the credit default swap is change in the credit status of bonds it issued note that the manufacturing company is not party to the credit default swap contract who participates in the credit default swap market historically banks have had the largest ma rket share in credit default swaps both as buyers of protection and as sellers of protection2 other significant participants both as buyers and sellers of protec tion include securities firms monoline insurance firms and hedge funds on much smaller scale pensi on funds corporations and mutual funds also participate what is the isda and what does it do the isda is the international swaps and derivatives association created in 1985 isda is an industry organization that seeks to identify and reduce the sources of risk in the derivatives and risk management busine ss the organization provides information on best practices such as standardized contr act forms and documentation industry surveys and statistics amicus briefs in court cases and s imilar information the isda master agreement provides market participants one avenue to standardize contracts agree on settlement procedures nd terms and limit the risk that c ounterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations do credit default swaps create systemic risk although there is single agreedupon finition of systemic risk it generally refers to the risk that the financial system will multiply the problems of one institution to many other institutions including those that are otherwise solvent and liquid systemichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22932crs4 3 for discussion of operational issues in managing complex payment exchanges see crs report rl33639 sources of systemic risk in large value interbank payment systems by edward vincent murphyconcerns of credit default swaps like many financial derivatives often refer to five attributes first derivatives could be used to increase the risk that banks and other financial intermediaries face rather than transfer risk to parties in better position to sustain risk second the sellers of protec tion may not be adequa tely capitalized to honor their commitments if many defaults occur at the same time third derivatives contracts are very complex and may be misused by inexperienced though sophisticated market participants fourth the notional value of derivatives greatly exceeds bank capital so change in the value of credit default swaps could greatly weaken the capital of the banking system triggering significant c ontraction in lending for investment and consumer spending fifth tracking counter party obligations in the market can create challenges for processing the trades and may overwhelm the system if defaults occur simultaneously on wide scale3 the five factors discussed above are not mutually exclusive leverage refers to the ratio of firms assets to its capital banking regulators impose regulatory and riskbased capital standards that limit leverage in the banking system one use of credit default swap is for banks as protection buyers to reduce the credit risk that they face this could allow the banks to more easily meet their capital standards and increase their overall leverage if protection sellers have not adequa tely prepared for losses then wave of credit events could overwhelm protection llers put in question their ability to honor their commitments and lower the value of the credit default swaps held by the banks because the credit default swap market is so large relative to bank capital the reduction in the value of the swaps could significantly damage the banking system similarly if credit default swaps became difficult to trad then their value according to markto market accounting rules would have to be discounted which could erode financial institution capital even if the institutions had intention of selling them it may be the case that market participants and regulators have adequately prepared for the risks associated with credit default swaps those who take this position might argue that participants in the credit default swap market are overwhelmingly banks hedge funds and similar organizations that have access to highly sophisticated expertise similarly these institutions are most aware of the potential risks in the credit default swap market others might respond that individual financial institutions might not have the incentive to fully prepare for the risks if they believe they will be aided in time of crisis how have credit default swaps been used in securitization in securitization debt instruments such as mortgages or auto loans are pooled into trust and the resultant cash flow is sliced into tranches and sold to investors as securities credit default swaps have been used to 1 enhance the credit rating of individual tranches and 2 provide protection to or iginators who backstop the entire structure in this case backstop refers to originators who retain an equity position first loss in the structure promise to repurchase or swap nonperforming loans or provide other credit enhancement for the securitization in some cases first loss position might itself be securitized as collateralized debt obligation cdo with its own set of tranches enhanced by

swaps the overthecounter market where credit fault swaps are traded is not directly overseen by federal financial re gulators on the other hand the use of credit default swaps by the institutions with the largest market share banks is regulated more specifically the risk management practices of banks are s ubject to direct superv ision by the federal regulators who coordinate through the federal financial institutions examinations council ffiec5 use of credit default swaps nd other complex derivatives is concentrated in the largest commercial banks most of which are federally chartered institutions regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ which is member of ffiec because the efficiency of the overthecounter derivatives market affects the safety and soundne ss of federally chartered ba nks the occ spends considerable amount of time nd resources evaluating the risk control systems these banks use to manage risk in derivatives markets6 the occ is not the only institution with an interest in monitoring and proposing changes to credit default swaps and related markets the securities and exchange commission sec for example has conduc ted notice and comment rulemaking for credit default swap options on the chicago board options exchange7 also the federal reserve bank of new york has been working with the isda to facilitate the tracking of counterparty
