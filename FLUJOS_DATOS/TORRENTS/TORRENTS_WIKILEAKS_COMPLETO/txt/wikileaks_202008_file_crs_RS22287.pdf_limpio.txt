the president to require emergency leasing authority an emergency lease may not be fo r more than 180 days without congressional approval of prospectus for the lease11 especially severe circumstances however may have ramifications that extend well beyond 180 days for example hurricane katrin which struck the gulf coast on august 29 2005 caused significant property and infra structure damage to 83 gsaowned and leased federal buildings and courthouses in louisiana alabama and mississippi the damage necessitated the even tual relocation of 2600 federa l employees from 28 federal agencies12

or even accessible roads to reach the federal facilities the storm also resu lted in environmental conditions that might have threatened the health and safety of fede ral employees in the affected

lease will not exceed the threshol d for congressional pros pectus approval if the threshold is not exceeded the term of emergencyrelated leases may exceed 180 days without triggering the timeconsuming proce ss of preparing presenting and obtaining congressional approval for prospectus on the other hand gsa says that constraining the needs to be met by the emergency lease can and does lead to relocating some displaced agencies in work space that is less than fully satisfactory13 congressional committees in both chambers agreed that the 180day limitation on emergency leases of space for displaced agencies was problematic in the 109th congress the senate committee on envi ronment and public works proposed increasing the maximum term of emergency leases to 180 days to five years saying past experience with emergency leasing s howed that 6month lease term 180 days for prospectuslevel space was unattainable due to the reluctance of building owners to agree to such shortterm leases for ffice space with gsa because competitors are able to offer longer lease terms in add ition to this challenge posed by the market circumstances arising from natural disasters or other unforeseen events will likely necessitate locating displaced federal wo rkers in emergency housing solutions for greater than the currently allowed 180 days14 the house committee on transportation and infrastructure also recommended an increase to five years for emergency leases related to hurricanes katrina and rita both committees reported b ills to their respective chambers15 but by the end of the 109th congress neither chamber had taken final action and both bills died proposals before the 110th congress to date in the 110th congress legislation has been introduced to amend pros pectus thresholds for lease construction or repair federal f acilities under emergency circumst ances however on march 13 2008 the general services administra tion sent to congress comp rehensive legislative proposal to improve the federal government by increasing its efficiency and effectiveness16 the proposal would among other things lengthen the maximum term of an emergency lease that does not require congressi onal approval of prospectus from 180 days to five years the gsa proposal has not been formally in troduced in either chamber of congress outlook for the 111th congress as noted above gsa has found that following major emergencies and disaster s local lessors will not offe r 180day leases for displaced federal agencies when displ aced commercial and other privat tenants are willing to agree to longer leases such market behavior is not likely to change but the current statutory prospectus requirement for longer leases can potentially impede speedy response and recovery action by gsa

proposal to extend the term of emergency leases to five years appendix legislation in the 109th congress s 1708 on september 15 2005 senator james inhofe and 11 bipartisan cosponsors introduced s 1708

shuster and two bipartisan cosponsors introduced hr 4125 the b ill would have authorized the gsa administrator to make repairs on federal buildings that were damaged by gulf coast hurricanes without

administrators emergency authorities would have been valid for one year following enac tment of hr 4125 at least five days before making any building repairs the gsa adminis trator would have been required to submit reports to the house transportation and infrastructure committee and the senate environment and public works committee detailing costs and completion estimates later than 15 days
