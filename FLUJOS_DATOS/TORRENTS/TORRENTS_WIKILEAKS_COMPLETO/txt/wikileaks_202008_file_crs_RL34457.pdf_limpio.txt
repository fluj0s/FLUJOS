something else summary under the conservation reserve progra m crp owners and operators of eligible land may enter into contract with the secretary of agriculture to enroll land in the program and convert it to less intensive use under an approved conservation plan in return participants receive an annual payment th at the statute refers to as rent legislation establishing and extendi ng the program has been silent as to the appropriate tax treatment of these payments for many years the internal revenue service irs generally treated the payments as farming income when received by someone who was engaged in the trade or bus iness of farming but as rental income when received by others the irss position appears to have changed to one that would treat all conservation reserve program payments as farming income and thus subject to selfemployment tax recently the ir s published proposed revenue ruling that explains its treatment of crp payments as income from the trade or business of farming and thus subject to selfemployment tax currently case law provides some suppor t for the irss position that the crps annual rental payments are not rent that is excludible from selfemployment tax this case law has not however considered crp payments received by individuals who were not previously engaged in farming and who have purchased property and immediately enrolled it in the crp or agreed to continue the enrollment begun by the previous owneroperat or neither have courts considered crp payments to those who hire third parties to perform activities required by the crp contract the possibility that the payments may not constitute selfemployment income even if they do not qualify as excludible rent has not been considered by either the courts or the irs neither has yet considered the statutory requirement that all payments must be returned if the contract is terminated the heartland habitat harvest and horticulture act of 2007 s 2242 introduced in the 110th congress contained provisions that would exclude crp payments from selfemployment income for some taxpayers and would allow all recipients to choose to recei ve tax credit in lieu of the payments

reserve program1 is federal program originally intended to remove highly erodible croplands from production for periods of 10 to 15 years participants in the program agree to remove the land from production and follow an approved conservation pl an the program was establis hed by the food security act of 19852 originally enacted to be in ffect through 1990 it has been extended repeatedly3 the most recent extension was through the end of 20074 but legislation proposed in the 110th congress would extend it through 20125 participants in the program receive annual payments based on the acreage they have enrolled in the program early rmination of the crp contract requires repayment of all amounts th participant has received6 the applicable statute refers to the annual payments as rental

the position that crp annual payments received by farmers were to be included as selfemployment income along with other farm income and therefore subject to selfemployment tax the payments were treated by the irs as rental income when received by nonfarmers over the years the irs has expanded its position regarding crp payments and selfemployment taxes11 in december 2006 the irs issued notice of proposed revenue ruling that takes the position that virtually all crp nnual rental payments are subject to selfemployment taxes12 the notice has been responded to by congress as well as by others13 this report outlines the evolution of the irss position along with relevant case law and legislative history it also provides comparisons to treatment of income from other sources where that income has some similarity to crp payments tax treatment by the internal revenue service and the courts taxpayers and the internal revenue service have generally agreed that crp payments must be included in gross income and are subject to income tax however there has been conflict regarding whether the payments should be considered income from farming and therefore subj ect to selfemployment tax the selfemployment tax rate is 153 many participants would prefer that their crp payments be excluded from selfemployment tax treatment other individuals may want to increase their eligibility for social security benefits by including the payments in selfemployment income the irs to varying degrees has treated the payments as includible selfemployment income treatment by irs before 1996 until 1996 the irs treated crp payments as selfemployment income for those who were otherwise engaged in the trade or business of farming for all others the payments were treated as rental payments and were not subject to selfemployment tax this treatment was similar to that in an earlier revenue ruling14 for payments received under the soil bank act15 in distinguishing between those who we re engaged in the trade or business of farming and all others it ppears that the irs looked at the participants activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34457crs3 16 irs priv ltr rul 8822064 mar 7 1988 17 76 tcm 48 1998 18 72 tcm 780 1996 19 76 tcm 48 20 the nature of these expenses is unclear upon examination the irs allocated only some of the expenses to the crp income saying that these were the only expenses directly connected with the maintenance of the crp land hasbrouck 76 tcm 48 21 it is unclear which tax returns were examined the case refers to 1990 1992 and 1994 as the years for which deficiencies were termined but states that the couples 1992 1993 and 1994 tax years were examined hasb rouck v commr 76 tcm 48 1998just before enrolling land in the program participant who had leased his land to tenant from march 1 1984 to march 1 1985 then farmed it himself for year and subsequently leased it again from ma rch 1 1986 to march 1 1987 was considered retired from the business of farming when he enrolled his land in the crp in 198716 at the time the participant was 71 years old since he had previously farmed the land personally it is possible that the irss position might have been different had he been younger and therefore not of retirement age 1996 shift in tax treatment in 1996 the irs changed its position regarding crp payments received by those not otherwise engaged in the trade or business of farming initia lly this shift was signaled by the irss concession in hasbrouck v commissioner 17 to taxpayers who had traditional farming activity either before or after ac quiring the crp land the ta xpayers had reported the crp payments on schedule f and after deducting expenses cl aimed loss from farming the irs attributed its concession to th tax courts ruling in another case ray v commissioner 18 however since ray involved taxpayer who was involved in farming and ranching outside of his crp involvement it is unclear why the results in ray led to the concession in hasbrouck hasbrouck v commissioner generally participants pay less in total taxes if their crp payments are treated as rent income rather than as farm income because they do not have to pay selfemployment tax on rental income however when taxpayers have expenses connected to the land that exceed their crp income their tax burden may be lower if they treat the crp payments as farm income this was the case in hasbrouck in hasbrouck couple purchased land in 1987 that had been enrolled in the crp by the previous owner19 the taxpayers chose to continue that enrollment they incurred significant expenses which they maintained were related to the conservation plan for the crp land they then reported their annual crp payments on schedule f even though they were not ot herwise engaged in the trade or business of farming on schedule f they deducted expenses they incurred which exceeded the income from the crp20 in 1995 the couples tax returns were examined by the irs21 the examination report denied the sses claimed on schedule f the report explained because the amount of income you receive each year is fixed by the federal government amount of effort or management skill on your part

involved different criteria from thos involved in determining whether one was in the trade or business of farming hasbrouck 76 tcm 48 24 hasbrouck 76 tcm 48 25 fees and costs were denied because the court found that the irss position that the taxpayers had not established that they were actively engaged in the trade or business of farming was substantially justified hasbrouck 76 tcm 48 26 ray v commr 72 tcm 780 1996increase it therefore it has been determined that at this point in your operation you are not yet in business22 the report went on to say that because the taxpayers were not in the business of farming use of the schedule f wa s inappropriate the couple appealed the irs determinati on providing copies of letters received each year from the agricultural stabiliza tion and conservation service office for their county these letters stated that their farm operating plan for each year had been reviewed and it had been determined that they were actively engaged in farming operation23 after receiving notice of deficiency the hasbroucks petitioned the us tax court just before filing their petiti on the couple received letter from an irs problems resolution officer who advised th em that title 16 of the us code specifically designates crp payments as rental payments24 before the case was heard by the tax court the irs conceded the case allowing the losses the couple had claimed on their tax returns it proceeded as claim for attorneys fees and costs thus providing public record of the underlying facts in the tax controversy25 ray v commissioner in ray as in hasbrouck the taxpayers purchased land that had been enrolled in the crp by the previous owner and they chose to continue in the program however like the hasbroucks who arguably had current farming activity mr ray was farm er and rancher who already owned and operated other farmland th tax court found that the crp acreage was added to his existing farmland and since he was already in the business of farming and ranching this was payment to him in connection with his ongoing trade or business26 post1995 guidance from the irs since neither tax returns nor irs examination reports are genera lly available to the public there is way to know for certain whether the irs began after ray and hasbrouck to treat crp payments as selfemployment income for those who were not otherwise engaged in the trade or business of farming however 1997 market segment specialization audit technique guide for farming indicated that proper treatment of crp payments

retired farmer who would ve rented the land out had it not been enrolled in the conservation reserve program nothing about proposed alternative uses for the land was mentioned however in the farmers tax guide for 1996 that irs publication indicated that the annual crp payment is farm income re ported on schedule f however if you do not materially participate in farming operations on the land the annual payment is rental income which you report on form 483528 in contrast the same guide for tax year 1995 stated the annual crp payment is receipt from farm operations reported on schedule f however if you do not materially participate in production or management of production of the farm pr oducts on your land the annual payment is rental income which you report on form 483529 the change in the irs publication for taxpayers seems to indicate that the irs adopted the view that simply having nd enrolled in the crp was itself farming operation which would be lfemployment income so long as the taxpayer materially participated in that operation essentially the taxpayers view in hasbrouck 1998 shift by the tax court wuebker v commissioner in 1998 in wuebker v commissioner 30 the us tax

he also farmed separate land under sharecrop agreement31 the first year of the crp contract th taxpayer established ground cover as required by the contract this involved fi rst disking the 214 acres and then planting seed according to the court little or upkeep was performed in later years32 in finding that the crp payments received by the taxpayer were rent and not subject to selfemployment tax the court recognized that congress intended the exclusion of rent from selfemployment income to apply only for use of space and by implication such services as are requi red to maintain the space in condition for occupancy33 in cases where additional services are provided that are so substantial that the payments received include compensation for those services the entire amount is included as selfemployment inco rather than being excluded as rent34 the court pointed out that the statut the regulations and the crp contract identify the payments as rental payments or rent the crp statute and regulations repeatedly and consistently refer to th annual payments as rent or rentals35 the court noted that rent gene rally referred to compensation for either the occupancy or use of land36 the crp contract placed restrictions on the taxpayers use of the land which the court pparently viewed as another sort of use37 the court found that the primary purpose of the crp contract was to achieve envi ronmental benefits38 by restricting usage and that the services required from the taxpayer were not substantial and were inci dental to the primary purpose of the contract39 therefore the payments qualified as rent that was excludible from selfemployment incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34457crs7 40 wuebker v commr 205 f3d 897 6th cir 2000 41 wuebker 205 f3d at 904 42 wuebker 205 f3d at 904 43

for position that the government was using the land by restricting the taxpayers use of that land but believed that such an argument impermissibly stretches the plain meaning of the term use especially in light of th narrow construction re quired of the rentals fromrealestat exclusion41 it stated that it was not compelled to conclude that the crp payments were rentals even though refe rences in the crp statute regulations and contract might fa vor such conclusion42 the irs had argued that the nature of the payments rather than the label placed on them should lead to conclusion that they were not excludible rent and the court agreed43 it supported its conclusion that the payments had the form but not the s ubstance of rental payments with the language of the crp statute in setting forth the crp payment rules congress expressly qualified its use of the term rental by providing that the amounts payable in the form of rental payments under contracts entered into may be determined through the submission of bids or through other means44 the dissent however believed that the substantial and wideranging limitations45 the crp imposed on the taxpayers use of the land resulted in the sort of use by the government that would be compatible with the ordinary meaning of rent the appeals court also disagreed with the tax courts finding that the maintenance services provided by the taxpayer were legally insignificant the appeals courts finding does not addres s the actual extent of the taxpayers maintenance services the finding app ears to be based only on what the court deemed to be the programs essence to prevent participants from farming the property and to require them to perform various activitie s in connection with the land both at the start of the program nd continuously throug hout the life of the contract46 although the tax court had cite d both senate and house report47 to support its conclusion that the pr imary purpose of the crp is to

the guide provides exceptions to that treatment it appears that the irs has shifted its position regarding crp payments again although in 1997 the taxpayers material participation in the farm operations was cited in irs publications as determining whether the crp payments were subject to selfemployment tax the irs seems to now take the position that material participation in providing required services under th crp is irrelevant in determining whether the payments are subj ect to selfemployment tax in 2006 the irs proposed revenue ruling that indicates an intent to treat crp payments as self employment income even if the participants only farming activity was being participant in the conservation reserve progra m even if the participant hired third party to perform all required activities52 2003 chief counsel advice cca came to conclusions about crp payments and selfemployment tax that are similar to those in the proposed revenue ruling53 though they do not extend to include payments received by those who do not materially participate the cca relied on two revenue rulings54 and an announcement55 to support its position that crp payments are includible in self employment income whether or not the recipient was otherwise engaged in the trade or business of farming each of the cite d sources was released before the inception of the conservation reserve program th ey each addressed payments received under different government program the two revenue rulings are discussed later in this report56 the cca appears to be the first time the announcement was

questions regarding the pik program58 and other land diversion pr ograms that are sponsored by the department of agriculture the firs t two questions address estate tax issues and in doing so the answer to the first states that participation in the program will be treated as material participation in the operation of farm with respect to the diverted acres the third question addr esses selfemployment tax the answer states farmer who receives cash or payment in kind from the department of agriculture for participation in land diversion program is liable for self employment tax on the cash or payment in kind received59 generally irs announcements carry very little authority they are not published in the cumulative bulletin cb but appear only in the weekly internal revenue bulletin irb some might question using such weak authority as the basis for position regarding crp payments that appears to have support in either statutory or case law the announcement pr edates the crp statut but was not used as basis for the irss position on crp payments until the 2003 cca additionally although the announcement is compatible with the irss early treatment of crp payments it does not clearly support the pos ition that all who receive crp payments are subject to selfemployment tax on the payments instead it refers to farmer who receives payments60 the cca admitted that there are hazards of litigation in asserting that receipt of crp payments denotes operation of trade or business the facts of an individual case could lead court to determine that the taxpayer was not engaged in trade or business hazards exist both when the re quired activities under th crp contract are minimal as well as when the participants were not farmers before enrolling land in the crp the irs acknowledged that the re is case law or guidance that has held that an individual is considered to have entered into the trade or business of farming by merely enteri ng into crp contract61 there is case law that holds that factual determination is required in every case to determine whether taxpayer is engaged in trade or business62 despite this in issuing notice 2006108 the irs has publicly indicated its intention to dopt the position that entering into the crp contract means that one is in the trade or business of farming and that the payments are selfemployment

minimum such personal services as daily housekeeping and maintenance they also generally involve rental periods of less than thirty days similarly beach hous and other vacation getaways are often rented for less than thirty days at time and generally include cooking utensils and linens as well as furnishings they of ten include books games and magazines and may include cleaning during the occupanc period some may include even more substantial services and all generally incl ude cleaning between occupants in other words they include more extensive furnishings and more substantial services than standard residential real estate that is rented on monthly or yearly basis both hotelmotels and recreational rental lodgings are considered businesses74 and to the extent owned by individuals rather than co rporations the income is subject to self employment tax on the other hand longterm rentals of both commercial and residential properties where the average rental period is

the property in condition for occupancy the income is by definition passive75 rather than from an active trade or business even when the owner materially participates easement income easements are real estate concept76 most easements are positive easements but there can be negative ones as well positive easement allows person or entity that does not own the land to use the land in certain ways frequently the owner of one piece of property the dominant property may be granted an easement by the owner of another piece of property the servient property to use the servient property for access to the dominant property another sort of positive easement is public utility easement that allows the utility company to use the land to install lines or pipes to deliv er utilities to series of properties negative easements on the other hand do not allow an outside party to use the owners land instead they restrain owners from using their own land in certain ways specified in the easement in this case the easement holder may be an adjacent land owner or may be some other third party in the case of both positive and negative easements the owners generally remain responsible for maintaining their propert in many jurisdictions required maintenance would include mowing and pest control easements though they often involve tran sfers of money to the property owners do not result in selfemployment income and frequently do not result in income at all for income tax purposes77 instead money paid for permanent easements reduces the effective amount the owner has invested in th property this is referred to as tax basis it becomes important when the property is sold because decrease in tax basis will result in an increase in gain from the sale compensation for temporary

reach the conclusion that payments for grain storage are selfemployment income when received for storing grain produced by the stor age owner but are re nt when that grain was produced by third party even if the grain is crop share so long as the storage owner did not materially participate in the cropsharing arrangement the situation addressed was one in which farmer grew grain and received price support loan on it through the commod ity stabilization service css under the loan agreement he was to store the grain for fixed period of time when that period was up he was asked to continue storing it and his loan period was extended the css agreed to set fee per bushel of grain for the storage the ruling points out that the agreement extending the loan period had language to indicate that the

compensate the milk producer for lost receipts from two sources these sources were 1 the diffe rence between the actual sale price of the cows for slaughter or export and the high er price the cows would have commanded if sold for dairy purposes and 2 the dairy production revenue lost when dairy operations were terminated to the extent that revenue was lost on the sale of the cows the payments

remainder of the payments received were to be treated as replacement for milk producti on income and reported on schedule f these amounts would be selfemployment income and thus subject to self employment tax the notice provides explanation for how the irs arrived at its explanation of the purpose of the compensation or why it determined that the payments were to be attributed first to sales of business assets the statute required participating producers to furnish information about ma rketing history size and composition of the dairy herd during that marketing hist ory and the size and composition of the dairy herd at the time the bid to participate was submitted85 it seems likely that it would have been easier to accurately calculate lost dairy sales revenue than lost revenue from the sale of the dairy cows however the provision may not have shielded much of the payments from selfemployment tax the notice put the burden on the taxpayer to show that portion of the payments received was compensation for selling the cows as nondairy cows and th erefore for less than if they had been sold as dairy cows at the same time and place comparison of crp payments to other types of income rental real estate in 1960 revenue ruling the irs found that payments made by steel company to owners of farm s were rent from real estate that could be excluded from selfemployment income even though the owners right to use the land was not restricted and the owners were obligated to maintain the land86 i n comparison crp participants are also re quired to maintain their enrolled land but their use of that land is very restricted the situation that was presented in the revenue ruling was one in which the companys plant discharged various gase s and fumes and the company wanted to insulate itself from liability for damage to livestock crops and other farm property to do so it entered into leases for rights to the farm land however these leases did not restrict the farmers us of those lands but provided that the company would not be liable for any damages unless due to ne gligence the farmers were allowed full use of their lands but they were not requi red to continue using them they were however required to maintain the land such that it did not grow up in weeds or sprouts the only way in which the steel company used the land was through the gases etc that emanated from the plant th irs found that limited use was sufficient to carve out of the owners interest certain estate in the land the maintenance services required under the cont ract were apparently irrele vant to the irs since they were not mentioned at all in the disc ussion of why the amounts paid constituted rentals from real estate that were not included in selfemployment

placing restrictions on the use of property enrolle d in the crp is using the property and payments made could be consid ered rent it could be argued that just as the steel company in the revenue ruling carved out an estate in the land from the owners interest the government carves out an estate in the land from the owners interest when it restricts the owners use of the land under the crp if one accepts that argument the question becomes whether the services required under the contract are of such magnitude that compensation for them can be said to constitute material part of the payments87 made under the contract if so the entire payment should be cons idered income from selfemployment88 but if not none of the payment should be subject to selfemployment tax in the case of the steel company the irs apparently did not consider maintaining the land free of weeds and sprouts to be services that required consideration in its analysis of the nature of the payments made to the land owners in wuebker the tax court recounted the services provided by the taxpayer under the crp contract and found them minimal the sixth circuit court however found the services legally significant without explaining why t hose services were however addressed in explaining why there was nexus between the crp payments and the taxpayers farming activity on ot her land the new revenue ruling proposed by the irs refers to these services saying that the circuit court noted that the taxpayers were required under the crp contract to perform tasks intrinsic to the farming trade or business eg tilling seed ing fertilizing and weed control that required the use of their farmin g equipment if it is pertinent that the tasks involved are intrinsic to the farming trade and pertinent that the equipment used is also used in the farming trade could it also follow that an owner of residential property that is rented out might have to include the rent as part of income from selfemployment if that owner were plumber electric ian or carpenter nd provided routine maintenance that involved tasks intrinsic to the owners trade particularly if using the same equipment used in that trade if not why are the tasks or equipment pertinent in determining that crp payments are income from selfemployment further consideration is the extent to which the annual rental payments actually include payment for services th farm service agency fsa which is part of the us department of agricu lture usda establishes maximum rental rate for each offer participants may offer their

per acre to 12544 per acre91 crp annual payments vary pending upon the type of land and the location of that land not on services provided the payments do not exceed the fair market rental for the land this leav the question open as to how and why the irs has determined that the payments are for services and subject to selfemployment tax easements the crp does not acquire legal easement when it enrolls land in the program however the limitations placed on the use of the enrolled land are similar to limitations on land use when negative easement is in pl ace92 crp payments amount to 18 billion annually if the crp acquired permanent easement these payments would in most cases reduce the owners basis in the land resulting in immediate tax revenue to offset the payments however reasonable unrestricted use of the enrolled land revert s to the owneroperator at the end of the enrollment period therefore even if the crp held legal easement it is likely that the payments would be treated as currently taxable rental payments rather than being nontaxable to the extent that they did not exceed the basis of the land soil bank program payments revenue ruling 60 32 addressed payments received under the soil bank act nd concluded that they were to be included in self employment income when received by those who were otherwise engaged in the trade or business of farming because they replaced income the recipients would have generated from farming the land93 similar reasoning has been used by the irs to support its position regarding crp payments in discussing crp payments the irs s said that the annual rental payments have the substantive effect of providing owners and operators with compensation for the potential income from their land had they devoted such land to the production of an agricultural commodity94 however nothing in the statutory language for the conservation reserve program either states or implies that the payments are being made to compensate for the participants loss of commodity income on the other hand the soil bank act explicitly states that compensation shall provide producers with fair and reasonable return for reducing their acreage of the commodity taking into consideration the loss of production of the commodity on the reserve acreage any savings in cost whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34457crs17 95 pl 84540 70 stat

the form of rental payments the legislative history gives indication that the payments were rent in form only both the house report and the conference report refer to the payments as rent96 use of the substance over form doctrin to invalidate for tax purposes the form given to transaction by congress is an unusual application of the doctrine the doctrine is one that is generally used when the taxpayer was able to influence the form of transaction choosing one with favorable tax conse quences rather than another with less favorable ones even though that form might better reflect the real substance of the transaction97 in the case of crp paym ents participants have influence over the form of the transaction instead it is the government that chose the form of the transaction it is arguable th at participants may ve relied on congresss description of the transaction and its accompanying tax consequences when choosing to enroll their land in the crp grain storage revenue ruling 65149 found that grain storage fees were includible as selfemployment income when there was language in the agreement to indicate that the commodity stabiliza tion service was leasing space and paying

use of the enrolled land the participant does not have full dominion and control over the nd even the right to freely transfer the land is limited since if the land is transferred to anyone who chooses not to continue the enrollment repayment of all payments will generally be required dairy termination program payments irs notice 8726 found that payments received under the da iry termination program were not includible in self employment income to the extent that they represented compensation for the lower prices received when dairy cows were sold for slaughter or export the statute

the payments as rent instead over the years it has used different interpretations to support inclusion of the crp paym ents in selfemployment income initially the irs treated the payments as for lost income from crop production when received by farmers for those who were not engaged in farming the payments were treated as rent but even that treatment may have been as compensation for lost income in that nonfarmer might otherwise have rented the land out99 unlike the dtp the crp has never require d participants to provide information regarding either the income they had derived from the land before enrolling it in the crp or other income they might receive if the land were not enrolled more recently the irss position seems to ve shifted to one that considers the crp payments to be compensation for rvices performed under the terms of the contract this leaves at l east two questions unanswered why do the payments for services remain the same even though the extent of those services may vary greatly from year to year why must the entire amount be repaid if the contract is terminated early examining the unexamined factor the repayment requirement both the internal revenue service and the tax court have repeatedly looked at crp payments to determine whether they should be included in selfemployment income or excluded under the rental income exclusion in so doing neither has looked at the requirement that all payments received by participants whether as annual rental payments or as costshare payments for the cons ervation plan generally must be repaid if the contract is terminated before it expires100 termination may occur if the participant violates term or condition of the contract101 termination also occurs if owneroperators transfer their rights and interests in the contracted land unless the transferee agrees to assume the contract102 however repayment is not required in two situations 1 the land is purchased by or for the united states fish and wildlife service103 or 2 the secretary of agriculture and the new owneroperator agree to modifications that are in line with the programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34457crs19 104 id 105 26 usc 1341 106 see treas reg 113411 for further disc ussion and examples of calculations 107 if the repayment were large enough to result in net operating loss in the year of repayment some of the selfemployment tax previously paid might be recouped through net operating loss carryback 108 for discussion of claim of right see bittker et supra note 94 4031 at 48 to 9objectives104 assuming that their tax returns were filed in compliance with the irss position on crp annual paymen ts participants paid both income and self employment tax on the annual payments that must be repaid if the contract is terminated the internal revenue code irc provi des possible income tax solution for those who have included amounts in taxable income and after the close of that tax year repaid all or part of the amount previously received105 in this situation taxpayer may be allowed to duct the amount repaid in the year it is repaid if the amount is over 3000 the irc allows taxpayer s to compare the income tax savings from the deduction to the income tax savi ngs that would have occurred had the amount not been included in income in th year it was received and recoup the larger tax savings106 there does not however appear to be similar provision for recapturing the selfemployment tax paid on those previously taxed but repaid amounts participants who are actively engaged in farming outside of their crp land may be able to recoup both the income tax and selfemployment tax paid on the crp annual payments that must be repaid after termination if the participants net income from farming is equal to or greater than the amount repaid it appears that the self employment tax might be reduced in the repayment year to the same degree that it was increased in the years in which the crp payments were included in income if however the participant had selfemployment income other than the crp payments the selfemployment tax for the ear of repayment would be zero but this would not recapture selfemployment tax paid in earlier years107 thus though some participants who must repa crp annual payments may be able to recoup some or all of the selfemployment taxes paid in previous years such recoupment is not certain for all participants amending prior years tax returns to remove the crp payments does not provide way to recoup either income or selfemploymen t tax crp payments are received under claim of right108 at the time the payments were received the taxpayer had an unqualified right to the pa yment as such the payments cannot be removed from income for the tax year in which they were received even if they are later repaid the requirement to repay all crp payments that were received raises at least two issues first is the equitable issue regarding imposing selfemployment tax on the annual payments but providing sure means for that selfemployment tax to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34457crs20 recouped if the money must be returned second is the issue of whether money that must be repaid if the land does not remain out of produc tion for the duration of the contract can reasonably be considered money paid for services rather than money paid for agreeing to refrain from using the land commercially conclusion it is easy to understand the irss move to treat all crp payments as self employment income subject to selfemployment tax doing so establishes bright line rule that does not require interpretati on of facts and circumstances on caseby case basis such rule is easier for th irs to enforce and easier for taxpayers to follow this is similar to the brightline rule that treats income from hotels and motels as selfemployment income but treats longerterm real estate rentals as rental income brightline rule for crp paym ents might be based on determination by congress that the services required under the crp contracts are significant and payment for them is included in the crp rent this would eliminate the need to examine the services provided on casebycase basis further it would eliminate any arguable need to examine whether the participant was engaged in the trade or business of farming the crp payments would be considered income from self employment because they included compensation for significant services with this brightline rule there would be need to consider the extent of the services provided by the recipient on casebycase basis different brightline rule could be tablished if congre ss were to choose to do so brightline rule that crp payments are to be treated as rent that is not subject to selfemployment tax as evidenced by bills repeatedly introduced in congress some members of congress have been aware that the irs was treating some crp payments as selfemployment income but thus far congress has not chosen to act to change that if congress now chooses to examine the possibility of explicitly excluding some or all crp payments from selfemployment income it may want to look at the services required under the crp contracts and c onservation plans it may also want to determine actual fair market rental values for lands similar to those enrolled in the crp to determine whether crp payments exceed those values services required the tax court and the sixth circuit court disagreed regarding the significance of the services provided by the taxpayer in fulfilling the obligations under the crp contract surv ey of the activities of participants might provide information as to the extent nd significance of services provided by participants it is possible that these may be greater in the first year than in subsequent years and that services may be more significant for some types of enrolled lands and conservation plans than for othe rs congress might choose to determine to what extent participants must provide significant services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract if it were to determine that there were significant services in the first year of contract but negligible ones in subse quent years it might choose to treat crp payments differently in the first year than in subsequent ones modifying the way inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34457crs21 109 the first years payments might be reported as nonemployee compensation on form 1099 misc subsequent years payments coul d be reported as rents on the same form alternatively form 1099 g could be modifi ed to distinguish between first year and subsequent years paymentswhich the payments are reported to the participant and the irs109 would allow the nature of the payments to be clear and aid the irss enforcement efforts of course congress could decide to exclude the crp payments from selfemployment income in all years even if the services required in the first year were disproportionate to the services required in later years similarly if congress determined that some types of land or conservation plan s required more ongoing services it could designate that all crp payments for those lands or plan s would be includible in selfemployment income in either case the statute could be modified to explicitly define the nature of the payments received and their tax treatment fair market rental values the correlation between the annual crp rental payments and the fair market rental rates for similar land might be another consideration the average rental paymen ts for all crp property is 51 per acre but payments vary depending upon the type of land its location and the particular type of enrollment even if congress finds that the crp payments are more than the rental income that might be received from third party who would use the land it could still determine that the services provided were sufficient that the payments must be considered selfemployment income however it might conclude that payments that were at or below fair market rental values could not be considered to include compensation for services thus shielding the payments from self employment tax conversely if it shoul d find that the payments made by the crp were greater than the fair market rental rate it could consider that clear indication that the crp payments included compensation for services and thus clearly subject to selfemployment tax selfemployment taxes and the repayment provision congress may choose to enact legislation that explicitly excludes some or all crp payments from selfemployment income taking legislative action would leave the issue up to the irs and the courts if congress choos not to act to exclude any or all crp payments from selfemployment income it may want to consider whether some provision should be ma to allow recoupment of selfemployment taxes paid whenever contract is terminated and the participant is required to return all payments

as it did not include commercial fish ponds or ponds used to water livestock or irrigate crops water cover was allowed in addition to vegetative cover for some contracts entered into after the date of enactment the act prohi bited owneroperators from producing agricultural commodities on th eir unenrolled highly erodible land if that land was purchased after the date of enactment and had not previously been used to produce nonforage agricultural commodities121 however alley cropping of agricultural commodities could be allowed in conjunction with enrolled land that was planted in hardwood trees122 oneeighth of the land enrolled betw een 1991 and 1995 was to be devoted to either trees or shrubs or other noncrop vegetation or water that may provide permanent habitat for wildlife
