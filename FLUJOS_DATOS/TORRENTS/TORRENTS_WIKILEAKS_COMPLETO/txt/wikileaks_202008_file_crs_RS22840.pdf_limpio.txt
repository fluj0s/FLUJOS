that transition assistants for presidentelect barack obama might recommend that the functions of the homeland security council be transferre d to another entity26 the council reconsidered the hsc was statutorily mandated in 2002 as an agency within the executive office of the president it became the recipient of the staff of the ohs when that agency was eclipsed by the new department of homeland security it has however seemingly fallen short of achieving complete agency status due to its 1 seeming failure to publish such basic information as descrip tions of its central organization where from whom and how the public may obtain information about it sta tements of the genera l course and method by which its functions are cha nneled and determined and rules of procedure substantive rules of general applicability and statements of general policy27 2 omission from the annual volumes of the united states government manual and 3 lack of an authorization to receive appropriations as an agency within the eop some have questioned the continued need for the hsc viewing its functions as being more efficiently and effectively carried out by the national security council dditionally they maintain that such merger might result in some economies if only minimal and might also provide an opportunity to eliminate what they see as the somewhat redundant hspd series the situation may be
