january 1 1959 without compensation to the original owners this provision was challenged by the european community in the world trade orga nization as being inconsistent with us obligations under the agreement on traderela ted aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement federal courts have held that 211 and related cubanembargo provisions bar infringement suits by successo rsininterest to cuban corporation4 dsb panel issued decision finding that 211 was inconsistent with the trips agreement in some respects but was either not inconsistent in other respects or not proven to be inconsistent in other respects by the european community5 the european community appealed the panel ruling and the appellate body issued decision which reversed the lower panels ruling in some respects6 the rulings and recommendations were formally adopted by the dsb on february 1 20027 essentially the appellate body held that subsections 211a2 and 211b c oncerning court recognition or enforcement of trademark rights were inconsistent with the national treatment requirements of the trips agreement and the paris convention 19678 parts of which were incorporated by reference into the trips agreement and with the mostfavor ednation requirement of the trips agreement under articles 21 and 22 of the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes dsu wt member whose measure is found to be inconsistent with wto obligations must inform the dsb of its intentions with regard to implementation of the rulings and recommendations of the dsb the implementation is to take place within reasonable period of time although the complaining wto member may be granted compensation and susp ension of concessions or other obligations if compliance does not take place within reasonable period of time such compensation and suspension are intended to be temporary and the responde nt member is expected to bring inconsistent measures into complian ce with wto obligations initially the united states and the european community agreed that reasonable period of time for the united states to amend 211 to be consiste nt with wto obligations would expire on december 31 2002 or the date of adjournment of the 107th congress whichever was later but not later than january 3 20039 subsequently the two parties to the dispute agreed three times to extend the final deadline most recently to december 31 200410httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21764crs3 11 wto dispute settlement appellate body 211 case wtds17611add16 feb 6 2004the united states continues to submit status reports to the dsb noting that the administration has been consulting with the 108th congress11 ruling of the dsb appellate body the appellate body noted that the european community was challenging subsections 211a and b on their face and not as applied this meant the appellate body did not specifically concern itself with whether the us decision in the havana club case was consistent with the trips agr eement the appellate body further noted that neither the cuban foreign assets control cfac regulations nor the trading with the enemy act under which the regulati ons were promulgated was at issue paragraph 211a1 prohibits the approva l or authorization under 31 cfr 515527 the cfac regulation concerning trans actions related to the registration and renewal of intellectual property with the re levant us agencies of any payment or transaction with respect to trademark trade name or commercial name that is the same as or substantially similar to those used in connection with ssets which have been confiscated defined in the cfac regulati ons as expropriation by the cuban government without compensation unless the original ow ner or the owners successorininterest has expressly consented although the european community challenged this paragraph as inconsistent with various articles of the trips agreement ultimately the dsb ruled that this was not inconsistent holding inter alia that the united states was not obligated to accept the registration of trademark which did not satisfy the substantive registration requirements of us law in this case that the registrant be the rightful owner under us law although the trademark was already regist ered in another member of the wto or the paris union paris convention organization paragraph 211a2 prohibits us courts from recognizing enforcing or otherwise validating any assertion of rights by d esignated national ba sed on us commonlaw trademark rights or on us trademark registration of confiscated trademark trade name or commercial name subsec tion 211b prohibits us courts from recognizing enforcing or otherwise validating any asserti on of treaty rights by designated national or its successorininterest for us trademark trade name or commercial name that is the same as or substantially similar to those used in connection with assets which have been confiscated unless the original owner or the owners successorininterest has expressly consented the term designated national is defined in subsection 211d by reference to the cfac regulations as in cluding cuba cuban nationals including corporations controlled by th cuban government and dditionally foreign national who is successorininterest to designated national the appellate body of the dsb analyzed the meaning of paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b with regard to trademar ks separately from the meaning of these provisions in the context of trade names because the lower panel had ruled that trade names were not covered unde r the trips agreement and thus wto members had obligation to protect trade names the appellate body of the dsb ruled that with regard to original owners of us trademarks paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b are inconsistent with the national treatment requirements in the trips agreement and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21764crs4 paris convention national tr eatment means that wto member must extend to owners of us trademarks who are nationals of other wto members the same protections and remedies available to us owners of us trademarks by making distinction between the abilities of us owners and cuban owners of us trademarks to protect their trademarks in us courts paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b violated the national treatment obligation this conclusion was based upon hypothetical circumstances posed by the european community substantially as follows us national acquires rights in the us to trademark separate entity acquires separate rights to the same or substantially similar trademark in cuba the cuban rights are subsequently confiscated under paragraph 211a2 and subs ection 211b the ability of the us national owner of trademark to assert its us rights in us courts is not affected by this confiscation by contrast suppose cuban national had originally ac quired the us rights to trademark and separate entity had acquired the separate cuban rights to the same or substantially similar trademark in cuba upon confiscation of the cuban right in cuba the original cuban owner of the us rights to trademark becomes subject to the enforcement restrictions of paragra ph 211a2 and subsection 211b because the cuban owner is designated national the ability of the original cuban owner of the us rights to enforce them in us courts pends upon the consent of the successorin interest to the separate confiscated cuban rights in this situation the us owner clearly receives better treatment than would the cuban owner the appellate body of the dsb ruled that with regard to successorsininterest to the original owners of trademarks paragra ph 211a2 is inconsiste nt with the national treatment requirements in the trips agreement and th paris convention paragraph 211a2 discriminates between the rights of us successorininterest who is not included in the definition of designated national and foreig n successorininterest who is included in the definition of designat ed national the united states argued that in practice us national would never be granted license to become successorin interest under the cfac regulations and therefore there was discr imination under paragraph 211a2 but the european community argued nd the appellate body agreed that although wouldbe us ccessorininterest ma be barred under the cfac regulations alone wouldbe foreig n successorininterest faced two hurdles to asserting rights the cfac licensi ng regulations nd paragraph 211a with regard to successorsininterest to original owners of trademarks subsection 211b was found not to be inc onsistent with the national treatment provisions of the trips agreement and the paris conven tion because subsection 211b limits the enforceability of trademark treaty ri ghts of designated national or its successorin interest who might be either us or fore ign national therefore there is discrimination between us nd foreign successorsininterest that would be inconsistent with wto obligations the appellate body of the dsb ruled that with regard to original owners of trademarks paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b are in consistent with the most favorednation requirements in the trips agreement mostfavorednation treatment effectively means that wto member must extend to nationals of all other wto members any protections or rights that it extends to nationals of any wto member so there is discrimination among other wto members regional trade agreementsgroupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21764crs5 such as the north american free trade agreement or the european community are special circumstance within the wto alt hough all foreign successorsininterest are at an equal disadvantage under paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b only cuban original owners are at disadvantage comp ared with the nationals of all other wto members the scenario desc ribed above concerning two pr econfiscation original owners of us trademarks operates to illustrate the violation of the mostfavorednation requirement under that scenario the non cuban foreign original owner of us trademark similar to cuban trademark for confiscated business or assets would be able to assert its rights in us courts while cuban original owner would not the appellate body of the dsb disagreed with the lower panels ruling with regard to the protection of trade names ruling th at trade names were covered under the trips agreement and therefore wto members were obligated to extend protections to trade names under the trips agreement under the same rationale described above for trademarks with regard to original owne rs of trade names paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b were found to be inconsistent with the na tional treatment requirements in the trips agreement and the paris conven tion similarly with regard to successors ininterest to owners of trade names 211a 2 was found to be inconsistent with the national treatment re quirements in the trips agreem ent and the paris convention but subsection 211b was not fina lly with regard to trade na mes paragraph 211a2 and subsection 211b were found to be inconsistent with th mostfavorednation provision of the trips agreement proposed legisl ation and recent developments six bills in the 108th congress would bring the united states into compliance with the ruling of the appellate body some

onal defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 which became pl 108136 however such amendment was included12 reportedly bacardi circulated proposal to delete all refere nces to designated national and its definition and to apply 211 only to those who knew or had reason to know that trademark was confiscated but opponents of 211 argued that any action less than complete repeal would leave the united stat open to further challenge by cuba under the interamerican convention for tr ademark and comme rcial protection13 both the european union and cuba have expressed concern about the lack of progress in us compliance with the dsbs recommendations at regular meetings of the dsb14 the european union asked in particul ar for clarification concerning the us position on abandoned trademarks or trade name s noting that despite representations by the united states to the dsb panel that 211 does not apply to abandoned trademarks the us courts have held otherwise since the trademark havana club had apparently been abandoned upon the failure of the origin owner to pay the required maintenance fee in 1973 the european union has repeated ly asserted that the panel had relied on nonapplication to abandoned trademarks in r eaching the conclusion that certain clauses of 211 were consistent with the trips at the meeting on may 7 2003 the united states replied that the panel decision did not relate to the issue of abandonment and that us court decision had been issued since the havana club litigation and the dbs panel decision although the trademark tria l and appeal board is an administrative panel and not us court in recent non precedential decision the board ruled against havana club holding hch partly because th federal appellate court in the previous litigation had ruled that hch was not the owne r of the us trademark for havana club since the assignment from cubaexport th cuban owner since 1960 was barred by the cuban embargo15 however in another nonpreced ential decision of the board it dismissed bacardis cancellation petition cla iming that cubaexport is not the rightful owner finding it to be political question concerning the legitimacy of the cuban government16 therefore arguably it remains uncl ear what effect repeal of 211 would have beyond allowing litigation concerning disputed cubanu s trademarks to reach the substantive merits of the case
