after fda approval by susan thaul 2 pressure mounts for clinical trial registry medicine health vol 58 24 june 21 2004 pp 23clinical trials reporting and publication introduction current federal regulations in 2004 congress and others raised questi ons about the safety and effectiveness of several fdaappr oved biomedical products on the market these included certain antidepressants mercks pain relief drug vioxx boston scientifics cardiac stents and other drugs and medical devices disc ussion about ways to help ensure safety and effectiveness of biomedical produc ts focused primarily on two questions whether data from all clinical trials should be made public ly available and whether fdas processes for product approval and postmarket rveillance and study are adequate this report focuses on the first of these questions1 the central issue before congress with respect to clinical trials reporting and publication is how to balance the potential beneficial public health effects of requiring that clinical trials data be made public with the burdens that such requirements may place on companies and th eir innovation on one hand companies may lose competitive advantage if their competitors are alerted to their clinical trials activities and failures on the ot her hand the pub lic may be harmed if particular type of clinical trial is re peated particularly if an earlier trial demonstrated that product was ineffective or harmful in addition if clinical trial data are to be made public the timing and contents of the disclosure may prove to be pivotal both with respect to comp etitive innovation nd public safety clinical trials reporting can mean public access to results after trials conclusion to proposed plan before trial is begun or both there is centralized system for either type of repor ting thus different trials may have the same title one tria l may be reported in several places under diffe rent titles and many trials are never reported researchers have traditionally reported pre and post market trial results in peerreviewed medical journals which have historically tended to favor publication of clinical trials demonstrating successful intervention the results of negative or inconclu sive trials of ten go unpublished2 other venues for the dissemination of research results are i ndustry government or university press releases and presentations at medical conferences researchers who may be affiliated with product s manufacturer university the government or an association established to find better trea tments for particular disease may have

continuedexpressed concern that lack of transparency particularly for negative data could adversely affect medi cal decisionmaking3 the lack of transparency may be amplif ied in part by s ponsors contractual requirements of their researchers this concern was raised by two may 2005 medical journal articles suggesting that contractual gag clauses might prohibit clinical trial investigators from examining data independently or submitting manuscript for publication without first obtaining the cons ent of trial sponsors according to one of the articles sponsors with financial interest in the outcomes of clinical research could thus suppress negative results and interfere with the publication of unfavorable data on safety4 the other article which describe d results from survey of medical school research administrator s responsible for negotiating clinical trial agreements with industry sponsors reported that industry provides approximately 70 of funding for clinical drug trials in the united states5 the survey results suggested that 85 of the administrators offices would not approve provisions that gave industry sponsors the authority to revise manuscripts or to decide whether results should be published administrators respons varied regardin g whether contracts could contain provisions allowing sponsors to insert their own statistical analyses in manuscripts draft manuscripts or prohibit investigators from sharing data with their parties after the trials conclusion in order to fully understand the debate surrounding clin ical trials reporting and publication basic understanding of clinical trials themselves and of the current federal requirements both of which are presented belo w is essential the slate of issues that frequently arise during discussions of clinical trials reporting and publication all of which are addressed below in the issu section of this report include questions related to the goals of publication the materi als appropriateness and presentation the timing the disclosures whether disclosure should be voluntary or mandatory with penalties overcoming potential conflicts of interest and whether medical devices should be incl uded in reporting requirements clinical trials are the gold standard clinical trials which are the gold standard for assessing drug and device safety and effectiv eness both before and after they are

july 1996 at http wwwfdagovcderguidanceiche3pdfmost of the bills all but s 1082 w ould require public disclosure of study results s 1082 would require the nih dir ector to issue repor t and hhs secretary to create rule based on that report regarding the best way to make clinical study results available to the public issues issues surrounding the possib ility of clinical trials reporting and publication have focused on range of topics thos topics are discussed below with an accompanying analysis of the clinical trials reporting and publication provisions contained in s 1082 hr 2900 s 467 s 484 hr 1561 and s 468hr 788 goals proponents of public access to clini cal trials data cite the need to provide information to members of the general public health care workers and researchers both to help inform treatment decisions and to help eliminate abuses industry advocates have also cited the poten tial benefits of public awareness of the resources necessary to get drug approve d and the elimination of duplicated failed efforts phrma cites making clinical trial results for usmarketed pharmaceuticals more transparent and providing inform ation to practicing physicians and their patients each of the legislative proposal s aims to make info rmation available and understandable to memb ers of the public appropriaten esspresentation some have questioned whether registration and publication of clinical trials and their results are the best mechanism for ensuring patient safety both because the language may be too technical for lay audiences and because numerous trials may need to be viewed together in order to draw meaningful conclusions an analysis that would be difficult for many doctors as well single clini cal trial may generate thousa nds of pages of documentation these questions have led some to focus on how information might be presented in an audienceappropriate way phrmas registry contains link to drug labels bibliography and summary of results in format developed by industry consensus32 all of the bills would contain in formation accessible to both the general public and professionals three bills hr 2900 s 484 and hr 1561 have the additional specific requirement that the resu lts database contain both technical and nontechnical summary report which might meet the differing requirements of professionals nd lay persons timing some have argued that only clinical study results are important to judging effectiveness so publication of trials inception is not necessary others have argued that some registration at in ception is necessary to avoid abuse and is helpful for connecting potential subjects with various trials fdama requires that notice of qualifying trial be submitted to httpclinicaltrialsgov later than 21 days after the trial is open for enrollment phrmas database only accepts results from completed trials s 1082 and s 467 w ould generally require registration within 21 days that trial is opened for rollment hr 2900 s 484 and

release of the information until the device is approved or cleared by fda s 467hr 788 would require that information about the study be posted not less frequently than every 90 days for clinical trial results hr 2900 s 467 and hr 1561 would require them to be submitted within one year of the earlier of the trials actual or estimated completion date s 484 would require resu lts submissions not later than one year after the last patient has hi s or her last medical visit and s 467 hr 788 would require results to be sub mitted upon completion of the study all the bills except for s 467 hr 788 would allow for extensions for results submission in certain circumstances such as when publication in peerreviewed journal is pending s 467 hr 788 may also allow for such extensions by nature of the fact that the director of the actcreated center for po stmarket evaluation and research for drugs and biologics would determine the studies completion date nd might therefore be capable of delaying the date if presen ted with good cause s 1082 does not create results databank and theref ore does not specify when results would have to be released voluntary or mandatorypenalties concerns about the potential regulatory burden on smaller drug and device manufacturer s as well as about the potential for intellectual property problems have led some to call for voluntary registration and publication the desire to protect public safety and to reduce abuse has led others to back mandatory reporting phrmas registry is voluntary the reporting proposed in all of the b ills would be mandatory with limited exceptions for trials not conducted on dr ugs devices or biological products and those completed before the bills enactment and w ould carry penalties for noncompliance conflicts of interest some commentators have focused on the need for public disclosure of financ ial and other arrangements between researchers and sponsors in order to demonstrat potential conflicts of intere st that may affect clinical trial design interpretation of data and presentation of results the phrma database does not include information about funding relationships though products there are identifiable by company which may also be the trial funding source all of the bills would require the disclosure of f unding sources among other things devices some have questioned whether information about clinical trials related to medical devices should be included in the registry the medical device advocacy group avamed points out that fda regulation of devices is different from its regulation of drugs devices are of ten approved based on an alytical comparisons to existing products rather than on the c onduct of new clinical trials devices as compared to drugs often tend to present lower risk to patients tend to be manufactured by smaller companies tend to have short market life due to frequent incremental refinements rather than majo r breakthroughs and tend to require more financial incentives to test phrmas database contains only information related to drug trials those proposed in all of th bills except s 468 hr 788 would include trials related to medical vices s 467 hr 788

include trial acronym if available countries of recruitmentthe countries from which participants will be are intended to be or have been recruited health conditions or problems studiedprimary health conditions or problems studied eg depression breast cancer medication error if the study is conducted on healthy human volunteers belonging to the target population of the intervention eg preventative or screening interventions enter the particular health conditions or problems being prevented if the study is conducted using healthy human volunteers not belonging to the target population eg preliminary safety study an appropriate keyword will be defined for users to select interventions enter the specific name of the interventions and the comparatorcontrols being studied use the international nonproprietary name if possible not brandtrade names for an unregistered drug the generic name chemical name or company serial number is acceptable if the intervention consists of several separate treatments list them all in one line separated by commas eg lowfat diet exercise the control interventions isare the interventions against which the study intervention is evaluated eg placebo treatment active control if an active control is used be sure to enter in the names of that intervention or enter placebo or treatment as applicable for each intervention describe other in tervention details as applicable dose duration mode of administration etc key inclusion and exclusion criteriainclusion and exclusion criteria for partic ipant selection including age and sex study type single arm study is one in which all participants are given the same intervention trials in which participants are assigned to receive one of two or more interventions are not single arm studies crossover trials are not single arm studies trial is randomized if participants are assigned to intervention groups using method based on chance eg random number table random computergenerated sequence minimization adaptive randomization date of first enrollmentanticipated or actual date of enrollment of the first participant yyyymm target sample sizenumber of participants that this trial plans to enroll recruitment statusrecruitment status of this trial pending participants are not yet being recruited or enrolled at any site active participants are currently being recruited and enrolled temporary halt there is temporary halt in recruitment and enrollment closed participants are longer being recruited or enrolled primary outcomesoutcomes are events variables or experiences that are measured because it is believed that they may be influenced by the intervention the primary outcome should be the outcome used in sample size calculations or the main outcomes used to determine the effects of the interventions enter the names of all primary outcomes in the trial as well as the prespecified timepoints of primary interest be as specific as possible with the metric used eg with beck depression score 10 rather than just depression examples outcome name allcause mortality timepoints 5 years or outcome name mean beck depression score timepoint 18 weekshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32832crs37 secondary outcomessecondary outcomes are events variables or experiences that are of secondary interest or that are measured at timepoi nts of secondary interest secondary outcome may involve the same event variable or experience as the primary outcome but measured at timepoints other than those of primary interest eg primary outcome allcause mortality at 5 years secondary outcome allcause mortality at 1 year 3 years or may involve different event variable or experience altogether eg primary outcome allcause mortality at 5 years secondary outcome hospitalization rate at 5 years enter the name and timepoints for all secondary outcomes of clinical andor scientific importance be as specific as possible with the metric used eg with beck depression score 10 rather than just depression examples outcome name allcause mortality timepoints 6 months 1 year or outcome name mean glycosylated hemoglobin a1c timepoints 4 and 8 weeks source who
