s of congress introduce bills seeking to suspend or reduce tariffs on certain imports on their behalf the vast majority of these commodities are chemicals raw materials or other components used as inputs in the manufacturing process the rationale for these requests in general is that they help domestic producers of the downstream goods reduce costs thus making their products more competitive in turn these cost reductions can be passed on to the consumer in recent congressional practice house ways and means and senate finance committees the committees of jurisdiction over tariffs have combined these duty suspension bills and other technical trade provisions into larger pieces of legislation known as miscellaneous tariff bills mtbs before inclusion in an mtb the individual legislative proposals introduced by members are reviewed by trade subcommittee staff and several executive branch agencies to ensure that they are noncontroversial generally that domestic producer objects and relatively revenue neutral revenue loss of more than 500000 per item late in the 109 th congress the house passed hr 6406 trade package that included suspension of duties on about 380

legislation amended house and senate rules to make it out of order to consider bills containing earmarks limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits unless certain disclosure and reporting requirements are met by the member proposing the legislation and the committees of jurisdiction on november 1 2007 the house ways and means trade subcommittee signaled that miscellaneous trade bill will be considered in the second session of the 110 th congress by issuing an advisory calling for house members to submit legislative proposals for inclusion in the next mtb by december 14 2007 the

congress the primary authority over trade policy therefore congress must approve any modifications to the harmonized tariff schedule hts constituents often representing domestic industry associations or manufacturers will sometimes ask members to introduce legislation proposing to reduce repeal or temporarily suspend duties on certain imports since the early 1980s the house ways and means and senate finance committees the primary committees of jurisdiction on trade matters have tended to incorporate duty suspensions into larger pieces of legislation known as miscellaneous trade and technical corrections bills mtbs these larger trade packages include modifications to the hts such as suspensions of duties on various products specific instructions to us customs and border protection cbp regarding certain entries of commodities largely where the cbp may have made an error in classification or dealing with other technical issues in entries of goods and minor technical corrections to trade laws this report focuses briefly on recent legislative actions on duty suspensions the current procedure by which congressional committees evaluate and select commodities for inclusion mtb legislation and some of the reasons that congress has approved them g15g22g4g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 the introduction of mtb legislation in its current omnibus format appears to have originated in the 97 th congress with hr 4566 gibbons pl 97446 enacted january 12 1983 which proposed to reduce certain duties to suspend temporarily certain duties to extend certain existing suspensions of duties and for other purposes prior to that date even though committee hearings were often held on several duty suspension bills at time congress tended to act on them individually in the 110 th congress the house ways and means trade subcommittee signaled that it plans to introduce miscellaneous trade bill in the second session by issuing an advisory calling for house members to submit legislative proposals for inclusion in the next mtb by december 14 2007 the advisory gave specific time line for the bills introduction or consideration the senate finance committee has not issued call for mtb proposals as yet g343g342g351g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 on july 28 2006 legislation suspending or reducing duties until december 31 2009 on about 300 products along with number of other trade provisions was inserted into pension legislation before the house hr 4 boehner the pension protection act of 2006 passed the house on the same date by vote of 279131 the bill was subsequently received in the senate and passed on august 3 by vote of 935 on august 17 the president signed the bill which became pl 109280 according to ways and means committee staff the law included duty suspensions for which corresponding standalone legislation had been introduced house and senate on december 7 2006

procedures for limited tariff benefitsare therefore now in effect 1 the rule provides that in order to be considered on the house floor bill or joint resolution reported by committee must include in the report list of congressional earmarks limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits in the bill or the report along with the name of the member delegate or resident commissioner requesting them or statement certifying that the proposal does not contain them similarly if bill or joint resolution is not reported by the committee prior to floor consideration the chairman of each committee of initial referral must cause similar list of benefits and requesting members to be printed in the congressional record in the case of conference reports list of benefits included in the conference report or accompanying joint explanatory statement and the requesting members must be included in the joint explanatory statement in order to consider the conference report 2 the resolution also provides that any member delegate or resident commissioner requesting limited tariff benefit must provide written disclosure to the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction including 1 the name of the sponsor 2 identification of the individual or entities reasonably anticipated to benefit from the measure 3 the purpose of the limited tariff benefit and 4 certification that the sponsoring member or spouse has financial interest in the benefit the committees of jurisdiction are directed to maintain the disclosures and make the statements regarding limited tariff benefits included in committee reported bill or conference report open for public inspection 1 hres 6 sec 404 2 the house may waive this rule by unanimous consent that is if member objects or by motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure which requires twothirds vote to adopt the rule also provides mechanism for the house to decide on casebycase basis whether to adopt

hours or as soon as practicable in the case of spending items proposed in floor amendments prior to the vote 3 if the disclosure is not completed the measure is subject to point of order4 the law defines limited tariff benefit as provision modifying the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states in manner that benefits 10 or fewer entities identical to the definition in hres 6 additionally any senator who requests limited ta riff benefit or any other directed spending item mentioned in the law must disclose in writing the name of the sponsor the name and location of the

out one mtb per congress in most congresses the house ways and means and senate finance committee the committees of jurisdiction chairs have sent out dear colleague letters to all members inviting them to introduce standalone legislation on proposed duty suspensions several months before an mtb is expected to be reported out of committee the mtb when introduced includes all committeeapproved

houses by unanimous consent or under suspension of the rules6 in recent congresses due to the number of provisions introduced for example about 470 new duty suspensions were introduced in the house in the 109th congress the committees of jurisdiction have tended to request comments from interested parties at the subcommittee level rather than holding hearings on these bills in practice the subcommittee considers duty suspensions for inclusion in the mtb only if the corresponding goods or materials are deemed noncontroversial or noncompetitive meaning that 1 there is domestic producer objecting to the duty suspension and 2 the suspension or reduc tion of the tariff is seen to be in the interest of us downstream manufacturers and theoretically consumers furthermore the volume of imports and corresponding revenue loss must be revenue neutral or generally not more than 500000 per commodity for example the congressional budget office estimated that all duty suspensions and extensions to suspensions in housepassed hr 4944 109 th congress would cost the government only about 275 million in lost revenue over five years7

subcommittee staff who in turn solicit comments from the ad ministration including the united states trade representative cbp and the department of comm erce and the international trade commission itc committee staff often solicit public comments directly but may do so through administration channels or the itc duty suspen sions that do not meet the above criteria are generally filtered out in this process g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g514g156g561g20g152g149g142g561 generally the itc is the first agency that provides response to the committees and is the only agency directly required to do so by statute8 the itc usually contacts companies and industry groups through its office of industries either through direct contact or by sending out questionnaire to solicit responses from interested parties especially looking for us producers of similar goods as those targeted for duty suspensions the itc issues congressional bill reports on the standalone bills which they forward to the committees and share with relevant agencies in the executive branch9 these reports provide information on the dollar amount and volume of trade estimated revenue loss if the tariff is suspended and technical information including proper nomenclature hts heading and chemical abstracts number if applicable the reports also list the proponent companys name 6 see us house committee on ways and means trade subcommittee advisory levin and herger request introduction of miscellaneous tariff and duty suspension bills by

at commerce also research the targeted commodities either independently or in conjunction with the itc depending on the time frame with regard to comments on duty suspensions commerce generally does not object unless us producer of targeted commodity is found in most cases intracompany transfers instances in which multinational with subsidiary in the united states imports product manufactured in plant owned by the same company overseas are also not opposed even if like product is manufactured in the united states customs and border protection also comments on duty suspensions largely by recommending reclassifications or changes in nomenclature for ease in administering the proposed tariff changes cbp has formal agreement to share this information with the itc and may also provide information to other agencies however if certain measures impact cbp more directly eg changes in duty drawback statutes legislative responses to cbp rulings liquidations and reliquidations or permanent duty suspensions cbp will generally communicate directly to the committees on confidential basis the office of the united states trade representative ustr may also comment on individual duty suspension bills but generally focuses on larg er issues in the legislation that would more permanently affect us trade policy however ustr officials indicate that the administration usually prefers that any tariff modifications in mtbs are temporary so that more permanent revisions of duties can continue to be used in trade negotiations to seek reciprocal tariff benefits for us exports

bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations many economists believe that lower foreign tariffs benefit us exporters because they make us goods more competitive in foreign markets and that lower us tariffs can benefit domestic manufacturers and consumers because the cost savings on imported goods may be passed on consumers or to other downstream producers ultimately resulting in lower costs of the finished products however tariffs may also be used protectively in an effort to help domestic industries remain competitive especially those considered vulnerable to foreign imports such as agriculture textiles and steel 10 the itc takes official position on duty suspension measures but relays any domestic company support or objections to committee staff an example of an instance in which an objection has been raised can be found in us international trade commission memorandum on proposed tariff legislation of the 109th congress on s 791 santorum on proposed duty suspension on

g348g561thus supporters of duty suspension measures point out that since they are largely requested on chemicals and other production inputs they are significant means of reducing manufacturing costs thus make domestic downstream goods more competitive in turn the cost savings can ultimately be passed on to consumers in the form of lower costs for finished products opponents however view them as an increasingly popular means by which congress confers benefit on business constituents and point to instances in which competing domestic manufacturers have been harmed despite the efforts of the subcommittee and administrative agencies to control their impact despite the efforts of house and senate committees to ensure the neutrality of mtbs insertion of controversial measures has held up floor consideration of the legislation in the past especially in the senate however these measures have largely dealt with trade policy concerns rather than duty suspensions for example the last mtb reported out of the senate first introduced in 2002 faced opposition from senator richard shelby who placed hold on the bill because it did not include provision to roll back preferential access previously given to beneficiaries of the caribbean basin trade partnership act in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 11 other provisions including one proposing to grant normal trade relations status to laos one to repeal the antidumping act of 1916 pursuant to wto ruling and another providing trust for us wool producers also met with objections12 ultimately the bill passed in late 2004 pl 108429 the twoyear legislative fight reportedly led to the reluctance of thenchairman grassley to report out miscellaneous trade bill in the 109th congress13

competitive advantag over another or that meet with opposition from domestic producer are generally not considered for inclusion in an mtb however an historical review of mtb legislation shows there are several other reasons that duty suspensions may merit congressional attention first in some cases higher tariff rate may apply to relatively noncompetitive product because it is aggregated in harmonized tariff schedule hts heading or subheading with similar commodities that are considered more competitive this is often the case where certain chemical compounds are concerned second there might be current domestic production of particular commodity or it might not be produced in sufficient quantities to satisfy domestic demand as result us producers who use the commodity as manufacturing input may have to depend on imports in this case duty suspension could lower the overall price of the good without significant harm to domestic suppliers third the duty rate of component essential in the manufacture of domestic product may be higher than that on the comparable imported finished good one example of this was case in 11 the senator insisted that the preferential access of socks from caribbean nations needed to be rolled back because it was harmful to alabama sock producers letter to senator charles grassley chairman of the senate finance committee from senators

g349g561which casein button blanks used by us button manufacturers were imported at 221 ad valorem while finished buttons were imported at rate of 69 ad valorem domestic producers complained that they were put at competitive disadvantage visàvis foreign manufacturers of the same product because of the higher duty rate for the raw material14 fourth multinational corporations sometimes manufacture commodities at foreign subsidiaries and import them to be used as components in domestically produced merchandise for example us automobile manufacturer may fabricate some of its car parts in plant in guatemala and then import the parts into the united states where it assembles the finished product congress sometimes considers duty suspensions in these cases because the importing company would probably not purchase it from domestic producer fifth nonprofit associations may wish to import an item and request onetime duty suspension for the product for example churches have sometimes requested dutyfree status for pipe organs purchased from europe and an educational institution has been allowed dutyfree status for parts used in the construction of telescope sixth less frequent reason for congressional approval of duty suspension legislation is compelling national interest for example in 1942 the 77 th congress considered the suspension of import duties on all scrap metal because the war production board predicted shortage of as much as 65 million tons of metal necessary for the defense industry to operate its open hearth and electric furnaces at full capacity 15 the board recommended that all barriers to importing these metals be dropped the bill passed both chambers by unanimous consent t able 1 miscellaneous t rade legislation 97th congr ess to the pr esent
