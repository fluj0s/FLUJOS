government and finance division january 16 2008 abstract this report traces out the channels through which the tax cuts are thought to aﬀect the economy and assesses the performance of those economic indicators including gross domestic product gdp employment interest rates inﬂation labor supply saving capital investment and the trade deﬁcit the report uses theory and data to evaluate the tax cuts eﬀects through 2004 this report does not analyze economic developments since 2004 presumably individuals had adjusted their behavior to the tax changes by then and economic developments since have not been signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by tax cuts enacted several years earlier the report also oﬀers an overview of the forecasts of their eﬀects made at the time the tax cuts were passed most estimates predicted that the tax cuts would increase economic growth in the shortterm and reduce it in the long run despite the wide diversity of the models used all of the results are relatively small as would be expected of tax cuts that are relatively small in relation to gdp in the years

consider economic stimulus legislation these proposals have raised questions about the economic effects of past policy changes congress enacted major tax cuts in 2001 2002 and 2003 the acts reduced marginal income tax rates reduced taxes on married couples dividends capital gains and on estates and gifts increased the child tax credit and accelerated depreciation for business investment the tax cuts resulted in an estimated revenue loss of 04 of gdp in 2001 11 in 2002 and 16 in 2003 since government spending rose as taxes were cut the cuts can be characterized as deficit financed it is hard to be certain what effects the tax cuts have had on the economy because there is way to compare actual events to the counterfactual case where the tax cuts were not enacted the most common method of estimating tax cuts effect is to feed it into macroeconomic model of the economy and see what the model predicts note that this is typically done before the fact economic estimates of the tax cuts effect are not based on actual ex post data these estimates are highly uncertain because there is one macroeconomic model that adequately captures all of the economys dynamics consensus among macroeconomists as to which one model is most suitable for policy simulations and model with strong track record in accurately projecting economic events most estimates predicted that the tax cuts would increase economic growth in the shortterm and reduce it in the long run for example the joint committee on taxation predicted that the 2003 tax cut would increase gdp by an average of 02 to 05 in the first five years and decrease it by 01 to 02 over the next five years keynesian models find the largest positive shortterm effect of the tax cuts on the economy but these effects are completely temporary because they focus on how tax cuts boost aggregate spending in the long run prices adjust and production rather than spending determines the level of output in neoclassical solow growth models deficitfinanced tax cuts reduce national saving thereby reducing national income because capital investment can only be financed through national saving or foreign borrowing if the latter occurs the result will be an increased trade deficit in intertemporal models deficitfinanced tax cut is unsustainable it must be offset in the future by tax increase or spending cut to prevent the national debt from growing indefinitely thus in these models tax cuts followed by tax increases lead individuals to shift work and saving into the lowtax period increasing growth then and out of the hightax period reducing growth then the period encompassing the tax cuts featured recession of average duration but belowaverage depth an initially sluggish recovery deep and unusually long decline in employment small decline in hours worked sharp and long sting contraction in investment spending significant decline in national saving and an unusually large trade deficit opponents see this as evidence that the tax cuts were ineffective proponents argue that the economy would have performed worse in their absence also consider that some perhaps most of the recovery was due to monetary rather than fiscal stimulus

the economy might be heading toward recession have led some policymakers to consider economic stimulus legislation to judge the efficacy of such proposals some policymakers have expressed desire to look back at the economic effects of past policy changes proponents of the tax cuts passed in 2001 2002 and 2003 argued that they would have salutary effects on the economy particular emphasis was placed on economic stimulus in the shortterm this report traces out the channels through which the tax cuts are thought to affect the economy and assesses the performance of those economic indicators including gross domestic product gdp employment interest rates inflation labor supply saving capital investment and the trade deficit the report uses theory and data to evaluate the tax cuts effects

report focuses on provisions of those bills that caused significant revenue loss from 2001 to 2003 in 2001 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act was signed into law egtrra pl 10716 its major provisions for 20012004 were reduction in marginal income tax rates an increase in the child tax credit marriage penalty tax relief and elimination of the estate tax all of these provisions were phased in gradually over several years and then scheduled to expire due to budget rules although it was the framers stated intent that they become permanent 1 in 2002 the job creation and worker assistance act jcwaa pl 107147 was signed into law its major revenueside provision was accelerated depreciation for business investment in 2003 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra pl 10827 was signed into law it accelerated the phase in of the main egtrra provisions with the exception of the estate tax provisions and extended and expanded the accelerated depreciation in jcwaa it also reduced the tax rates on dividend and capital gains income in addition the 2004 working family tax relief act wftra pl 108311 extended some pr ovisions of the earlier acts that were slated to expire it had revenue effect in 2004 table 1 gives the estimated revenue loss of the tax cuts and their key provisions as scored by the joint committee on taxation at the time the tax cuts were enacted estimates of the cost of the tax cuts based on ex post data do not exist 2 egtrra was the largest of the tax cuts and most of 1 proposals to make part or all of egtrrajgtrra permanent can be found in the administrations budget proposal for fy2007 and several dozen congressional bills 2 actual tax receipts fell significantly more than predicted by the ex scores even after controlling for economic conditions this suggests that the tax cuts may have resulted in more revenue loss than predicted see crs report rs21786 the federal budget deficit discussion of recent trends by gregg

and jcwaa occurred in the shortterm in fact because accelerated depreciation is revenue loser in the shortterm and revenue raiser in the mediumterm the 10year cost of jcwaa is smaller than the shortterm cost in the long run it was by far the smallest of the three but of comparable size in the time period considered here jgtrras costs are mainly shortterm because it mostly accelerates tax cuts that would have occurred later under egtrra all of the tax cuts are temporary and scheduled to expire although it was the intention of their supporters that egtrrajgtrra be permanent t able 1

n outyears consistent with the goal of shortterm stimulus this report focuses on the effects of the tax cuts through 2004 certain provisions that are large in the long run are small to date and will not be explored most notably the repeal of the estate tax other provisions such as accelerated depreciation were large in the short run but not in the long run although the costs of the tax cuts are large as fraction of total receipts particularly in the out years the costs as percentage of gross domestic product gdp in the years of interest are small the small size of the tax cuts places low ceiling on their potential economic effects this is especially the case when evaluating demandside effects where their incremental increase from year to year rather than their absolute value is the relevant figure in 2001 the tax cuts revenue provisions only were equal to 04 of gdp all of which occurred in the second half of the year in 2002 they increased 07 percentage points to 11 of gdp in

labor supply and saving the key measure is marginal tax rates as seen in table 2 the change in average marginal tax rates under egtrra and jgtrra is modest for wages and interest income when fully phased in however egtrrajgtrra leads to larger decline in marginal rates on capital gains income and more than 50 decline in marginal rates on dividend income t able 2 v era ge marginal t ax rates

taxes were cut these tax cuts can be characterized as wholly deficitfinanced tax cuts financed by increasing the deficit or decreasing the surplus this is important to note because deficitfinanced tax cuts have different economic effect than tax cuts financed by reducing spending or raising other taxes in the models described below

g5g158g157g156g561 it may be surprising to learn that there is straightforward way to evaluate how tax cut has affected the economy economists can observe how the economy performed after tax cut but because they cannot observe the counterfactualhow the economy would have performed in the absence of tax cutthere is direct way to tell what contribution the tax cut made to the economys performance if the economy boomed after tax cut there is way of telling whether the economy would have boomed even if the tax cut had not been passed if the economy grew sluggishly after tax cut there is wa of telling whether the economy would have grown even more slowly without tax cut econometric research is based on observing variation between data observations to determine correlation between variables for studies of individual behavior variations in the tax cut that individuals receive can be used to establish correlation if recipients of tax cut systematically behave differently than nonrecipients all else equal it can be deduced that the tax cut caused that behavior unfortunately in the case of tax cuts variation between individuals is not independent of other control variables needed to hold all else equal the size and eligibility of tax cut is based on criteria that may strongly influence an individuals behavior for example the size of the marginal tax rate reduction received under egtrra is determined by factors such as income yet if the experience of individuals in one income cohort is systematically different than in

when some other factor was the cause for example income inequality has been growing in the united states in recent decades because the income of upperincome cohorts has been rising more quickly than lower income cohorts because egtrra gave larger tax cuts to upperincome cohorts on average3 the portion of faster income growth caused by growing inequality unless properly controlled for would be spuriously attributed to the larger tax cut4 for economywide studies the variation studied is typically over time rather than across individuals in the case of tax cut this wo uld entail comparing how the economy performed in periods with the tax cut compared to periods without the tax cut but because other factors are also changing over time different control variables are not independent and causation runs in both directions it is very difficult to isolate the effect of tax cuts for example consider tax cut implemented to stimulate the economy in response to downturn comparing economic activity before and during the tax cut simple correlation could lead to the conclusion that tax cuts cause recessions since the timing of the tax cut is associ ated with decline in growth some other factor is necessary to control for this endogeneity problem some econometric methods can overcome the endogeneity problem but greatly limit the number of control variables that can be employed because of insufficient degrees of freedom some time series analysis has been criticized for assuming that individuals do not change their reactions in response to changes in the behavior of policymakers known as the lucas critique because there have been relatively few major tax cuts or increases in recent history there are relatively few observations to consider 5 in this situation economists typically predict tax cuts economic effects by building econometric forecasting models calibrating the models to match actual economic data and then running the model with and without tax cut the difference between the two outcomes is said to be the tax cuts economic effects notice that this approach does not rely on actual after the fact data to determine the tax cuts effects these simulations are typically run before the tax cut is implemented and it is rare for the modeler to go b ack after the fact and test the accuracy of the prediction as shown in the section below none of the predictions made for egtrra and jgtrra were based on actual expost data using expost data would improve the accuracy of the results but not avoid all of the problems discussed above this method of estimating tax cuts effects would be less problematic if there were widespread consensus that one particular econometric model could accurately predict economic activity in fact econometric models are

g23g156g142g141g561 as discussed above there is consensus as to which type of macroeconomic model best describes reality each model captures certain aspects of economic behavior well but model adequately synthesizes all the different aspects at once because economists differ on which aspects of economic behavior are most important they also differ on which model is preferable for evaluating policy model described below is right or wrong each has unique strengths and weaknesses 6 but the predicted effects of tax cut will be highly sensitive to the assumptions of the model used to evaluate it because the models are not integrated major problem with the estimates is that if there are effects caused by properties that the model being used neglects the effects will be incorrectly attributed to other properties that are included in the model being used for example if tax cut boosted aggregate demand supply side model would attribute the rise in output to an increase in labor or saving even though the increase would not necessarily be induced by incentives would not necessarily be permanent nor would it necessarily be replicable at different point in the business cycle

keynesian models focus on aggregate demand or the spending side of the economy rather than the aggregate supply or the production side of the economy because recessions are typically thought to be shortfalls in aggregate spending relative to potential supply production if all of the economys labor and capital resources were fully employed keynesian models are popular for shortterm policymaking and forecasting purposes professional forecasters including cbo office of management and budget omb the federal reserve global insight and macroeconomic advisers use models with keynesian attributes in the short run to predict economic activity however the richness of the models development of the demand side of the economy comes at the expense of their ability to explain the supply side this makes these models of more limited usefulness for explaining and prescribing policies when the economy is fully employed because aggregate demand can fall below aggregate supply only in the short run before prices adjust keynesian models are also of limited usefulness in explaining the long run 6 commercial forecasting models such as global insight and macroeconomic advisers incorporate aspects of supply side and solow growth models in their results but keynesia n effects dominate the results over the first few years of the projection

referred to as stimulating the economy and evaluating stimulus package is best done by looking at its effects on aggregate spending using keynesian model in these models the government can boost spending in the economy by increasing the budget deficit if the deficit is the result of increased government spending aggregate spending is boosted directly because government spending is component of aggregate demand because the deficit is financed by borrowing from the public resources that were previously being saved are now being used to finance government purchase or production of goods and services if the deficit is the result of tax cuts aggregate spending is boosted by the tax cuts recipient to the extent that the tax cut is sp ent not saved or invested in financial securities 7 in this case resources that were previously being saved are now at the disposal of the tax cut recipient and to the extent that the recipient decides to increase his consumption aggregate spending will rise in this model the increase in aggregate spending does not stop there when spending increases idle labor and capital resources are brought back into use leading to an increase in employment and decrease in unemployment this generates new production and income accrues to those previously idle resources which can then be spent by the worker or owner of capital this process is repeated producing multiplier effect so that the eventual increase in aggregate spending exceeds the initial increase in the budget deficit it is assumed that it will take some time for the full effects of the stimulus to be felt some prominent keynesian models predict most of the effects are felt within two years the effects of fiscal stimulus can be visualized in terms of simple supply and demand diagram where the boost in demand brings the economy to new higher equilibrium with supply because the supply curve is sloped upward the ultimate increase in output is less than the boost in demand if the supply curve were vertical the boost in demand would ultimately lead to zero increase in output economists cannot directly observe distinct supply and demand curves they can observe only the single point of equilibrium between them and this is recorded as gross domestic product thus there is direct way to determine whether change in gdp is demand or supply driven simple keynesian models assume in essence that all changes in gdp are demandside phenomena and can be explained by the process above the other models considered below assume that all changes in gdp are supplyside phenomena in recessions this assumption is often valid unless the recession is caused by supply shock such as an increase in the price of oil in expansions the assump tion is problematic because aggregate spending already matches potential production in which case the process described above may be poor guide for explaining reality thus the same tax cut implemented at full employment will result in significantly smaller boost to aggregate spending and employment than during recession since the 2001 tax cuts t ook place during recession and the 20022003 tax cuts took place during period of sluggish recovery characterized by an economy operating below full employment the keynesian framework is valid one to capture at least in part the effects of these tax cuts on the economy in this framework these tax cuts would be predicted to stimulate aggregate demand which would be manifested in the data as an increase in gdp growth the size 7 tax cut that was financed by lower government spending would not stimulate aggregate spending because the increase in private spending among the tax cuts recipients would be offset by the decrease in government spending in the keynesian model the key to stimulus is the larger deficit not the tax cut httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32502g25g145g138g157g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g6g146g141g561g157g145g142g561g344g342 g342g343

increase in the budget deficit was small less than 1 of gdp each year how did the economy react following the tax cuts in evaluating the effect of the tax cuts on aggregate demand the unusual nature of the economic recession and recovery poses serious problem keynesian models predict that tax cuts will boost gdp growth and employment and other measures of capacity utilization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001 growth and employment moved in opposite directions based on gdp data this recession and subsequent recovery was characterized by its mildness the decline in gdp during the recession was relatively brief and shallow and economic output returned to its previous peak quicklyalthough growth was not initially rapid in the recovery gdp was not far below its peak this is illustrated in table 3 based on these data the argument could be made that egtrra prevented deeper and longer recession from taking place alternatively it could be argued that despite very large tax cuts the recession was comparable length to although it was clearly shallower than other recessions in which taxes were not cut furthermore there is the question of whether the tax cuts that came after egtrra were useful in stimulating aggregate spending even if it is believed that the earlier ones were historical experience shows that eventually recessions end on their own through market adjustment and monetary expansion every recession in the postwar period has lasted less than year and half by the time jgtrra was implementedtwo years after the recession had endedit can be argued that the economy was in little need of further stimulus and unlike most recoveries gdp growth was sluggish for the first six quarters of this recovery despite three tax cuts this view would lead to the conclusion that the tax cuts particularly the latter two made impression on the normal market forces that determine expansion and contraction the counterargument would stress the initially sluggish nature of the recovery as evidence that further stimulus was required t able 3 gdp gr wth in historical recessions period duration f recession months percent decline in gdp cumulative

dated by nber less than 01 by these measures making the case that the tax cuts boosted aggregate spending is more difficult at best it could be argued that the tax cuts prevented the decline in aggregate spending from being even longer and deeper but why would this recession have been worse than others in the tax cuts absence to make this case circumstances in this recession that made it unique would have to be identified some recent events can be used to make this case such as the september 11 attacks although they did not occur until the recession was almost over and the stock market crash however this case is weakened by the role of monetary policy the depth and duration of the double dip recessions of the early 1980s are widely attributed to the monetary contraction that preceded them in recent years monetary policy has played the opposite role sharply mitigating any recessionary forces as discussed below does the employment or gdp data give more accurate picture of the recessions depth and breadth although single data set gives complete picture of the economy one compelling argument is that the gdp data understate the recessions severity the strong growth in productivity throughout the recession and recovery suggests that the higher rates of productivity growth first registered in the late 1990s have continued to the present if this is the case then the

discussed above the key to evaluating tax cuts effect as stimulus is the extent to which it boosts aggregate spending by definition to boos t aggregate demand stimulus package must lead to spending rather than saving any policyinduced increase in the deficit would lead to some increase in aggregate spending all else equal but one criticism that was made about the recent tax cuts was that they would deliver relatively little bang for the buck as stimulus measure that is while they would boost aggregate spending in the economy because of their design they would have very low multiplier effect relative to alternative policy options several arguments have been made for why the recent tax cuts provided relatively little bang for the buck compared to the alternatives 8 first government spending has greater multiplier effect than tax cuts because some portion of tax cut is saved rather than spent second it is believed that tax cuts for upper income cohortsthe primary recipients of the recent tax cutsprovide less bang for the buck than tax cuts for lower income cohorts because upper income cohorts have higher saving rates third some argue that more of tax cut will be saved if it is temporary rather than permanent by law major parts of egtrra and jgtrra are scheduled to expire after 10 years however this factor may be inconsequential because individuals may view the tax cuts as permanent since the legislators who supported the ta x cuts indicated their intention to make them permanent finally certain provisions of the recent tax cuts are intended to promote saving rather than spending such as the reduction in the taxation of dividends and the elimination of the estate tax by definition these provisions would not be stimulative although the tax cuts could have been designed to have larger bang for the buck for the reasons listed above it is an open question as to whether the difference would have been substantial or negligible econometric models are typically not detailed enough in the modeling of fiscal policy to answer this question definitively further complicating the question the alternative economic models discussed below predict differentin some cases contradictoryfactors that would make tax cut more effective for example in the solow growth model tax cut that promoted saving and discouraged consumption would have more positive effect on growth in any case it is fair to say that the most important factor in determining the effect of fiscal stimulus on the economy is its size the incremental increase in the budget deficit not the specific form that the stimulus takes

when considering the shortrun effects of the tax cuts on gdp one should also net out the stimulative effects of changes in monetary policy most economists believe that monetary policy has strong effect on aggregate demand growth in the short run and that lower interest rates were more important factor than tax cuts in tempering the depth and length of the recession indeed there was large

for inflation expost reveals that real interest rates were lower in three of the previous seven recessions than in 2003 and the recent decline in interest rates was smaller than any other recession in the previous three decades thus monetary policy did not play more prominent role than usual in mitigating the recession nor did monetary policy play large role in causing the recession shortterm interest rates were raised by 175 percentage points between 1999 and 2000 this is much smaller than the episodes of significant monetary tightening in 1969 1973 and 19801981 which are credited with

inflation rate is determined by the interaction of aggregate demand and supply when aggregate demand exceeds supply inflation rises because there is too much money chasing too few goods when spending is inadequate to maintain full employment inflation falls keynesian models are based on the assumption of price stickiness prices are slow to adjust to changes in aggregate supply and demand tax cut pushes up inflation by increasing aggregate demand all else equal because of sticky prices the entire increase in prices does not occur instantaneously when the economy is already near full employment the increase in inflation is likely to be quick and substantial relative to the tax cut because production is incapable of being increased enough to match the increase in spending when the economy is below full employment the increase in inflation would likely be smaller and slower because there can be greater increase in production to meet the increase in spending

is highly unlikely that all else will remain equal in reality inflation is ultimately determined by the federal reserves manipulation of the money supply and the fed has shown strong preference in recent decades for maintaining relatively low and stable inflation rate when evaluating the effects of change in fiscal policy the most realistic assumption to make is that the fed would take steps to offset any inflationary effects that the policy change may have thus the most realistic assumption to make about tax cut in the abstract is that it will lead to higher short term interest rates via tighter monetary policy rather than higher inflation this is particularly true if the tax cut takes place when the economy is near full employment in which case the monetary response will negate most of the tax cuts effect on aggregate spending if the economy is in recession inflationary pressures are less likely to be concern and the fed is less likely to allow interest rates to rise ie it will accommodate the fiscal expansion in the case of the recent tax cuts inflation was extremely low as measured by the consumer price index it fell from 34 in 2000 to 16 in 2002 and then rose to 23 in 2003 with the federal funds rate declining by 55 percentage points from 20002003 there was tightening of monetary policy to offset the inflationary effects of fiscal policy at most the easing of monetary policy that occurred would have been larger in the absence of the tax cutbut the fed was limited by how much further monetary policy could have been eased under traditional methods since shortterm interest rates were brought down to 1 close to the zero bound g5g152g151g156g158g150g153g157g146g152g151g561 it is often assumed that insufficient aggregate spending the source of recessions in keynesian models refers to personal consumption spending in fact aggregate spending is composed of personal consumption private investment government spending and net exports and shortfall in any of these components can cause recession in 20012003 consumption growth was slightly below normal but was consistently the strongest component of gdp growth as seen in table 6 thus it would be inaccurate to characterize the 2001 recession as being caused by insufficient consumer spending by far the weakest component of the economy was private investment sp ending as will be discussed below this is not unusual in all of the postwar recessions investment spending growth was lower than gdp growth and consumer spending was higher than gdp growth 9 at most consumption spending indirectly

fourth quarter of 2001 seems to have been dominated by onetime automobile sales incentives expansionary monetary policy may also have played role in sustaining consumption since much of the growth in spending was concentrated in interestsensitive durable goods note that the argument that tax cuts boosted consumption spending is mutually exclusive with the supplyside argument described below that tax cuts will boost national saving 10

keynesian models are useful for understanding shortterm fluctuations in the business cycle they provide little insight into the causes of longterm growth when the economy is already at full employment in other words keynes ian models emphasize movements in aggregate demand and deemphasize changes in aggregate supply although the shortterm might appear to be more worthy goal of fiscal policy than the long term many economists would argue that the shortterm effects of fiscal policy have been overemphasized and the longterm effects neglected that is because the federal reserve and market forces have proven able to keep the economy growing steadily for sustained periods of time without relying on activist fiscal policy in which case when the economy is not in recession the advice derived from keynesian models will be based on factors that are not pa rticularly relevant at that point in time since the 2001 tax cuts were enacted during recession keynesian models are probably the single best guide for evaluating its effects at the time yet by the time the 2003 tax cuts were passed the economy had nearly returned to full employment at least based on gdp data furthermore going forward into the future these tax cuts if made permanent will continue to have an effect on the supply side of the economy but effect on the demand side of the economy thus growth models can play valuable role in evaluating the longrun effects of these tax cuts and when evaluating tax cuts in the abstract it may be most sensible to assume that the economy is at full employmentsince recessions are rareand omit demandside effects from the analysis g16g142g152g140g149g138g156g156g146g140g138g149g561g21g152g149g152g160g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561g15g152g141g142g149g561 the standard neoclassical growth model developed by nobel laureate robert solow explains growth in terms of the input of resources into pr oduction that lead to greater output in the basic model inputs are labor and physical capital plant and equipment any increase in production that is not attributable to these two inputs eg improved business practices is caused by productivity growth 11 over long periods of time technological change which is recorded as productivity growth dominates per capita output growth which suggests that the permanent economic effects of any tax cut will be limited output cannot be influenced by changes in spending as in keynesian models and there is typically monetary sector in the model the 10 the keynesian prediction of higher consumption is also in contrast to intertemporal models with ricardian equivalence described below which predict that consumptio n would fall in response to deficit financed tax cut 11 the analogous measure recorded by the bureau of labor statistics is called total factor productivity growth

capital investment is exactly equal to national saving and saving can be undertaken by individuals businesses through retained earn ings or the government when the government runs budget surplus it increases national saving when it runs deficit it decreases national saving because it must borrow to finance expenditures in excess of revenues thus deficitfinanced tax cuts of the type the united states has pursued in the past few years reduce economic growth in solow growth models by reducing national saving which in turn lowers private investment 12 as national saving falls interest ratesthe cost of borrowingrise as firms bid for shrinking pot of resources to finance their investment spending this is often referred to as the crowding out effect13 the decline in growth caused by the budget deficit predicted by the solow model is based on two assumptions first private saving at the household or corporate level does not rise to offset the fall in government saving this possibility will be explored in the section below on supplyside effects second investment is not financed from abroad to offset the fall in government saving which will be considered in the next section table 7 shows what happened to saving and investment after the tax cuts the budget deficit shifted by 6 percentage points of gdp between 2000 and 2004 of this about 23 percentage points of the shift can be attributed to the tax cuts according to official exante estimates over the same period private saving did not rise nearly enough to offset the decline in public saving of 6 percentage points of gdpprivate saving rose by 14 percentage points so national saving fell by 46 percentage points of gdp at the same time the recession and stock market decline caused investment demand to decline by 31 percentage points of gdp this partly explains why interest rates did not rise as result of the budget deficitinterest rates are determined by supply and demand and the supply of saving and the demand for investment happened to fall simultaneously for unrelated reasons the reduced investment demand was temporary factor caused by the recession however had investment stayed at it s 2000 level there would have been only three quarters as much national saving available to finance it 12 more precisely growth in solow models declines in the medium run when the rate of capital formation declines in the steady state changes in the rate of capital formation have effect on growth 13 similar effect occurs in keynesian models for different reasons in the keynesian model the rise in aggregate spending resulting from the budget deficit causes the dema nd for money to rise to restore equilibrium in money markets interest rates must rise when interest rates rise investment spending and interestsensitive spending declines the primary difference between the solow model and keynesian model is that growth cannot fall as the result of deficit in the keynesian model as it does in the solow model that is because interest rates only rise if aggregate spending rises at most the crowding out of investment can entirely offset the rise in aggregate spending so that growth does not rise but it cannot cause growth to fall

in investment spending is pertinent because certain provisions of jcwaa and jgtrra were specifically aimed at boosting capital investment jcwaa contained temporary accelerated depreciation provisions for certain types of capital investment structures were notable exception and this provision was exte nded and expanded under jgtrra jgtrra also temporarily increased the amount of investment that an unincorporated businesses can expense14 the effectiveness of these provisions depends on whether they caused capital investment to be higher than it otherwise would have been in fact capital investment fell by 20 percentage points of gdp between 2001 and 2003 as with any tax cut evaluating the efficacy of these provisions is hindered by uncertainty concerning how much lower capital investment would have been without the provisions the efficacy of the provisions may have been partly offset because they were deficit financed due to the crowding out effect in addition to influencing the overall level of investment spending these provisions may have distorted the form of capital investment since not all types of investment were eligible this may explain why the decline in capital investment was so concentrated in structures which were not generally eligible under the provisions between 2001 and 2003 investment in equipment fell by 3 whereas investment in structures fell by 21 this pattern is unusual investment in structures contracted more than investment in equipment in only two other postwar recessions

must first buy us dollars and this pushes up the value of the dollar as the dollar appreciates us exports and importcompeting goods become less competitive this causes exports to fall and imports to rise increasing the trade deficit by definition the increase in the trade deficit will be equal to the borrowing from abroad because the only way the united states can borrow from abroad is if the us purchases more imports than foreigners purchase us exports15 as can be seen in table 6 there is some evidence that the decline in government saving has been partly offset by foreign borrowing even though priv ate investment fell by three percentage points of gdp between 2000 and 2004 borrowing from foreigners the trade deficit rose by 16 of gdp to record high of 5616 some economists questioned the sustainability of borrowing at that pace particularly since the demand for borrowing was depressed over most of that period by the fall in capital investment spending

some argue that tax cuts boost longrun growth by giving individuals greater incentive to work and save if tax cuts caused individuals to extend their work hours or join the labor force this would increase output directly likewise if tax cuts caused individuals to save moreassuming this had shortrun effects on aggregate demandthere would be more saving available for investment and growth would rise there are three main problems with this reasoning first capital investment is determined by national saving not private saving national saving consists of personal saving business saving and public saving when the government runs budget deficit public saving is negative and reduces national saving because the recent tax cuts were deficit financed any increase in private saving they caused would have to exceed the increase in the budget deficit to prevent investment spending from falling some of the provisions such as the dividend tax reduction and repeal of the estate tax are intended to promote saving but others are likely to encourage consumption second it is not clear theoretically whether tax cuts would increase or decrease growth marginal reductions in income tax rates elimination of the estate tax and dividend tax reductions have separate substitution effect and income effect by making work and saving more rewarding these tax cuts may induce individuals to undertake more of each this is called the substitution effect and raises growth but there is an opposing income effect that lowers growth by making individuals more wealthy on an aftertax basis tax cuts require less work and saving to achieve their financial goals for example with lower tax rate less saving is needed to reach target such as retirement or the purchase of car or vacation the net effect on growth will depend on the strength of the substitution effect relative to the income effect but some of the provisions of the recent tax cuts have substitution effect they only have an income effect and would 15 these results are identical in keynesian open economy model with perfect capital mobility in such model the stimulative effects of the tax cut are completely offset by wider trade deficit the actual economy is somewhere between the theoretical cases of an open economy and closed economy since capital does flow in and out of countries in response to interest rate differentials but not sufficientl to eliminate differentials entirely thus the tax cuts will provide some stimulus but not as much as the closed economy keynesian model would predict 16 looking at the current account there was significant decline in trade during the recession in 2001 the trade deficit increased because exports declined more rapidly than imports in 2002 the trade deficit increased because imports grew more rapidly than exports

child tax credit and marriage penalty relief for most taxpayers third there is the issue of how large these supply side effects are empirically could the substitution effect and income effect cancel each other out so that the effect on growth is negligible even if the substitution effect dominates how much more work will be induced by reduction in the marginal tax rate from for example 31 to 28 why has the working week first shortened and then stayed relatively constant over the past century when wages and tax rates were rising empirical research is not conclusive with some studies finding tax cuts to have positive effect on labor supply and some finding negative effect most of the estimates are modest and some are statistically insignificant not statistically different from zero there is little consensus on the effects of tax cuts on personal saving reflecting the empirical literature the joint committee on taxation assumed in its macroeconomic model labor supply substitution elasticity of 018 and an income elasticity of 013 so that the two almost cancel out for very small labor response this means that 10 reduction in aftertax income would lead to 05 increase in labor supply and smaller increase in gdp it assumes longrun saving elasticity of 029 17 cbo assumed labor supply elasticity of 007 for primary earners and 05 elasticity for secondary earners18 research suggests that workingaged males are not very sensitive to changes in tax rates they tend to work fulltime regardless of the tax rate their ability to alter their hours in response to change in tax rates may be limited at least in the short term some married women older workers and younger workers may be more sensitive to tax rates because they are less attached to the workforce but estimates of their sensitivity vary significantly from study to study the dramatic rise in female labor force participation in the postwar period suggests that cultural factors may be far more important determinant of labor supply than tax policyand in the case of married women may have already run their course 19 casual observation does not reveal higher labor supply or national saving since the recent tax cuts have been enacted as seen in table 7 private saving has risen since 2000 but by less than one third as much as public saving has fallen while less than half of the decline in public saving is attributed to the tax cuts the increase in the deficit caused by the tax cuts alone exceeded the increase in private saving furthermore some of the increase in private saving could have been motivated by unrelated factors such as precautionary saving in response to the recession finally the composition of the increase in saving casts further doubts on causation with the exception of accelerated depreciation all of the major provisions of the tax cuts affected individuals yet the increase in private saving is entirely attributable to increased business savingpersonal saving actually fell from 17 to 13 of gdp between 2000 and 2004 as seen in table 8 since 2000 labor supply has fallen both in terms of total employment and hours worked as seen in table 8 of course this decline was overwhelmingly attributable to the recession and sluggish recovery through 2003 but it suggested that any supply side incentives to work more were swamped by the weakness of the economy and were not significant factor even after growth 17 john diamond and pamela moomau issues in analyzing the macroeconomic effects of tax policy national tax journal vol lvi 3 september 2003 p 447 18

only as the labor supply moves from the old hours worked to the new hours worked after that labor supply will not continue to grow in response to the tax cut20 by contrast the effects of the deficit on saving are ongoing until the ec onomy returns to its steady state if the deficit financed tax cuts result in decline in national saving as the data would seem to indicate then the negative effect on growth would be ongoing although the difference between demandside effects and supplyside effects are distinct in theory it is difficult to disentangle them in practice assume taxes are cut in recession caused by insufficient consumption leading to higher aggregate spending as the tax cuts are spent by individuals the increase in aggregate spending would bring involuntarily unemployed workers back into the labor force and increase the hours of involuntarily underemployed workers in supplyside analysis unless properly controlled for it would appear that workers were responding to the incentives of lower tax rates to voluntarily increase their labor supply and would be taken as evidence in favor of supplyside economics this also suggests that many workers will not be able to take advantage of supplyside incentives that do exist in recessions because they will not be able to voluntarily increase their hours at time when labor is underutilized

nontheoretical nature21 they turned to macroecnomic models based on 20 the only ongoing effect from an increase in the labor supply on economic growth comes from the fact that some of the additional output generated from the onetime increase in labor supply will be invested leading to growth in the capital stock 21 see for example robert lucas and thomas sargent after keynesian macroeconomics in

here as intertemporal models infinite horizon models and overlapping generation models such as lifecycle models are some prominent examples in this category in these models individuals plan their lifetime work leisure saving and consumption choices at present in order to maximize their lifetime utility wellbeing the advantage of these highly sophisticated highly mathematical models is that every decision made by individuals is rooted in logical coherent decision the disadvantages are that these models make unrealistically complex assumptions about how individuals make decisions and the models are more grounded in theory than evidenceparticularly because their theoretical complexity makes empirical estimation problematic 22 for example infinite horizon models assume that individuals live and have planned their work saving and consumption forever even if one believes that concern for ones descendants makes the infinite horizon close to actual behavior for parents not everyone has descendants or values their descendants well being on par with their own as another example the models often do not feature uncertainty or uncertainty is assumed to cancel out in the aggregate about future earnings prices rates of return or government policies when individuals make decisions today because of the long timeframe taken by these models deficitfinanced tax cut cannot be evaluated because it is not sustainable policyeventually tax cut must be offset by higher taxes or lower government spending or else the national debt would become infinitely large 23 thus when these models are used to evaluate tax cuts some assumption must be made about higher taxes or lower spending at some point in the future although there is obvious choice for when the policy change is likely to occur or what form it is likely to take these choices are unfortunately critical to the models results the primary reason why saving and labor supply change in these models when taxes are cut is because of the wedge they create between aftertax wages and interest rates now relative to the future for example in lifecycle model individuals are assumed to keep their lifetime consumption constant when taxes are cut today and raised in the future the model predicts that individuals will work and save more today when taxes are low in order to work and save less when taxes are raised if the tax cut leads to seemingly innocuous change in interest rates this can affect labor pply today because higher interest rate makes the discounted value of leisure in the future greater as result people work more today so they can save more and work less in the future if the tax cuts are instead assumed to be financed through lower future government spending in many of these models there is smaller labor and saving response induced by the tax cut since private spending cannot be substituted for government spending these models also contain to varying degrees effects known as ricardian equivalence ricardian equivalence is the theoretical notion that budget deficits would not cause interest rates to rise because individuals know the deficits will be offset by higher taxes or lower government spending in the future as result private saving rises today to prepare for future consumption losses and replaces the fall in public saving so that there is net effect on national saving and capital investment in infinite horizon models there is total ricardian equivalence because people 22 intertemporal models have not been without their critics group of economists known as behavioral economists have developed new economic models based on irrational rule of thumb and bounded rational behavior for an overview of behavior economics see richard thaler and sendil mulianathan behavioral economics

such as life cycle models the ricardian effect is only applicable to those generations that will still be alive when taxes are raised or spending is cut so there is only partial private saving offset the theoretical sophistication of intertemporal models comes at the expense of empirical accuracy because the models are so complex they cannot be empirically estimated directly instead the models are simulated with certain key parameters inferred from empirical evidence some of the parameters must be inferred because they are also too complex to measure directly for this reason the model results should not be considered direct evidence of tax cuts effect most economists believe these models do poor job of explaining economic activity in the short run 24 in these models there are demandside effects such as involuntary unemployment ie everyone who wants job can find one or excess capacity there tends to be modeling of monetary policy since there are short term effects workers are free to lower or raise their work hours or even enter or exit employment as they desire indeed when these models generate substantial growth effects in response to tax cut it is because they assume that work and saving patterns voluntarily fluctuate greatly because the tax cut changes present and future economic conditions although these models may offer certain insights into behavior over the long run they are unsuitable for evaluating tax cut whose purpose is shortterm stimulus in recession g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152g143g561g21g146g150g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 before egtrra and jgtrra were enacted nu mber of simulations were performed that estimated their economic effects using the economic models discussed above estimates of jcwaas effects were found as tax cut proposals move through the policy process details change the estimates presented here are based on proposals that may differ slightly from the policy that was eventually enacted it should be stressed that all of the estimates were made before the fact none of the estimators examined the data retrospectively to check their accuracy nearly all of the simulations showed that the tax cuts would have positive effects in the short run and negative effects in the long run often the longrun effects did not entirely materialize by the end of the traditional 10year forecast window thus the tax cuts cannot be said to be unambiguously good or bad the merits of this tradeoff depend on policymakers preferences over time

the next 150 years this model did not contain shortterm business cycle properties like all intertemporal models permanent deficitfinanced tax cut is inconsistent with the model because it would have caused the national debt to grow indefinitely au erbach assumed that the tax cut would result in higher taxes at some point in the future and ran simulations in which either the tax on labor or the tax on capital was raised an increase in the wage tax reduced output more than an increase in the capital tax faced with lower tax rates in the short run and higher tax rates in the long run the model assumed that individuals work and save more while the tax cut is in place and work and save less while the permanently higher tax rates are in place as result saving rates and output were increased while the lower tax rates were in place and lowered while the permanently higher tax rates were in place the eventual increase in taxes reduced gdp the longer the tax increase was postponed the more long run gdp fell the tax cuts caused output to rise by about 1 by 2004 in the first year of the tax increase output declined by enough to leave it below the baseline level and in the long run output

referred to as rebate of up to 600 as an advanced tax credit in lieu of the 10 tax bracket30 some studies have looked specifically at the effects of this credit on consumption and saving unlike the other studies summarized here these studies were estimated from ex post empirical evidence and were not based on ex simulations using macroeconomic models david johnson jonathon parker nicholas souleles used regression analysis to determine whether the rebate affected the consumption of nondurable goods31 they found that 2337 of the rebate check was spent on higher nondurable consumption within the first three months of receipt if the remainder of the rebate was saved then the effect on aggregate demand is likely to be modest however it may have been spent on services durable goods or investment goods which the study did not include evidence showed that most of the remaining rebate was spent within the next two quarters although those fi ndings were not statistically significant econometric studies of this type are hampered by several factors including selfreporting errors problem with most economic data random fluctuations in high frequency data insufficient variation in the data over time because most of the rebate checks were received within two months and omitted variable bias both because the study did not control for other factors influencing consumption over time eg macroeconomic conditions and because the control group of rebate nonrecipients may have differed in important ways eg income and marital status that influenced consumption thereby attrib uting the influence of those omitted variables to the rebates when nonrecipients were excluded from their calculations the results became statistically insignificant joel slemrod and matthew shapiro of the university of michigan analyzed the results of telephone surveys before and after the rebate was sent the survey asked individuals whether they planned tohad mostly spent the rebate saved the rebate or use the rebate to pay down debt from an economic perspective the last two choices are both form of saving and only the first response would lead to an increase in aggregate spending in both surveys about onequarter planned to mostly spend the rebate and about threequarters planned to save it or used it to pay down debt which does not suggest the rebate had strong stimulative effects survey results should be considered with caution because it is wellknown among researchers that survey responses often differ systematically from actual behavior the authors argued that the sharp increase in the personal saving rate in the months that the rebate were sent out supports their findings 32 continued potter estimate that gdp would be 037 percentage points higher than gnp 30 see crs report

effects of jgtrra as it was passed using three different models33 thus the committee assumed that jgtrra would be allowed to expire in 2013 as scheduled and the tax cuts with the exception of new dividend and capital gains tax cuts are an acceleration of tax cuts that in the baseline would have already gone into effect in future years the jct used two models with keynesian shortterm properties and neoclassical longterm properties proprietary model and the global insight model assuming that the federal reserve fed responds aggressively to keep inflation stableconsistent with their actual behavior in recent yearsthe proprietary model predicted that gdp would be increased by cumulative total of 02 after five years with less aggressive fed the global insight model predicted that gdp would be increased by cumulative total of 09 after five years in both models gdp would be reduced by cumulative total of 01 over the next five years primarily due to crowding out the third model was an intertemporal life cycle model which as discussed previously required an assumption that taxes will be raised or spending cut in the future to finance the tax cut the life cycle model predicted that gdp would be increased by cumulative total of 02 over the first five years and decreased by cumulative total over the next five years by 01 if the tax cuts were financed by reduced government transfer payments eg social security after 2013 and reduced 02 if financed by higher taxes after 2013 in other words the negative effects on growth would begin even before taxes are raised or spending is cut because the dividend tax cuts and accelerated depreciation create an incentive to invest in capital equipment the models predicted that investment in residential housing would decline as investors shift from investment in housing to equipment g5g4g17g561 the congressional budget office evaluated the economic effects of the presidents overall budget proposal for fy2004 34 this differed from jgtrra because it included other spending and revenue proposals and the analysis was based on the tax cut that was proposed by the president not what he signed into law still the tax cut was the most significant budgetary proposal in fy2004 and the presidents proposal was arguably close to the version enacted so cbos analysis was pertinent one important difference between the presidents proposal and jgtrra was that the president proposed to make egtrrajgtrra permanent because of the uncertainty and complexity surrounding macroeconomic modeling cbo employed five different econometric models and nine different scenarios to make its projections although the results varied by model and scenario all were modest relative to gdp all of the models predicted that the tax cuts would increase interest rates except under the open economy assumption where borrowing from abroad completely compensates for the fall in national saving 35 33 joint committee on taxation macroeconomic

projected to decrease gdp by an average of 02 from 2004 to 2008 and an average of 07 from 2009 to 2013 the tax cuts reduced growth because the increase in labor supply was not sufficient to offset the decrease in the capital stock caused by the larger budget deficit in this model cbo assumed that labor supply would increase and 65 of the decline in public saving caused by government borrowing would be offset by higher private saving and borrowing from abroad without these ad hoc offsets which are not empirically estimated the decline in gdp would be greater cbos evaluation produced six different results based on intertemporal models because intertemporal models require that the budget eventually return to balance cbo applied different scenarios in which lumpsum taxes were raised or spending was cut after 10 years 36 it produced results with an infinite horizon model and life cycle model both under an open economy ie the united states can borrow from abroad and closed economy assumption it estimated that the budget proposals would reduce gnp if financed by lower government spending after 2013 gnp would change 02 to 08 from 2004 to 2008 and 06 to 20 from 2009 to 2013 but increase gnp if financed by higher taxes after 2013 gnp would increase by 03 to 09 from 2004 to 2008 and 03 to 14 from 2009 to 2013 37 it may sound counterintuitive that higher future taxes are better for the economy than lower government spending but that is because of the oddities of the intertemporal models38 because individuals are assumed not to value government spendinga highly unrealistic assumptionthere is less incentive to work and save more in the first 10 years in response to the tax cuts when they are financed through lower government spending by contrast when the tax cuts are financed through higher future taxes these models assume that there is large incentive to work and save more now in order to work and save less once taxes are raised cbo also estimated the economic effects of the budget proposals using two keynesian models the ma model and the global insight gi model for these models cbo estimated results only for five years because the models are designed to capture only shortrun phenomena cbo added larger labor supply responses to the models than the original modelers estimated on average the proposals would increase gdp by 02 in the ma model and 14 in the gi model in both models the supplyside effects were negative and the demandside effects were positive over five years gdp increased only because of the stimulus to aggregate spending the increase in gdp would be possible only if the fed did not offset it which it might do to keep inflation from rising in the ma model gdp would be higher for the first three and lower for the next three years in the gi model gdp would be higher for every year of the projection continued the increase in interest rates were larg est in the keynesian simulations and lowest in the intertemporal simulations 36 cbos assumption that the presidents budget proposals would be financed through higher future lump sum taxes eg head tax is curious since the government does not currently collect any lump sum taxes cbo reports that if it had instead assumed that the budget proposals were financed with marginal tax increases the increase in gdp would have been smaller 37 the results for gdp are equal to the gnp results for closed economy models in the open economy variation gdp is slightly higher because it includes the income accruing to foreigners as result of net capital inflows 38 higher taxes reduce gdp in the model outside the reported 10 year projection window

couple of years of simulation and neoclassical properties in the long run ma private forecasting firm projected that jgtrra would boost growth by 05 percentage points in 2003 and 10 percentage points in 2004 they projected that jgtrra would reduce growth in later years leaving gdp 03 lower by 2017 the longrun effects are largely the result of the administrations proposal to make egtrra perman ent provision that was not included in the version of jgtrra signed into law because the economy was already close to full employment jgtrra would cause inflation and intere st rates to rise quickly in their model as result while jgtrra would reduce unemployment from 2003 to 2006 it would increase unemployment from 2006 through the rest of the decade jgtrra was projected to raise long term interest

already scheduled to take place as result of egtrra were modeled as new tax cuts rather than accelerated tax cuts if individuals did not treat them as new their effect on aggregate demand would be

and neoclassical properties in the long run41 global insights model projected that jgtrra as propos ed by the bush administration would increase growth by 02 percentage points in 2003 09 percentage points in 2004 and 01 percentage points in 2005 primarily by stimulating aggregate demand after that point jgtrra would reduce economic growth by 05 percentage points in 2006 and smaller amounts for couple of years after that primarily through the crowding out effect of the budget deficit jgtrra was also projected to increase inflation by 0203 percentage points per year through 2006 with the inflation rate remaining 01 percentage points higher for the remainder of the 10year projection interest rates were about 025 percentage points higher for most of the 10year projection resulting in stronger dollar and larger current account deficit the dividend tax cut was projected to initially boost stock prices by 5 but prices fell slightly by the end of the projection 42 39 macroeconomic advisers preliminary analysis of the presidents jobs and growth proposals mimeo january 2003 40 estimates of tax cuts effects are sensitive not only to th model used but the assumptions entered into the model the heritage foundation also used the global insight model to estimate the effects of jgtrra and found more favorable results by using more favorable assumptions however even using more favorable assumptions they estimated that the tax cut would have negligible effect on gdp growth after the first two years over ten years they estimates that on average the tax cut would have effect on economic growth william beach et the economic and fiscal effects of the presidents growth package heritage center for data analysis april 2003 41 the model has been criticized for having extremely long lasting keynesian effects for example even at the end of the 10year projection jgtrra still causes aggregate demand to exceed the baseline in their model 42 cynthia latta the 2003 stimulus and

the macroeconomic effects of the tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2003 there is direct way to determine the effects of tax cut on the economy because there is way to observe the counterfactual case where the tax cut did not occur estimates were made by comparing the results of macroeconomic models with and without the tax cuts these estimates were made before the tax cut occurred and were not based on actual expost data unfortunately there is consensus among macroeconomists as to which one model is most suitable for policy simulations and model with strong track record in accurately projecting economic events the different models vary in fundamental ways and one model incorporates every key aspect of economic behavior keynesian models focus on the business cycle but neglect the determinants of longrun growth neoclassical growth models and intertemporal models concentrate on longrun growth but do not feature recessions involuntary unemployment or monetary policy the results generated by intertemporal models are based on assumptions about behavior that most people would find highly unrealistic despite the wide diversity of the models used all of the results are relatively small as would be expected of tax cuts that are relatively small in relation to gdp in the years considered

would boost output during recession by increasing spending so that slack labor and capital resources are brought back into production for the individual income tax cuts higher consumption in response to higher aftertax income is the channel through which spending is boosted this boost in growth is temporary because the growth rate of spending cannot exceed potential production over time keynesian macroeconomic models are the only popular model that allows for shortrun business cycle fluctuations the effect of growth in other macroeconomic models is considered next the economy was in recession of mild depth and average contraction when egtrra was passed the recovery was unusually sluggish for the first six quarters during which jcwaa and jgtrra were passed before more normal growth rate took root proponents point to the short and mild recession as evidence that egtrra boosted growth opponents point to the sluggish recovery as sign that the tax cuts were ineffective and credit monetary expansion and normal market forces for the mild recession opponents so point to the performance of labor markets as evidence that the tax cuts did not appreciably stimulate spending

and interest rates will rise most empirical estimates suggest that the offset will be only partial because some of the tax cut is not saved and national saving will fall the neoclassical solow growth model predicts that reduction in national saving would reduce economic growth over the medium term by reducing capital investment empirical evidence suggests that marginal tax cuts create incentives to work and save more referred to as supply side effects but the increases in work and saving are too small to offset the reduction in capital accumulation caused by the budget deficit thus on net

deficitfinanced tax cuts national saving fell from 20002003 but this did not lead to higher interest rates because investment demand fell even more sharply accelerated depreciation which was the major tax provision in jcwaa and was extended and expanded in jgtrra was intended to stimulat capital investment spending investment spending sharply contracted during and following the recession this is not unusual but it is difficult to make the case that investment spending would have been even lower in the absence of the tax cuts jcwaa may have distorted investment decisions toward equipment which qualified for accelerated depreciation and away from structures which generally did not qualify equipment spending contracted by 3 from 2001 to 2003 whereas spending on structures contracted by 21

from abroad must take the form of trade deficit borrowing abroad will mitigate the rise in interest rates and the crowding out of capital investment but will lead to dollar appreciation that causes exports and importcompeting goods to be crowded out evidence shows that this has occurred as the trade deficit increased from 4 in 2000 to 56 in 2004 typically the trade deficit declines when growth has been low

months after the recessiona postwar record by 10 months since the employment contraction was so prolonged it is difficult to argue it would have been even longer in the absence of the tax cuts in

supplysiders focus on the incentives that tax cuts provide to work and save more however marginal tax cuts could theoretically lead to more or less work because tax cuts also reduce the labor and saving required to meet income targets tax cuts without marginal effects such as the child tax credit unambiguously reduce work and saving it is an empirical question as to the size and direction of these effects most estimates for labor supply are positive and very small for primary earners and somewhat larger for secondary earners evidence of supplyside effects from the tax cuts exists thus far hours worked and labor force participation both declined after the tax cuts were passed this was likely due to cyclical factors which suggest that supplyside effects are not large enough to outweigh other factors even in 2004 when the expansion picked up steam there was still aggregate increase in labor supply private sector saving increased after the tax cuts but this was due to an increase in
