number between 300 and 900 is used by lender to rank potential borrower the higher the score the lower congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the risk this ranking helps to determine whether consumer qualifies for loan the amount of the loan and the loan rate during the 1990s credit scores began to be widely used by the mortgage industry lenders attest to the value of using credit scores they state that scores provide fast accurate risk assessment which can streamline the lending process by one estimate credit scores are determining factor in 90 of all us consumer credit decisions1 more recently noncreditrelated businesses including auto and homeowners insurance have found credit scores to be useful rating variable increased reliance on credit scores by lenders and other businesses raises consumer issues such as access to scores awareness and understanding of scoring systems consistency of scores and accuracy of scores credit scores are not easily explained the score provides picture of the consumers credit history and worthiness at one point in time when the score is calculated lenders and other businesses may use their own credit scoring model different scoring models for different purposes or generic model developed by credit scoring company credit scoring models use complex statistical formulas and the models vary among creditors and for different types of credit technological advances have httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298 allowed large number of predictive variables to be rapidly evaluated during the calculation of credit score models can be solely based on information from credit reports or the model may include other information found on the credit application such as income and employment history the equal credit opportunity act2 prohibits certain characteristics from being used in credit scoring system these include race sex marital status national origin and religion only recently have scores been made available to the individual consumer number of companies now offer to disclose credit scores and provide explanatory information usually for fee mortgage lenders primarily rely on credit scores generated by the three national credit reporting agencies bureaus equifax experian and trans union the three bureaus independently collect data on individual consumers and use this information to create consumer credit report the fair credit reporting act fcra3 provides consumer protections to deal with inaccurate and inappropriate use of personal information the fcra sets out requirements for all consumer reporting agencies and users of credit information four categories of data are collected for credit report personal information credit history public record information and inquiries4 data in an individuals credit report will then be fed into creditscoring model and used to calculate credit score credit report files are continually updated as the bureaus receive new information since they work independently the three bureaus do not necessarily collect identical information and the three use various models therefore not only can credit scores frequently change but each agency can generate different score for the same consumer 1 credit scores and mortgage lending aarp public policy institute ib number 52 p1 2 pub l 93495 tit 5 88 stat 1520 15 usc 1691 et seq 3 pub l 91508 tit 6 84 stat 1128 15 usc 1681 et seq 4 inquiries are requests by creditor for copy of an individuals credit report crs3 five factors scoring models generally evaluate five factors from credit report when calculating credit score different weights can be assigned to each factor for different types of credit applications the five are payment history amounts owed length of credit history new credit accounts or requests and types of credit accounts payment history is usually heavily weighted factor payment information on many types of accounts is collected in credit report accounts include credit cards retail accounts credit from stores finance company accounts and mortgage loans consumers timely payment of bills such as phone or gas does not influence this factor unless consumers account has been sent to collection agency late or missed payment information would include details such as how late amount owed and how recent was the event also included in this factor are public record and collection items including bankruptcies foreclosures suits and wage attachments amounts owed is also significant factor in credit scoring this factor evaluates the amount of debt consumer has compared to his or her credit limit is the consumer over httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298 extended any amount owed on all accounts is considered and different types of accounts are compared outstanding debt is compared with the original loan amounts the length of consumers credit history provides credit track record how long have accounts been established in general the longer an individual has had credit history the better an insufficient credit history including credit history can negatively affect score applying for new credit can affect credit scores how many new accounts does consumer have requests for credit generate inquiries requests by lenders to get copy of an individuals credit report applying for too many new accounts can negatively affect score inquiries by creditors who are monitoring consumers account or looking at credit reports to make prescreened offers are not counted how many and what types of credit accounts an individual has affects ones credit profile while it is generally good to have established credit accounts too many or certain types of credit accounts may affect score negatively some scoring systems do not rate loans from finance companies favorably policy issues the pervasive use of credit scoring has raised concerns about consumer awareness of and access to credit scores as well as the consistency and accuracy of scoring systems credit scores are standard factor in consumer credit decisions and are increasingly used as rating variable in insurance underwriting5 in addition employers have used credit scores to evaluate job applicants and landlords have used them judge prospective tenants 5 for additional information concerning credit scores and insurance see crs report rs21341 credit scores creditbased insurance scores by baird webel crs4 so credit scores are being used not only to measure consumers credit worthiness but also as factor in the evaluation of consumers financial stability responsibility and potential risk the use of credit scores in mortgage lending has generated most of the legislative attention the use of credit scoring in noncreditrelated businesses has been increasingly controversial in part because the connection between credit scores and insurance or renting is not obvious until recently the credit scoring industry did not provide consumers with access to their credit scores public pressure and 2001 california state law prompted wider availability of credit scores nationwide still many consumers first knowledge of the existence and importance of credit scores comes as result of not qualifying for loan consumer advocates state that more needs to be done to educate consumers about credit scores to make the scoring systems more transparent and to provide consumers less costly or free access to their scores the fcra permits credit bureaus to charge up to 900 for credit report and allows additional fees for credit scores for example fico scores have been available from equifax as part of credit profile package for 1295 consumer is entitled to free httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298 report if the consumer was denied credit or was notified by an insurance company of an adverse action based on information provided by credit bureau the consumer must place request within 60 days of either of those events consumers have been entitled to free annual credit bureau reports upon request under state law in six states colorado georgia maryland massachusetts new jersey and vermont consumer can end up with multitude of scores depending on the credit data used and the scoring model scores are available from variety of score providers and some lenders fees vary in addition the credit score the consumer pays for may not be the score particular lender used in the lending decisionmaking process consumer can have difficult time discovering what score was used individual lenders or insurance companies do not always provide this information just as important as obtaining the score is understanding what it represents especially if consumer wants to improve it consumer advocates argue that complete disclosure of exactly what factors were considered and how they are weighted is required to really understand score full disclosure they say would also allow testing of scoring models and formulas to determine how accurately they evaluate consumers the computations involved in scoring models are closely guarded proprietary information score providers such as fair isaac company have published some explanatory information to help consumers understand scores but they say to disclose more about their model would hurt the company competitively they say they would in effect be giving away what they are currently selling consumer advocates have argued that steps need to be taken to assure the same credit information is submitted to each bureau to minimize the differences between the credit reports generated if the information filed with credit bureaus were more consistent then the scores calculated from their credit reports would vary less advocates also backed better and more consistent reporting of positive credit information to enhance the accuracy of credit reports crs5 in december 2002 the consumer federation of america and the national credit reporting association published study of the accuracy of credit scores and credit report information6 the study was based on survey of 502623 archived credit files generated by request for the reports and scores from all three national credit reporting agencies the study found that scores from the three bureaus for consumer varied substantially many credit files had additional reports that did not belong to the consumers file and many had conflicting information the reports provided limited information to help individuals understand their particular score the study concluded that while many consumers are unharmed by these findings millions of consumers are at risk of being adversely affected by inaccurate information and incorrect scores the potential exists for individuals to either be denied credit or be placed into more expensive pricing range consumers can take steps to ensure the calculations are made on accurate information individuals can request their credit reports from all three major bureaus and check for incorrect or obsolete information correcting mistakes can be costly time consuming and frustrating the bureau has 30 days to confirm an entry with the reporting creditor and must make changes to the credit report if the mistake is confirmed if creditor fails to respond the entry must be removed this may require follow up httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21298 inquiry by the consumer to make sure correcting steps were taken therefore consumer may need to begin the process well in advance of applying for credit to guard against an adverse lending decision while correcting mistakes can improve consumers score this is not guaranteed outcome because the consumer does not know how particular entry fits into an individual scoring formula in addition scoring models may be based on more than the information found in credit report for example the model may include data from the loan application such as employment history legislation congress established consumer credit protections with the enactment of several laws dealing with specific credit practices including the fcra in 1970 the fcra has been amended to meet the developing needs of consumers for credit protections congress continues to monitor the effectiveness of the fcras provisions as the use of consumer credit information grows complaints by consumers and criticism by consumer advocates have drawn congressional interest to issues raised by credit scoring the 108th congress considered issues raised by credit reports and credit scoring during the debate over whether to renew fcra state law preemption provisions dealing with the exchange of credit information7 series of hearings held before the house financial institutions subcommittee and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs on the provisions evolved into forum for discussions on number of 6

provisions see crs report rs21449 fair credit reporting act preemption of state law by angie welborn crs6 consumer protection issues concerns included access to credit report and scoring information

introduced and passed to reauthorize and make permanent national credit reporting standards the fact act pl 108159 was signed by the president on december 4 2003 the law addresses variety of consumer protection measures that were raised during the hearings8 consumer advocates were generally supportive of the improved consumer protections but were opposed to the permanent preemption provisions
