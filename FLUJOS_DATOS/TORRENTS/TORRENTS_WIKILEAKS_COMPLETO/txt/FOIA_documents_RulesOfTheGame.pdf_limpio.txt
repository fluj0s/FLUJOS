the rulesof thegame recommendations to the climate change communications working group evidence base for the climate change communications strategy the game is communicating climate c hange the rules will help us win it the principles of climate change communicationwhy were the principles created the game is communicating climate change the rules will help us win it these principles were created as part of the uk climate change communications strategy anevidencebased strategy aimingto change public attitudestowards climate change in theuk this is short version of far longer document ofevidence that can be found atwwwdefragovuk there is plenty of evidence relating to attitudes towards andbehaviour on climate changegeneral environment behaviour change and the whole issue of sustainable developmentcommunication as we reviewedthe researc h for these principles one Ã¼berprinciple emerged changing attitudes towards climate change isnot like selling particularbrand of soap its likeconvincing someone touse soap in the first place at first glance some of the principles may seem counterintuitive to those who have been working on sustainabledevelopment or climate changecommunications for many yearssome confront dearly cherishedbeliefs about what works feweven seem to attack the values or principles of sustainable development itself however these principles are first step to using sophisticatedbehaviour change modelling andcomprehensive evidence fromaround the world to change attitudes towards climate change we need to think radically andthe rules of the game are signthat future campaigns will not bebusiness as usual this is trulyexciting moment for the full evidence for these rules and the climate change communications strategy itself please visit wwwdefragovuk for the new uk sustainable development strategy please visit wwwsustainabledevelopmentgovuk new way of thinking once weve eliminated the myths there is room for some new ideas these principles relate to some of the key ideas emerging from behaviour change modelling for sustainable development 5 climate change must be front of mind before persuasion works currently telling the public to take notice of climate change is as successful as selling tampons to men people dont realise or remember that climate change relates to them 6 use both peripheral and central processing attracting direct attention to an issue can change attitudes but peripheral messages can be just as effective tabloid snapshot of gwyneth paltrow at bus stop can help change attitudes to public transport 7 link climate c hange mitigation to positive desiresaspirations traditional marketing associates products with the aspirations of their t arget audience linking climate change mitigation to home improvement selfimprovement green spaces or national pride are all worth investigating 8 use transmitters and social learning people learn through social interaction and some people are better teac hers and trendsetters than others targeting these people will ensure that messages seem more trustworthy and aretransmitted more effectively 9 beware the impacts of cognitive dissonance confronting someone with the difference between their attitude and their actions on climate change will make them more likely to changetheir attitude than their actions2blowing away myths many of the oftrepeated communications methods and messages of sustainable development have been dismissed by mainstream communicators behaviour change experts and psychologists before we go into what works our principles make clean sweep of what doesnt 1 challenging habits of climate change communication dont rely on concern about childrens future or human survival instincts recent surveys show that people without children may care more about climate change than those with children fight or flight humansurvival instincts have time limit measured in minutes they are oflittle use for change in climate measured in years dont create fear without agency fear can create apathy if individuals have agency to act upon the threat use fear with great caution dont attack or criticise home or family it is unproductive to attack that which people hold dear 2 forget the climate change detractors those who deny climate c hange science are irritating but unimportant the argument is not about ifwe should deal with climate change but how we should deal with climate change 3 there is rational man the evidence discredits the rational man theory we rarely weigh objectively the value of different decisions and then t ake the clear selfinterested choice 4 information cant work alone providing information is not wrong relying on information alone to change attitudes is wrong remember also that messages about saving money are important but not thatimportant1 style principles these principles lend some guidance on the evidence of stylistic themes that have high chance of success 16 create trusted credible recognised voice on climate change we need trusted organisations and individuals that the media can call upon to explain the implications of climate change to the uk public 17 use emotions and visuals another classic marketing rule changing behaviour by disseminating information doesnt always work but emotions and visuals usually do effective management these principles are drawn primarily from the experience of others both in their successes and in the problems they faced 18 the context affects everything the prioritisation of these principles must be subject to ongoing assessments of the u k climate c hange situation 19 the communications must be sustained over time all the most successful public awareness campaigns have been sustained consistently over many years 20 p artnered delivery of messages will be more successful experience shows that partnered delivery is often key component for projects that are large complex and have many stakeholders5 6linking policy and communications these principles clearly deserve separate section all the evidence is clear sometimes aggressively so that communications in theabsence of policy will precipitate the failure of any climate changecommunications campaign right from the start 10 everyone must use clear and consistent explanation of climate change the public knows that climate change is important but is less clear on exactly what it is and how it works 11 government policy and communications on climate change must be consistent dont build in inconsistency and failure from the start audience principles in contrast to the myths this section suggests some principles that dowork these principles are likely to lead directly to set of general messages although each poses significant implementation challenge 12 create agency for combating climate c hange agency is created when people know what to do decide for themselves to do it have access to the infrastructure in which to actand understand that their contribution is important 13 mak climate c hange home not away issue climate c hange is global issue but we will feel its impact at home and we can act on it at home 14 raise the status of climate change mitigation behaviours research shows that energy efficiency behaviours can make you seem poor and unattractive w must work to overcome these emotional assumptions 15 target specific groups
