technological change in todays society is truly remarkable moores law is good example gordon moore former head of the worlds largest semiconductor maker intel correctly predicted in 1965 that the computing speed of silicon chips would double every year1 rapid advances in telecommunications have ended the constraints of time and distance and led commentators to call ours the information age the knowledge society the digital age or the networked nation personal computers blackberry laptops interactive television wireless networks and more are technological devices reshaping the habits and routines of individuals and institutions including the us congress the relationship between congress and the internet is multifaceted the emergence of any major technological development railroads radio automobiles etc always give rise to legislative debates about the need for new tax regulatory or management laws the internet is exception it has expanded the legislative agenda and influenced aspects of the lawmaking process congress is now grappling with host of complex internetr elated issues heretofore not on its agenda such as the extent to which copyright protections should be extended to material transmitted in cyberspace or whether state and local governments should collect sales taxes on goods and services traded on the internet today scores of information technology bills are introduced in the house and senate in each congress influencing the work of nearly all congressional committees and members and spawning the growth of new array of intere st groups for example after ignoring washington for years google embraced the lobbying world in scramble to match bases long established here by competitors like yahoo and microsoft as well as the deeply entrenched telecommunications companies 2 thus the invention of the internet as new communications medium formed by the interconnection of num erous computers has led congress into new frontiers of lawmaking oversight and representation the internets influence is also evident within and between the chambers of congress nearly every nook and cranny is filled with diverse t echnologies for example member and committee offices are wired to various electronic networks numerous data bases available via the internet provide lawmakers committees and staff aides with wide range of information legislative support units such as the congressional research service government accountability office or government printing office integrate the internet into their work committees and lawmakers maintain their own websites 3 each chamber has its own intranet thousands of staff use blackberry or other portable devices and the exchange of legislative email addresses is as common as trading telephone numbers there is even bicameral bipartisan internet caucus which has as one of its prime goals moving congress ever more quickly into the information age outside organizations such as the congressional management foundation and the congress online project affiliated with george washington university provide relevant information and ideas to congressional offices on how they might enhance their use of electronic communications 1 paul abrahams and louise kehoe moores law sets the pace of progress financial times june 23 2001 p 7 2 kate phillips once maverick google joins the lobbying herd new

politics and policymaking congress usually reacts cautiously to new complexities and innovations the congress never moves as fast as the rest of the world does said one senator4 longstanding traditions customs and procedures exert powerful influence in both the house and senate and inhibit frequent changes in the way congress conducts its daytoday work however congress also recognizes that ready or not it must adopt certain new technologies both to enhance lawmakers performance and to remain relevant and effective branch of the national government the purposes of this report are several explore how new technologies are allowed in or introduced to the congress discuss the impact of information technology on the two principal centers of institutional powercommittees jurisdictional competition for example and parties communications strategies for instanceand provide number of summary observations about the internet and congressional governance

congress often approach the application of new technology to legislative processes with mix of caution skepticism and resistance as one lawmaker put it whatever the future holds we can be sure of one thing at first congress will always be very good at resisting it 5 this general attitude among many lawmakers is understandable change often brings in its wake both pluses and minuses and has the potential to change the distribution of influence within congress before lawmakers sign on to change th ey want to know who stands to win or lose power with the new technology are there electoral risks associated with its use what are its costs and benefits will members become too dependent on the technology how long will it be before the technology becomes obsolete what rules or customs are likely to change if the new technology is used by the congress is the new technology applicable to all the functions of congress what is the best way to integrate the technology into the legislative process the list of questions can go on and on the point is that just because new technologies are constantly developed and marketed does not mean they will find ready acceptance in the congress or even among the general public for example scholar pointed out that the video telephone was demonstrated at the 1964 worlds fair in new york city although home units of the video telephone became available in the 1990s there seemed to be little public interest in employing them why the camera would add an unwelcome burden to the technique of conversation you would need to look your best be careful about facial expressions youre being recorded and perhaps be forced to tidy up the visible background 6 look at the lengthy process of introducing electronic voting machines in the house

great loss of time attending roll calls for votes in congress edison conceived the idea for an electronic voting machine7 he explained that the places where lawmakers sat would be wired to central receiving instrument in front of each member of the house would be two buttons one for aye and one for by the side of the speakers desk was erected square frame in the upper part of which were two dials corresponding to the two classes of votes below the dials were spaces in which numbers appeared when the vote was called for each member pressed one or another of the buttons before him and the number of votes appeared automatically on the record all the speaker had to do was to glance at the dial and announce the result8 edison believed that his voting machine would win wide acceptance by state legislatures and the us congress he was wrong for example the massachusetts legislature rejected edisons machine on the ground that it would infringe on the minoritys right to delay action on legislation undeterred edison went to washington dc and demonstrated his apparatus to committee chairman whose panel was authorized to purchase such equipment the chairman told edison young man that is just what we do not want your invention would destroy the only hope that the minority would have of influencing legislation and as the ruling majority knows that at some day they may become minority they will be as much averse to change as their opponents 9 still there was some support in the house for edisons voting machine on july 6 1870 the chamber considered report from the committee on rules recommending that the house experiment with voting machine to expedite the counting of votes i believe machine like this which will facilitate the taking of the yeas and nays in this house declared representative samuel cox of new york is consonant with the spirit of our progressive country and our progressive age 10 another member representative thomas ferry of michigan stressed the large amount of time that would be saved by using the new voting apparatus during session of the 40th congress he said the roll was called three hundred and fortysix times consuming one hundred and fifteen hours which would be some twentythree days or calendar month11 these arguments were unsuccessful and the house tabled or killed the proposition by roll call vote of 86 to 82 one hundred years passed before the house authorized the use of electronic voting equipment for roll call votes or quorum calls the relevant part of section 121 of the legislative reorganization act of 1970 pl 91510 84 stat1140 stated upon any roll call or quorum call the names of such members voting or present may be recorded through the use of appropriate electronic equipment in the interim between edisons time and 1970 there were periodic calls from lawmakers and others to install electronic voting equipment in 1945 for instance two house 7 matthew josephson edison biography new york john wiley sons 1992 p

congress and recommended an automatic roll call device twenty years later about dozen lawmakers testified in favor of electronic voting in the house before another jo int reorganization committee then in the midst of large public concern about secrecy in congress especially the lack of recorded votes in the committee of the whole the prime amending forum in the house the 1970 lra made provision for recording the names of lawmakers either by tally clerks or an electronic device bipartisan coalition of lawmakers deserves large credit for generating public support for recording these votes they employed an antisecrecy strategy which gathered support from editorial writers and public interest groups across the country the electronic voting provision became effective on january 23 1973 periodically suggestions are made in the senate to permit electronic voting on january 6 1987 for example majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia introduced resolution sres 29 100 th congress to permit electronic voting on measures or matters subject to the joint approval of the democratic and republican leaders12 to date the senate has yet to emulate the house and install electronic voting one reason for the senates reluctance to modernize its voting system is that many senators prefer the drama associated with calling the roll on highly controversial issues where the outcome is in doubt furthermore during the period when the roll is called many senators welcome the opportunity to discuss legislative business with colleagues and to socialize with one another

that had been in american homes quarter century earlier like electronic voting legislative resistance to television was strong many lawmakers argued that if floor sessions were televised it would promote grandstanding distort floor proceedings encourage broadcasters to portray congress unfairly focusing on members reading newspapers rather than paying attention to the discussion for example and be too complicated and boring for the average viewer even as early as the 1920s however lawmakers began proposing radio coverage of the house and senate and later with the invention of television they introduced legislation authorizing radio and television coverage of chamber and committee proceedings television first occurred on the opening day of the 80 th congress 19471949 when tv coverage of the house was permitted for the firstand lasttime until the 1970s television was allowed in the chamber for the presidents state of the union message or for speeches by certain dignitaries but key party leaders opposed its wider use house and senate committees were sometimes televisedfor example the nationally televised hearings in the 1950s on the communist threat or the 1960s hearings on the vietnam warsubject to the rules of the pertinent panels for time in the 1950s speaker sam rayburn even banned televised committee hearings arguing that they were not authorized by house rules for example on february 25 1952 in response to an inquiry from gop leader joseph martin speaker rayburn said there being rule with reference to television or radio the chair interprets that the rules of the house shall apply to the committees whether they sit in washington or outside of washington not until enactment of the legislative reorganization act of 1970 did the house and senate formally authorize the televising of committee hearings subject to committees broadcasting rules 12 congressional record vol 133 january 6 1987 p s92

in the house continued into the 1970s time of heightened public interest in sunshine in government and legislative executive clashes over the vietnam war according to donald wolfensberger who served as top staff aide to the house rules committees 19751976 ad hoc subcommittee on broadcasting what gave impetus to televising house floor debates was the recognition by the democratic leadership in early 1970 that president richard nixon was dominating the airwaves with defenses of his vietnam war policies while congressional opponents were not being given equal access by the networks 13 finally after several closedcircuit tests were authorized by the speaker the house on march 19 1979 went public for the first time with live floor coverage carried over the cable satellite public affairs network cspan whose founder brian lamb was instrumental in transforming the house floor into the electronic gallery if the house was slow to permit gaveltogavel br oadcast coverage of its floor proceedings the senate was even slower on may 2 1924 the senate did agree to resolution sponsored by senator robert howell whose background was in radio to consider the radio broadcasting of the chambers floor proceedings many senators opposed howells proposal including majority leader henry cabot lodge who stated i do not at all know whether or not the senate desires to have everything which is said here broadcasted14 nothing ever came of howells broadcast idea until july 29 1986 when the senate after sixweek trial period voted 78 to 21 to permit live gaveltogavel radio and television coverage of its floor proceedings over cspan ii 15 institutional pride competition and selfimage were among the prime factors that contributed to the senate vote in favor of televised coverage16 senators who were accustomed to receiving much more publicity than rankandfile house members were concerned about the heightened public visibility accorded the house and its lawmakers telling argument for television coverage heard over and over again in the senate was made by majority leader howard baker my point is that the house of representatives will become the dominant congressional branch of government of the united states simply because the public has access to their proceedings if we do not provide similar access here 17 senate democratic leader byrd added many people think congress is

opposed perhaps feared computers for congress stated in my opinion it will be sorry day for the country when congressmen have been replaced by computers 20 nonetheless there were lawmakers during this period who recognized the importance and value of technology for congressional use they proposed legislation to encourage use of automatic data processing systems to better manage store and retrieve information making congress less dependent on the executive branch or special interests for data and analysis21 several house and senate committees and other legislative entities also examined 1 where to apply computer technology member offices committees administrative units and so on for 2 what purposes payroll preparation inventory control mail preparation etc and 3 how it could best be used to assist lawmakers in making informed judgments on myriad of complex issues22 for instance proposal by committee reform panel won senate adoption on february 4 1977 of resolution requiring establishment of computerized scheduling system for all senate committees still by 1993 report of the joint committee on the organization of congress noted congress is an institution that has not kept pace with the developments in technology widely used in society the house and senate spend more than 150 million per year on information and technology resources yet critical information is often not readily available to the members there is little coordination between the entities that provide technological support to the congress members require modern technological support to deal with the scope and variety of information on huge span of issues it is not being provided 23 technological development on capitol hill accelerated in the mid1990s because of the determined effort of many lawmakers to

individual lawmakers and individual citizens to acquire an expanded range of legislative information in timely and costeffective manner an advocate of greater openness and transparency in congressional deliberations gingrich wanted legislative information available to any citizen in the country at the same moment that it is available to the highest paid washington lobbyists24 soon after he became speaker in 1995 gingrich inaugurated publicly available computer system called thomas after thomas jeffer in the library of congress thomas httpthomaslocgov is an online legislative information resource that provides information bill summaries and status updates committee reports the congressional record etc previously accessible only to capitol hill staff and washington lobbyists this internetaccessed system was watershed event for it made the legislative process more transparent and promoted the availability of materials about the congress not everything of legislative significance is available on thomas such as the chairs mark the draft legislative text to be considered during the committee amendment or markup stage but thom as provides large amount of current and unfiltered information about congress to the general public in 1995 speaker gingrich directed computer and information services working group to upgrade and revamp the houses information system two years later the speaker supported adoption of new house rule each committee shall make its publications available in electronic form to the maximum extent feasible previously committee publications were available only in printed form two years later the library of congress and the congressional research service at the instruction of the senate committees on appropriations and rules and administration brought online legislative information retrieval system the lis that is available only within the legislative branch 25 in 2007 speaker nancy pelosi urged all house committees to utilize technology to provide live broadcasts of their hearings online webcasts so as to make the legislative process fully accessible and transparent to the public26 number of outside entities such as the sunlight foundation http wwwsunlightfoundationcom strive to promote more transparency of and accessibility to the legislative branch by the citizenry27 to summarize number of significant forces and factors commonly combine to trigger technological change on capitol hill first new innovations arrive in the house or senate because key committees and determined lawmakers champion their value second external challenges from the white house or other places require the house and senate to embrace technology as way to modernize and strengthen their competency and effectiveness third lawmakers recognize the competitive advantage of technology it enables members to better manage their workload serve their constituents and communicate policy and political views to wide audience fourth

by the house and senate seventh election results produce an influx of new members who having grown up using variety of electronic devices advocate and support technological innovation in the legislative branch lastly there has been rapid increase in the number of constituents knowledgeable in use of new technologies such as the internet who are prepared to demand from congress better and

today every lawmaker is an electronic legislator to one degree or another because the major functions of congressrepresentation lawmaking and oversightare all affected by technology members representational role has probably been affected the most by the array of new information technologies constituents may use email to communicate their opinions aroundtheclock to lawmakers 29 in turn many members embrace the same technology to respond to voters inquiries lawmakers can use filtering techniques to distinguish email messages sent by individuals from outside their district or state and choose not to respond to them as one legislator said most members are not interested in the views of those who dont vote for them or have the potential to vote for th em so when an office is inundated with email messages it is sometimes easier not to respond 30 lawmakers also use the internet for ecampaigning purposesraising money enlisting volunteers or communicating political messages from candidates point of view noted one account the great advantage of the internet is that you can send lot of information to lot of people at minimal cost the downside is so can your opponents and anyone else with keyboard or camera phone 31 more lawmakers too are starting their own blogs blogshort for web logis generally discussion of issues and even ts by an individual or group of contributors blogging lets bypass the conventional press and media and take my message directly to many voters said one lawmaker another member noted i think this whole medium has proven to be something not just for people who sit at computer but who want to get involved in the political process 32 the internet in brief expands the concept of representation beyond distinct geographical area to include people who share similar interests and policy preferences regardless of their location on the planet equally significant the internet has the potential to foster an interactive or twoway process of communication between members and their constituents as well as with other individuals and organizations clearly the next phase in memberconstituent communications that were moving to is an interactive phase and blogs or bloglike elements are part of that phase stated the deputy director of the congressional management foundation nonpartisan washington 28 dennis w johnson congress online

about how to become little bit more interactive33 worth mention is that several lawmakers have created virtual town hall on their website and answer questions ask george for example put to them by constituents one lawmaker and his aides have consulted large number of bloggers policy experts public interest groups and citizens on various internet issues the member said he will use the information he collects to draft bill which he will then post online to gather more feedback before officially introducing the bill in the fall 34 information technology affects the congressional process in numerous other ways from the ready supply of data and analysis for policy formulation to the rise of elobbying to concerns that some form of electronic direct democracy might shortcircuit our representative system of government 35 today both the house and senate prohibit members from using electronic devices on the floor for concern that they would disrupt the deliberative process as house member stated there is sanctity to the floor of congress there are constituents there lobbyists interests other than your colleagues36 another lawmaker viewed this matter differently its ridiculous that we cant have laptops on the floor he said we could use laptops to get upto theminute information while giving speech or receive message from staffer about something we should mention in the speech it would make things run that much more efficiently 37 there are occasions when lawmakers read into the congressional record information from their blackberry that has been emailed to them by their staff as for congresss oversight role computerbased technologies are increasingly being employed by committees to monitor executive branch performance and to receive relevant information from administrative entities few examples illustrate the point the house and senate appropriations committees rely upon information technology to track the fiscal expenditures of executive agencies and programs and evaluate their performance and costeffectiveness march 2006 study of the federal aviation administration faa by the government accountability office highlighted the userfriendly for congress page on its website the site provides single point of access for information and analysis relevant to congressional oversight of the faa two senators established website to collect ideas from

accountability to the governments funding decisions doubt many citizen auditors would make their evaluations of federal expenditures known to congressional lawmakers and comm ittees relatedly senator has declaimed that congress needs to enlist the publics help in monitoring the performance of executive agencies40 to do this the senator recommends placing on the website of executive entities the home page of the inspectors general igs so ig reports can be easily accessed by interested individuals igs conduct investigations and audits of the agencies in which they are located to improve

committees as noted earlier make many of their reports and documents available on their home pages the house education committee became the first panel ever to create spanishlanguage website so spanishspeakers could obtain president george w bushs child left behind legislation in their native language 41 house and senate committee may organize interactive hearings with witnesses located outside of washington dc and allow viewers to email their questions to committee members42 the house and senate have procedures to utilize cyberspace to promote earmark funding for projects targeted to specific locales transparency for example section 511 of s 1 the honest lead ership and open government act of 2007 requires that before conference reports are voted upon they must be available to members and the general public on publicly available website for 48 hours committee staff aides share information and analysis over the internet to be sure outside groups use the internet to quickly mobilize support or opposition to legislation nominations or other matters being considered by committee they may also strive to win committee assignments for lawmakers who support the groups issues committee jurisdictions loom large with respect to the internet because they are central to congressional policymaking which committee has jurisdiction over bill determines how when and by whom the legislation is considered and whether legislation will make it to the floor turf conscious chairs seek to expand or protect their policy domains especially when new issues or technologies appear on congresss agenda as colleague said of one committee chairman he thought that every bill that began with hr began in his committee 43 committee leaders may seek to exploit ambiguous committee

the house energy and judiciary panels had new chairmen because of the sixyear term limit rule adopted by the house in 1995 the energy and judiciary chairmen both were known as strong defenders of their panels jurisdictional mandate the energy chairman teamed with his ranking minority member to introduce bill hr 1542 with over 100 cosponsors to amend the landm ark telecommunications act of 1996 hr 1542 would permit the regional telephone companies such as verizon to provide highspeed or broadband internet service over their telephone lines without opening their local telephone markets to competitive rivals cable television companies or satellite companies for example as required by the 1996 act 44 spokesman for the energy panel emphasized that our committee has sole jurisdiction over telecom policy45 the judiciary chairman concerned about the bills antitrust implications launched public lobbying campaign to win referral of the legislation he sent highly detailed 11page letter to the speakerand to the mediamaking the case for why judiciary should receive sequential referral of the bill the judiciary chair also pressed his case with the house parliamentarian46 house rules state that the speaker refers all measures but in practice the referral function is performed on his or her behalf by the parliamentarian the senate parliamentarian also refers legislation on behalf of the presiding officer the judiciary chairs letter to the speaker which he posted on the panels website detailed the reasons why his committee wanted the telecommunications bill referred to his panel for example he highlighted the long history of he arings since the 1950s conducted by the judiciary committee on antitrust and the communications industry he spotlighted the legislation referred 44 see

energy committee that dealt with the topic he cited reports accompanying telecommuni cations legislation prepared by the judiciary committee he also made explicit reference to house rules which he argued justified the sequential referral of the energy measure to his panel rule x1k5 of the rules of the house of representatives provides the committee on the judiciary has jurisdiction over the prot ection of trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies in addition rule xlk2 of the rules of the house provides that the committee on judiciary has jurisdiction over administrative practice and procedure fundamentally hr 1542 addresses monopoly issue it takes its place at the end of long line of legislative efforts that confront the monopoly power of incumbent local exchange carriers in the telephone industry for decades such efforts have come under the jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary 47 democratic member of the judiciary committee strongly supported his chairs determination to protect the panels jurisdiction he said i want to express my appreciation and fervent desire to cooperate with the chairman in vigorous defense of the jurisdiction of this committee against any imperialist assaults by other committees 48 in midmay 2001 the speaker granted 30day sequential referral of hr 1542 to judiciary but limited its review of the bill to provisions dealin g with the department of justice on june 13 2001 the judiciary committee reported the broadband legislation unfavorably and with an amendment tearing out the heart of the energyreported measure49 in order to avoid nasty parliamentary fight on the floor between the two chairmen the speaker asked the energy chair to negotiate differences with opponents of his bill or he would not schedule the legislation for floor consideration50 the speaker did schedule hr 1542 for floor consideration which the house adopted on june 27 2002 the senate took action on the legislation committees may also draft memoranda of understanding to deal with internet issues that overlap their responsibilities these memoranda which have some precedential value are usually printed in the congressional record kept on file in the parliamentarians office and may influence the reference of legislation implicated by these intercommittee agreements for instance when the house reconfigured its committee system at the start of the 107th congress two committees new financial services committee and the energy panel claimed authority for the electronic communications networks that automatically match buy and sell orders for stock transactions51 in order to end the turf battle the speaker brokered an agreement between the two panels which was entered in the congressional record

technological as it is political or procedural congressional leaders understand the importance of these components in framing issues molding public opinion and generating grassroots support to achieve policy initiatives on capitol hill the shrewd use of words and communications strategiescalling the estate tax the death tax for exampleis part of the competing stagecraft parties employ to target their message advance their agenda attract popular support and sway public opinion words frame peoples understanding of issues language does our thinking for us remarked professor kathleen jamieson and so the person who places vocabulary in the head of the audience controls the thought process 53 added house democratic leader about the importance of communication appeals to the public we can do all we can with our inside maneuvering but without the outside mobilization well never achieve what is possible 54 technology and policy stagecraft are often interconnected elements of each partys legislative strategy as highlighted by these three examples first in 1997 legislation was introduced in the gopcontrolled congress targeting the internal revenue service irs for change because of its overly aggressive approach to tax enforcement house republicans also sponsored public website during halloween to solicit horror stories from taxpayers whose dealings with the irs were unpleasant and negative the website was titled irs horror stories this halloween the republican congress is unmasking the irs for what it really is bureaucratic monster stalking the american taxpayer declared gop leader our web page is silver bullet for taxpayers fighting this governmental beast 55 the house republican initiative combined with well publicized hearings on the irs by the senate finance committee led to enactment of the internal revenue restructuring and reform act of 1998 second president george w bush announced in may 2001 comprehensive initiative to promote domestic energy production through more drilling for oil and gas tax incentives to encourage energy production and conservation and funds for nuclear energy research and clean coal technology democrats attacked bushs pl an for emphasizing energy production over energy conservation and environmental protection for instance democrats set up war room in the capitol to coordinate radio and television interviews and opened website httpwwwgrandoldpetroleumcom to bolster public opposition to bushs plan republican leaders responded by creating their own website httpwwwbushenergycom to encourage supporters to telephone radio shows with the message that bush is doing everything he canas soon as he canto help americans who are feeling the energy crunch at the gas pump and in their utility bills 56 both parties made available briefing materials online to party members which they could download and use in their states or districts either to attack or promote the bush energy plan as the case might be57 this

leaned toward market based approach to health care reform particularly divisive issue involved the democratic proposal granting patients the right to sue hmos for malpractice republicans argued that the proposal would raise the costs of health care and serve the interests of trial lawyers group commonly viewed as democratic supporter democrats responded that republicans favored the insurance companies over patients given sharp party differences over this issue the stage was set for public relations battle between the two sides when democrats took over the senate in june 2001 following senator james jeffordss switch of party affiliation from republican to independent majority leader tom daschle successfully made chamber enactment of patients bill of rights his top priority as part of the strategy to widely broadcast the democratic health care message senator daschle created an intensive care unit icu in leadership conference room equipped for live broadcasts over television radio and the internet 58 democratic senators went online to discuss hmo reform rebut opponents charges and advertise the democratic plan not to be outdone senate republicans established their own communications unit in the capitol dubbed the delivery roomafter their stated goal of delivering an hmo bill that president bush would sign into law the gops room was also equipped with various technological devices from computers for interactive chats to cameras and microphones for senators to use for interviews59 this legislation was not signed into law plainly the internets capacity for rapid informati on retrieval and instant response means that it is technology that cannot be ignored by either party in showcasing signature issues mobilizing internal and external support and winning policy and political objectives g22g145g142g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g142g157g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g497g561g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561g24g146g142g160g156g561 the internets impact on the legislative branch is extensive because it influences nearly everything that congress does from policymaking to representation to member office operations odds favor even more extensive use of the internet as new generation of technologically sophisticated lawmakers enter the house and senate today the use of various technologies is second nature to many young congressional staff aides they are in the vanguard of using and exploring the internet in part because it permits them to get smart quickly on issues their members are interested in as well as target and mobilize activists on behalf of those topics an interesting question is the extent to which it is technology or internetsavvy people who are changing the work routines of capitol hill needless to say it is increasingly important in the house and senate to combine legislative skills with technological expertise several other technological implications also merit mention they include transparency constituent communications information accessoverload deliberation and decisionmaking and additional considerations as discussed below g22g155g138g151g156g153g138g155g142g151g140g162g561 new

websites enable citizens to access reliable information and electronic documents about congress these sites whether public the library of congress or the government printing office for example or commercial congressional quarterly inc for instance prov ide an abundance of trustworthy materials about the congress to interested individuals internet access not only provides opportunities for citizens to be better informed about congress it also st rengthens their ability to hold elected officials responsible and accountable for their actions and decisions as more information becomes available online about congress there is also more demand that additional materials be distributed electronically to the public for example various groups have urged congress to post online searchable voting records of lawmakers or certain reports of the congressional research service there may of course be many arguments raised in favor of withholding specific materials at certain times for example after selected house and senate members negotiate for days or weeks to hammer out fragile compromise which they must then sell to colleagues there may be an understandable reluctance to disseminate the product to the general public before it has been reviewed by the majority and minority leaders of congress and the white house

members can quickly keep constituents updated and informed about their activities as one senator explained our office uses digital camerawhich allows photographs to be downloaded printed and disseminated almost instantly on recent trip to bosnia for instance i took pictures of our troops from tennessee downloaded them into my laptop emailed them to local newspapers in tennessee as well as to my washington office where they were posted on the web for all to see the whole process took only few minutes 61 cybersavvy legislators interact regularly in chat rooms with constituents in their districts or states constituents in turn are able to quickly send emails to their members the ease of sending emails to lawmakers has sometimes produced email overload in congress with members staff sometimes unable to be responsive to the increasing volume of emails flooding their offices 62 advocacy groups too are able to trigger constituent emails at internet speed when president bush nominated john ashcroft to be attorney general pro and antiashcroft websites sprung up within hours of the nomination and helped generate hundreds of thousands of messages to lawmakers63 today cyberlobbying through the internet is an important form of grassroots activism 60 one reason the internet has been embraced is because sending mass emails does not spend lawmakers franking allowance

distributed worldwide that much of it can be characterized as negative information neither legislators nor staff aides have the time to sift through the enormous amounts of available data to determine the useful from the useless as former senate majority leader george mitchell said what we do not lack is the means by which to learn about issu there is shortage of information there is shortage of time64 the internets prime virtue is the speed with which it can make unmediated information and data available to policymakers what is often lacking on capitol hill is the time and human resources to make sense of it all and to find the policyshaping nuggets in the information deluge significantly lawmakers also need an array of legitimate information sometimes not easily found on the internet and which is more difficult to obtain or create such as the combination of political rewards or sanctions that might encourage wavering colleagues to vote certain way or credible defense and intelligencerelated analyses relevant to the use of military power lawmakers and congressional staff are mindful that information quantity does not mean information quality several pertinent questions they may consider per downloaded reports or studies might include who produced the information why is it accurate credible and legitimate what is the reputation of the sources does the content of the material reflect an ideological bent like any means of communication the internet can convey good and bad right or wrong information members too are mindful of representational fairness not all constituents have or can use the internet further is one form of communication more valued than anothera handwritten letter or an email

on any given day lawmakers might be required to vote on measures involving defense higher education abortion taxes or public works to be sure the internet can help members make informed decisions as one house member stated you know were in the information age and were making decisions in so many different areas that its huge help i mean from policy standpoint computer technology is very productive for and its very productive way to learn 65 on the other hand numerous factors shape how legislators make choices not just information constitutencybased partybased or ideologicallybased decisions are often more important than informationbased judgments in politics an old saying goes facts are negotiable members frequently want objective analyses that support their policy predispositions masses of reliable and timely data may be of limited value to legislators making political determinations paraxodically although information and ideas can move with the speed of light lawmaking usually requires time for reflection and reasoned deliberation these qualities are often necessary to forge the consensus generally required to pass legislation the legislative process is replete with political and procedural speed bumps that inhibit overly hasty action house leader in 64 congressional record vol 135 october 20 1989 p s13811 65 george archibald technology lets

the art of persuasion when youre persuading theres nothing more important than facetoface contact66 virtual collegiality through emails laptops or videoconferences is substitute for the hard work of building personal and political relationships between or among lawmakers if i cannot eyeball you i cannot see you i cannot see your body language i cant really listen to you declared one lawmaker67 or as top senate party leader said the senate leadership role is about personal relationships68 g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the internet has transformed much of the work of the legislative branch by integrating technology into the daytoday activities of the institution it has enhanced ability of lawmakers in washington to communicate with their constituentsthe aforementioned virtual town hall meetings for example or party colleagues will electronically share good responses to tough or critical constituent letters the internets influe nce on the campaign trail is wellestablished think fundraising and webbased video or youtubecom it has also augmented congresss ability to better oversee the executive branch by fostering greater administrative transparency and serving as vital research tool for committees lawmakers and staff significantly the internet has given rise to type of direct democracy expanding the influence of growing community of online activistspolitically attentive cybercitizens andor bloggers the result lawmakers and the two congressional parties longer exercise the degree of control or influence over legislative elections or policymaking that they once did for example members who block legislation or stymie action on amendments might be encouraged to change course by nationwide coalition of bloggers able to generate countervailing public sentiment in ways big and small wrote news editor bloggers are changing how business is done on capitol hill 69 rapid advances in communications technology such as the internet and new uses for old mediums talk radio and cspan for example have promoted both more open government and larger opportunities for citizens to shape the nations laws and policies there are pluses and minuses in having the governed influence more directly the work of the governors as professor robert dahl the yale political scientist stated the increase in direct communication between citizens and political leaders is not in my view inherently unhealthy or undesirable on the contrary it could mark an important stage in the development of political system that provides citizens with greater range of opportunities for participating effectively in important decisions that bear heavily on their lives which is presumably one of the major justifications for democracy but unless the citizens who influence government because of their special opportunities for direct communication are also able to understand how policy proposals bear on their own interests and are reasonably representative of all citizens the result of more direct communication will 66 kelly capitol hill at crossroads on info highway p 24a 67 tom price creating

facade on process manipulated by political leaders to achieve their own agendas70 the founding fathers deliberately created representative government and not direct democracy as james madison wrote in federalist 10 representative government enlarges and refines public views by passing them through the medium of chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country or as former speaker gingrich told one of his college classes direct democracy says okay how do we feel this week we all raise our hand lets rush off and do it the concept of republican representation is you elect somebody who you send to central place they by definition learn things you dont learn because you dont want toyou want to be able to live your life they are supposed to use their judgment to represent you the founders feared the passion of the moment71 yogi berra the wellknown former yankee baseball player is purported to have said prediction is very hard especially when its about the future nonetheless as the nations populace continues to become more and better educated and as new communications technologies pervade society it is likely that the american constitutional system will
