6206c26 shspec165 prepchecking prepchecking is based on fundamental of dianetics which is that related incidents form chains on the time track the time track is consecutive occurrences in time recorded in pictures which classify themselves in chains picture persists because of the violation of purpose involved in the incidents where the pc intended one thing and got something else alteris is violation of purpose eg going out to hang someone and being hung or going out to kill the mayor and electing him pictures are held in place by this violation of purpose when you run out the basic purpose intention the pictures will fold up cf expanded dianetics the pictures hang up in the mind classified in chains each of which has basic and basicbasic the basicbasic is the first time on the track you did or experienced or decided that kind of thing but you can have basic on each chain in each lifetime there is basic picture on chain there is basic purpose on chain which the chain violates and that is what hangs the up you need that data for 3ga but nor for prepchecking all you need to know to prepcheck is that there is time track with classified chairs on it the chain will free when you find the basic on it it doesnt have to be basicbasic recent thislifetime experience is all you need if you go back to basic purposes you will get into 3ga before you are ready the basic is generally in childhood this life occasionally it is in prenatals or even past life charge can remain on the chain when the basic is longer unknown this is why the what question will be null if you have gotten all the way back zero questions will come live as his responsibility rises prepchecking consists of locating chains of sufficient charge to aberrate the conduct of the individual then it provides system that knocks out the basic on the chain the withhold system see pp 186 and 237 above the charge is there in pt because of the pcs misassociation of the past with pt this is misidentification all this is in dmsmh so is 3ga as the basic purpose of the individual dmsmh p 238 and science of survival book ii p303 even at the age of two or three years an individual seems to know what his basic purpose is in life later this becomes corrupted by individual and social aberrations but is recovered in dianetic processing possibly past lives have something to do with forming basic purpose originally we ran the withhold system on the incident closest to pt after finding reading zero question the zero questions are found in sec cheeks of which there are many if you get two reads on zero question you had better prepcheck it there is danger in being too fundamental in doing prepchecks for instance if you got zero question by doing dynamic assessment you may run into the gpm which you dont want when you get an incident that is an answer to the zero question and the read is still there after the pc tells you about it you formulate what question by dibbling and dabbling around until you find one that reads the same as the zero question this is the weakest part of the prepcheck system when the what question has been found it is now time to let the pc get it all off using encouraging halfacks until he runs down then send him earlier you know the earliest is something he cant just spot easily so you dont ask for that you ask for earlier until he is as early as he can go without much assistance or using the meter the pc uses earliest the auditor uses earlier the earliest incident the pc can recall is the barrier to earlier memory there is always barrier incident here is where the auditor starts using the withhold system when he has done it couple of times he has blasted the track open more so he can find an earlier incident then you use the withhold system on that one to get out all the unknowns then test the what question on the meter if it still reads go earlier again keep using the withhold system to open up track finally the what question will be flat so you get middle rudiments in then recheck the what question the crimes one is looking for need not be sordid or highly reprehensible ones though people who have been psychoanalyzed often try to come up with spectacular believing that that is what is needed to clear it if your pc does this be sure to add the end rudiments question about halftruths etc to your middle ruds auditors are prone to the virgin complex the auditor wishes to think that he is the first one the pc has told things to so he may go for the really sordid stuff that he pc wouldnt have told anybody else if you go at this without prepared list like sec check the pc will surely give you the least aberrated chain which is the most known to them if cleaned up this chain will produce the least case change the pc will give you this chain because it is safe one pcs like security this is why lists of arbitrary questions are more productive of case gain than more general prepchecking you can also use the rudiments as zero questions along with finding goals or auditing or whatever he does lot eg his job as long as he doesnt tell you that that is what is wrong with him if it is as advertised it aint the balance and the delicacy of auditing is getting the pc to talk to you about things that he doesnt know he should talk to you about and preventing him from rambling on about things that wont advance the session without letting him see how he is being steered naturally he will tend to bounce off things that are aberrative they are there because he hasnt asised them which he has avoided doing because he doesnt want to confront them you have to let him discover that he is confronting something auditing in this manner will make you look clever to the pc as if you knew just where he was heading you do because you are traveling on series of fundamentals you are only trying to pull up basic on chain of incidents than were wrong conduct on pcs part he knows they are wrong conduct so he has them buried you dont want to make him guilty you only want to clean up the chain every now and then you will hit something that is real pay dirt for instance when the pc has occluded the top of chain the rest of the chain will be really hot it is symptomatic of charged chain that the incidents are out of sequence all mixed up as the pc straightens it out the time factor unscrambles as you go earlier you find that the incident he thought was earlier is really later these incidents are mainly locks they are all overts clearing person with prepchecking is not possible however hundred hours of it would go long way if you go on prepchecking forever you will get more bank appearing because you are not on the pcs goal line prepchecking will make for more sanity than any psychoanalytic system ever developed the earliest version of this was straightwire and spotting someone who had an aberration or difficulty similar to the pcs that was fabulous when it worked which wasnt always
