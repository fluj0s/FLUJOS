expectancy of 3d lecture given on 7 december 1961 is there heater on there all right how are you today audience fine still getting in practice for the washington congress now what whats the date seventh audience seventh its the seventh all right and i think you just had sheet handed out here well now youve had an experimental sheet handed to you there have never been any runs on this sheet it is simply handed to you as trick pattern of command structure it has to be tested maybe one or two of you will be run on it but theres nothing very deadly about it but let point out to you here that you have an opportunity to clear with the pc problem situation difficulty confusion mest trouble whatever it is and what he considers the solution is solve made okay cured finished ended thatsthated or whatever he considers the thing is you see and then youve got thirty command which is fifteen bracket thirty commands with fifteen brackets which is pretty good because it covers just about everything and so on now youll find that some pcs will hang up little bit if you dont have others in the run and so forth this is very comprehensive coverage of this particular thing and i would say offhand that if you could run it with confusion it probably would run faster than with problem on quite few people but this gives you an opportunity to clear it all up this is let point out to you this is change there isnt any change here this just gives you this is all possible elements that you could run on 3d commands with all all effective brackets theres even you and you in there theres bracket in there tell problem you have had with you thats for those people amongst us who have valences all right well thats just its just tricky command sheet i handed it out to you more or less for your curiosity more than anything else and yet we will run it and probably do something with it but possibly itll be refined before it is generally issued i thought you might like to be on the upper end of the assembly line for moment okay audience thank you well ive practiced enough for the washington congress so ill sit down this is 7 dec still nautical month and we have the saint hill special briefing course and we have some people who that look wonderful and some people who look horrible im going to make to you just few random comments today i havent really very much to talk to you about youre all doing perfectly theres possible improvement that could be made either on your cases or your auditing you will recognize that except in few instances few instances your auditing could be improved and in few instances your cases could be improved you see but on the whole youre all perfect except you all right youre not getting sitting in the way down in the bull pit you might say with pc youre not getting broad view of the working of 3d and i might tell you something about this youre getting onepc view of it and your coffeeshop comments and thats thats little different so what are the expectancies of the thing and id better give you some idea of the expectancies of what would happen with pc on 3d and ill just take one through from start okay all right these are broad expectancies and these expectancies have been routinely borne out when these are not borne out there is its nothing its the assessment is wrong or something is goofy when you dont run into the phenomena which im going to list to you here why something is wrong all right this person staggers in see and hits both sides of the door and sits down to get audited and we put him on the emeter and we say well what were what did you have to eat for breakfast and he says what breakfast and you say this morning he says what what this morning that sort of thing well he is not in position to be audited with an assessment on 3d you wouldnt assess that person you ask this person various questions about life in general and the person seems to have tremendous amount of worry in present time ive already told you that present time an elephant stepping on your toe here and now even your little toe is far more important to you than an elephant who squashed your whole body few million years ago you you recognize this see peanut which you are not able to procure right now is far more important than an empire which you failed to secure several trillenia ago let point this out to you the havingness the further it goes back on the track why the more unlikely it seems and the importances of case must be concentrated to some degree at least over this lifetime and cant be concentrated in the last three minutes of life now if you find case that the rudiments are very hard to keep in on youre finding person whose life is constant problem unless you can do something for this it isnt likely you will ever get his attention off this constant immediacy onto what might have caused the immediacy hes not so much interested in what caused him to go broke hes interested in the fact that he hasnt got sou well that he hasnt got sou is whats worrying him and that the causes of his decline and going broke are the least possible interest to him the fact of the matter is hes broke and this is all he can concentrate on you see there he sits mental bankrupt and he hasnt any any margin on which to operate at all in other words his mind cannot play even easily over this lifetime you see he sits there and he says well when i go home this is going to happen and when i come back this is going to happen and then then ill go and so on i wonder what im going to do andandyou know its terrible and isnt life horrible right here and now well you try to get him split instant off of now and of course he has to at least have the idea of going then somewhat before you can get an assessment even though the assessment is in right here and now you understand that he he doesnt however appreciate that the assessment is in here and now he would much more easily have you take the elephant off of his little toe than to remove the empire off of his back you see because hes not very aware of this empire thats off on his back but he sure is aware of that elephant thats stepping on his toe you see hes very aware of that so this person is not in an assessable state because his concentration is well on the auditor is this fellow going to do in isnt he going to do in i dont know i was audited by somebody out in california one time and thats enough for anybody uh god isnt that terrible and is he going to fix up or isnt he or or is he really or is he just in it for the money or is there anything to scientology we dont know there is anything and uhyuhrruhrrr automaticity automaticity automaticity automaticity and hes saying well i dont know whether ill go home or not or whether ive got any money and car fare or whether i should take the bus or whether i should take the car i wonder if i should buy car and uh nahnahna and so on should i eat breakfast should i have steak for dinner or shouldnt i its very expensive i shouldnt have steak for dinner because i might have better have beans for dinner uh so forth i wonder what theyll think if i do have beans for dinner i wonder what bean and that thats just somebody with the rudiments out see well the process of getting rudiments in can be begun at that point and if you regard it more than just getting the rudiments in youll see what were talking about because it may take seventyfive hours to get the rudiments in all right from that point of natter natter present time elephant on my toe dont know what im going to do from that point for the next seventyfive hours he gradually gets back to point where he can look at this lifetime where he can sit in the auditing room where he can look at the auditor and keep his mouth shut while youre reading list to him now in other words youre youre into condition here where the individual can be fairly relaxed in session and therefore you can get the information that you want for an assessment so that is the usual condition of person as he moves into the perimeter of auditing in other words he doesnt know and its this way and then gradually over period of time particularly if you are doing something very effective like sec checking problems intensive racking around one way or the other curing up his bad memory anything you can think of that makes him easier gets the rudiments in gets some of his overts off gets him into communication with the auditor during that whole period of time you should be getting more and more responsive meter now if you read it always that the meter action should be loosening up you are going to make mistake because meter action can get get looser and tighter and so forth somewhat disassociated from the response of the pcs mind on the meter theres difference there the pc comes in feeling very relaxed and physically and feels very relaxed physically and actually does get fairly decent dial drop see feels pretty good well actually it doesnt really not follow and it doesnt really follow that his mental response to your questions is better it doesnt immediately follow the response of the meter to the question is not necessarily independent of this other but it is itself it is itself how much is the person reacting now ill lets give you an idea i might just have been auditing this person and i straightened them up and they feel fairly comfortable and theyve got dial drop on the can squeeze you see and the following morning an hpa student from central organization fumbles with the meter and asks him few questions and so on hell get dial drop he wont get any response you get the difference here hell hell still get the dial drop but he says this is different than what happened to yesterday and hes of course got present time problem he he says i dont know and i im not sure and what is this all about and hes thinking about this and the meter response to the auditor is the factor there which doesnt necessarily coordinate with the drop of the can squeeze do you follow that in other words your meter might be responding if somebody were making it respond or if the pc accepted who was making it respond now your job in the first seventyfive hours is getting the pc to accept the meter responding see he he accepts your communication he feels that its better its its all right to be audited by you now this is hard bridge for an auditor to cover during that particular period and its something that you should put your mind to this this is something that you should know as as an auditor yes you can goof up yes you can make mistakes but your auditing even the worst auditor in this unit at the present moment perhaps with one or two exceptions is better than most of the auditors in practically all the auditors in 1954 see theres theres heres difference of auditing here we cant go out on the basis entirely that it is quality of auditing let us assume that the auditor does halfway interested technically correct job on the pc all right now lets just take auditor who is doing halfway interested technically correct more or less job on the pc you see hes not doing perfect job hes not doing an imperfect job all right we have him in rotation audit fifteen pcs taken from different strata this is the same auditor and then without allowing those pcs without allowing auditor to do any advertising without allowing him to tell them how he is good auditor or any propagandizing at all we take these pcs and without permitting them to talk together we get each ones opinion of this auditor were going to get fifteen different qualities going to get fifteen different opinions of the same auditor and if these people are unaudited people by and large youre going to get fifteen bank expressions to something that had nothing to do with the auditor auditor was wearing yellow dress all right very good pc number one likes yellow so its good auditor pc number two doesnt like yellow so it must be bad auditor and itll be something as oddball as that during the first seventyfive hours you should actually not take to heart any opinion the pc has of your auditing you should not take it to heart at all because it has nothing to do with observation nothing to do with it at all its just his various reactivities reacting and ive noticed you as auditors worrying far too much about what the pc thought of you in the early stages of your auditing of the pc well the reason youre worried about it is because your rudiments arent in well your rudiments wouldnt be in it wouldnt matter what you did or if you had changed the color of your hair and wore funny nose youd have the same opinion exactly on the part of the pc of your auditing and if the pc well let give you better example did any of you ever have your parents get acquainted with you you see well this had very little to do with you but had great deal to do with your parents ability to observe they didnt observe very deeply and so they didnt know you very well thats about the way that adds up the pcs ability to observe during that first seventyfive hours of getting straightened up is negligible his powers of obnosis stink he could go down the street and you ask him im not talking now about strange offcolor neurotic personality i am talking about homo sap average issue school tie and the lot see and we have him walk down street one block and then ask him at the end of the block what have we just seen and you would be amazed you have either seen nothing or you have seen something else or the people you have passed have been entirely different people his obnosis the power of observing the obvious the ability to observe the obvious it just is not present so you actually should not feel bad or be influenced by this preclears opinion of you at all up until the time youve got 3d levels about threequarters of the way run because you see he cant observe this this is something you should keep in mind its quite important because ive seen pc who was sort of bad off curse and swear at one of the finest smoothest auditing jobs ive ever seen and ive seen pc who was apparently in fairly good condition and so forth totally satisfied with one of the lousiest auditing jobs i was ever punished to witness theres just the pc had nothing to do with this so what you do you see is you be satisfied with yourself you see am i turning in representative auditing job is my interest in the case adequate and is my technical accuracy as i work with this case is that adequate am i turning in representative auditing job is my technical skill there and thats it now if you have that confidence youll never get rocked otherwise you will continue to get rocked always because your job could be utterly perfect and you would still get your eyes clawed out by some pcs and your job could be horrible and you would still be kissed on both cheeks by other pcs you see oh my auditors wonderful auditor she gives such good advice between the auditing commands could get pretty wild couldnt it so its actually up to you to hold and maintain standard of auditing you have to know what is what does session look like and what should it look like and then just hold that standard thats all as best you can hold the standard just turn in good job of work on the thing one that you wont be ashamed of and one that you dont think id be ashamed of and youll youll have it made you see that is what counts it is your belief in your auditing job now that belief of course can be enormously influenced by the pc providing you are not sure whether or not youre turning in technically perfect auditing job as soon as you become sure of that pc in the world could shake you its only when you are doubtful about what you can do doubtful about your skill and doubtful about your technical accuracy that you can be shaken now you just go ahead and hold standard thats very easy to do and so on because the first long run here is not going to be done before reliable judge the pc he is not reliable judge in the first place hes hes even further introverted during session than he would normally be so he is frankly less capable of observing because youre trying to make him observe himself so his observation of you of course is very poor so dont pay any attention to that do you hear on this might practically save your bacon some day maybe if id told some auditor this earlier why maybe wed had few auditors who wouldnt feel so bad about some of their failures or something like this if somebody had ever told that i know i wouldnt feel so bad about some of mine so this is the way it goes because that first seventy five hours may if your technical accuracy is good and if youre doing the things and using the tools the way you should remember those tools are well put together dont dont think those tools arent youre going to see little change in beginning and end rudiments adapted to security checking or adapted to 3d you see youre going to see little variation between those two model sessions but the bulk and body of model session is unaltered these things are not altered your security checks theyre very set your problems intensive thats very well set the packaged processes which you have theyre very well set these things are not variables and you are not dealing with variables i could give you table and i will try to compile you table of what to do in almost any with any type of pc very simple table using exactly the tools you know how to use but those first seventyfive hours well you just do them now we get up to point where the pc has needle response i dont say that it takes seventyfive hours and i dont say that you graduated from saint hill and really knowing your stuff will not be able to get enough altitude over some pc who is sitting there kind of wideeyed and overwhumped anyhow and you say give your terminal bang you got it you see i mean crash the meter goes you get tremendous meter reads you see because you got altitude dont count on other auditors you train having the same altitude and dont make the mistake that i continue to make please profit by my mistake i make this mistake continually i can sit pc down i know my business i have altitude with the pc even when i dont have altitude with the pc and know my business i can get command value over the pc very rapidly i can really make meter read can really make it read all right so then i expect you to do the same thing thats not proper proper thing for to do but over the years over the years i have finally learned this fact one that i dont know what process will do until it is done out of my sight see i dont know what process will do and the other one is is that i have every reason to expect comparablelevel auditing from everybody who audits oh you thought i was going to say the reverse didnt you you can audit like that because i found out i audit the same way you audit except i just know what im doing and you dont know what youre doing and that unconfidence that you sometimes display at those crucial points on the thing is your only fault now all youve got to do is get that confidence and youve got it made im not saying then that pc raw meat could not be assessed on 3d youve got tremendous altitude with this pc and you sort of overwhump him and you hold him like frozen halibut insession and he responds and he hasnt any choice im not saying you cannot do this at the same time im not advising you to do it not that you couldnt get it not that it wouldnt be fine not that the pc wouldnt get tremendous gains not for those reasons but because youre not going to get that even run of it the bulk of the pcs which you sit down across from will not be in any shape to audit and youll be wasting your time on class ii skills when you should be assessing thats all so that you you should have enough nerve either yourself to set up somebody you care about great deal as pc to set them up perfectly for assessment and get the rudiments in or turn them over to somebody to be set up one way or the other so that you can assess them thats what you ought to be doing with it all right now what happens at this point of assessment well youve got needle response now dont expect the needle response to stay constantly good youve got these rudiments in sort of on the basis of mounting couple of toothpicks on the side of the empire state building you see and theres high wind and toothpicks are frail and theyre liable to fall off at any minute dont expect because you have invested seventyfive hours that they will stay in all youve done is guarantee that you can get them in thats all youve guaranteed with all of this actually the pc will feel better hell live better life hell think things are wonderful youve actually done something to change his way of existence hell think this is fine hell have more confidence in you these are all factors hell think these are gains you under your future experience will learn these arent gains at all they dont amount to hill of beans but they amount to something to the pc theyre more than the pc could get anywhere else from anybody else all right and youve just brought him up to point where you could get the rudiments in thats thats about all you could say you brought him up to point where at the beginning of session you have some guarantee that you can get the rudiments in and that they will stay in probably maybe throughout the session see probably i guess mmhm maybe you see but its more positive than that now you couldnt have gotten the rudiments in on him seventyfive hours before see so thats the single gain that you can expect to have made that you can get the rudiments in on the pc after the pc has been well prepared it isnt now that the rudiments will stay in on the pc they wont but they will be much much better much easier to keep in you wont find yourself coming into session and having to take up two hours of the session with present time problem see you can get the rudiment in as rudiment youve got him to position now where you can call he tells you he has present time problem and then you say well whats the prior confusion to it sec check it little bit and it blows and you can get on with the session do you understand but every session every few sessions you may find yourself confronted with some upheaval in his life which requires that you spend whole session putting him in some kind of shape every now and then even though hes been prepared youve just given yourself the fact that ordinarily you could get the rudiments in thats all youve done after all that period of time all right now we dont care whether the pc feels much better whether he thinks scientology is wonderful or whether he thinks its now horrible we care nothing about his opinion we just hope that he is in bit better communication with the auditor that is all we hope for this pc is going to keep telling you constantly well you know my left eye still twitches hmhmhmhmhmhm my left eye still twitches hmhmhmhmhm you know when you ran that problems intensive it didnt do my left eye bit of good hmhmhmhmhm you can kind of touch the head of the arm so that itll play the next groove1 but thats about all you can do about it because i can tell you frankly his left eye twitching is buried in the middle in some kind of wild goals problem situation that you couldnt have got to with an oilwell rig you see so just pat them on the back and say thats fine and they come in and they tell you it is so wonderful so wonderful i feel so free i feel so marvelous you know my chest longer hurts all these years my chest has been hurting and my chest doesnt hurt very much and i achmmmmm its marvelous what youve done for im so happy about the whole thing you say thank you thank you very much and get on with the game because you know very well his chest is going to turn on in full before it turns off again see you frankly havent you you havent done more than key few things out all right thats fine but if you expect to do anything horrendous for him you see in five hours of security checking and so forth disabuse yourself of the idea youre not whether hes happier or unhappier we couldnt care less its just whether or not we have to do that five hours of security checking while were assessing or do that five hours of security checking before we start assessing and its always smarter to do it before we start assessing thats thats all there is to that all right so we get him into assessment now we spent theres time been spent on this pc this pc is in pretty good condition sleeps oh almost every now and then you know sleep is much better now sleep on the job all day or something like that and hes eating pcs eating now hes eating now hes graduated from eating only nuts to being able to eat bread and nuts you see all these great gains you pay attention to these things at all but hes got all these things see hes all straight everything is nice life is going to continue out now at high climb and everything is going to be wonderful and then you start assessing well during the goals hes very very interested and everything is fine now during goals run pc is very interested unless you start goofing and losing his goal and invalidating it and so forth hell get upset but even then you can bring his interest back its marvelous their interest is right in there with goals and they go right on with this very nicely and they just do fine under goals assessment and nobodys ever happier than pc when he finally finds his goal and thats quite understandable because hes been looking for this thing for long time if anybody had come up to him three or four years before and say what do you intend to do in life it would have thrown him into the awfullest confusion hed ever heard of and now he can say to them what do i intend to do in life i intend to knock the tops off buildings or whatever goal you found on the pc see thats fine see all right but he feels good about this im not making light of that point because that is tremendous point he feels fine about this now the reason routine 3 is so attractive and why youre going to find people backsliding and trying to do routine 3 is just this you can find terminal and the pc is very happy to find his terminal so now hes got his goal and hes got his terminal you can also run this terminal too and it makes the pc happy to have it run thats all dandy now that route hell stay happy the other route that youre going to follow hes not going to stay happy so you just make up your mind to it now hes very happy and he found his goal and he was so happy to find his goal and hes very cheerful and hes got this big gains of now he can sleep all day on the job and he never could sleep wink before and he now eats bread and nuts and he only used to eat nuts now you got all those big tremendous forward strides in life on your very next action youre liable to lose all of them hes liable to backslide on any one of them because its something like you getting in with stick and stirring it up now the pc will stay with it but your technical accuracy and the rapidity with which you do it measures how well that pc will stay with it well i dont care what part of 3d you find next you cant find the terminal because you havent got the modifier you could find the modifier next as in 3a thats hell of fight trying to find modifier when youve got oppterm or anything of the sort but it may keeps the pc bit happier the pc really does not get terribly unhappy youre still fighting on his side you see when you find the modifier im afraid its little bit better however to just run down the 3d exactly the way youre doing 3d you look for the opposition terminal well telling what youll find you may find the guys terminal but you might not have found his goal in the first place that might be the opposition goal this thing is liable to go all topsyturvy before you get through the point is have it right thats the main point dont have the pc happy about it have the assessment right and if your goal is to make the pc happy while youre assessing youre being very foolish you should keep the rudiments in while youre assessing and the devil with whether the pc likes it or doesnt like it youve got to have enough ascendancy to make him sit still while you get the rudiments in and while you find the next item and this pc is going to go over the rolly coasters the process of finding the oppterminal well youre asking the fellow to confront an enemy he has never confronted he just had never confronted this as an enemy hes never even identified the enemy it may be his best friend you might even be it who knows who knows what this oppterm is going to be the thing to do is get it before he has chance to wake up and inspect it thats always fastest in other words lets get the thing and write it down and three days later on the comm lag he says what do you know opposition terminal building you know im in them all the time you know i dont care just find it you can find it before he finds out about it if you if you do that that slippily youll get it for sure and get it very rapidly and easily im not saying to be covert about it because you can get it headon too with his full cooperation or without it all right getting his opposition terminal is going to upset him because youre going to turn on the winds of space hes going to feel that backflow hes going to feel that he is opposed he is going to feel that you are longer really his friend and if at that stage of the game youve got hes got overts on you that you havent pulled by god you cant hold him insession worth two nickels and collar button dont you see hes just not capable of sitting there well actually youre sitting there chanting at him when youre doing the assessment list hes cop and youre youre saying robbers thieves murderers so forth and youre going on over every enemy the cop has its very easy for him to associate you with deadly enemy at that point see if your rudiments are out he will too why you obviously are connected with them because you are saying these things these are dirty words to him really pcs will get some of the most remarkable actions on having assessment lists read back to them again or getting them checked out one has even informed checker that he shouldnt use such dirty words the most remarkable reactions occur well dont expect them to be sensible reactions because youre dealing with the bottom rung of his aberration now he may be nice guy and sensible at all times except when being assessed and then while hes being assessed of course youre playing around with and stirring up all of his worst meanest most viciousesses selves now doing an assessment is sort of like taking pomegranate apart when you first looked at the pc these things were not separate these were all identified and by assessing them you separate them dont think that this separate item was sitting there separately it is the piece of glue to which all other pomegranate seeds are stuck and its quite trick because it might be any of the pomegranate seeds you see it might be any of them but in actual fact its just one of them holding the rest of them together and everything will come off except the last seed and thats the glue only that isnt part of the pomegranate thats the bank youve now got your hands on the bank and the rest of this that you were pulling off of the thing you have simply been causing the pc to differentiate so the case is coming apart in your hands while youre assessing so therefore if you do crude job of assessment it is very comparable to doing very bad job of auditing you see if you arent handling the assessment well and pulling this pomegranate to pieces rapidly or skinning the onion or whatever you want to compare it to youre doing kind of slow painful auditing job on the fellow because its really auditing it really isnt searching you see youre pulling those seeds off one after the other and so forth and you may pull out the center seed and put the whole pomegranate over here on the right and say were through with that and you will do that often thats great blunder youve missed it after this you keep all of sudden theres nothing sitting at the table in front of you at all what happened to the pomegranate see its gone and we have to get back and get the original list thats why you always preserve original lists because it might have the one piece of glue that was holding this thing together on it you see theres only one and there it is so youve got to have that and in taking this apart the pc gets tremendous feeling of relief when you finally find the one piece that was holding the rest of it to pieces and you identify it now he doesnt have to agree with it at all and in lot of the cases he wont verbally agree with you he wont verbally agree with you he will say oh well that couldnt be it and i just gave you that in the first place i was actually just throwing red herring i this i that i that so on and so on because pc can always be counted on to do himself in if you restimulate his opposition terminal because thats what hes trying to do in and he will do in what you will find if hes been trying to do it in in life yeah after youve found it he will try to do it in this you can count on in large number of pcs after youve found it he then explains to himself how it couldnt be it and you couldnt be it see he will do this this is in some number of cases the thing which you will see most generally is the person will be just well of course yes thats it well of course yes thats it thats it that couldnt be it well i sure doubt that yeah well thats it of course that thats the one i i really realize that thats just exactly what ive been doing thats just exactly i dont know how you found that thing dont know how you found that thing couldnt be right hes liable to be of some kind of reversible frame of mind here very easily so you dont pay too much attention to it all right you go on and find the opposition goal now this is cruelty beyond cruelty having turned on the winds of space on the bird with the opposition terminal youre now going to chant opposition goals at him well if this pc were very touchy of course it might be smarter thing to find the modifier before you found the opposition goal it doesnt matter what sequence you find the remaining items in but this is going to turn on more winds of space but also its going to make things much better when you finally have it so its sort of choice at that point and then when you finally get it he feels better he feels worse he feels better he but in general feels better now youre going to find his modifier and of course he doesnt believe that although he says thats what i do all right yeah but uh yeah thats what he does they they have tendency to accept their modifier pretty well except if its terribly discreditable and they have given you terrible time finding it and if theyve given you an awful time finding it of course theyve got overts on their own modifier theyve got overts on you now and they can liable to get all balled up this way well you go across now having found the goalplusmodifier and knowing what its against you can find the gplusm by simply getting the opposition what would oppose the opposition terminal thats easy isnt it or what would oppose the opposition goal see you could take it from there or you could just take the goalplusmodifier and who and what there are many ways you can assess this thing if you wanted to be sure you would assess it several ways and find out how many parts you have and then check the parts out and youll find some of them are null so you could get more parts apparently for instance if if you got the gplusm the goalplusmodifier terminal you just got list of these things you assessed them and you got gplusm you dont like it you you dont think this is quite right or you just want to be sure or for some reason like that you could turn around now and you could get who or what would oppose opposition terminal same assessment isnt it but who or what would oppose you get another list and you find out nothing occurs on this list that occurred on your gplusm list where are we going now well thats fine assess it out and write it down and dont worry about it too much but try to find some new ways to find parts you see see if you havent got some excess baggage here someplace find the opposition actual goal the actual opposition goal which isnt the opposing goal at all its its what the opposition as person would do person or being would do find that find this and find that well the aspect of the pc while youre doing all this sort of thing is because you dont seem too confident because youre finding two or three additional parts or youre trying to sum this up or add this up and he of course is withholding like mad on these things and all of this is an upset aspect and all these beautiful gains are liable to just blow up in smoke through that period somatics turn back on again the pc becomes apathetic the pc becomes very upset the pc becomes this the pc becomes that the only thing you should worry about is when the pc becomes something so they wont have session thats the only thing you should worry about but those beautiful gains might be all wiped out right on up to the time when youve got provenup settled assessment just before that assessment is finished you can expect this pc to be an absolute blank the blank doesnt mean hes blank it means dirty word pcs before 3d assessment is finished can be expected to be bitchy or upset or unsettled and worse off they dont like it theyre in terrible confusion youve thrown them into the midst of tremendous numbers of parts and havent found the parts they that fit and so they react to this confusion and they are very very upset and there may be worse period in their whole processing time in any processing session than they go through twentyfour hours day during 3d assessment they do not look good or sound good when theyre going through the ends run of 3d assessment goal fine opposition terminal well all right opposition goal all right modifier well were not quite sure by now and by the time we get down to finding the terminal oh god life is too horrible theyre liable to become very dramatic theyre liable to become much more dramatizing anything that they would naturally do by reason of their valence they now do twice as hard not commit crimes but theyre liable to be very very hard to get along with during that particular period ive noticed this as recurring phenomenon and just before 3d is finished up god help everybody so thats not necessarily beautiful vista and all of sudden you finish it all up and they say of course and if its absolutely right they relax and some of these gains we had before but which vanished during assessment return and thats good thing that they now have recovered confidence because theyre about to get them all back again the second we start run frankly that is the aspect of pc right up to that point you can expect that all right now during the first assessed run we can expect the pc during the first part of the run quite ordinarily it all depends on long run if persons been run on the terminal before the first level flattening of the first level is pretty pretty easy they dont mind this too much or they mind it terribly or it could be quite variable but ordinarily your first run the pcs willing to sit there and take what comes and so forth and you run the second level and this is in fresh pc that had never run the terminal before and and you get them where theyll sit there and well and theres the next one thats all right im not quite sure about all these somatics is this quite right this couldnt be right because he never had this many somatics before and theyre sort of used to the somatics which they have you see which is severe pain across the throat and hollow feeling in the stomach that is life how do you feel well i feel severe pain across the throat and hollow feeling in the stomach they would have told anybody this for years and now all of sudden their best friends are gone they have horrible pain in the middle of their back and their right leg feels paralyzed this hollow feeling in the middle of their stomach has become much more hollow and their throat isnt there and this is totally unfamiliar view well whats happened to them is the goals problem mass is moving in you have whistled it up and youve said well all the way come on and its moved on in actually it hasnt moved at all but their perception of it has changed and they finally will focus on it and when they if if it isnt correct terminal they never get the goalsmodifier terminal inside their own body its out there someplace but eventually after two three four five levels have been run certainly by that time they should perceive that they have been living in double house and that where they stand something else has always stood and where the body is something else has always been there well the somatics that they get at this particular stage of the game are very changeable theyre very harsh they are very upsetting and they go clear around to the back of the head they make them feel like the back of their heads going to fall off actually theyre frankly not too worried but they sure hurt they dont like this particularly theyre liable to complain and youre liable to believe that something is wrong yes theres something wrong if that doesnt happen theres something wrong with your 3d if that doesnt happen because that is routine all right now whats the routine behavior of flattening level somewhere from it all depends on how strong level you found off the auxiliary prehave scale and it might even you might even get stuck ta with only two or three commands and then it takes you the rest of the bracket and by the end of the bracket its obvious that the needle has been still for half of the bracket well thats thats getting too tough thats awful still thats awful stuck but normally the tone arm if the assessment is proper can be expected to go up and stick and then the needle sticks first the tone arm sticks and then the needle shows little driftiness and then the needle sticks too when youre first running across these runs that needle can stop with clank you can almost hear it clank it is just not about to move anyplace it is in brass after while on later runs youll find it just sits there it doesnt necessarily sit there at screaming attention but its still stuck and its still stopped now you can expect then on this first level for the tone arm to go up and the needle to stick and that happens and when that happens you dont overrun that you do another assessment and between them if you had the right havingness and if everything is going well and the rudiments are in and so forth the person should come down off of that before you run your second run it doesnt matter much if they dont but they actually should come down off of that you should be able to get them down off of that just by virtue of their not running it for few minutes and you run the second level and it goes up and sticks the tone arm sticks and the needle sticks both of these things stick and they stick very solidly and you dont want to overrun that too far because assessment will be very difficult to do so you come off of that and you do it again and it just just keeps happening up goes the tone arm and sticks and the needle sticks and that is all that happens and you go on and you run level after level after level after level and thats what happens on every one of the levels and the pcs somatics however abate after while they get less severe after youve run four or five levels why the pcs somatics are hes getting used to them there are still sticky masses inside of him the mass picture hasnt changed and so forth now during this early run and even very late in the runs you cannot expect the pc to get clean clear pictures there everything is fuzzy he wont even see probably picture of the terminal until you have run something if you count running level as also rerunning level until you have had about twenty runs on levels he may not even get dubin picture of the terminal and hell eventually collide with dubin picture of the terminal in some phase or another this may puzzle the pc but of course he is it how can he see himself the pictures are all smashed in on him and theyre all fuzzy and mucked up and they arent really engrams they arent really pictures they shouldnt be in 3d they probably arent in color theres probably nothing very startling about them he gets impressions of them its sort of theres picture over there way over to the right someplace and he gets something about that theres steady picture is liable to occur and reoccur out in front of him that he cant quite make out black ridges occur inside of his head and around him and hes not sure what these things all are and thats quite ordinary quite routine nothing to that if he had clean track he would have been able to inspect it and he wouldnt be there and he wouldnt be in that condition obviously so all right now what is the thats thats one of these aspects that the needle goes up and sticks and tone arm is pardon the tone arm goes up and sticks the needle sticks and that the pc has pictures now after youve run ten or twelve levels or something of that order you should rerun all of your levels you just take them up in sequence from the earliest level through and rerun them frankly you should rerun them by assessment but its not the same kind of assessment that you do on the prehav scale you just mention you take the first level and you mention it and you dont get any needle reaction so you take the second level and you mention it and you get needle reaction so you run that level on its same original commands again and youll find theres little tone arm motion left in it and it goes up and sticks and as soon as it goes up and sticks and youre sure everything is good and stuck for few commands and so forth you come off of the thing and you mention the third level to the pc and that of course nothing on that and you mention the fourth level to him theres nothing on that so you mention the fifth level to him whatever it was and you get tick or sudden stick all right you rerun that level you rerun it again and so you go over these things actually you go over all of them third time just this same way before you go on up above certainly above the level of ten or twelve before you find ten or twelve levels lets get all of the early ones cleaned up by passing over it at least three times on this assessment basis that ive just talked to you about now the pc during this time has not lost the mass the mass is still observable it is much lighter by the time youve done the second or third run you will find you know across those levels and before youre ready to do new prehav assessments you will find that the pc isnt really bothered by these things except occasionally they get sharp pain or suddenly be sitting there thinking about nothing in particular or somebody will be talking to them and their oppterminal gets mentioned or something like this and they feel sort of zhuuuuu they feel kind of winds of space hit them for minute or they had hell of pain in the back of their head or or their chest will start acting up suddenly and then they forget about it and so on it actually isnt too uncomfortable to them its probably sharper but actually not as bad as some of the illnesses they have had now theyre liable to believe during this period that theyre going to get sick that is to say theyre liable to throw up theyre liable to get very thing or theyre liable to develop fever or they do develop fever between sessions but their sicknesses for the trillennia have all come out of this goals problem mass how do you expect this person to do otherwise than react to it as matter of fact i did the anatomy of how thetan feels pain and they actually feel it through goals problem mass you have to have valence and valence in order to for thetan to have this sensation of extreme pain you have to have doublerooted whizzle to collide with whatnot you know you have to have two things colliding and then he believes he isnt one of them and believes he is the other one and and you get that and then these two things will come together and then you get the pain registered what youre doing is pushing the pc beyond the borderlines of extreme pain he will not be able to feel extreme pain when you figure when you get one of these things flat all right and of course thats very bad news to pc who is so overwhelmed that he thinks pain is delicious anyway along about the third run or something like that or sometime during that period pc is liable to suddenly develop the symptoms which used to tell him he was going to get sick and this will worry him well ill give you an idea the person gets gets bad throat bad throat and they knew at one time or another that when their throat felt that way that they were coming down with sore throat and tomorrow it was going to be worse well frankly this was the somatic in the goals problem mass which when it moved its few inches further on to the rest of that particular engram was the sickness which they used to suffer from see and youve caught them at this point which is the warning point and theyve always used this as warning point they got so that they noticed that when their throat got dry they then went on and got sick what they didnt realize was what was making their throat dry was always also what was making them sick and it was simply cycling through an incident of some kind or another which was totally flatly worn on the body so they get this and it gives them an idea theyre going to be ill and they go around thinking theyre going to be ill and they dont get ill its very puzzling and it upsets their considerations with regard to these things because life has been pockmarked and predicted by these various sensations and their map is disappearing you know when am i going to feel sick at my stomach well im going to feel sick at my stomach when i get this small feeling in the back of my neck everybody does you know before youre sick at your stomach you get this funny feeling in the back of your neck or i know something terrible heres more familiar one i know something terrible is going to happen because i have this terror feeling in the pit of my stomach and i know that will probably something bad is going to happen tomorrow and all of these signals turn on see these are superstition signals that the person has used and of course they wake up in the morning and by god theyve got that terror stomach they know something bad is going to happen today it always has happened in the past every time they woke up in the morning you see and felt that way why something bad was going to happen in the rest of the day thats for sure so they wake up in the morning and then their stomach feels bad so they know something bad is going to happen in the day and then they get up out of bed and it disappears so they suddenly remember it was the level the auditor was running on them yesterday which was worry or something like this you know or terror or something you see and it evaporates they dont mind all this its just whats going in and out now as you go on and run prehav levels from that point on you get slow gain the pc is not really going to raise hell with you and not going to complain about lack of progress particularly but they are going to natter that it doesnt all happen at once well now youre running problem and the pc suffers from all of the illusions given to anyone about problem problem is everywhere at once is hung in an instant of time and time doesnt move these are all the illusions given to one by having problem and when he has hell of problem he always knows time is not moving and hell talk to you about why isnt it happening faster and i wish it could happen faster and this is all this this stuff which is resultant from this from being up against the central problem of their whole track is what you collided them with with crash you see and this runs out slowly i hate to tell you this but it runs out slowly it does not run out rapidly because youre running it out on the basis of socking the pc into the problem youre not taking any chances on this thing going off and getting keyed out and then keying in again in few years the best thing to do is throw him in the middle of the whirlpool and get rid of it whats going to happen here now is that he is not going to notice his improvements this could upset an auditor it is quite common the pc does not notice his or her own improvements except on comm lag they notice them on the basis of about three days or four days or something they suddenly realize they havent had any trouble sleeping well for years you see theyve had lot of trouble sleeping they cant even spot what this was or why they stopped having trouble sleeping they just dont have any trouble sleeping now they go to bed clonk you know and they wake up thud you know and they say its never happened to them you know thats fantastic and this problem about bread and nuts and that sort of thing well they theyre just all set about this and so on it gradually comes over them as theyre sitting there theyre eating this great big steak and theyre chomping into it you know slop slop slurp slurp you know gulp gulp gulp suddenly comes up you know ive never eaten steak before you know or the following day they suddenly remember that they have never eaten steak before you see something goofy like this goes on and some of the things that they suffer from get worse theyve always had bad itching back their back has always been itching and every time theyve ever sat in company you know they really felt like doing this all the time you know but they didnt dare and so they get sort of suffering look on their face and they and youll see them sitting in the auditing chair and theyll be going grrr and so forth and actually their back will get much much worse much worse and itll itch and itch and itch and itch theyll complain about it and complain about it well theyre headed in forwards into goals problem mass and the last part of them that gets affected is of course the rear thats all thats all there is to that and they they first just turns on it turns up and up and up and it becomes far from unbearable but it they complain about it and complain about it and complain about it and then one day theyre coming into session and theyre complaining and complaining about their cold feet and theyre complaining and complaining about their cold feet and you say whats the matter with your back hows your back today oh well that that was nothing that was nothing dont pay any attention to that i dont know why i ever worried about that thats gone why are you worried about that im not worried about that thats their main answer youll see them fly up flight of stairs taking three steps at time you see zip you know come up to the top and then fly down the flight of stairs just thud see and they come down to the bottom bang breath shortage nothing walk along not panting he used to go up the stairs four at time and then pant pant you know they dont appreciate your calling this to their attention though they say of course thats the way i am or theyll explain to you with perfectly straight face perfectly straight face that if they were their terminals waterbuck well thats the way waterbuck is and their social conversation they give people long lessons on the subject of this and that and its really terribly interesting to listen to but they are prone to do this its terribly interesting but its rather interesting to have somebody give you dissertation on the subject of it must be hell on waiters thats all i really this fellow says well now you see in the seventeenth century violins werent made that way you see these violins i remember violin i made one time and back there and uh about that time you can just hear the waiters neck creak well i dont think they should have come across the sunken road at the battle of waterloo i was down in the middle of it there on cavalry charger and it was not comfortable you see cavalry chargers have to be very carefully disciplined and here we get here we get the the know how on the subject of the handling and training of cavalry chargers or books arent printed that way in the upper galaxy they dont print books that way at all they have electronic beams you see they have this big machine its very educational but the persons thinkingness you would think at this time is being far more this is the mistake you can make is being far more colored by their terminal than it ever has been before or that their views are far more colored than they ever had been before this is not true at all their views are much less colored because they know now what they are talking about and they are very conscious of the fact that while they are talking about that they are being waterbuck you see theyre very conscious of this fact and theyre also conscious of the limitations of waterbuck and it begins to dawn on pc about this time that the terminal was the limiter of the things it pretended to extend in other words if their terminal was swimmer at first theyre of the opinion of that is why i have succeeded and this lasts quite while into auditing well i have succeeded as swimmer because i have terminal as swimmer and then eventually as they get the thing run they start remembering all the races theyve lost you see all the swimming races theyve lost and they find out theyve lost practically nothing but swimming races and then they suddenly realize that in order to be successful swimmer theyd have to get rid of this cottonpickin terminal that would be the way to be successful swimmer in other words the terminal appears to be valuable up through certain strata and then the pc all of sudden starts to fly on his own and realizes that the terminal itself is limiter of ability and that the pc realizes eventually that he has these abilities himself and the terminal never had any abilities but all the terminal did was specially channel the abilities in such way as to make the pc relatively ineffective in executing these abilities thats all for instance if we had somebody who was had terminal gigolo you know wed find out hes been dreadfully bad gigolo terrible gigolo you know never asked an old lady for sou if he could possibly get out from under it you know and he he just never really was good gigolo and we get him all straightened up and he goes out and chucks an old lady under the chin and she at once reaches into her purse for the hundred franc note you see pang you know i mean just just like that its hes gotten rid of the terminal you see it was in his ability to be gigolo but as long as he was being gigolo on dramatizing basis of course he never could be gigolo not really he couldnt be good gigolo its very interesting theres certain sense of freedom then begins to emerge and that actually begins to emerge somewhere toward the end of about the third rerun of the first twelve levels and the person starts coming out of this feeling of im good because i was they dont come out of it very thoroughly then they sometimes very wisely realize that it was because they were probably pretty well educated at one time or another into being that they have so much data on the subject and they begin to realize that they are data wise now i told you one time that if you cleared cannibal youd have cleared cannibal right used to say that fairly often now the truth of the matter is we have exceeded this definition of clear with dynamic clear and this is where were going and why were going in that particular direction if you clear cannibal you longer have cannibal today and furthermore this person will also be able to learn to do something else or will resurrect the data which enables him to practice something else and so forth at the same time while not depriving him of the ability to dine succulently on human flesh but he doesnt have to do it anymore and he also has sense enough to realize as he looks around the civilized community that hardly anybody in there is eating any bodies so it isnt done here so he doesnt do it and he wouldnt do it until he got someplace where it was socially acceptable again you see in other words you have judgment on the subject now what crime is is action without inspection and this is what youve restored and you restored it fully action without inspection person will begin to realize while hes why hes holding himself down while running these things too some of the most unlikely cognitions will start turning up hes holding himself back so that he wont cannibalize he has to have all these things he doesnt dare move out around the grounds for fear he might start dining on human flesh you know because hes got reprehensible not all terminals are considered to be reprehensible but there is not one terminal any pc will ever run that doesnt have its reprehensible side they are there are terminals that are free from all see its impossible because they never would have been terminal all right now lets look back at the review of this and lets find out that it what this was all about now how did the pc get into this mess in the first place well he objected to the activities of the terminal so he attacked the terminal and then he accepted its enemies he attacked the terminal interiorized into it and accepted its enemies he accepted its enemies before he attacked the terminal he accepted its enemies after he attacked the terminal and they were both the same enemy in other words he chose this thing as something to attack this was something he objected to in the society at large so he decided to eradicate it and he got enough overts on it and they were mostly failed overts and failed withholds and while attacking it he lost often enough and he finally became this thing and now ever since hes trying to get rid of it because of course he hates it so therefore people commit suicide cut their own throats fix themselves up with unsuccessful lives of course theyre still trying to get rid of this terminal all right now the individuals freedom of course is tremendously restricted as long as it is totally patterned upon the terminal and its opposition because the individual will continue to go to the opposition to eradicate himself as terminal and so we get this weird explanation of human behavior hell continue to do this always it rather explains human behavior its why they behave this way all right the individual as he comes up the line then improves on runs very gradiently he approve improves gradually he doesnt improve suddenly flashily and it would be bad thing if he did improve flashily he wouldnt know himself from day to day but he starts straightening out and you can be very very disinterested from professional viewpoint if suddenly some pet somatic of his oh youve run now youve run twelve levels twelve levels three times through youve gotten all of those flat and the pc is still sitting there with one of his favorite chronic somatics dont worry about it dont worry about it these things go away slowly they dont go away rapidly now pc can run level after level after level without single cognition and its sort of like hell get several cognitions running his first level or his second level he may and then he may run several levels without any cognitions whatsoever just grind grind grind grind grind and he may get the same problem over and over and over and over he may get the same circumstances over and over and over and he may get the same scene over and over and over and over it doesnt matter bit you just keep running it we dont care what hes getting and it doesnt matter at all because all of this thing will shake out sooner or later and then hell spend session and hell just have cognitions cognitions cognitions and he oh is that what thats all about is that what its all about or late in the evening he was sitting down taking his socks off and an hour later hes still poised there with one sock halfway off you know whole string of cognitions have suddenly cut loose and started going off like skyrockets you know and hell try to take up the whole next session and give you the cognitions he had the night before well you want to fix him up with new cognitions not review old ones but anyway theres theres your expectancy at this particular stage of the game and if case does these things this is poor show case runs nice big beautiful 3d pictures doesnt get into anything for three or four sessions gets into nothing gets into this lifetime only doesnt really tangle with anything and the tone arm does not go up and the tone arm and nothing sticks and so forth well you just got lousy 3d combination thats all its just bum but if the tone arm goes up and sticks and the pc seems to be alert and the pc to you looks better and the pc looks less like theyre being smashed against the wall the chances are that youre running the right terminal you see and that youre running the right oppterm and that the 3d is okay and everything is fine its going along providing the tone arm goes up and sticks and the pc has collided with mass and so on all these things are the expected things now you could have an oppterm slightly off and have pc run oddly if you run the opposition terminal as the pcs terminal its going to be odd all right its going to practically blow the pcs head off the pc is just going to sit there and theres more and more pressure on the front and less and less happening about it youve got him in the ranks of the enemy but that they get pressure is foregone conclusion they will get this running their right terminal you see but im talking about its it they get blown in on everythings blowing at them you know and their face is sort of disappearing and their chest starts disappearing and yeowwwwwww and thats running the wrong side of it if more levels start going alive thats why you must keep up your 3d forms you must keep up these 3d forms list your levels and every time you do an assessment on the prehav scale put down after it on the 3d form over there anger twentyseven alive see and youll come back to it next assessment youre thinking about other things you see and you put down jeopardize thirtyseven alive well thats bit dangerous all right and then you run another level and you put down hate seventysix alive well its about time to put the pc on the plane to saint hill or or something or or be sensible and do another 3d or something of the sort or look the thing over inspect it try to get some more terminals try to get some more parts check out what youve got and so forth because youre running wrong terminal if thats happening youre not just on the opposition side of it youre running wrong terminal well the oppterm i cant quite tell you what goes wrong when an oppterminal goes off youre running the right pcs right terminal and youve got the wrong opposition terminal if you have that the thing is going to go awry but at this stage of the game i cant tell you because i havent observed one so i wouldnt know but i dont think the goals problem mass will come up and hit the pc in the face the goals problem mass will hit the pc in the face if hes on the opposition terminal see youll run him into the goals problem mass with thud well with far too much in the way of air currents things dont get solid to the pc they get blowy you know winds of space if theyre on the right terminal they get plenty going on in front of them and inside of them but its getting solid it is in the level of solidity and they have an outflowing aspect although theyre being smashed in they still have an outflowing aspect they sort of feel like wooooo its uuuu well its out there and im here and and so forth if you want subjective reality on how it feels how it feels or how it looks to have the oppterm goal why as i told you several times just repeat the opposition terminal to the pc several times this pcs terminal is waterbuck opposition terminal tiger you say tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger pc he wont be able to help it youll see see him going back and you say what did you feel at that time i dont know its something you knowandit well something haha haha and it sort of i dont know currents moving or something and then of course be kind enough to restore it say waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck well what does that feel like well its getting kind of solid haha thats right solid so its the high wind versus solidity the high wind of course is when youre running the opposition terminal if you ran the pc as the opposition terminal he cant get into it because he isnt in it and hell get sort of frantic idea of getting into it now those are some of the things you can expect out of 3d run its very gradual the improvements theyre not very spectacular but as far as improvement is concerned they are much greater than you would could expect out of ordinary oldtime auditing theyre much greater than this its just that the pc is not as vocal about them theyre considerably greater all right now lets take another aspect of this situation and that is how long would it take well that depends on the accidental combinations of the prehav scale that depends upon the density of the mass the ferocity of the situation that depends upon the auditor it depends on how well the pcs rudiments stay in how well the pcs rudiments are put in and i wont give you any kind of an estimate i wont give you an estimate i dont know it is much too variable it looks to like one of these very variable pictures but i dont think youre going to get anybody in going real clear in five hours or ten hours i know that wont happen because of course you are not now keying them out you could only get fast clear with keyouts you could key them out and clear them fast and theyd register clear but youre making different type of clear and your expectancies of this of course are different but theyre not infinite theyre very far from infinite its not worrisome length of time its not even bad length of time the biggest change your pc will get just to recapitulate from the viewpoint of the pc is of course in his sec check and rudiments in and so forth hell think this is quite change and then hell say that the biggest change and the the you you wont be able to observe much change in the pc except hes little more friendly thats about all but you will now start to observe considerable change in the pc at the time you get his 3d parts when youve got all these wrapped up why there is great change in the pc and this is an enormous shift on 3d and when you run the pc from day to day you will be able to see the changes in the pc and the pc wont now it starts out with the pc seeing marvelous changes that you cant observe that is on sec checking and all that sort of thing and then it starts in on big changes that you can observe and the pc definitely observes and the pc is very excited about and and its sort of wow or damn it or isnt it horrible and it doesnt matter what their tone of mind is you know but its change and theyre really getting shift theyre finding exactly what its all about and then after that youre the one who notices it youve done just complete reversal on the situation the pcs sitting there and the pc is looking brighter and the pc is looking healthier and the pc is looking more active and you say well are you feeling better today as matter of fact im not i have pain here in my side here and so forth im kind of worried about it you know the pc looks about five years younger today than they did yesterday you know so it goes into reverse look of course it is what it is and changes are what they are all right well ive tried to give you some kind of recapitulation of how 3d looks over broad numbers of cases and what i would look for as being right and what id look for as being wrong and it might have occurred that some of you you already have by the way youve all helped do this one way or the other i never saw such frantic comments in my life as ive had on the subject you know the pc cant get any pictures the pc just cant get any pictures i mean its just all masses out there one kind or another well yes of course you know and so on and so on its one reaction another one is the tone arm just goes up and sticks i cant make it do another thing and the funny part of it is that im giving you these remarks because an auditor apparently gets worried about all the right things see the right things about 3d are what the auditor gets worried about about 3d and theres the tone arm going up and sticking and the pc cant get any pictures and black masses and terrible somatics inside the body and the feeling like the pc is going place nothing is happening of any kind whatsoever in the pc well something is happening but it feels like theyre going place to the auditor the auditor says the pc is always complaining about somatics and so forth the auditor never thinks to ask the pc are these somatics different than the somatics you had yesterday oh the pc will say the somatics i had yesterday lets see oh yes quite quite different theyre different than the somatics i had this noon as matter of fact as matter of fact theyre different from the somatics i had at the beginning of session as matter of fact theyre gone as matter of fact theyre much worse at this particular moment that weve been talking about them so youre looking at youre looking at giddy change rate here see and an auditors expectancy is geared up to very slow shift of somatics or something of this sort of thing youll see the way it goes if 3d is wrong why you will be able to tell it from the winds of space phenomena which i keep describing it to you you see the reason i call it the winds of space is because of course there is air there to blow and there isnt anything to have any current except maybe electronic flows only these electronic flows probably dont exist so they must come from someplace else and of course out in outer space there are winds so there are winds there and yet there are winds there the pc can feel them the other thing that would be very dangerous is levels living up but if youre doing an accurate assessment if youre doing very very accurate assessment each time of course you wouldnt even make mistake on this and if levels are living up that is dangerous symptom it isnt that you should come off of 3d it isnt that you should do this or that or do something desperate or fantastic or something like this what you should do about it is just check the thing over and find out if theres anything wrong with this and find out if the levels still react and and find out some little odds and ends about all this 3d see thats all youre interested in and then youre satisfied that the thing is right run another level find out if that one came alive maybe that one will die out maybe much many less levels alive maybe youre going across some kind of peak maybe the pc wasnt quite doing your auditing commands maybe the rudiments were out you see theres lot of odd obvious auditing errors could have been occurring that would have might else have accounted for it its still dangerous symptom the pc cant somehow come to grips with goals problem mass and yet the pc seems to be running their own terminal i would probably suspect the oppterm as being off and id reassess for an oppterm youll get another oppterm you might have gotten an oppterm that was almost it and would last for little while see but it wasnt quite right i normally can see these things mile off because if it doesnt add up to that thered be conflict there i know it isnt enough for person to have spent trillennia in agony over it you see you wouldnt have canary bird and you wouldnt have canary youd have canary bird and cat yeah you could figure that one out see natural game all right but you wouldnt have canary bird and old boots old boots canary bird oh he might have an incident where canary bird got caught in some boots but i dont think itd happen very often thats not the kind of game were were shooting these days old boots and id just i wouldnt throw the assessment away or suggest anything to the pc id just work it over here whats right what are we sure is right all right lets take that point of departure and then lets reassess and check everything there making sure the old item is also on the list and we use the old list and so forth lets just do rapid check on it and see if we come out with something else this time ah there was something else showed up and something else all of sudden was going bing bing and that looks much better now and then itll settle down and run as pattern but what is pattern run well i just described it to you in this lecture gruesome as it is that is pattern run heavy masses heavy valences hidden bodies inside of bodies aches pains and somatics pc acting like theyre on wire theres one phenomena i havent mentioned to you after the first few runs youll get this youll be trying to make things stick and then the pc will twitch their elbow or lean back in the chair and you get blowdown after this thing gets freed up after 3d level sticks it more and more rapidly goes free it wont stay there it wont stay stuck sometimes it stays bit stuck but mostly itll get more and more impermanent in other words your stuck is up there and the needle is stuck and it was for sure stick and three days ago this would have been like truck running into wall you see but its real stuck and theres doubt about that and then the pc takes his attention or her attention off of the thing and puts down the cans and picks up the cans and is reading at clear read they were reading at 45 now theyre reading at clear read see it it just comes down rapidly that sort of thing should increase if it isnt increasing youre running with the rudiments out if the stuck ta is not more rapidly coming down and returning to clear read more rapidly and more rapidly and if you say why
