u ask zelda guilty until proven innocent from zelda dispenser of advice on workplace issues run date 11082012 u the below article is unclassified in its entirety note the following question has been edited for brevity dear zelda how do i exonerate myself from an anonymous mailbag incident few months ago coworker was really steamed about how things were going in our branchdivision and wrote livid message to our offices anonymous mailbag but showed few of us the draft beforehand i suggested that the wording was overly strong as it referred to our managers as abysmal and idiotic the coworker sent it anyway coworker receives praise and recognition from the office despite the mail or because coworker didnt come up on the list of suspects who wrote the message in the meantime the chill im feeling is pretty severe im known to be direct person so possibly it was assumed that if anyone would write message like that i would but i didnt and i advised against it because i agreed to look at the draft in confidence i dont want to dime out my coworker what recourse do i have to officially establish that i have not used this mailbag if i have something to say to anyone ill do it under my own name and it wont involve using the words abysmal or idiotic help and btw to the situation im in is good argument against anonymous mailbags let people put their own names to criticisms they want to make of others otherwise you end up with people like who are wondering if were getting unjustly blamed innocent bystander dear bystander you make good case against anonymous mailbags but lot of people wont give feedback at all if they know it will be attributed to them i believe scathing comments such as your coworkers are the exception and not the rule in such mailbags nevertheless there is something you can do about the situation speak to the persons who is freezing you out in private say ive notice you describe the treatment youre receiving have i done something to offend you if they mention your note you have the opening to set the record straight you can state what you did above that you have never used the mailbag and that if you had something to say to someone you would tell them directly cause thats how you roll if they dont bring up the note at least youve made an attempt to clear the air maybe there is another reason for the cold shoulder when they insist nothing is wrong you could say something like i hope if you did have problem with that you would talk to directly about it i would do the same for you that plants the seeds of innocence in their mind ie you would talk to them directly and not use an anonymous mailbag if the cause is the note and encourages them to broach the subject if its something else other anonymous mailbag thoughts while it is tempting to be completely uncensored when using anonymous feedback mechanisms please understand that it can be counterproductive rude accusatory or overly severe comment can turn the recipient off to your suggestion for improvement try to make your comment constructive and free from emotional coloring you are more likely to have it considered and initiate change that way likewise if you receive hostile feedback through an anonymous mailbag its easy to discount and ignore it especially if it pushes your hot buttons instead try to look past the way it is worded to see if theres kernel of truth that requires action often important feedback is not couched in the most pleasant terms while many people will accept gentle criticism from friend it takes truly enlightened person to acknowledge that an adversarys nasty comment might have some merit and to do something about it u standard disclaimer zeldas views are her own and do not represent the official views of the associate directorate for corporate leadership human resources sid or any other nsa organization u looking for some of the older ask zelda columns they are filed away in the archives under the ask zelda 2010 and ask zelda 2011 series also if youd like to submit question of your own to zelda just use the commentssuggestions about this article button below to send it in
