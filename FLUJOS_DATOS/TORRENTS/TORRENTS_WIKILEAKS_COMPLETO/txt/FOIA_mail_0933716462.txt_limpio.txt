for bringing that to our attention i checked out that page and unfortunately what he has done is so ridden with problems that it isnt even worth confronting many of us eg phil jones henry pollack shaoyang huang rob harris and others have been scratching our heads trying to find statistically defensible way of combining the information in boreholes and conventional proxy indicators and as yet it is not clear if it can be done given in particular the loss of information due to geothermal diffusion and the overriding important of landusage changes and snowcover variations on borehole temperature profiles i dont think hoyt has added anything scientifically productive in this regard looks more like he has wrecklessly convoluted borhole data with our reconstructions to get just the kind of result he wants to get of course there are issues with regard to secular trends in dendroclimatic reconstructions which form an important but not exclusive role in oure reconstructions and nobody is better qualified to discuss these than keith or malcolm hughes who have highlighted these issues in recent publications there is link to nice recent nota bene science piece by keith and tim osborn on my webpage httpeclogitegeoumasseduclimatemikembh99html with regard to co2 fertilization it is ironic that hoyt frames his analysis in these terms when it precisely this effect for better or for worse we took great pains to account for in our recent millennial temperature reconstruction see the above web page for more info at least we have done this in reasonably statisticallydefensible if imperfect manner rather than an ad hoc attempt to get an answer rather than follow scientifically meaningful process this thing wouldnt have chance at passing peerreview at least not on this planet so he posts it on the webthe downside of absolute freedom of dissemination i suppose the material in question is the scientific equivalent of trash plain and simple like lot of the skeptics out there dh appears far less interested in honest scientific discourse than in misleading as many unlucky soles as possible who wander into his den of disinformation kind of like the scientist equivalent of an ant lion i suppose every once and while i do choose to respond to this type of crap eg with regard to pat michaelsmy soontobe neighbors recent pieces in his world climate report in dhs case i doubt even more that this would be at all productive we just have to wait and see if he ever tries to get this kind of thing published in the peerreviewed literature for our part i think the best approach is to as jonathan overpeck has so effectivley been doing try whenever possible to educate the lay public about the essential distinction between peerreviewed science and unpeer reviewed well whatever you want to call it again thanks for the heads up on this best regards mike mann xsender tfppopunixgubcca date tue 3 aug 1999 133636 0700 to rbradleyclimate1geoumassedu from tom pedersen pederseneosubcca subject skeptics cc calvertunixgubcca steve calvert kbriffaueaacuk weaveroceanseosuvicca hi ray my colleague steve calvert has just brought to my attention website of which i was unaware but you probably know well its at httpwwwerolscomdhoyt1 and run by doug hoyt amongst other things hoyt has taken the mann reconstruction and reconstructed it by removing the effect on tree ring thickness that results from co2 fertilization paraphrased you will see the figure on his site he concludes that there is significant warming in the last half of this century relative to the last millenium do you know this guy are you familiar with his reconstruction of your reconstruction didnt keith briffa correct his treering reconstructions for co2 fertilization keith any comments steve and i would be most interested to hear your collective comments to close this here is bit cut and pasted from hoyts sight three final points there are three important points to make about the reported warming of the last 20 years 1 the warming has occurred mostly at night and not during the day this result is inconsistent with warming caused by greenhouse gases but is consistent with urban heat island and other surface effects 2 the reported warming has occurred only at the surface and not in the upper atmosphere this type of warming is completely opposite to what is predicted if greenhouse gases are the cause again these observations are consistent with problems in the surface measurements 3 the warming has occurred primarily in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes with little in the polar and tropical regions this result is consistent with urban influences but is incompatible with the climate warming predicted from greenhouse gases which predict it to be largest in the polar regions in short the reported warming is inconsistent with warming due to greenhouse gases in its temporal vertical and geographical distribution the reported warming is consistent with problems in the surface network cheers tom tf pedersen oceanography earth and ocean sciences 6270 university boulevard university of british columbia vancouver bc canada v6t 1z4 telephone 6048225984 fax
