trade barriers and trade deficits implications for us economic welfare summary this report provides an ove rview of the economics of international trade that may be helpful for consider ation of many recurring international economic policy issues it is intended as general explan ation of mainstream economic principles that may be considered in gauging the economic significance of trade issues as well as the tradeoffs inherent in many policy choices fundamental tenet of economics is that international trade is means to higher standard of living for all trading nations the postwar era has seen rapi d expansion of trade and the united states has been major participant in this pro cess both as trading nation and as leader in the steady lowering of barriers to trade wo rldwide the significant benefit of trade does not come without disruption and cost however gaining the benefit of trade and also treating equitably those hurt by trade is often difficult public policy issue there is recurring congressional concer n about the effect of trade on us economic welfare current issues include bilateral and multilateral trade liberalization initiatives steel dumping export controls and the rapidly growing trade deficit this report provides br ief overview of the ec onomic arguments for free trade common arguments for trade barriers and the cause and economic significance of persistent large trade deficits central theme is that the economic benefit of specializa tion and trade is fundamental aspect of economic life whether for the individual region or nation this benefit is mutual enriching each trader moreover the gain from trade can accrue to trading partner even if that partner is less efficient in the production of all tradable goods trade can also lead to economic gains by allowing fuller use of econo mies of scale and by inducing productive innovation trade is however disruptiv force as well advancing the economic position of relatively efficient activities but diminishing that of relatively less efficient activities this process will often place significant economic and social costs on workers and industries in adversely affected activities arguments for trade barriers come in ma ny forms but none is generally accepted by economists trade barriers are often seen as redress to the social and economic costs of trade or as way of enhancing ec onomic advantage in most cases however economists argue protection from trade imposes costs on the economy that exceed the benefits obtained these costs can arise from inefficient resource allocation intractable implementati on and foreign retaliation the trade deficit is not necessary aspect of trade nor is it caused by foreign trade barriers trade deficit is rooted in macroeconomic behavior at home and abroad the deficit is means for the nation to spend beyond current production with like sized inflow of borrowed fore ign capital that funds the added spending spending beyond current production par ticularly on investment can confer significant benefits but borrowing will entail some level of cost as debts are repaid this report will be update d infrequently with chan ges

mankiw principles of economics new york dryden press 1997 pp 4557trade trade barriers and trade deficits implications for us economic welfare the growing importance of trade to the us economy the american economy has experienced steady and substantial growth of international trade since the end of world war ii total trade the combined value of exports and imports as share of gross domestic product gdp has risen from around 10 in the 1950s to about 26 in 2005 even this large increase may understate the rising impact of trade on the economy because of the large share of services output much of which is nontradable in us gdp for example looking at merchandise exports as share of total tradeable output for the united states shows growth from near 4 in 1950 to more than 40 in 2005 for the united states however international trade is still much less important than in other industrial economies where as in most european countries trade often exceeds 50 of gdp1 the rising integration of the amer ican economy with the world economy has been facilitated by technical advances that have reduced the natural barriers of time and space that separate nati onal economies integration s also been facilitated by recurrent multinational policy actions that have steadily lowered various manmade barriers to international exchange the united states has always played leading role in pursuing these trade liberalization initiatives as natural and manmade barriers have fallen the considerable ec onomic advantages of trade have induced large increases in the international exchan ge of goods and mutual gain in the economic wellbeing of trading nations why do countries trade2 trade occurs because it is mutually enriching with positive economic effect like that caused by technological change whereby economic effici ency is increased allowing greater output and consumpti on from the same endow ment of productive resources think of international trade as productive process with us exports as the inputs and foreign imports as the output but most importantly it is more efficient productive process that provide s american consumers with goods and services they want at lower cost than can domestic producers the notion exportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs2 3 for further discussion of the nature and si gnificance of integrated global markets see thomas friedman the lexus and

institution 1998are good and imports are bad often colors public policy debates about international trade as the cited analogy suggests from macroeconomic perspective both exports and imports are good the benefit of free trade is attached to the product received not in the product given the united states want imports and exports are how they are paid for this is an exchange of something of value to acquire something of greater value and what is gained from ch exchange is increased by anything that allows the united states to exchange smaller volume of exports for any given volume of imports ie by reduction in the export cost of imports like technological change and other ma rket forces international trade creates wealth by inducing reallocation of th economys scarce resources capital and labor into relatively more efficient activities and away from less efficient activities in the case of international trade however the more efficient activities are located beyond the nations borders such reallocati on can be characterized as process of creative destruction generating net economic gain to the overall economy but also being disruptive and costly to workers in adversely affected industries these displaced workers will likely bear signifi cant adjustment costs and many may find work only at lower wage although economic analysis almost ways indicates that the economywide gains from trade exceed th costs the perennially tough policy issue is how to secure those gains for the wider community while dealing equitably with those who are hurt by the process3 specialization comp arative advantage and gains from trade the importance of the gains from trade is clearly evident in individual economic behavior rather than person building hi s or her own automobile providing his or her own medical services or producing his or her own food it far more efficient for an individual to specialize in the production of some good or service in which he or she is good at and trade these indirectly w ith the use of money for most other goods or services that are desired such specialization and trade clearly allow each person to consume far more than would be possible if he or she were completely self sufficient the same is true for count ry albeit to less extensive degree in most cases ie us imports of goods and services amount to about 15 of gdp economics also tells us that the gains from specialization and trade are mutual occurring even if the trading parties have an absolute advantage or disadvantage in the efficiency with which they produce all tradable goods all that is required is difference in relative efficien cy that is difference among countries in the rate at which the output of one good must be curtailed to expand production of another good in other words difference in opportunity costs exists if these rates are different then each country has comparative advantage in the production of one of the goods creating the potential for gain s from trade in this circumstance eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs3 4 the exception would be difference caused by manmade barrier to trade such as continuedcountry can improve its economic wellbeing by producing what it does relatively best and trading for the rest nation does not compete with its trading partners it engages in mutually beneficial exchange with them therefor business metaphors such as competitiveness that are relevant to the individual firm are unlikely to be useful in understanding the twoway nature of trade and significance of the mutual gains from trade this principle of comparative advantage would explain for example why the 200 per hour attorney despite be ing able to type very fa st and accurately would still find it more efficient to employ secr etary for 25 an hour to do that job the income gained from using the time he or she would spend typing to practice law would likely more than compensate for th cost of the secretary the opportunity cost of the attorney typing for one hour ex ceeds the cost of the using secretary for that task similarly the secretary gains by spending more time typing and less time attempting to practice law the pay from typing exceeds the opportunity cost of not practicing law differences in comparative advantage will arise between countries because of differences in the relative abundance or scarcity of the factors of production comparative advantage will be found in t hose activities that make intensive use of the abundant productive resource for ex ample compared with many other countries the united states with relativ abundance of highskilled labor will find that specialization in the production of goods that use highskilled labor intensively will with trade raise national income in contrast china which has relative abundance of lowskilled labor and relative scarcity of hi ghskilled labor would find that specialization in the production of goods that use lowskilled workers intensively would with trade raise that countrys real income differences in productive technology among countries c ould also create differences in relative efficiency and form basis for trade comparative advantage can emerge in the production of in termediate products as well as final products with some incr easingly fragmentable production processes it may be more efficient to produce par ticular component in one country another component in second country and assemb the final product in third country it is also found that comparative advantage will vary over the life cycle of product at the stage of innovation and product deve lopment where highskilled workers and specialized capital are required an econom with an abundant endowment of such resources like the united states would be the more efficient location for production at later stage in the products life with greatly expanded sa settled technology the capability for standardized production and falling price production would be more efficient in an economy with an abunda nce of lowwage labor such as in china it is important to highlight that the gains from trade will most often arise from there being differences between the trading partners not just economic differences but social political geographical or demographic differences can be of significance as well4 this explains why many economists do not find useful the sports metaphorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs4 4 continued tariff in this case removal of the diffe rence through elimination of the tariff would increase the gains from trade and economic wellbeing 5 another possible benefit of more open trad for the united states can arise because its level of trade barriers is already very low rela tive to most other trading partners therefore removal of those barriers would likely have stronger positive effect on the demand for us exports than it will on us demand for im ports this can cause rise in the relative price of us exports rising export pric will increase the import purchasing power of any given volume of us exports and increases the gains from trade to the united statescommonly used in trade policy discussions the need for level playing field among trading partners if each person re gion or country were alike in every way there would be little to gain from trading this observation may be particularly important when considering the merits of us trade with poorer less economically advanced countries who will very often have sharply di fferent economic cultural and other characteristics economic theory indicates that using these differences to generate trade will be an im portant means by which rich or poor nation can improve its economic wellbeing other sources of gains from trade trade is also enriching to the extent it llows countries to take greater advantage of economies of scale the longer production run the lower unit production costs may be many products requi re huge initial investments in research and development as well as large investments in highly specialized physical plant and equipment the ability to reach larger world market through international trade can greatly reduce average production costs and the fi nal price consumers must pay for the product in addition open markets and inte rnational trade can increase the flexibility of an economy trade can enhance an economys ability to respond quickly and efficiently to rapidly changing economic conditions in the global market place by improving access to foreign market s resources and technologies further trade can increase the competitive pressures in the market place pushing firms to cut waste keep prices down improve quality and raise productivity such pressure can also be an effective check against the use of monopoly power and in general clear benef it to the nations consumers finally trade can accelerate the pace of technical advance and boost the level of productivity by raising the expected ra of return to successful innovation and spreading research and development costs more widely trade can propel higher pace of innovation with more competitive pr essure firms must quickly adopt new practices or risk business failure greater international trade can also enhance the exchange of technical knowledge among countries as human and physical capital may move more freely economic theory suggests that these inducements will increase an economys rate of growth causing not just onetime boost to economic welfare but persistent increase in income that gets steadily larger as time passes5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs5 6 jeffery frankel and david romer does trade cause growth nber working paper 5476 june 1999 7 catherine l mann globalization of it services and white collar

the gains from trade through these several forces economists reason that free international trade will raise the efficiency of the world economy and improve the living standard of most trading nations moreover these gain s are permanent accruing to the economy each year and making their full significance better measured by cumulative gain over the stretch of decades in the postwar era international trade worldwide has grown three times as fast as briskly dvancing world output leaving little doubt that trade has made an important contribution to the growing prosperity of the united states and the world economy initiatives such as the creation of the european union implementation of ur uguay round of market openings and the north american free trade agreement nafta all speak to the importance of trade it is also apparent that trade has played an important role in the dramatic transformation of the emerging economies in east asia many studies have measured the benefits of trade to be sizable with the overall gain typically growing with the degree of openness to international trade for example 1999 study by frankel and ro mer looked at data from 123 countries to assess the relationship between openness to trade and the growth of real per capita income they found that each percentage point increase in openness as measured by the sum of exports and imports as percentage of gdp led to 034 increase in real per capita income for the unite d states between 1960 and 1997 there was 127 increase in openness to trade and an associated 43 increase in real per capita income and they expected this gain to increase as the time period is extended into the future6 2003 study by catherine mann looked at the economic consequences of the globalized production and international tr ade of information technology it hardware it found that increased it hardware trade between 1995 and 2002 generated cumulative gain of 230 billion to the us economy7 the likely sizable benefits derived from trades inducement for the development of new products provision of an enhanced array of products and generation of increased productivity are not eas to measure therefore it is likely that the full magnitude of the gain s from trade are underestimated in most quantitative studies8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs6 9 manmade trade barriers come in several forms two common manifestations are tariffs and quotas tariffs are tax on imported goods quotas are limit on the quantity of good that can be imported variant of the quota is the voluntary export restraint ver where the exporting country imposes the restriction other barriers against imports often called nontariff barriers include local content requi rements national procurement policies and unduly protracted health safety and customs procedures the magnitude of the negative effect on economic welfare will likely vary with the type of barrier used in general for given level of protection quotalike restrictions carry greater potential for reducing welfare than do tariffs tariffs quotas and nontari ff barriers lead too few of the economys resources being used to produce tradeable goods an export subsidy can also be used to give an advantage to domestic producer over foreign producer export subsidies tend to have particularly strong negative effect because in addition to distorting resource allocation they reduce the economys terms of trade in contrast to tariffs export subsidies lead to an over allocation of the economys resources to the production of tradeable goods for fuller discussion of the nature and implica tions of different forms of trade barriers see w m corden the theory of protection oxford clar endon press 1971 10 oecd indicators of tariff and nontariff barriers paris various issues 11 see gary clyde hufbauer and kimberly ann eliott measuring the costs of protection continuedthe economic effect of trade barriers9 if international trade is economically enriching imposing barriers to such exchanges will prevent the nation from fully realizing the economic gains from trade and must reduce welfare protection of importcompeting indus tries with tariffs quotas and nontariff barriers can lead to an overallocation of the nations scarce resources in the protected sectors and an underallocation of resources in the unprotected tradeable goods industries in th terms of the analogy of trade as more efficient productive process us ed above reducing the flow of imports will also reduce the flow of exports less output require s less input clearly the exporting sector must lose as the protected importcompeting activities gain but more importantly from this perspective the overall economy that consumed the imported goods must also lose because the more efficient production process international trade cannot be used to the optimal degree and thereby will have generally increased the price and reduced the array of goods available to the consumer therefore the u ltimate economic cost of the tr ade barrier is not transfer of wellbeing between sectors but perm anent net loss to the whole economy arising from the barriers distortion toward the less efficient the use of the economys scarce resources the united states and other nations have made great progress in the postwar era in reducing trade barriers the aver age tariff among industrial nations has been reduced from near 50 after ww ii to near 5 today10 barriers in many developing economies have also fallen but are still generally higher than those of the industrial economies these remaining impediments to trade nevertheless have significant economic costs 1994 estimate of the economic cost of existing us barriers in 21 highly protected sectors was 70 billion pe r year with economic cost per protected job ranging from 100000 to more than 1 million and averaging about 17000011httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs7 11 continued in the united states washington institute for

cases the cost of protection was far higher than the workers average annual earnings and far higher than any likely worker adjustment program would cost 2004 study of eight industrial nations including the united states provides estimates of the extent of integration among these econo mies and the welfare gains from further integration12 on the question of extent of integration it was found that despite considerable lowering of trade barriers over the postworld war ii sizable barriers still existed in 1999 with averag product prices differing by third on the welfare gains from further integr ation it was found that removal of the remaining trade barriers among these eight countries would lead to an increase in global gdp of more than 500 billion in 1997 dollars or 21 of global gdp the gain to the us alone was estimated to be bout 77 billion in 1997 dollars or about 1 of gdp highlighting the greater gain associated with multilateral lowering of trade barriers this study so estimated the gains to each of the eight countries if each removed thei r trade barriers unilaterally in this circumstance the gdp increase for the united states is pared to 30 billion or 04 of gdp in general the welfare gains to the united states are smaller then those of the other eight countries this is thought to occur for three reasons one us trade barriers were already lower th an those in the other countri two trade represents comparatively smaller share of economic activity in the us economy and three there are increases in import prices because of the huge size of the us market causing some deterioration of the terms of trade and an associated decrement to economic welfare the issue however is not just whet her to continue removing barriers but whether to resist the erection of new barri ers the world economy saw the most rapid removal of trade barriers and greatest increase in economic integration in the years between 1870 and 1913 during most of the first half of the 20th century trade barriers grew sharply reversing the substantial trade liberalization achieved in the previous century during world war i world trade had been tightly controlled nations grew more insular in the 1920s nd sentiment for trade protectionism grew in europe and the united states causing creeping up of tariff rates over the period the onset of the great depression accelerated this pattern in the united states the smoothawley tariff of 1930 raised tariffs on manufactured goods to lofty 48 swift retaliation by europe and britain followed in the aftermath it is estimated that between 1929 and 1932 the value of world trade fell by 70 an outcome that doubtless only exacerbated the ongoing colla pse of economic activity across the world economy therefore much of the ffort

trade productivity and recession by craig kelwell 16 economies always have some amount of unemployment each economy will tend to have natural rate of unemployment around which the actual unemployment rate fluctuates this natural rate will also represent the rate at which the economy is effectively at full employment because lower rate of unemployment would not be sustainable due to the inducement of higher rate of inflation the na tural rate is not zero because at any point in time there will be some people who are changing jobs and other people who normal market forces have temporarily displaced the more fluid the economys labor markets the lower its natural rate of unemployment is likely to be for most of the last 30 years the us continuedwar ii era has involved reversing and guarding against the reerection of those protectionist structures13 common arguments for trade barriers demands for the preservation or augmen tation of trade barri ers continues to be part of the public debate ove r trade policy five of the more common arguments for trade barriers are evaluated below for their likely economic effects jobs are destroyed by trade it is asserted that trade has created jobs for foreign workers at the expense of american workers it is more accurate to say that trade both creates and destroys jobs in th economy just as other market forces do economywide trade creates jobs in industr ies that have comparative advantage and destroys jobs in industries that have co mparative disadvantage in the process the economys composition of employment chan ges but according to economic theory there is net loss of jobs due to trade over the course of the last economic expansion from 1992 to 2000 us imports increased nearly 240 over that same period total employment grew by 22 milli on jobs and the unemployment rate fell from 75 to 40 the lowest unemploym ent rate in more than 30 years14 foreign outsourcing by american firms which has been the object of much recent attention is form of importing and also creates nd destroys jobs leaving the overall level of employment unchanged15 there are two complementary reasons for increased international trade not leading to any net job loss first the federal reserve using monetary policy can set the overall level of spending in the ec onomy to level consistent with full employment16 although deviations from full em ployment can occur wellrunhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs9 16 continued economys natural rate was judged to be in the 55 to 60 range since the mid1990s the natural rate has likely fallen to the 45 to 50 range most often an appropriate level of aggregate spending is that consistent with employment at the natural rate 17 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics business employment dynamics various issuesmonetary policy will minimize the incidence and duration of such episodes and help keep the total level of employment high in most years with or without outsourcing trade deficits or trade in general to give some perspective on the relation between job lossand total employment as well as the potential significance of foreign outsourcing in this dynamic process consider that in any quarter of 2000 at the peak of the last economic expansion with total employment at about 111 million gross job losses tallied between 85 and 90 million nevertheless the economy at that time was operating at the lowest rate of unemployment in 40 years over the whole course of that expansion gross job loss actually rose as the unemployment rate steadily fell but with adequate economywi spending it was possible to create job gains that more than offset job losses in the far weaker labor market of 2003 gross job losses per quarter measured 72 to 78 million gross job gains in 2003 were at about the same as losses leaving total employment steady in each quarter of 2004 and 2005 however gross job gains exceeded gross job losses by between 200000 to 900000 jobs causing the us unemployment rate to fall from 6 to 5 this occurred despite the us economys total level of trade exports plus imports growing from 26 trillion to 33 trillion over th same period in either time period gross job losses occurred on scale far greater than that attributed to foreign outsourcing alone17 second against the economic backdrop of adequate aggregate spending any increase in the purchase of imports will tend to generate an equal increase in the sale of the countrys exports of goods or assets this outcome follows from the fundamental economic re quirement that imports must be paid for and exports are the only means for making that payment the export sold does not have to be currently produced good or service it can also be the sale of an asset such as deposits in bank account shares of stock bonds or real property but in the end when tallied across transactions in goods and assets na tions trade is always in balance in the sense that any imbalance in goods trade mu st be offset by compensating imbalance in asset trade both types of export sales will have pos itive effect on domestic output and employment countering across the whole economy the negative effect of increased imports in short the us deficit in trade is offset by the surplus in capital flows there is denying that with international trade there will be shortrun hardship for some but economists maintain the whol economys living standard is raised by such exchange they view these adverse ffects as qualitatively the same as those induced by purely domestic disruptions such as shifting consumer demand or technological change in that context economists argue that easing adjustment of those harmed is economically more fruitf ul than protection given the net economic benefit of trade to the total economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs10 18 this conclusion is also confirmed by the ab sence of any deterioration in labors share of national income which

vol 125 6 june 2002 continuedworker wages are hurt by trade many people believe that imports from countries with low wages has put downwar d pressure on the wages of americans there is doubt that international trade can have strong effects good and bad on the wages of american workers the plig ht of the worker adversely affected by imports comes quickly to mind but it is also true that workers in export industries benefit from trade moreover all work ers are consumers nd benefit from the expanded market choices and lower prices th at trade brings yet concurrent with the large expansion of trade over the past 25 years real wages ie inflation adjusted wages of american workers grew more slowly than in the earlier postwar period and the inequality of wages between the skilled and less skilled worker rose sharply was trade the force behind this teriorating wage performance the effect of trade on wages in the us economy has been the focus of numerous studies over the past 10 years nd the conclusions that may be drawn from these efforts are as follows as regards the slow growth of the average real wage from the mid 1970s to the late 1990s increased trade is not seen as being the cause of that sluggish performance rather the identified reason was slow productivity growth labors share of the economic pie was not getting smaller the economic pie just was not growing as fast18 when productivity accelerated in th late1990s average real wages also increased at faster pace that the level of wages is most often reflective of the level of worker productivity also explains why higher wage american workers are not necessarily at disadvantage to lower wage foreign workers the critical comparison is of unit labor costs not of the level of wages the high productivity that is the basis of high wage means that unit labor costs can be lower in the highwage economy than in the lowwage economy because productivity in lowwage economies is commensurately low as well as regards trade and increased wage inequality the research indicates that trade was cont ributing factor but minor one accounting for perhaps 10 to 20 of the observed increase in wage inequality it would seem then that from the standpoint of the economy as whole trade w ith lowwage economies has not triggered race to the bottom likely important reason for the small effect of trade on wages for the us economy was that trade with lowwage countries was s till relatively small amounting to less than 2 of gdp in 2000 in fact among us trade partners the average wage level in manufacturing relative to the us manufacturing wage level grew from 60 in 1975 to 76 of the us level in 200019 this has occurred because many tradinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs11 19 continued pp 3649 20 jagdish bhagwati

any restriction placed on chinas imports to the united states would not increase domestic output rather it woul d increase the output of the pacific rim economies whose exports to the united states would increase as they become replacement for restricted chinese goods for discussion of this and other aspects of trade with china see the economic report of the president washington gpo 2004 pp 6568 and crs continuedpartners who were once lowwage econo mies have with open trade and steady economic growth become highwage econo mies as the once poor have moved up the income ladder they have also wit hdrawn from the production of goods that use lowskill and lowwage labor intensively and these products are then imported from the newer emerging economies china has pi cked up this task as other east asian economies have withdr awn and in turn as these ec onomies did when japan shifted away from this type of production so us trade with lowwage economies is not rising to significant degree rather it is shifting location economies of scale are also factor th at likely helps hold up industrial wages in the face of lowwage foreign competiti on scale effects are thought to be significant force in many industries and wh present would tend to increase worker productivity and decrease unit labor costs it is also possible that the increase of competition itself spurs companies to higher levels of efficiency that also lowers unit labor costs and helps preser ve higher wage level another reason for the small impact of trade on wages in the united states is that as the once lowwage economies have absorbed current technology raised the capital intensity of their pr oduction and transformed to highwage economies two events occur one they produce less of the goods typically produced by lowwage workers and two they increase their mand for the products produced by lowwage workers the two effects exert upward pressure on the wages of these workers including any producing similar laborinten products in the united states this outcome is consistent with the evidence that for the united states the relative price of unskilled laborintensive import comp eting goods rose in the 1980s and 1990s based on this evidence it can be argued that trade with lowwage economies is likely to have improved wages in the united states at least in the sense that they are higher than they otherwise would be20 it is also apparently true that import penetration by laborintense products has not changed greatly but the location of th at production has reviewing the period 1994 thr ough 2003 the council of economic advisors concludes that for united states the increase in share of total us imports accounted for by imports of goods from china has been largely offset by d ecrease in

american worker giant sucking sound or small hicc up brookings papers on economic activity washington brookings institution 1993of course it cannot be ruled out that if trade with relatively lowwage economies does grow in importance the ne gative effects on us worker wages of such trade would grow in significance yet there is probably an upper bound to this effect for it is possible that in the future with only relatively moderate differences between home and foreign production costs complete specialization would occur that is the united states would longer produce much of what is imported from lowwage foreign economies since the united states would then longer have industries that use lowwage labor intensiv ely there would be downward pressure on domestic wages caused by such trade to the extent that this pattern of trade allows for fuller realization of econo mies of scale and lowers product prices domestic workers real wages could be increased the change in the location of us imports from lowwage economies noted bove suggests that sizable amount of such specialization may have already occurred it is also known that industries that expor t pay wages that are on average higher wages than industries that compete with imports therefore as rising level of trade and outsourcing creates jobs in exporting industries and destroys jobs in import competing industries there is tendency for the average industrial wage to rise it is also useful to keep in mind that the us economy is still largely domestic in orientation with perhaps as much as tw othirds of the labor force working and having wages determined in activities largely unaffected by trade economic analyses indicates that it is very unlikely that growing international trade has had much to do with the slowdow n in real wage growth and unlikely that trade has caused more than minor share of rising wage inequality in the united states the slower productivity growth evident from the mid1970s to the mid1990s is seen as the principal cause of slow real wage growth in this period the experience during the 19922000 period shows that despite rapidly rising level of imports real hourly earnings in the us manufacturing sect or the sector most strongly effected by trade but one with relatively high produc tivity growth in this period rose 2622 for trade to have reduced the relative wages of lower skilled workers there would need to be an associated fall in the mark et price of those importcompeting goods that are produced using lowerskilled workers intensively this has not occurred23 more likely reason for increased wage inequality is the presence of bias in recent technological change toward greater use of higher skilled workers economy wide tending to pull up their wages relative to those of the less skilled other factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs13 24 for further discussion see crs report 98441 is globalization the force behind recent poor us wage performance an analysis by craig k elwell 25 it is beyond the scope of this report but it is worth noting that there is sizable body international relations literature on the question of whether ec onomic integration reduces the likelihood of war see for example richard rosecrance the rise of the trading state commerce and conquest in the modern world new york basic books 1986 that are thought to have made minor contributions to wage inequality are immigration deunionization and falling real minimum wage24 national security is threatened by trade some industries or at least components of some industrie s are vital to national s ecurity and possibly may need to be insulated from the vicissitudes of international market forces this determination needs to be made on case bycase basis since the claim is made by some who do not meet national security cr iteria such criteria may also vary from case to case it is also true that nationa l security could be compromised by the export of certain dualuse products that while co mmercial in nature c ould also be used to produce products that might confer milita ry advantage to us adversaries controlling such exports is clearly justif ied from national security standpoint but it does come at the cost of lost export sales and an economic loss to the nation minimizing the economic welfare loss from such export controls hinges on well focused identification and regular reeva luation of the subset of goods with significant national security potential that should be subject to control25 special industries with unique nd substantial ec onomic potential will not mature without protection from trade in theory there can be special industries which if given gove rnment nurturing including protection from international trade will grow to generate large economic returns in the future but without this public support these special i ndustries will not emerge or will occur at too small scale while there are many variants of the argument for government promoting particular industr ies two have some plausible economic merit one is support for industries that will have the potential to generate substantial economic benefits to other sectors but only fracti on of those benefits can be appropriated by the firm if left to the private market this will lead to underinvestment in the socially desirable activity the second type of speci industry that could warrant government support is new endeavor that will only exist in highly concentrated market structure ie oligopoly where sizable m onopoly profits are likely to be emerge claiming the lions share of those profits will depend on which nation gets there first and which nation can be deterred from tr ying government support can influence which nation ultimately claims those m onopoly profits in both cases the role of government support is to overcome mar ket failureand by doing so raise the economic wellbeing of the nation the generation of new ideas is often the activity of central economic importance for economic wellbeing because an idea can have limited excludability it can be difficult for the firm to fully appropriate the economic benefits of the idea it has created the new idea may

287296support the firm will not have the incentiv to invest in the knowledgecreating process at level that the whole societ would find most economically beneficial this is theoretically valid argument for government support for an industry that generates significant benefits that are external to the firm in practice however it is problematic endeavor26 to be economically eff ective such support needs to be targeted at the knowledge that would not otherwise be produced this is likely difficult task even if the right target is identified it will be virtually impossible to know what amount of support is called for because these types of activities to not carry market price from which to judge re lative scarcity tariff or other forms of protection from international competition is likely to be too blunt an instrument to achieve this goal as it is likely to create other costly distortions at the international level knowledge nurtured at considerable expense by one nation may be easily appropriable by industries in other nations tending to reduce any national advantage to accrue from supporting special firm the other theoretically valid argument fo r government promotion of particular industry is based on the possible existence of strategic industries these are industries in which only very few firms woul d be able to operate profitably in this oligopolistic market structure firms will likely have significant degree of mon opoly power and the potential to ear n above normal profits ca pturing those profits would increase the home nations economic wellbein g in this environment nations may be tempted to compete for those profits without government support those profits will most likely be appropriated by the first few firms to establish themselves in the industry subsequent entry by other firms would be deterred as they can only expect to incur losses this outcome can be alte red if the government of one country gives support with an export subsidy for instance sufficient to assure that whether firms from other nations enter or not its firm will earn profit because any unsubsidized firm would now earn losses they will be deterred from entry the subsidized firm is said to have strategic advantage over its potential competitors so this type of action has been called strategic trade policy in theory well placed subsidy to assure the timely entry and successful ope ration of the strategic industry can actually raise economic wellbeing in the home economy again although it is conceptually possibl for strategic trade policy to raise national economic wellbeing its practical significance has been widely questioned by economists perhaps the greatest doubt as to the efficacy of strategic trade policy is that the information required for the government to successfully execute the policy most likely exceeds what would be readily av ailable economic theory indicates that the conditions needed for the execution of successful strategic trade policy are many and favorable outcome will be extremely sensitive to small deviations from any of those necessary conditions this means that pursuing such policy with substantially incomplete information coul d easily result in subsidies supporting more inefficiency than efficiency and leading to more loss than profit further if large subsidies are to be handed out without ll necessary information available policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs15 27 see stephen golup does trade with lowwage c ountries hurt american workers federal reserve bank of philadelphia 1998makers can anticipate some politicalization of the process and the rising probability that more subsidies will be given than can be analytically justified success is likely to be even less tractable if trading partners can be expected to retaliate against policy that will clearly make them wors off finally economic studies have suggested that even if the policy is well implemented the realized gains could be very small for all these reasons it is likely in practice that trade protection to support strategic industries w ould raise economic welfare unfair competition undermin the benefits of trade can trade be beneficial if all parties do not abide by the same ru and regulations economic theory says it can if another country c hooses to give subsidy to an exporting industry buying those nowcheaper ex ports will hurt domestic industries that compete with those foreign goods but it will benefit the domes tic consumers who purchase them economists assert that th gain to consumers will typically exceed the loss to producers and workers ther efore from the standpoint of overall economic welfare here defined as increas ed national income an efficient economic response may be to accept the gain in real income offered by the subsidized foreign goods and facilitate the adju stment of the adversely ffected home workers to more efficient endeavors similarly many ec onomists see possible economic advantage of buying foreign goods produced under different labor and environmental standards they view differences in such standards as basis for creating comparative advantage and realizing mutual gains from trade in ddition to the economic benefit to the us economy for many poor nations the ability to use such advantages to produce tradeable good today may offer the best vehicle to increased productivity and steadily rising living standard in the future despite the economic gain to the united states trade on this basis can undermine l ong held domestic norms of fair market conduct it is at the core of many domestic disputes regarding tr ade and trade barriers as many see trade as eroding labor and environment standards if deviation from these norms is unacceptable in domestic transactions it may be hard to justify them in international exchanges yet it is also probably unrealistic to expect us trading partners to be just like the united states in these practices p oor countries with much lower levels of productivity simply cannot afford the ameri can level of wages and labor standards27 rich or poor other countries often have different social and economic priorities and may choose to live with very different environmental standards one thing that is clear from the economic history of the nowrich industrial nations with rising income there also came rising labor and envi ronmental standards it can be plausibly assumed that many now poor countries w ill follow similar path and that trade can be an important means for achieving higher income

and free trade see dani rodrik continuedanother common activity widely seen as an unfair trade practice is foreign dumping of exports28 dumping can hurt particular workers and firms and is not acceptable under us law but to believe that total economic welfare is reduced by dumping the premise that there can be price that is too low has to be accepted price cutting is basic element of comp etition widely practiced in the domestic economy that leads to great er efficiency and economic gain to consumers actions to prevent dumping curtail the benefit of such competition in international commerce an exception would be instances of dumping that are predatory and part of plan to establish monopoly power such predat ory practices woul d ultimately reduce economic welfare and preventing them is in nations economic interest because predatory pricing is rare economists place little merit in most claims of dumping nevertheless the number of antidumping ac tions has risen precipitously in the past 15 years once the protectionist tool of choice of few rich nations antidumping actions are now being emulat ed by many other nations the discussion so far shows that mainstream economics gives little reason to expect that deviations from free trade imp rove nations economic wellbeing yet trade barriers persist this most likely occurs because barriers have very focused benefits accruing to wellde fined groups with concentrated political voice while the barriers costs are often widely disp ersed over the population among people with less natural cohesi on and more diluted political voice economic analysis demonstrates that the protected groups ga in however is most often at the greater expense of the wider community29 the tough policy question is finding an acceptable reconciliation of th conflicting goals of imp roved economic efficiency that comes with open trade and social equity that is often compromised by more open trade without necessarily relying on trade barriers in the postww ii era most large mark et economies have prospered but they have also maintained social bargain whereby society is asked to embrace the wealthbuilding power of the open market economy in return for an acceptable degree of cushioning from the periodic soci disruption and cost that also comes with that process in effect workers in these economies have been given an amount of social insurance to ameliorate the risk to job and income inherent in the operation of markets extending this idea the case can plausibly be made that with more open trade that risk increases and commensurat enhancement of that social insurance is called for thus to secure the economic benefits of reduced trade barriers and more open trade societies may in the interest in economic equity and social cohesion extend and improve that social insurance this would point toward g overnment policies to better provide for temporary support of income to better provide for worker retraining and to better provide for geographic mobility30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs17 30 continued has globalization gone too far washington institute for international economics 1997 31 there are plausible scenarios where nations if left only with the use of unilateral action might see their best option to choose protection while in multilateral framework they would see that better result comes from choos ing mutual barrier reduction thus the use of the multilateral option would reduce the risk of trade wars this is an example of situation called the prisoners dilemma where individual action always leads to an outcome inferior to the outcome from collective 32 preliminary negotiations called the doha development agenda have occurred to set the stage for the initiation of ninth round of multilateral negotiations to achieve further reductions of trade barriers worldwide 33 for fuller discussion see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes consequences and cures by craig k elwell

details of us trade performance in 2004 see us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis news release us international transactions mar 16 2005 the persistence of trade barriers is also consequence of the slow incremental process that the worlds economies have us ed to reduce those barriers although unilateral reduction or removal of nations trade ba rriers would most often improve its economic wellbeing it is rarely used31 the steady reductions of tariffs and other trade barriers by the worlds economies over the past 60 years was largely achieved by successive rounds of multila teral reductions since ww ii there have been eight major multilateral trade agreements th most recent being the uruguay round which was completed in 199432 this is slow process with each round taking many years to negotiate and implement partial reduction of existing barriers yet it is process that confers significant advantages not likely to occur with unilateral action first the economic gains are likely to be considerably larger if all economies reduces their barriers because gains arise from the freer flow of both imports and exports second multilateral action gets exporters on board with consumers to broaden political support for the market opening pro cess and third the multilateral process develops an institutional framework for dispute settlement that better insures that once reduced barriers stay down and institutional momentum that keeps the trade liberalization process moving fo rward through successive rounds the trade deficit33 the us trade deficit has rise n more or less steadily since 199234 it reached 805 billion in 2005 more than doubling in size since 2001 and with cumulative increase of more than 700 billion since 199535 as share of gdp the trade deficit over the past decade has risen from less than 2 of gdp to reach record 64 in 2005 in the 1990s the trade deficit grew despite good export sales in those years the 2001 recession reduced the trade deficit but with ec onomic recovery it has grown larger and economic proj ections point to the trade deficit continuing to growhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs18 36 it is useful to remember that income spending are the flip side of production output any given value of production generates an equal value of income thus the income the economy earns can support spending sufficient to purchase the economys current output with international trade however it is possible for there to be divergence of spending and production through the borrowi ng and lending of current income and output between nations this year to more than 800 billion ssuming the economic expansion maintains momentum but it is not necessary that an economic expansion generate large trade deficit rising current account deficit r falling surplus over the course of brisk economic expansion is not remarkab event for the us economy in the 1960s brisk economic growth steadily eroded small current account surplus in the 1970s modest deficits occurred with each economic expansion however in the 1980s and 1990s the size of the trade defic its increased greatly cyclical factors certainly at times played some role in th is phenomenon particular ly in recent years with the us growing rapidly relative to most major trading partners trend forces are also at work however inclining the us economy toward generating large trade deficits in all but recession conditions the trade deficit widens as the economy expands not because of trade barriers abroad not because of foreign dumping of imports and not because of any inherent inferiority of us goods on the world ma rket but primarily because of underlying macroeconomic conditions at home and abro ad in effect the us economy spends more than it produces and this excess of demand is met by net inflow of foreign goods and services leading to the us trade deficit36 of course the us trade deficit is only possible if there are foreign economies that produce more than is absorbed by their current spending and are ab export the surplus trade deficits and trade surpluses are jointly determined international capital flows will allow mutually favorable reconciliation of these domestic spendingpr oduction imbalances these imbalances will be sensitive to the shortrun effects of the business cycle at home and abroad as well as longterm eff ects of trends in sp ending and production but these imbalances will not be efficiently changed by trade policies that try to directly alter the levels of exports or imports such as tariffs subsidies or quotas saving investment imbalance national spendingproduction imbalances ar most usefully analyzed from the standpoint of national saving nd investment behavior saving is just the flip side of the same phenomenon an excess of spending essentially tr anslates into deficiency of savings but has the advantage of mo re clearly rooting the phenomenon in the international asset market transactions which is th key to understanding the mechanism that generates aggregate trade imbalances it is an economic identity that the amount of investment undertaken by an economy will be equal to the amount of sa ving that is the portion of current income not used for consumption that is available to finance investment but for nation this identity can be satisfied through the use of both domestic and foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs19 37 saving in macroeconomic framework is the portion of current income that is left after households businesses and government pay for their current consumption household that diverts some amount of current income to bank mutual fund or government bond is saving similarly the tax revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending is public savingsaving or domestic and foreign investment therefore savinginvestment imbalance is relationship between domestic saving and investment and one that can only occur if foreign saving or investment are available to satisfy the overall saving investment identity37 in relatively open world ec onomy with reasonably fluid and well functioning international capital markets capital flows from lender to borrower are the means by which the saving of one country can finance the investment of another with willing lender and willing borrower flows of capital from one nation to another can achieve overall savinginvestment bala nce for both nations if international capital flows did not occur dom estic investment c ould be larger or smaller than domestic saving differences in the level of interest rates between economies are what induces saving capital flows between countries as international investors seek out higher rates of return nation with sur plus of domestic saving over domestic investment opportunities will tend to have relatively w domestic interest rates because the domestic supply of loanable f unds ie saving ex ceeds the domestic demand for loanable funds i investment pushing down interest rates ie the price of loanable funds as result this economy will also likely see some portion of domestic saving flow outward attr acted by more profitable investment opportunities abroad this net outflow of purchasing power which generally can only be used to purchase goods or assets denominated in the countrys currency will through changes in exchange rates induce likesized net outflow of real goods and services trade surplus japan is an example of nation that in recent decades has produced large net outflows of saving to the us and other nations conversely another nation that finds its domestic saving fallin g short of desired domestic investment will tend to have relatively high dom estic interest rates because the domestic demand for loanable funds exceeds the domestic supply of loanable funds as result this economy will likely attract an inflow of foreign saving attracted by the higher rate of retur n and that inflow will help support domestic investment such nation becomes net im porter of foreign saving income able to use the borrowed purchasing power to ac quire foreign output and leading to like sized net inflow of foreign output trade deficit that deficit augments the output available to the domestic economy allowing the nation to invest beyond the level of domestic savings in recent years large share of this inflow of capital has been the result of official purchases of dollar asse ts by foreign governments that are most often not prompted by relativ rate of return therefore these purchases can run counter to the direction of capital flows indu ced by private investors this movement of capital will most often modulate the impact of private capital flows but not likely to offset or revers the impact of those flows the purchase of foreign asset will require the use the appropriate foreign currency therefore asset market transactions will also change the demand for

trade deficit net outflow of capita l bids down the exchange rate and the exchange rate will decrease by enough to induce an equivalent net outflow of goods trade surplus the united states has in recent years had rising shortfall of domestic saving relative to domestic investment and has received growing net inflow of foreign capital to bridge this gap in 2000 at the peak of the previous economic expansion the us gross saving rate total saving s as percent of gdp was 18 the gross investment rate was 22 with the difference being made up by an inflow of foreign saving or lending equal to 4 since the n the us saving rate has fallen reaching 135 of gdp in 2005 because of the 2001 r ecession and its after effects the us gross investment rate fell but since 2003 it has risen to 197 in 2005 again the saving investment gap was bridged by an inflow of foreign sa ving equal to 64 of gdp this rising inflow of foreign capital caused steady appreciation of the dollar through early 2002 the dollars rise in turn l ead to steady rise of the trade deficit the recent depreciation of the dollar suggests that the size of the net inflow of capital to the united states may be ebbing and with some time g this will lead slowing of the rate of increase in the trade defi cit and untimely induce shrinking of that imbalance the ebbing of foreign capital inflows by private investors is most likely due to some reduced attrac tiveness of the american ec onomy as destination for investment in the wake of recession slow economic rec overy low interest rates corporate malfeasance and war of more enduring significance for the path of the dollar and the trade deficit is the now large share of dollar assets in the investment portfolios of foreign investors causing those investors to prudently seek to increase the diversity of their portfolios by moving away form dollar assets while further depreciation of the dollar is expected in the nearterm the intensity and duration of this trend is problematic also weigh the prospect of accelerating economic growth in the united states weak growth abroad continuing large official purchases of dollar assets and the interest raising effect large federa l budget deficits will tend to raise the relative rate of return on dollar ssets boost their attrac tiveness to foreign investors and exert upward pr essure on the dollar and tend to widen the trade deficit what is certain however is that so long as domestic saving in the united states falls short of domestic investme nt and an inflow of foreign saving is available to fill all or part of the gap the united states w ill run trade deficit of commensurate size the benefits and costs of foreign debt trade deficit is not necessarily unde sirable increasing current spending

whether used for investment or consumption such borrowing and lending between nations is intertemporal trade these are exchanges of current goods for claims on future goods and can also be seen as type of gain from trade if there are differences in the valuation of current versus future consumpti on between countries then gains from trade are possible the borrower gains by being able to consume now beyond what his or her current income allows the lender gains by being able to consume more in some future period international capital flows are thus facilitating more efficient use of global saving and more optimal pattern of spending over time some see the current pattern of intertemporal trade as troublesome because it is flow of capital saving from poor developing economies to much richer us economy the opportunities for investment would be expect to be higher in the capital poor developing economies and the need for saving higher in the united sates with its rapidly aging labor force and ther efore for capital to flow form the us to the developing economies for further discussion of this typical pattern of international borrowing and lending see ben s bernanke speech the

productiv possibilities and is boon to economic growth and longterm economic welfare of course borrowing carries cost as the lender at least demands that interest be paid on the borrowings this debt service cost is burden the borrower must carry tomorrow for living beyond his or her means today persons judgement about the desirability or unde sirability of the trade defi cit may hinge on the benefits gained from that added spending relative to the debt service burden that is also incurred that decision may depend on how the foreign borrowing is used if used to finance investment that raises pr oductive capacity the economys future output may increase by an amount suffi cient to meet debt service costs and also add to the output available for domestic uses if used to finance public or private consumption there will be enhancement of productive cap acity and meeting fu ture debt service costs must come at the expense of future living standards38 through the end of 2004 the united states net accumulation of foreign obligations ie the value of us assets abroad minus the value of foreign assets in the united states is about 25 trillion this net indebtedness w ill continue to grow so long as there is net inflow of fore ign funds caused by the shortfall of domestic saving relative to domestic investment39 the current debt service burden of americas stock of foreign debt can be roughly judged from changes in the net investment income component of the cu rrent account balance which tallies income earned from us foreign investments in foreign assets against us payments to foreigners for their investments in us assets in 2005 the surplus in the us investment income account declined to 15 billion from 304 billion in 2004 the investment income balance is tally of what us foreign investments earn against what foreign investments in the us earn this erosion was generally consistent with the rapid growth of foreign assets in the united states relative to the stock of us assets in the rest of the world since 1998 the surplus in investment income has exhibited general rising trend despite the continued growth of us nethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs22 40 on the

2003 and fell to 304 billion in 2004 the persistence of the us investment income surplus most likely reflects the interplay of several forces first us investments abroad on average earn higher return then do foreign investments in the united states this differential is thought to result from high er incidence of mature high yielding assets in the us investment portfolio gr eater risk exposure and the special status of the dollar as the worlds reserve curre ncy of choice second the sharp fall of interest rates has translated into fall in the rate of return as large portions of us debt is repeatedly rolledover thir d in the period 2002 to 2004 falling dollar particularly against the euro leads to rise in the foreign currency value of us foreign assets and the associated earnings in the long run it seems likely that th united states large stock of foreign indebtedness will come to dominate movement of the investment income balance and lead to steadily larger deficits in this balance the investment income deficits of the recent past have been very moderate in size however this payment could easily grow to 100 billion or more in the near future this is far from insolvency but net outflow of resources to foreigners of that size would be significant decrement to the annual rate of advance of th nations living standard and decrement that can get larger some observers maintain that it is burden that needs to be curtailed dependence on foreign capital often ra ises concerns about economic and financial instability that could be associated with these often volatile asset flows sharp retreat from dollar assets by foreign investors could send such sizable shock to the united states and other industria l economies that might induce recession here and abroad there are good reasons to doubt that sharp damaging turnaround in foreign capital flows is likely40 however recent experience with the panic of foreign investors such as the asian financial crisis of th late 1990s has shown that such behavior most often results from the growing likelihood that in the face of weak economic growth and dwindling foreign exchange reserves creditors would not be repai d that debt service payments were doubtful this occurred when countrys that had borrowed substantial amounts abroad that was denominated in foreign currencies found the rising value of those currencies relative to the home currency made it doubtful that they could continue to pay debt service these are not risk factors that have much relevance to the circumstances of the united states wh ich has strong growth and does not fix its exchange rate and is able to borrow abroad in its own currency in addition large proportion of foreign investme nts made in the united stat have been longterm in nature and not particularly prone to quick changes in commitment it is very likely that many foreign i nvestors generally see the us economy as bastion of longrun economic strength and will continue to invest for longterm gain further since the dollar is the worlds reserve currency of choice the ongoing demand for liquidity and store of value th at the dollar serves undergirds the desirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs23 41 see crs report rl30873 saving in the united states how has it changed and why is it important by brian cashell and gail makinen to hold dollar assets particularly shortterm assets such as treasury bills that function essentially as an international currency another possible cost of large persistent trade deficits is that they are very likely to lead to more calls for costly protection from foreign competition economic analysis indicates that since such measures have effect on the macroeconomic factors that cause trade deficit they will not reduce it reducing the trade deficit the mechanics of the savinginvestment relationship in an internationally open economy such as the united states suggests th at there are essentially three ways the trade gap can be reduced one the rate of domestic investment falls two the level of domestic saving rises or three some combination of one and two occurs macroeconomic policy the use of monetary and fiscal policy tools can in theory effect changes in these variables monetary policy by raising domestic interest rates and braking economic activity can lower the rate of domestic investment and likely narrow the trade deficit it is also possible that the adjustment to smaller current account deficit would be in itiated by reduction in pref erence of dollar assets by foreign investors diminished inflow of foreign capital absent any increase in domestic saving would tend to increase domestic interest rates and force so as to force reduction of domestic investment consistent with the smaller inflow of foreign capital and overall savi nginvestment balance at the extreme recession would likely dramatically reduce the trade deficit as it did in 2001 because of its negative effects on economic growth decreas ing the rate of domestic investment is not generally considered the most desira ble economic course to follow however the second course to smaller trade defi cit raising the dom estic saving rate while having considerable economic merit is very problematic goal for macroeconomic policy as explained above fiscal decisions on taxing and spending influence the deficit or surplus position of the federal budget and the rate of public saving as seen in the late 1990s rise in the us overall saving rate as consequence of rising public saving ra stemmed from the sharp swing of the federal budget from deficit to surplu s of in 2000 but budget deficits have returned and the government saving rate has fallen accordingly given the political nature of budget deliberations it seems ve ry problematic whether the federal budget can be an exploitable policy tool for reducing the trade deficit can macroeconomic policy lift the low private saving rate proposals have been made to use the tax code to raise in centives for saving by households careful analysis reveals that such proposals most often have uncertain effects on the saving investment balance as they tend to raise both saving and investme nt or merely shift saving from source to another with net gain41 other proposals such as individual retirement accounts may just redistribute sa ving raising the hous ehold rate little but lowering the public rate by an offsetting amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs24 42 for example see nora lustig ba rry bosworth and robert lawrence assessing the impact of north

s to help shift the locus of economic growth from net exports toward domestic demand and also tend to reduce the outflow of saving from these economies into the us economy if such policies are concurrent with us policies to raise domestic saving smaller trade deficit can occur without reduction in dom estic investment in the united states otherwise smaller inflow of foreign capital will induce reduction in the trade deficit by forcing reducti on of domestic investment regardless of the posture of economic policy here and ab road foreign investors can step back from the purchase of dollar asse ts in response to greater rates of return outside of the united states or in an attempt to increase the diversification of their portfolios now overly stocked with dolla r assets such move would decrease capital inflows to the us market and reduce saving available to the united states the trade deficit with time lag would tend to fall but lacking an increase in the rate of domestic saving inte rest rates would rise and th rate of domestic investment would also fall the depreciation of the dollar exchange rate from 2002 to 2004 was in part the consequence of foreign inve stors reducing there purcha ses of dollar assets this pattern was reversed in 2005 however with renewal of strong demand for dollar assets resulting from the interaction of rising shortterm interest rates in the united states and large volume of petroleum ex port earning looking for safe and liquid resting place it seems probable that the behavior of foreign capital inflows to the united states will hinge on balancing of the attractiveness of dollar assets against the risk to foreign investors of holding to large share of dollar assets in their portfolios the outcome of this calculation is subject to large degree of uncertainty but it does seem clear that the pressure for diversification away from dollar assets is rising rapidly conclusion for economists the case for free trade is strong and compelling reduction of impediments to the flow of goods among nations will raise each trading nations economic welfare this conclusion has been repeatedly validated by studies of trade liberalization policies such as the ur uguay round agreement and north american free trade agreement42 however public debate over such initiatives makes very clear that many americans do not share economists optimism about the virtues of free trade some of this antipathy might arise from economic concerns that us workers and industries hurt by trade do not receive quitable compensation and other adjustment assistance allaying this concern some economists argue is best achieved by efforts to augment and refine the various govern ment programs that help to support and retrain workers displaced and hurt by market forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32059crs25 43 the 50 states of course have the sa labor and environmental standards others may simply doubt that trade is beneficial if unconvinced by the various technical studies they might consider that the united states itself gives clear evidence of the virtue of free trade th is country comprises 50 separate political entities that under the constitution are re quired to allow unfettered trade among themselves specialization has occurred interstate trade s grown and national economic welfare has benefitted43 certainly us economic welfare would be reduced if barriers to interstate trade were erected economists view the benefits of interstate trade as of the same nature as th benefit of international trade in policy deliberations of course national economic welfare will be considered in conjunction with political social and national defense issues that will also influence trade policy
