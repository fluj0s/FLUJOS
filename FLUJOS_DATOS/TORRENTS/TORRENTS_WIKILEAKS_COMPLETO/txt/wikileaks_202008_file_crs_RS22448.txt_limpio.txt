109171 authorized new optional benefit that allows states to cover limited hcbs without waivers the requirements of this new optional benefit section 1915i of ssa differ from other medicaid state plan benefits eg home health and personal care and the section 1915c hcbswaivers table 2 compares key features of the new hcbs benefit with existing medicaid program authorities section 1915i authorizes states to offer hcbs without waiver beginning in january 2007 states can define beneficiaries needs and do not have to require that beneficiaries meet institutional levels of care to qualify for services also under 1915i states may amend their medicaid plans without demonstrating budget neutrality as they do under 1915c waivers section 1915i permits states to offer fewer hcbs services than are permitted under 1915c waivers and to restrict eligibility to beneficiaries whose incomes fall below 150 of fpl states also may offer selfdirection under the 1915i option and may cap enrollment cms is developing regulations to guide states that want to offer hcbs under 1915i and plans to issue notice of proposed rule making in early 2008 cms also conducted training on the new state plan option for its regional office staff and for states medicaid staff as well as drafting state plan amendment spa preprint6 four states have 6 the optional 1915i spa preprint is available through cmss regional offices in addition to offering guidance to states on issues to be addressed in hcbsspas cmss preprint also identifies quality monitoring and other reporting assurances required of states crs4 submitted spas to provide hcbs services as permanent medicaid benefits7 three hcbsspas are under review by cms iowa was the first state to submit hcbsspa and was approved in april 2007 to provide hcbs services to 3700 seriously mentally ill beneficiaries in the first year and 4500 beneficiaries by year five8 state utilization of the 1915i option may lag behind expectations created by the recent rapid growth of hcbs waivers and program cost estimates9 data on states plans for adopting the 1915i hcbs option are limited but an october 2007 survey of states on their ltc plans indicates that two states planned to submit hcbsspas while 16 other states and territory guam were considering the option10 the remainder of this section discusses issues that could affect states utilization of the section 1915i option under 1915c waivers states may use higher income standards for determining beneficiaries eligibility for services than income standards under 1915i up to 300 of ssi for 1915c versus 150 of the federal poverty level fpl for 1915i11 the more restrictive income eligibility standards under 1915i limits states from converting beneficiaries in existing 1915c waivers to 1915ispas because many states permit beneficiaries to have higher incomes than 150 of the fpl in 1915c waivers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22448 in addition to more restrictive eligibility standards 1915i is limited to covering only services described in section 1915c paragraph 4b12 the 1915i spa option prevents states from adding other services requested by states on casebycase basis as permitted under 1915c waivers under 1915c waivers states have used the other services clause to address the needs of specific beneficiary groups for example hcbs waivers have been used to expand services to include transportation apartment deposits and even home modifications necessary for community living under 1915c waivers states may define eligibility based on diseases or conditions such as brain injury or hivaids or geographic area such as city or county under 1915i however states must create different ways to measure qualification for services that rely on individuals needs for service under hcbswaivers medicaid may use common medical measures such as diagnoses but assessing individuals support needs using activities of daily living can be more difficult to measure for some populations 7
