electronic system that would link the various stock markets exchanges market makers and alternative systems in an attempt to correct some of the problems that have emerged because of the proliferation of trading venues in recent years as envisioned by some clob could allow the centralized display of investors offers to trade stocks which are listed on various stock exchanges clobs also tends to be conceptualized as an order display device that would allow those who first submit stock trade to receive execution priority over similar but subsequent orders clob detractors however say that it could impede innovation and subject us stock markets to systemic risk in the summer of 2000 the sec abandoned the idea of imposing clob background the idea of central limit order book clob has been around the since the 1970s when the securities and exchange commission sec broached the idea and met opposition from stock exchanges but there are some new concerns over the issue of market fragmentation and the idea of clob is receiving renewed interest as possible antidote to it consider this illustration stock that you like is offered on your screen for 2025 you dont want to pay that so you give your discount broker an order to buy 500 shares at 20125 your bid pops up on the screen its now the highest in the market and you figure its only matter of time then you see 500 shares trade at 20125 then another at the same price and another still you dont get any stock then your broker buys 200 shares from another investor paying 201875 smidgeon above your bid the stock rallies and your broker unloads the shares he bought frustrated you cancel your first order and enter another with preset limit five seconds later your broker confirms youhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20631crs2 1 taken from ip

brokerdealer is firm that in its capacity as broker brings the buyers and sellers of securities together and which in its dealer capacity buys securities for and sells securities from its own portfolio the term brokerdealer is often synonymous with brokerage firm and brokerbought 500 shares at 20375 you paid 125 more than you expected but at least you paid just 10 in commission 1 what happened many students of the markets consider that this not uncommon scenario is basically byproduct of the isolated or fragmented relationship among the various market centers that execute trades for stocks listed on the new york stock exchange nyse or for stocks that are traded through the computer screenlinked nasdaq or that are traded through the growing electronic communications networks also known as alternative trading systems ats at present how your shares are traded depends on what stock you want and through whom you purchase them for any of the 5000 stocks listed on the nasdaq your broker could send your order 1 to market maker who will fill your order using his own capital or inventory called trading against 2 to any of nine ats which will provide totally automated order matching primarily for limit orders2 or 3 to the trading desk of the same brokerdealer to whom you submitted your order called internalization for nyselisted stock your broker can forward your order 1 to the single specialist on the nyse floor who will make your trade by matching your order with another 2 to market makers on one of the five regional exchanges3 or 3 to one of the nasdaq market makers who also trade in nyselisted stocks the third market while there are some links among these market alternatives that allow them to share information on the best prices available to stock investors the dispersion of market centers may cause some retail limit orders to be isolated perhaps resulting in orders not being executed for investors there is clear opportunity cost from losing an order should it happen often enough investors may become less willing to submit price improving orders fragmentation may also undermine efficiency by constricting order interaction limiting stock price competition and constraining the pricediscovery process through which large numbers of buyers and sellers in particular securities tend to converge toward optimal share prices fragmentation does not present only problems however many securities industry observers regard the notion of market fragmentation as just another way of characterizing the beneficial widening of competition in us securities markets for the surging volumes of retail order flow particularly in nasdaqlisted stocks by various accounts the rise in the number of market centers competing for trade execution order flow has helped produce significant reduction in what retail investors pay to their brokerdealers4 moreover ats give retail customers the benefit of unprecedentedly cheap and fast stockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20631crs3 5 for example some traders may place premium on fast execution while others place premium on the trading venues ability to improve on the prevailing stock price

1999 p a12 10 as noted previously the regional exchanges are the cincinnati the pacific the philadelphia the boston and the chicagotrade executions it has also been argued that the existence of multiple venues that compete for investor order flow means that individual investor desires for varying kinds of trades can be more fully met5 some observers also contend that competition for investor order flow which is the very basis of the fragmentation tends to foster innovation in trading technologies as trading venues seek competitive edge congressional interest the senate banking and the house commerce committees held number of oversight hearings during the fall of 1999 and the winter and spring of 2000 that touched on fragmentationrelated issues senator gramm chairman of the senate banking committ ee has indicated his concern that centralized market facility like clob might curb innovation and limit newly competing entrants6 but banking committee member senator charles schumer has appeared to be more supportive of proposal like clob noting that weve had situations before where there isnt openness which fragmentation inveighs against unles s there are some changes smaller investors particularly can be taken advantage of in little corners of the world7 recent developments for years the sec has observed that market fragmentation confers both benefits and costs on investors and markets as recently as 1994 when the principal focus was fragmentation in the market for nyselisted stocks the sec concluded that market fragmentation conferred net benefits8 however recent developments have led the agency to reassess the issue key developments giving impetus to this reexamination include the rise in the number of ats to nine and the decision by the nyse to rescind rule 390 with certain exceptions rule 390 had barred the 23 of nyselisted stocks accounting for about 46 of its trading volume9 that were listed prior to april 26 1979 from being traded outside of the nyse or the five regional exchanges10 the sec observed that the rescission of rule 390 appear ed to open the door to greater potential market fragmentation in nyselisted stocks it reasoned that trading venues like ats and brokerdealers through internalization might exploit the new trading opportunities thus further fragmenting the market in nyselisted stocks in february 2000 the sec issued public policy think piece known as concept release on the topic of market fragmentation in addition to soliciting public comment on varioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20631crs4 11 selfregulatory organizations notice of filing of proposed rule change by the new york stock exchange inc to rescind exchange rule 390 commission request for comment on issues relating to market fragmentation sec concept release february 23 2000 12 additional questions concerning the clob design would include would it also display market orders would it also be used for automatic order execution as well as order display and would it only display the best dealer orders or would it have greater depth of display 13 the separate order display linkages that exist between the dealers in nasdaq stock and the dealers in nyselisted stocks provide each set of dealers with continual information on the prevailing best bid and best offer for the various stocks 14 the same scenario applies to the intermarket trading protocol between the various market centers in nyselisted stock the nyse itself market makers on the five regional exchanges and various dealers in the third market nasdaq dealers who also trade nyselisted stock questions concerning the costs and benefits of fragmentation the release also requested input on several policy options being considered for mitigating some of fragmentations potentially less desirable aspects11 the clob was by far the most sweeping controversial and commentedupon policy option posed the sec version would create linked system to provide market centers with displays that show pending limit orders from all the various market centers in stocks listed on the different exchanges the initial and primary interest would be in stocks listed on the nyse and the nasdaq this consolidated multiple exchange display system would constitute the central aspect of the central limit order book and would stand in contrast to the current convention in which the systems that disseminate and display market orders and limit orders for stocks listed on the nasdaq and the nyse to their respective traders are totally separate12 the other key attribute of the clob is that it would have trading protocol known as pricetime priority under pricetime priority trading priority would be assured the first trader who improves on the best displayed bid offer to buy or offer offer to sell for given stock the first party to improve on the best prevailing stock price offer would then be first in line to trade with anyone in other words the investor in the illustration cited on page 1 would not be stranded at present there is different kind of trading protocol suppose an investors limit order for nasdaqlisted stock is initially received and displayed by one of on average 12 independent dealers who trade in that particular stock13 if the investors limit order establishes new best price all of the dealers who trade in the stock must honor that price but those other dealers do not have to trade with the investors order instead they are permitted to match the investors price using the price as basis for subsequent trades with their own investor order flow until the emergenc of new best bid or best offer price under pricetime priority which clob makes possible and could enforce dealer b could longer match the price of dealer as investor order that had established the best prevailing bid or offer price if dealer b wants that price b must trade directly with the investors order14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20631crs5 potential advantages of clob clob could address number of concerns that various observers have had with the stock trading status quo for some trades the major cost of placing limit order is the opportunity cost of not havin g the trade executed limit orders may not receive execution for number of reasons including lack of realism on the part of the investor the presence of highly volatile market in the stock or breakdowns or delays in the trading infrastructure there are however additional concerns over the role that the lack of pricetime priority may have in isolating some of the orders that establish new best prices as we described earlier the orders may simply go unexecuted when dealers in other market centers match their prices but do not interact with them and generally the more active an investor is the more important clob might be in helping to reduce the costs associated with isolated and unexecuted orders sec officials among others have raised number of issues in this regard one concern is that unexecuted limit orders may discourage investors from future market enhancing offers to improve on prevailing stock prices there are additional concerns over the fairness of other dealers free riding on prices that they did not establish clob could remedy these in addition because it would provide consolidated display of limit orders for both nyselisted and nasdaqlisted stocks clob could help lower search costs for traders who trade in both markets number of observers have also voiced some concerns about the vulnerability in the event of market crisis of the smaller and more isolated fragmented pools to illiquidity good argument could be made that clobs centralized order flow would provide the markets with what some analysts call macroliquidity centr alized deep pocket of liquidity that would be better able to withstand any drying up of market liquidity during times of severe market stress key criticisms of clob clob detractors make three main arguments again st creating such structure part from the critical questions of how such system would be designed administered regulated and who and how it would be financed the systems that currently link various parts of the markets are indus try financed and selfregulated with sec oversight by organized consortiums composed of representatives from the linked trading venues the three main criticisms are 1 that clob is inherently anticompetitive and would harm innovation 2 that it would probably commodify investors stock orders see below and 3 that it is unnecessary because market fragmentation will decline over time even without it many think that clob would have the effect of discouraging market centers from activel competing for investor order flow this could occur because under clob market centers would lose control over their ability to make profit by trading with the orders that may be initially routed to them orders would be immediately routed to the clobs centralized display where they could be picked off traded with by any market center as consequence market centers could lose some motivation to compete for order flow and be less driven to innovate new technologies in competition for that flowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20631crs6 15 for example see the battle for efficient markets the economist june 17 2000 p6 16 testimony of alan greenspan before the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs april 13 2000the second concern is attendant to the first that clob would thereby commodify investor order flow leading to elimination of the valuable array of unique and differentiated investordealer relationships and networks the third concern is related to the notion of systemic risk because clob would provide for single point of interaction for stock orders system disruptions or its outright failure could pose serious overall problems for the markets thus imposing clob rather than letting markets develop their own organization is neither necessary nor particularly effective and there is widelyheld perception that over time investors will want to trade where there is an abundance of other trades once market center attracts certain critical mass of liquidity it is inclined to attract even more trading volume15 in other words market centers may have certain scale economies in stock order flow if true over time this would imply natural tendency toward greater consolidation it is this kind of reason ing that has led some observers such as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to reject the need for clob16 major market participants and clob entities who are actively involved in the trading of stocks andor the execution of stock orders have generally questioned the need for clob included among these critics are various ats various nasdaq dealers the brokerage firm of charles schwab heavily involved in trading via internalized orders some online brokerages some of whom internalize some of their order flow the national association of securities dealers nasd the parent company of the nasdaq the nyse and some regional exchanges which trade nyselisted stock at minimum clob with pricetime priority could make their or their members revenue flows from order execution andor actual stock trading less certain and more unstable the most visible advocates of clob have largely come from the ranks of traditional wall street brokerage firms earlier this year five large brokerages abn amro north america inc edward jones goldman sachs co merrill lynch co and morgan stanley dean witter signed white paper asking the sec to support clob with pricetime priority subsequently couple of these firms appear to have softened their stances on the position not unreasonable argument could be made that clob might particularly benefit large traditional wall street brokerage firms with comparatively large trading desks large trading capacities could provide them with greater capability to pick off orders displayed on clob number of the wall street firms champion clob with an exemption for block trades the institutional investor trades of 10000 shares or more which are generally handled outside normal trading systems now and in which these firms are actively involved nyse officials among others say that this would result in bifurcated and discriminatory stock market in late july 2000 the sec announced that it had rejected the idea of clob and instead was proposing much less controversial greater disclosure requirements by brokerage firms and equity market centers concerning their order routing practices and execution quality
