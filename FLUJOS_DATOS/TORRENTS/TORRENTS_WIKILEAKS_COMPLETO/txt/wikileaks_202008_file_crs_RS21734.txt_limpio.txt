will vote on motion to report the nomination favorably however the committee could also vote on motion to report without recommendation to report unfavorably or to table the nomination if the

bearden this report will be updated as events warrant crs2 although the senate has confirmed most of the thousands of us circuit court and district court nominations submitted to it some nominations do not receive senate confirmation1 neither the judiciary committee nor the full senate is compelled to act on the nomination and nominations that receive action are eventually returned to the president once the president submits judicial nomination to the senate it almost invariably is referred to the judiciary committee2 the committee may then hold hearing on the nomination after the hearing the committee has four basic options it may report the nomination to the senate favorably unfavorably or without recommendation or it may choose to take action at all3 typically if the committee votes on the nomination it votes to report favorably however in small number of cases the committee has voted to report the nomination either unfavorably or without recommendation if majority of the committee agrees to any one of the motions to report the nomination moves to the full senate the nomination fails to be reported on tie vote by contrast the nomination remains in committee if the committee votes against reporting if there is committee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21734 vote on the nomination or if the committee votes to table the nomination once nomination is reported to the senate by the judiciary committee the senate can consider the nomination4 if the senate disapproves the nomination it is returned to the president with resolution of disapproval5 if judicial nomination does not receive senate vote the nomination ultimately will either be withdrawn by the president or 1 this report was originally prepared by mitchel sollenberger analyst in

roberts nominated to be us district court judge for the western district of virginia was the first judicial nominee reported unfavorably by the committee 6 the senate may by unanimous consent hold

senate consideration of presidential nominations p 13 7 the 76th congress was the earliest in which judiciary committee votes could be found in the congressional record or the senate committee on the judiciary legislative calendar 8 see in table 1 the nomination of ronnie white to the us district court for the eastern district of missouri 9 the american congressional dictionary defines senatorial courtesy as the senates practice of declining to confirm presidential nominee for an office in the state of senator of the presidents party unless that senator approves sometimes called the courtesy of the senate the practice is customary one and not always adhered to senator sometimes invokes the custom by declaring that the nominee is personally obnoxious or personally objectionable to him see walter kravitz congressional quarterlys american congressional dictionary washington cq press 2001 p 231 crs4 and rejected by the senate within the 19392007 time period the committee adversely reported roberts in 1939 on the grounds that his nomination was personally offensive to the two virginia senators10 as was the tradition under senatorial courtesy at that time roberts was adversely reported to the senate where he was rejected by vote of 72 to 9 in each of the other five cases before 1951 in which senatorial courtesy was the stated reason for objecting to judicial nomination the opposing senator stated that the nominee was personally obnoxious11 in one instance the nomination was not reported out of committee12 the other four nominations were reported adversely and rejected by voice vote in the senate13 between 1951 and 1978 judicial nominations were reported without recommendation or unfavorably during that time one nomination that of william poff to the us district court for the western district of virginia was laid on the table by the senate judiciary committee based on senatorial courtesy14 since 1978 senators objections to nominations have rested largely on the perceived ideological orientation of judicial nominees the professional qualifications of the nominees or both15 for example daniel manion nominated by president reagan to the seventh circuit court of appeals was criticized for lacking the record of distinction and achievement that was httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21734 expected of appointees to the courts of appeals16 while his supporters argued that opposition to his nomination was based on his conservative views and his activities with his father17 who had cofounded the john birch society arguments made in support of and in opposition to the manion nomination were similar to arguments made about other nominees whose nominations received vote to report other than favorably since 1978 10 national archives and records
