act of 1986 hr 3838 99th congress pl 99514 jcs1087 may 4 1987 pp 2930during the 1970s some policy studies d shown that the proportion of wages replaced by uc benefits on an aftertax basi s was large enough to erode claimants work incentive9 taxation of uc benefits served to reduce the degree of aftertax wage replacement and reduce the work disincentive effect however uc benefits of lower income claimants remained untaxed becau their total income was under the tax threshold ie their standard deduction and personal exemp tions offset their income in 1982 congress lowered the agi thresholds for taxation of uc benefits the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 reduced those thresholds to 12000 for single filers and 18000 for joint filers10 primary motivation of this legislation was to raise revenue but it left in place policy of protecting lower income claimants from taxati on of uc benefits11 congress made uc benefits fully taxable in the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99 514 effective for benefits received af ter december 31 1986 although this action reversed the original policy of taxing uc benefits only above an agi threshold it occurred in the context of law that removed many lowincome filers from the tax rolls lowered the marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers and expanded eligibility for the earned income credit the rationale for full taxation of uc benefits was to treat uc benefits the same as wages and to eliminate the work disincentive caused by favorable tax treatment for uc benefits relative to wages12 concern about claimants cas h flow problems caused by the lack of tax withholding from uc benefits arose during the 19901991 recession pl 102318 required states to inform all new claimants of their responsibility to pay inco tax on uc be nefits and to provide them with information on how to f ile estimated quarterly tax payments in 1994 pl 103465 required states to withhold fede ral income tax from uc benefits if claimant requested withholding and permitted states to withhold state and local income taxes pl 103465 set the fede ral withholding rate at 15 of the gross benefit payment amount the federal withholding rate was ch anged to 10 by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliati on act of 2001 egtrra pl 107 16 effective august 7 2001 legislation in the 110th congress on september 9 2008 the suspension of federal income tax on unemployment benefits act of 2008 hr 6844 mchugh wa s introduced this bill would temporarily suspend the inclusion of uc benefits for federal tax purposes for 2008 and 2009
