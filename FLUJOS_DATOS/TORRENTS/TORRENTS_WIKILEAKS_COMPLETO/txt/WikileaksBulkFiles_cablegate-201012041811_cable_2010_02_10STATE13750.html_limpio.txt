2010 under secretary bill burns and defense under secretary for policy michele flournoy hosted the third usfrance strategic dialogue with counterparts jacques audibert and michel miraillet discussions focused on afghanistan pakistan nato reform missile defense turkey russia iran and the middle east peace process the french indicated an announcement of further civilian contributions to afghanistan would be made at the london conference but hedged on decision regarding additional combat troops on natos new strategic concept the french highlighted the potential for split in the alliance between old and new members and agreed that document that linked to nato reform measures was needed the french requested more information on the us proposal to make missile defense mission for nato both us burns and usdp flournoy underscored that the potential sale of french mistralclass helicopter carrier to russia would be unhelpful in terms of regional stability next steps on iran were discussed with the french agreeing that the european union eu was more unified than ever on the need for increased pressure and welcoming us efforts to engage the eu as whole on this issue end summary afghanistan and pakistan 2 snf us burns praised the french contributions and previewed us goals for the london conference on afghanistan which included agreement on growing the afghan national security forces ansf reintegration and choosing new senior representative for afghanistan usdp reviewed the potus decision and highlighted that july 11 2011 was an inflection point the beginning of process she noted that potus was careful to not create an artificial timeline for transition to afghan responsibility and that the us message to the region is that we are not leaving deputy srap jones described the new us regional stability strategy and our efforts to align karzai with the international communitys civilian priorities 3 snf audibert remarked on frances special commitment to afghanistan based on france leading the invocation of natos article 5 after 911 nine years later the french cite allied unity as the missions principal success france believes the presidents announcement of 30000 more troops substantively changed the operation while the london conference is chance to impress upon afghan president hamid karzai that he must implement the commitments in his inauguration speech the french are concerned it might be too early to put too much political pressure on karzai audibert suggested second international conference on afghanistan in the spring would be helpful and was pleased to hear about plans for an april conference in kabul audibert also stated that france will make an announcement about its civilian surge at the london conference but that commitments on further troop deployments were not ready miraillet lamented french public opposition to the war in afghanistan but believed that the government was making progress in convincing the french people of the necessity for the operation he also explained that the military staff had developed several plans for additional contributions which were now with president sarkozy for action nato strategic concept 4 cnf audibert noted that the strategic concept sc was not redrafting of the washington treaty and should not open troublesome issues such as new missions and redefining article 5 he further emphasized that france wanted to stay as close to the 1999 strategic concept as possible on language state 00013750 002 of 004 relating to nato nuclear issues audibert highlighted the risk of split between old and newer members of the alliance on these questions and advocated for short simple document the french want to use the strategic concept to drive reform at nato he noted that france had submitted several proposals on reform and that france was keen for us support miraillet added that with the dire state of nato financing it was important to stress financial reform even before the drafting of the strategic concept miraillet also warned that secgen rasmussen might put tight grip on drafting the concept and cautioned that turkey would play stronger role in drafting than in 1999 5 cnf usdp asserted that the us has played leading role in the senior officials group sog because of our strong commitment to nato reform on the sc she said it was important that the key allies make their input to the secgen before pen was put to paper further usdp clarified that the us did not believe alliance transformation could happen without financial reform and that it was priority for the us state assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs phil gordon agreed any misperception that the us did not want to link the strategic concept to reform must be corrected osd assistant secretary for international security affairs alexander vershbow added that the new concept must put public face on the alliance and address issues for the future such as article 4 and crisis management capacity he agreed that reform of financing was critical as the current budget crisis evidenced asd vershbow stressed that we must work with the uk to solve the financial crisis at nato and suggested that the idea of zero real growth be put aside audibert was pleased to hear that the us was on the same page as france regarding reform and that this was priority goal for the french side during the strategic dialogue missile defense 6 snf usdp briefed the french on the current state of play regarding worldwide us missile defense plans she noted that the ballistic missile defense review bmdr would soon be submitted to congress and noted the phased adaptive approach paa would be us contribution to nato missile defense project this plan would protect both us forces and interests in europe and our nato allies usdp requested french support for securing nato approval for the active layered theater ballistic missile defense altbmd program to become the command and control c2 backbone of wider european missile defense program usdp stressed that nato approval for the c2 relationship between altbmd and the paa was important as turkey was unlikely to approve participation unless it was part of larger nato enterprise 7 snf miraillet conveyed that france was pleased with the obama administrations swift action on missile defense and welcomed the us development of the paa france shared the us perception of the threat and had ideas on ways it could participate in the usproposed system however miraillet emphasized that france needed more information before the government could endorse natopaa linkage through altbmd and argued that the lisbon summit may be too early for nato decision he said that france wanted information on phases three and four of the paa and whether the sm3 block 2b could be perceived as threat by the russians audibert added that france needed much more detail on the potential costs to nato allies before endorsing altbmd as the c2 for the european missile defense system he also asked how the c2 relationships in the system would work in nato context audibert concluded by underscoring that french hesitation on accepting nato role for europeanwide missile defense is not reluctance but reflection of the need for greater clarity on what was being proposed 8 snf in response usdp flournoy said we would soon share additional details on c2 arrangements noting that authorities would need to be delegated given the short decision time for response she and asd vershbow pressed the importance of political decision at lisbon to adopt territorial missile defense as nato mission both to secure turkish agreement to host the forwardbased radar and to demonstrate that nato was addressing real article 5 threats state 00013750 003 of 004 turkey 9 snf miraillet and audibert were remarkably downbeat on turkey and lamented poor french bilateral relations with turkish leadership though they believed ties were slowly improving miraillet believed the military leaders were longer what they once were as the recent ergenekon scandal had weakened the influence of the generals in turkish politics miraillet asserted that fm ahmet davutoglu had kept with his theory of strategic depth which he had described in his previously published books through turkeys continued engagement with neighbors like syria and iran and in turkeys proactive approach to the caucasus and recognition of the iraqi kurds miraillet in noting that the turkish military had of late established better relationship with the pakistani military stated that turkey was nuclear threshold country and that france did not know if there were similar civilian nuclear cooperation linkages with pakistan in highlighting turkeys unwillingness to engage in combat in afghanistan its improved relationships with syria and hamas its willingness to negotiate with iran outside the p5plus1 process and its position on selecting new nato secretary general at the april 2009 strasbourg summit miraillet summed up that turkey was becoming more of global actor but not always positive actor in the international system 10 snf usdp asked whether the eu was closer to identifying way that it could signal to turkey that the door was open to closer relationship such as observer status in the european defense agency audibert noted that president sarkozy had been particularly upset with the turkish position on rasmussen at strasbourg and that sarkozys objection to turkish membership in the eu was one of five pillars on his political campaign that the public still remembered further when france tried to move forward with closer natoeu ties during its 2008 eu presidency turkey rejected every plan that was put on the table for these reasons it would be difficult for france to see any opening on eu membership for turkey in the near future all french interlocutors agreed that more arrogant turkey could present problem during nato strategic concept discussions this year in response flournoy vershbow and gordon reiterated that by closing the door on the turks the eu was creating vicious circle that fueled turkish obstructionism at nato russia 11 snf audibert began by stating that france was taking pragmatic approach to russia but that president sarkozy had problem of confidence and did not fully trust russia audibert said russias two treaty proposals on new european security architecture were unacceptable and mere provocations but that the french position was to use the proposals to engage the russians on new approaches to crisis management the conventional forces in europe cfe treaty and on the adoption of the open skiesverification measures however he noted these issues will continually be bogged down over the situation in georgia which audibert saw as intractable as russia will never derecognize the sovereignty of abkhazia and south ossetia while also never recognizing georgian sovereignty over its territory including the two enclaves 12 snf audibert noting he was raising his ifraised point brought up the issue of frances potential sale of helicopter carrier mistralclass ship to russia he asserted that the french had merely agreed to negotiate with russia on the potential sale but then argued that sale would be only for the ship without armament systems audibert also said that while france understood us concerns over the potential for russia to use the ship for projection of power it was important to note that any decision on the issue would in the end be political in nature miraillet stated that this sale would be gesture of good will to russia as france assessed the russian navy was in dire condition in any case concluded miraillet if france did not make the sale the netherlands and spain would likely sell similar technology 13 snf on mistral usdp observed the optics and policy behind the sale were perplexing as it would fly in the face state 00013750 004 of 004 of president sarkozys personal engagement on resolving the georgia crisis in 2008 she asserted that this sale would send confusing political signal to russia as well as to other europeans us burns concurred with usdp noting the sale would feed georgias fears and could lead to an arms race increasing the chance of miscalculation by one or both sides usdp concluded that while we understood that france wanted to actively engage russia the us would prefer that france find different confidencebuilding measure than mistral sale iran 14 snf us burns stated that the international community had reached point where it had to begin looking for further consequences for iran as the credibility of our efforts was at stake us burns noted that other actors were watching western actions on iran he cautioned that moving china toward greater sanctions would not be easy but that we need to continue engaging them 15 snf audibert noted that france was using every means possible to bring the eu together on iran he noted recently eu council decision to task foreign ministers with developing new ideas on the way forward with iran briens stated that since the iranian regime cracked down following the june 2009 elections the eu was more solid as block on sanctions in particular spain and sweden who were reluctant to support sanctions in the past were more supportive because of recent gross human rights violations middle east peace process 16 snf audibert hailed us efforts to reestablish peace talks between israel and the palestinians he asked pointedly where the us saw the process in the next six months and how to further involve europe especially regarding possible settlement notably the french did not advocate for middle east summit in paris 17 u participants united states department of state william burns under
