enacted in 1975 as federalstatelocal partnership to help strengthen families by securing financial support from noncustodial parents the cse program serves both welfare and nonwelfare families all 50 states and the four jurisdictions of the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs in fy2006 the cse program collected 239 billion in child support payments and served 158 million child support cases in fy2006 cse program expenditures amounted to 56 billion the cse program is funded with both state and federal dollars the federal government bears the majority of cse program expenditures and provides incentive payments to the states for success in meeting cse program goals pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 replaced the old incentive payment system to states with revised system that provides incentive payments based on percentage of the states cse collections and incorporates five performance measures related to establishment of paternity and child support orders collections of current and pastdue support payments and costeffectiveness pl 105200 set specific annual caps on total federal incentive payments and required states to reinvest incentive payments back into the cse program the exact amount of states incentive payment depends on its level of performance or the rate of improvement over the previous year when compared with other states in addition states are required to meet data quality standards if stat do not meet specified performance measures and data quality standards they face federal financial penalties pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 prohibited federal matching effective october 1 2007 of state expenditure of federal cse incentive payments this means that cse incentive payments that are received by states can l onger be used to draw down federal funds the repeal of federal reimbursement for incentive payments reinvested in the cse program has garnered much concern over its fiscal impact on the states and has renewed interest in the incentive payment system per this report describes the current cse incentive payment system explains how state incentive

support enforcement cse programs enactment in 1975 the federal government has paid incentives monetary payments to states to encourage them to operate efficient and effective cse programs1 the incentive payment system is part of the cse programs strategic plan that rewards states for working to achieve the goals and objectives of the program incentive payments although small when compared to federal reimbursement payments for state and local cse activities are very important component of the cse financing structure together with the incentive payment system is penalty system that imposes financial penalties on states that fail to meet certain performance levels the purpose of the two complementary systems is to reward states for results while holding them accountable for poor performance thereby motivating states to focus their efforts on providing vital cse services pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 enacted july 16 1998 replaced the old incentive payment system to states 2 with revised revenueneutral with respect to the federal government incentive payment system that 1 provided incentive payments based on percentage of the states cse collections 2 incorporated five performance measures related to establishment of paternity and child support orders collections of current and pastdue child support payments and costeffectiveness 3 phased in the incentive system with it being fully effective beginning in fy2002 4 required reinvestment of incentive payments into the cse program and 5 used an incentive payment formula weighted in favor of temporary assistance for needy families tanf and former tanf families pl 105200 stipulated that the revised incentive payment system had to be revenueneutral with respect to the federal government which resulted in an annual cap on incentive payments congress capped incentive payments by legislating the total amount of incentive payments that states in aggregate could earn in each fiscal year federal law stipulates that the aggregate incentive payment to the states can not exceed the following amounts 422 million for fy2000 429 million for fy2001 450 million for fy2002 461 million for fy2003 454 million for fy2004 446 million for fy2005 458 milli on for fy2006 471 million for fy2007 and 483 million for fy2008 for years after fy2008 the aggregate incentive payment to the states is to be increased to account for inflation congress based the capped aggregate incentive 1 the 1975 enacting legislation pl 93647 based incentive payments solely on child support collections made on behalf of welfare ie aid to families with dependent children afdc families in 1984 pursuant to pl 98378 the law expanded the incentive payments formula to include child support collections made on behalf of nonwelfare families for legislative history of cse incentive payments see appendix also note that the afdc entitlement program was replaced by the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant pursuant to pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law 2 under the old incentive payment system each state received minimum incentive payment equal to at least 6 of the states total amount of child support collections made on behalf of afdctanf families for the year plus at least 6 of the states total amount of child support collections made on behalf of nonafdctanf families for the year the amount of states incentive payment could r each maximum of 10 of the afdctanf collections plus 10 of the nonafdctanf collections depending on the states ratio of cse collections to cse expenditures there was an additional limit ie cap however on the incentive payment for nonafdctanf collections the incentive payment for such collections could not exceed 115 of incentive payments for afdctanf collections in addition the old incentive payment system incorporated only one performance measure ie costeffectiveness in determining incentive payments to states one of the main criticisms of the old incentive payment system was that it did not provide an incentive for states to improve their programs because every state regardless of performance received the minimum incentive payment there was general agreement by congress that states whose cse programs performed poorly should not be rewarded with federal funds

g344g561payment amount on congressional budget office cbo projections of incentive payments at the time that the child support performance and incentive bill was passed3 pl 105200 also revised the financial penalty system for the cse program to reflect that improved performance is especially critical in three areas paternity establishment child support order establishment and current child support collections if specified performance standards are not met in these three areas financial penalties against the states tanf program are imposed before the beginning of fy2008 the federal government was required to match incentive funds that states reinvested in the cse program pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 prohibits federal matching effective october 1 2007 of state expenditure of federal cse incentive payments this means that cse incentive payments that are received by states and reinvested in the cse program are longer eligible for federal reimbursement so instead of receiving 66 federal matching funds for incentive payments that are reinvested in the cse program the states receive federal matching funds for such incentive payments the repeal of federal matching funds for incentive payments reinvested in the cse program has garnered much concern over its fiscal impact on the states and has renewed interest in the incentive payment system per this report describes the current cse incentive payment system provides information on financial penalties that are imposed on states if incentive payment data are unreliable or if performance standards are not met explains how state incentive payments are derived discusses some of the state trends and presents some policy issues concerning incentive payments in addition the report includes two appendices appendix presents legislative history of cse incentive payments appendix b includes several detailed state tables that display unaudited incentive performance scores for each of the five performance measures 4 table b1 shows incentive payments by state for each of the following yearsfy2002 fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005and the amount that each state received5 table b2 presents cse incentive payments for fy2002 together with unaudited incentive performance scores for each of the five performance measures for fy2002 table b3 presents cse incentive payments for fy2003 together with unaudited incentive performance scores for each of the five performance measures for fy2003 table b4 presents cse incentive payments for fy2004 together with unaudited incentive performance scores for

fy2005 table b6 shows only the unaudited incentive performance scores for fy2006 3 in fy1998 the incentive payment which at that time came out of the gross federal share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families was 395 million beginning in fy2002 child support incentive payments were longer paid out of the federal share of child support collections made on behalf of tanf families instead federal funds have been specifically appropriated out of the us treasury for cse incentive payments 4 the unaudited incentive performance scores are readily available each year when the federal office of child support enforcement ocse publishes its preliminary data report in this report the unaudited scores serve as proxy for the actual audited performance indicator scores upon which actual incentive payments are based ocse does not consistently publish actual audited performance indicator scores 5 ocse has not yet published data on cse incentive payments by state for fy2006

more details see crs report rl33422 analysis of federalstate financing of the child support enforcement program by carmen solomonfears first states spend their own money to operate cse program the level of funding allocated by the state and localities determines the amount of resources available to cse agencies 6 second the federal government reimburses each state 66 of all allowable expenditures on cse activities the federal governments funding is openended in that it pays its percentage of expenditures by matching the amounts spent by state and local governments with upper limit or ceiling the federal governments financial participation in the cse program is the programs largest revenue source third the federal government provides states with an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs federal law requires states to reinvest cse incentive payments back into the cse program or related activities effective october 1 2007 pl 109171 enacted february 8 2006 prohibits federal matching of state expenditures of federal cse incentive payments this means that beginning october 1 2007 cse incentive payments that are received by states and reinvested in the cse program are longer eligible for federal reimbursement fourth states collect child support on behalf of families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf to reimburse themselves and the federal government for the cost of 6 as indicated earlier the federal share of total cse expenditures is 66 this means that the states share of total cse expenditures is 34 the following report found that in aggregate 25 of the states share of cse expenditures is financed with incentive payments ie dollars received from the federal government according to department of health and human services hhscommissioned report while the mix of funding sources for each state is different financing for the state and local share of cse expenditures for the nation as whole comes from state

g346g561tanf cash payments to the family federal law requires families who receive tanf cash assistance to assign their child support rights to the state in order to receive tanf in addition such families must cooperate with the state if necessary to establish paternity and secure child support cse collections on behalf of families receiving tanf cash benefits are used to reimburse state and federal governments for tanf payments made to the family ie child support payments go to the state instead of the family except for amounts that states choose to pass through to the family as additional income that does not affect tanf eligibility or benefit amounts the formula for distributing the child support payments collected by the states on behalf of tanf families between the state and the federal government is still based on the old aid to families with dependent children afdc federalstate reimbursement rates 7 even though the afdc entitlement program was replaced by the tanf block grant program8 under existing law states have the option of giving some all or none of their share of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to the family pursuant to pl 109171 effective october 1 2008 states that choose to pass through some of the collected child support to the tanf family do not have to pay the federal government their shares of such collections if the amount passed through to the family and disregarded by the state does not exceed 100 per month 200 per month for family with two or more children in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family for additional information see crs report rl34105 the financial impact of child support on tanf families simulation for selected states by carmen solomonfears and gene falk fifth application fees and costs recovered from nonwelfare families may help finance the cse program in the case of nonwelfare families the custodial parent can hire private attorney or apply for cse services on their own the cse agency must charge an application fee not to exceed 25 for families not on welfare who apply for cse services the cse agency may charge this fee to the applicant or the noncustodial parent or pay the fee out of state funds in addition state may at its option recover costs in excess of the application fee such recovery may be either from the custodial parent or the noncustodial parent fees and costs recovered from nonwelfare cases must be subtracted from the states total administrative costs before calculating the federal reimbursement amount ie the 66 matching rate moreover effective october 1 2006 pl 109171 requires families that have never been on tanf to pay 25 annual user fee when child support enforcement efforts on their behalf are successful ie at least 500 annually is collected on their behalf the state can collect the user 7 under old afdc law the rate at which states were reimbursed by the federal government for the costs of cash welfare was the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which varies inversely with state per capita income ie poor states have higher federal matching rate wealthy states have lower federal matching rate the fmap ranges from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 83 like the old afdc program current law requires that child support collections made on behalf of welfare ie tanf families be split between the federal and state governments according the fmap if state has 50 fmap the federal government is reimbursed 50 for each 100 in child support collections for tanf families if state has 70 fmap the federal government is reimbursed 70 for each 100 in child support collections for tanf families in the first example the state keeps 50 and in the second example the state keeps 30 thus states with larger fmap keep smaller portion of the child support collections 8 the tanf block grant replaced the afdc entitlement program pursuant to pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law because the cse incentive payments have changed significantly since 1975 when the cse program was enacted this report refers to both afdc familiescases and tanf familiescases depending on the time frame

from the outset incentive payments were provided by the federal government to the states to encourage them to operate effective cse programs pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 was designed to further improve the cse program by linking incentive payments to states performance in five major areas instead of rewarding states only for their programs costeffectiveness the revised incentive payment system was designed to reward states for good performance in five different areas that were closely related to children obtaining child support payments from their noncustodial parent the new system was touted as one that would provide real incentives for the states to improve the cse program help families attain selfsufficiency and support important societal goals like paternity identification and parental responsibility 9 the current cse incentive payment system also adds an element of uncertainty to what used to be somewhat predictable source of income for states although in the aggregate states receive higher incentive payments than under the earlier incentive payment system the total amount available is fixed and individual states have to compete with each other for their share of the capped funds under the revised incentive system whether or not state receives an incentive payment for good performance and the total amount of its incentive payment depends on several factors the total amount of money available in given fiscal year from which to make incentive payments the states success in obtaining collections on behalf of its caseload 10 the states performance in five areas see text box below the reliability of states data and the relative success or failure of other states in making collections and meeting the performance criteria moreover unlike the old incentive system which allowed states and counties to spend incentive payments on whatever they chose the current incentive system requires that the incentive payment be reinvested by the state into either the cse program or some other activity which might lead to improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the cse program eg mediationconflictresolution services to parents parenting classes efforts to improve the earning capacity of noncustodial parents etc further beginning october 1 2007 federal matching funds are not available to increase the value of incentive payments g5g138g149g140g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g21g157g138g157g142g561g5g21g7g561g11g151g140g142g151g157g146g159g142g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 the cse

determine states incentive payment the following computations must be made first each states performance percentage for each performance measure is separately determined and translated into the applicable percentage for that particular performance measure if the performance percentage is at or above the upper threshold the applicable percentage for that performance measure would be 100 if the performance percentage is below the lower threshold the applicable percentage for that performance measure would be 012 if the performance percentage is in between these two points the upper and lower thresholds the applicable percentage is obtained by referring to the tables specified in federal law section 458b6 of the social security act for each of the performance measures for example with regard to the establishment of child support orders if the states performance percentage for this measure is 70 meaning that 70 of cse cases in the state have child support order the applicable percentage is 80 the tables showing all of the applicable percentages for each performance measure are in section 458b6b of the social security act second after the applicable percentage for each performance measure is determined that percentage is multiplied by the collections base for an individual state the collections base is calculated by multiplying child support collections made on behalf of tanf families title ive foster care families and medicaid families in the state by factor of 2 and then adding that amount to the amount of collections made on behalf of families that were never on welfare 2 x tanf collections formerly on tanf collections never on tanf collections 13 third if the performance measure is paternity establishment child support order establishment or current collections then the resulting amount ie the applicable percentage multiplied by the collections base is multiplied by 100 if the performance measure is pastdue collections ie arrearages or costeffectiveness then the resulting amount is multiplied by 75 these calculations result in maximum incentives for each performance measure 12 at the low end of the performance scale there is minimum level below which state is not rewarded with an incentive payment unless the state demonstrates substantial improvement over the prior years performance even though substantial improvement is recognized the law stipulates that the incentive payment in such cases cannot exceed 50 of the maximum incentive possible for that performance measure the substantial improvement provisions do not apply with respect to the costeffectiveness performance measure 13 it was decided during the negotiations on revising the incentive payment system that because collecting child support on behalf of tanf and formertanf families is generally more difficult than collecting child support on behalf of families who had never been on tanf the incentive formula should provide greater emphasis on collection in tanf and former tanf cases moreover it was mentioned that collections in tanf cases provide direct savings to the state and federal governments the incentive payment formula thus doubles the collections made on behalf of tanf and formertanf cases to give them extra emphasis see office of child support enforcement department of health and human services child support enforcement

before enactment of pl 105200 incentive payments under the old system were not dependent on data reliability although audits were performed at least once every three years to ensure compliance with federal cse program requirements the audits were focused on administrative procedures and processes rather than performance outcomes and results under current federal law states are accountable for providing reliable data on timely basis or they receive incentive payments the data reliability provisions were enacted as part of pl 105200 which established the current incentive payment system they are in the law to ensure the integrity of the incentive payment system the federal office of child support enforcement ocse office of audit performs data reliability audits to evaluate the completeness accuracy security and reliability of data reported and produced by state reporting systems the audits help ensure that incentives under the child support performance and incentives act of 1998 pl 105200 are earned and paid only on the basis of verifiable data and that the incentive payments system is fair and equitable if an audit determines that states data are not complete and reliable for given performance measure the state receives zero payments for that measure 15 if states do not meet the data quality standards they do not receive incentive payments and are subject to

then the state retains onefourth of its annual estimate of incentive payments from the federal governments share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families each quarter following the end of

g343g342g561if the corrective action was unsuccessful the financial penalty is reduction in the states tanf block grant historically congress has linked the cse program and the tanf and old afdc program currently section 402a2 of the social security act title iva which deals with tanf and used to pertain to the afdc program stipulates that the governor of state must certify that it will operate an approved cse program as condition of receiving tanf block grant funding since the enactment of the cse program in 1975 there has always been provision in federal law that linked poor performance and penalties or noncompliance in the cse program with reduction in title iva funding under the performancebased audit procedures section 409a8 of the social security act graduated penalty equal to 15 of the federal tanf block grant is assessed against state if 1 on the basis of the data submitted by the state for review the state cse program fails to achieve the paternity establishment or other performance standards set by the hhs secretary 20 2 an audit finds that the state data are incomplete or unreliable or 3 the state failed to substantially comply with one or more cse state plan requirements and the state fails to correct the deficiencies in the fiscal year following the performance year ie the corrective action plan year the penalty amount is calculated as not less than 1 nor more than 2 of the tanf block grant program for the first year of the deficiency the penalty amount increases each year up to 521 for each consecutive year the states data are found to be incomplete unreliable or the states performance on penalty measure fails to attain the specified level of performance according to the cse annual data report for fy2004 in 2004 nine states received penalty after the fy2003 corrective action year for the fy2002 performance period six states filed appeals to the department appeals board22 g21g157g138g157g142g561g22g155g142g151g141g156g561 states share of incentive payments depends on many factors that are distinct to its population and cse caseload cse collection can be straightforward in most cse cases paternity has already been established and in majority of cases the child support order was established at the time of the divorce or separation further many noncustodial parents are uptodate in their child support payments and do not owe any pastdue arrearage payments however in other cases meeting cse performance measures can be more difficult although not exactly sequential the cse performance measures are very interdependent child support order cannot be established if paternity has not been legally determined child support payments cannot be collected or enforced unless child support order has been established arrearage payments cannot be 20 there are three performance measures for which states have to achieve certain levels of performance in order to avoid being penalized for poor performance these measures are 1 paternity establishment specifically mentioned in the federal lawsection 409a8a of the social security act 2 child support order establishment and 3 current child support collections these last two performance measures were designated by the hhs secretary45 cfr section 30540 21 the penalty amount is calculated as not less than 2 nor more than 3 of the tanf block grant program for the second year of the deficiency the penalty amount is calculated as not less than 3 nor more than 5 of the tanf block grant program for the third or subsequent year of the deficiency 22 office of child support

more cases that require services such as paternity establishment child support order establishment and payment of arrearages generally have tougher time collecting child support than states that do not face such challenges in fy2005 the aggregate incentive payment amount was 446 million among the 50 states and the 4 jurisdictions of the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands cse incentive payments in fy2005 ranged from high of 417 million in california to low of 108972 in the virgin islands 23 as mentioned earlier incentive payments are function of states collections base which is largely dependent on population size thus the aggregate amount of incentive dollars received by individual states are poor indicator of states performance with respect to individual performance measures as discussed in more detail later incentive payments are not directly correlated with performance in other words even though state may receive high incentive payment the states performance on one or several individual performance measures may be very poor this results because child support collections are the critical determinant of incentive payments to states in fact the top ten states with regard to collecting child support in fy2002 fy2005 were the top ten states with regard to high incentive payments 24

performance scores these data are readily available each year when ocse publishes its preliminary data report over the years states have made significant improvement in the area of data reliability according to the final report on fy2004 data only fo ur jurisdictions failed data reliability audits comparison of fy2002 performance score data to fy2006 performance score data 25 shows that cse program performance has improved with respect to all five performance measures the following scores represent the total score for all 54 jurisdictions for each of the performance measures referred to in this analysis as national averages the national average for the paternity establishment score went from 73 cse program measure rather than statewide measure in fy2002 to 90 in fy2006 the score for child s upport order establishment increased from 70 to 77 the score for current child support collections increased from 58 to 60 the score for child support arrearage cases increased from 60 to 61 and the costeffectiveness score increased from 413 to 458 if state trends are examined in terms of the median score of the five performance measures rather than the average score the timetrend is similar to the trend in the national averages but the performance of the median state over the fiveyear period tends to be slightly higher than that of the average state with respect to paternity establishment child support order establishment and costeffectiveness with regard to the other two performance measures ie current collections 23 the ocse has not yet published actual incentive payment data by state for fy2006 24 during the fouryear period fy2002fy2005 the states with the highest incentive payments were california texas pennsylvania new york michigan florida new jersey and wisconsin these states also are the most populous states 25 the table for the fy2002 data can be found at httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscsepubs2003reports prelim_datareport the table for the fy2006 data

always been to establish paternity for those needing that service in fact the official title of the program when it was enacted in 1975 and to this day is child support and establishment of paternity the cse programs strategic plan for fy2005fy2009 reiterates this by indicating that goal 1 of the program is that all children have an established parentage and the program tries to achieve this goal by increasing the percentage of children with legal relationship with their parents as mentioned earlier in the cse performance measures text box states have two options for determining the paternity establishment percentage pep they can use pep that is based on data that pertains solely to the cse program or they can use pep that is based on data that pertains to the state population as whole in effect the pep compares paternities established during the fiscal year with the number of nonmarital births during the preceding fiscal year during the period fy2002fy2006 the median pep score among the 54 jurisdictions 28 with cse programs ranged from 8664 in fy2002 to 9411 in fy2006 with slight dip in fy2004 the maximum pep score was 13075 in fy2002 it rose to 19070 in fy2003 and dropped to 12212 in fy2006 pep of 100 or more generally means that the state has established paternity for more than just the newborns who were born outside of marriage in the specified year ie the state has established paternity for many older children as well 29 the minimum pep score fluctuated during the period fy2002 through fy2006 it started at 5083 and ended at 5944 26 the median reflects the performance of the middleranked state with all states weighted equally 27 the median score sometimes better illustrates trends because unlike the mean ie average it is not affected by very high or very low scores 28 according to preliminary fy2002 data guam had the maximum pep score of 45287 but that score for guam was excluded because of conflicting data 29 as mentioned earlier in the text box state may use as its pep either the cse pep or the statewide pep the state cse pep is based on the entire number of children in the cse caseload who had been born outside of marriage regardless of year of birth and whether paternity had been established for them if the cse pep is more than 100 then the number of children on the cse rolls who were born outside of marriage but had paternity established on their behalf exceeded the number of children on the cse rolls who were born outside of marriage in any previous year whereas if the statewide pep is more than 100 then the number of paternities established in the current fiscal year exceeded the number of babies born outside of marriage in the preceding fiscal year

g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 given that the incentive payment is based on five performance measures it is likely that all jurisdictions would continue to receive some amount of incentive payments however if individual performance measures are examined different picture develops some states may not perform well enough to receive an incentive payment with respect to one of the five performance measures table b2 table b3 table b4 and table b5 show actual incentive payments by state includes jurisdictions for each of the four years fy2002fy2005 respectively along with the five performance measures 32 the states in each of the tables are ranked from highest performing state relative to each indicator to lowest performing state these tables illustrate that the relationship between actual performance and cse incentive payments is not always transparent that is even though state may receive high incentive payment the states performance on one or several individual performance measures may be very poor child support collections are very important component in determining the amount of states incentive payment as mentioned earlier incentive payments are function of states collections base which is composed of child support collected on behalf of current and former tanf families multiplied by two plus the collection amount made on behalf of families who have never been on tanf 33 the main reason that there is not more direct relationship between incentive payments and performance levels is that the incentive payment calculation is so heavily dependent on child support collections thus high collections base can mean that state receives high incentive payment despite low performance measures for example although california received the highest incentive payment in each of the years fy2002fy2005 it ranked ve ry low with regard to costeffectiveness 51st in fy2002 50th in fy2003 52nd in fy2004 and 51st in fy2005 current collections 53rd in fy2002 51st in fy2003 52nd in fy2004 and 50th in fy2005 and arrearage cases 40th in fy2002 41st in fy2003 43rd in fy2004 and 37th in fy2005 however because california collected at least 31 more child support payments than the next ranking state and at least 64 32 ocse has not yet published data showing the incentive payments received by states in fy2006 33 states collections base 2 x tanf collections formerly on tanf collections never on tanf collections

the current performancebased incentive payments system is part of the cse programs strategic plan to set goals and measure results despite general consensus that the cse program is doing well questions still arise about whether the program is effectively meeting its mission and concerns exist over whether the program will be able to meet future expectations in light of recent reductions in federal funding that were made pursuant to the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 some in the cse community eg states cse workers analysts state policymakers and advocates contend that several factors may cause state not to receive an incentive payment that is commensurate with its relative performance on individual measures these factors include static or declining cse collections sliding scale performance scores that financially benefit states at the upper end but not the top of the artificial threshold and financially disadvantage states at the lower end of the artificial threshold limited number of performance indicators that do not encompass all of the components critical to successful cse program and statutory maximum on the aggregate amount of incentive payments that can be paid to stateswhich causes states to have to compete with each other for their share of the capped funds others point out that the current cse incentive payment system was developed with much thought and input from the cse community they maintain that the incentive payment formula rewards states for their performance in five critical areas consistent with the legislated mission of the cse program as well as the programs strategic plan and related outcome measures they say that the performance thresholds were designed to provide tough but reachable targets for performance by rewarding states with higher incentives as they improve in addition it is argued that the annual cap on incentive payments imposed by pl 105200 has encouraged competition among the states and that there is evidence that the cap has stifled the motivation of states to improve performance many in the cse community argue that any reduction in the federal governments financial commitment to the cse system could negatively affect states ability to serve families they contend that cost shift to the states during this time when many interests are competing for limited state dollars could jeopardize the effectiveness of the cse program and thereby could 34 california collected 31 more in child support payments than texas in fy2002 in fy2003 california collected 41 more in child support payments than texas in fy2004 california collected 45 more in child support payments than texas and in fy2005 california collected 25 more in child support payments than texas california was the highest ranked state with respect to cse incentive payments in fy2002fy2005 texas was the next ranked state given that the incentive formula gives more weight to child support collections made on behalf of tanf and former tanf families than on families that have never been on tanf it is important to note that the majority of the child support collected in california for the four years illustrated was on behalf of tanf and formertanf families specifically in fy2002fy2005 75 64 71 and 65 respectively of cse collections in california were made on behalf of tanf and formertanf families

several cse directors who were surveyed in the lewin group study said that they expected their states to replace all or most of federal funding shortfalls in the cse program however some of the directors moderated their statements by saying that the prospect of the state replacing eliminated federal dollars with state dollars in years beyond fy2008 is uncertain35 this section discusses the following list of issues 1 does the cse incentive payment system reward good performance 2should incentive payments be based on additional performance indicators 3 should tanf funds be reduced because of poor cse performance 4 why arent the incentives and penalties consistent for the paternity establishment performance measure 5 should incentive payments be based on individual state performance rather than aggregate state performance and 6 will the elimination of the federal match of incentive payments adversely affect cse programs

g18g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g501g561 according to ocse all states received cse incentive payment in fy2006 this means that all states attained certain level of program performance according to ocse for all five performance measures all states36 achieved applicable percentage scores that earned them incentives moreover comparison of fy2002 da ta to fy2006 data shows that cse program performance has improved for all five performance measures the national average for the paternity establishment score increased from 73 cse measure rather than statewide measure in fy2002 to 90 in fy2006 the score for child support order establishment increased from 70 to 77 the score for current child support collections increased from 58 to 60 the score for child support arrearage cases increased from 60 to 61 and the costeffectiveness score increased from 413 to 458 nonetheless many contend that the cse incentive payment systems is too heavily based on child support collections and that artificial thresholds adversely affect performance levels in that they unfairly allow states that are performing at signifi cantly higher levels than other states to be given the same score at the high end of the performance scale and at the low end of the performance scale g5g21g7g561g5g152g149g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 ultimately the amount of states incentive payment depends on how much the state collects in child support payments if state has small amount of child cse collections then even if it has high performance percentages for all five measures its cse incentive payment would be small 35 the lewin group anticipated effects of the deficit reduction act provisions on child support program financing and performance summary of data analysis and ivd director calls

g344g343g561total child support collections for state may vary for number of reasons some factors that may influence the amount of child support state collects include the population of the state the number of single parents in the state the number of children in the state the number of unmarried parents in the state the number of successful paternity determinations the number of successful child support order establishments the size of the tanf caseload the size of the formertanf caseload the number of interstate cases the effectiveness of the states cse program state per capita income state

all of the performance measures have sliding scale so that increased performance earns higher level of the incentive payment however they also all have upper and lower thresholds 37 this means that above certain percentage all percentages are translated into the maximum applicable percentage by the same policy all performance percentages that are below certain threshold percentage are translated into zero ie the state would not be eligible for an incentive payment unless the program improves sufficiently and quickly for performance measures pertaining to the establishment of paternity or the establishment of child support orders if state establishes paternity for at least 80 of its caseload or establishes child support order for at least 80 of its caseload the state receives percentage score of 100 in fy2006 this meant that louisiana state that established paternity for 8107 of the children in the state without legally identified fathers and oklahoma state that established paternity for 12212 38 of the children in the state without legally identified fathers both received paternity establishment percentage score of 100 thus states separated by more than 40 percentage points received the same performance rankingthereby not fully rewarding the performance of the more successful state with regard to the establishment of child support orders in fy2006 south dakota state with an order establishment percentage of 9298 received the maximum possible percentage score of 100 as did california state with child support order establishment percentage of 8057 by the same reasoning the lower threshold of 50 treats states establishing zero paternities and zero child support orders the same as states establishing paternities or child support orders for 49 of their caseload in fy2006 only one jurisdiction the district of columbiaorder establishment 4543 had an applicable percentage score below 50 for either paternity establishment or child support order establishment see appendix table b6 the upper threshold for the current collections performance measure also is 80 but the lower threshold is 40 the performance measure for current child support collections is based on the 37 pl 104193 enacted august 22 1996 the 1996 welfare reform law directed the hhs secretary to develop new revenueneutral performancebased incentive payment system in consultation with state cse directors the federal office of child support enforcement ocse convened an incentive funding work group in late 1996 to develop new incentive payment system the work group consisted of 26 persons representing state and local cse programs hhs regional offices and the ocse central office the work group determined the minimum and maximum standards ie thresholds for each performance measure based on historic performance by the states and state trends in general the upper threshold was based on the view that most states could realistically achieve that level of performance 38 states are able to establish patern ities for more than 100 of children n eeding paternity established because the paternity establishment performance measure compares current year data to previous years data and includes paternity established on behalf of newborns born outside of marriage as well as older children who were born outside of marriage

could not effectively evaluate the performance of the cse program the current cse incentive payment system bases incentives on the states success in achieving number of goals in addition to its ability to provide services in costeffective manner incentive payments are tied to the rates of paternity establishment child support order establishment collection of current child support payments and collection of arrearages pastdue child support payments as well as the amount of child support collected for each dollar spent ie costeffectiveness some in the cse community contend that several other indicators of performance have just as much legitimacy as the five measures that were enacted they include medical child support interstate collections welfare cost avoidance payment processing performance and customer service in contrast according to report on the implementation of the cse incentive payment system many states indicated that the five measures were adequate and that adding new ones would be premature 40 39 states that fail to attain an applicable percentage score of 40 with respect to arrearage collections can still earn an incentive payment if the state improves its

develop performance indicator that would measure the effectiveness of states in establishing and enforcing medical child support obligations supporters maintained that medical child support measure would encourage states to strengthen their efforts to ensure that every child who is eligible for cse services has comprehensive health care coverage but even supporters of the proposal agree that not enough reliable data exist upon which to calculate medical child support measure some supporters have also expressed concern about the benefits of implementing performance measure before states have adequate tools to improve their performance in this area 41 according to the cse justifications of appropriations document for fy2008 ocse is developing two new indicators to measure the extent to which medical child support is ordered and provided in child support cases according to the justifications states have submitted medical support performance measure data for fy2006 and during calendar year 2007 data reliability audits will be conducted on the medical child support data 42 g11g151g157g142g155g156g157g138g157g142g561g5g152g149g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 many cse workers contend that the most difficult child support orders to establish and enforce are interstate cases although states are required to cooperate in interstate child support enforcement problems arise due to the autonomy of local courts family law has traditionally been under the jurisdiction of state and local governments and citizens fall under the jurisdiction of the courts where they live many child support advocates argue that child should not be seriously disadvantaged in obtaining child support just because his or her parents do not live in the same state despite several federal enforcement tools intended to facilitate the establishment and enforcement of interstate collections problems still exist given that about 33 of all cse cases involve more than one state some analysts maintain that performance indicator that would measure whether states were successfully establishing and enforcing interstate child support cases would significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the cse program 43 others acknowledge the importance of interstate collections but argue that states are not yet in position to perform satisfactorily on an interstate performance measure they acknowledge that although interstate collections increased by 39 over the eightyear period fy1998fy2006 from 1032 billion in fy1998 to 1438 billion in fy2006 interstate collections ie child support

to nonwelfare families enrolled in the program thus the cse program imposes personal responsibility on noncustodial parents by requiring them to meet their financial obligations to their children thereby alleviatin g taxpayers of this responsibility these child support payments reduce government spending by providing families with incomes sufficient to make them ineligible for programs such as tanf food stamps and medicaid in fy2004 child support payments enabled 331000 cse families to end their tanf eligibility research has indicated that families go on welfare less often and leave sooner when they receive reliable child support payments in addition federal costs for medicaid food stamps and other meanstested programs decrease when both parents support their children44 although it is difficult to determine how much money might have been spent on various public assistance programs without the collection of child support payments some analysts contend that it would be good public policy to add performance indicator that attempts to measureor at least estimatethe impact of cse collections in reducing or eliminating costs in other public benefitwelfare programs45 other analysts argue that adding performance indicator to measure welfare cost avoidance would only add more complexity to an already complicated incentive payment system

factors when evaluating their state cse program they maintain that legitimate purpose of performance standards in some instances is to set expectations they contend that because the cse program has expanded its mission from welfare cost recovery to include promotion of selfsufficiency and personal responsibility and service delivery it should account for payment processing performance such measure would try to capture whether or not child support payments were accurately accounted whether families were paid in timely manner and whether both custodial and noncustodial parents were

different programs ie cse and tanf47 incentive payments are given to states from federal cse funding and penalties are taken from states tanf funding48 historically congress has linked the cse program and the tanf and old afdc program currently section 402a2 of the social security act title iva which deals with tanf and used to pertain to the afdc program stipulates that the governor of state must certify that it will operate an approved cse program as condition of receiving tanf block grant funding since the enactment of the cse program in 1975 there has always been provision in federal law that linked poor performance and penalties or noncompliance in the cse program with reduction in title iva funding the principle that there are levels of state performance that would merit an incentive payment and there are levels that would warrant penalty was incorporated into the current cse incentive payment system but the law also provides that before penalty is imposed states with lower performance levels may be able to receive some incentive provided their program improves sufficiently and quickly 49 states with poor performance are able to still qualify for an incentive payment if significant increase over the previous years performance is achieved in those measures ie 10 percentage points on the paternity establishment performance level 5 percentage points on the child support order establishment performance level 5 percentage points on the current support collections performance level and 5 percentage points on the arrearage collections performance level federal law stipulates that with regard to the three more important performance measures states must achieve certain levels of performance in order to avoid being penalized for poor performance the three performance measures are paternity establishment child support order establishment and collection of current child support payments graduated penalty equal to 1 to 5 reduction in federal tanf block grant funds is assessed against states that fail to meet the cse performance requirements 50 although there is an interaction between the in centive payment and financial penalty systems they affect different programs thus even if states incentive payment is larger than any penalty assessed against the state the state cannot easily reconcile the difference because the state is required to reinvest incentive payments back into the cse program the state would have to expend other state funds that are not earmarked for the cse program to replace the loss in tanf funding 47 federal register vol 64 249 office of child support enforcement department of health and human services child support enforcement program incentive paym ents audit penalties final rule december 27 2000 p 50 of 71 48 even in cases in which the amount of the child support payment incentive is larger than the amount of the tanf penalty imposed state is required to reinvest its incentive payment in its cse program while penalties are assessed from the tanf funding stream states that acquire penalty would find that each quarterly tanf payment for the upcoming year would be reduced for total of the tanf penalty amount these states would then additionally have to expend an equivalent amount of state funds if they wanted to repl ace the reduction of federal f unds 49 under this alternative improvement formula the cse incentive payment can never be more than half 50 of the maximum incentive possible the costeffectiveness performance indicator is the only measure whereby improved performance does not translate into an incentive payment 50 the percentage reduction depends on number of times state fails to comply with cse state plan requirements ie at least 1 but not more than 2 for the 1st failure to comply at least 2 but not more than 3 for the 2nd failure and at least 3 but not more than 5 for the 3rd and subsequent failures

performance measures the paternity establishment indicator has two separate standards to which it must adhere first the paternity establishment percentage pep must meet 90 standard section 452g of the social security act this means that federal law currently requires that states must establish paternity for at least 90 of the children who need to have their father legally identified in order to substantially comply with the requirements of the cse program 51 if state does not meet the pep it must raise its performance by specified level of improvement in order to avoid having financial penalty imposed the percentage of improvement required varies with states performance level the increase needed to avoid penalty decreases with higher pep scores until state reaches 90 or hi gher pep at which point the penalty is avoided without an increase in performance52 for example state with pep of less than 40 needs 6 percentage point increase over the prior year to avoid the penalty whereas state with pep between 75 and 90 needs 2 percentage point increase over the previous year to avoid the penalty 53 if the state fails to increase the pep by the necessary percentage points after corrective action period the state is penalized by 15 reduction in its states tanf funding second in separate provision section 458 of the social security act the pep is included as one of the five cse performance measures thus states can receive incentive payments if their pep meets certain requirements the incentive payment provision with respect to the pep is consistent with the view of the cse community that only poor performance should be penalized thus under the incentive formula an incentive is awarded to state with pep of 50 or more the incentive formula provides that state that achieves pep of 80 or more will receive 100 of the applicable state collections base for that measure if state has pep of less than 50 the 51 the original paternity establishment percentage pep was enacted into law as part of the family support act of 1988 pl 100485 section 452g of the social security act the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 increased the percentage of children for whom state must establish paternity pep from 50 to 75 pl 10366 also imposed financial penalties against states that fa iled to comply with the mandatory paternity standards the financial penalty translated into reduction in federal matching funds for the states afdc program pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law raised the pep from 75 to 90 52 report on state child support forcement

points over the previous years score in order to receive an incentive payment from the outset of the performance measure debate 19961998 there was concern about whether states should be subject to penalties and be eligible for incentives at the same time some argued that the lack of an incentive payment would make some states doubly penalized by not improving performance it was decided that states should be eligible for incentive payments based on performance even if they were subject to penalties because their performance had not improved to the extent required to avoid the penalty 54 the work group that developed the current incentive payment system maintained that the existing statutory pep standard of 90 was too high and that it conflicted with their premise that only very poor performance should be penalized thus the work group overlaid another provision on top of existing law which provided that state that had pep of 80 or higher would receive 100 of the applicable state collections base for the paternity establishment performance measure this new pep for incentive payment purposes created what many maintain is an inconsistency in cse law according to the national council of child support directors it is inconsistent to reward state that achieves paternity establishment percentage of 80 with maximum child support incentive funding but impose penalty against the states tanf funding if 2 percentage point increase is not achieved between 80 and 90 performance 55 the national council of child support directors recommended that the paternity establishment penalty provisions set the upper threshold at 80 which will then make it consistent and uniform with the existing incentive formula under which state that has paternity establishment percentage of 80 or more receives 100 of the weight allowable for that measure56 if this recommendation was enacted into law states would be required to establish paternity for at least 80 of the children who need to have their father legally identified rather than 90 as required by current law

the cse incentive payment system adds an element of uncertainty to what used to be somewhat predictable source of income for states although in the aggregate states receive higher incentive payments than under the earlier incentive payment system these totals are fixed amount and individual states have to compete with each other for their share of the capped funds the revenueneutral capped incentive payment system creates an interactive effectan increase in incentive payments to one state must be matched by decrease in payments to other states similarly if one states performance weakens

states program performance to itself rather than national average the fixed amount of aggregate incentive payments forces state to compete with the other states for its share of the aggregate amount58 under the current incentive system whether or not state receives an incentive payment for good performance and the total amount of the incentive payment depend on four factors the total amount of money available in given fiscal year from which to make incentive payments the states success in obtaining collections on behalf of its caseload the states performance in five areas and the relative success or failure of other states in making collections and meeting these performance criteria because the incentive payments are now capped some states face loss of incentive payments even if they improve their performance some analysts argue that each state is unique in terms of its cse caseload and thereby should only have to make improvements over its performance in previous years with regard to rewarding of incentive payments nevertheless cse programs are compared to one another in that there is capped funding source and it must be shared by all so even though texas has large cse caseload shares an international border and has vast cultural and socioeconomic diversity among its residents its program is in essence compared to that of small midwestern state or wealthy northeastern state in determining its share of cse incentive dollars 59 others contend that if state deems that it has not received sufficient amount of incentive payments and that more cse funding is necessary it is the states prerogative to augment federal funding they maintain that the federal government is carrying too much of the financial burden of cse program they point out that the federal government matches state funds at 66 rate and additionally provides states with incentive payments

dollar invested in the cse program including incentive payments which came from the federal government although incentive payments per are not affected pl 109171 included provision that eliminated effective october 1 2007 the federal match on cse incentive payments that states in compliance with federal law reinvest back into the cse program this provision was passed as part of the deficit reduction act because many argued that reinvesting incentive payments back into the cse program was really supplanting state funding states are longer entitled to receive federal matching funds for cse incentive payments that the state reinvests in the cse program the elimination of federal reimbursement of cse incentive payments is likely to result in significant reduction in cse financing two bills hr 1386s 803 have been introduced in the 110 th congress to repeal the provision that eliminates the federal match on incentive payments in other words both bills would restore the federal match on incentive payments under previous law the 66 federal matching rate on incentive payments resulted in near tripling of state cse fundingin that for every dollar the state reinvested in the cse program the federal government matched that investment with about 261 thereby states were able to significantly leverage their investment through the federal financial structure both 2003 study by the lewin group mentioned earlier and recent 2007 st udy by the lewin group indicate that cse incentive payments represent 25 of all funds used to draw down the federal match for the cse program according to the lewin study there is substantial variation across states in the proportion of the state share financed by incentives from 7 percent to 54 percent this va riation may be due to number of factors such as poor state performance on incentive measures thus low incentive payments or higher appropriations from state legislatures similarly the decrease in expenditures assuming new state outlays ranges from 5 percent to 36 percent 62 the 2007 lewin study also indicates that because about third of the cse caseload is composed of interstate cases cse directors expect that the elimination of the federal match on incentive payments will probably result in negative interstate ramifications the study uses the following illustration for example consider two states state replaces funding and maintains strong performance but state b cuts back services due to funding shortfalls and performance declines state needs assistance from state b on interstate cases but state b cuts back staff on this laborintensive unit state as performance is affected negatively as result 63 61 the general cse federal matching rate is 66 this means that for every dollar that state spends on its cse program the federal government will reimburse the state 66 cen ts so if the state spends 1 on its program the federal share of that expenditure is 66 cents and the state share of that expenditure is 34 cents the algebraic formula for this relationship is represented by 6634x1 thereby if the state share of the expenditure is 1 the federal share is 194 ie the federal share is 194 times the state share and the total expenditure by the state is 294 1194 similarly if the state share of expenditures amounted solely to the incentive payment of 471 million ie the statutory cap on the aggregate cse incentive payment for fy2007 the federal share would amount to 194 times that amount or 914 million translating into 1385 billion in total cse expendituresfunding 62 the lewin group anticipated effects of the

cse program significantly impacts program performance several studies have indicated that most of the bestperforming state cse programs also have the most generous funding levels64 the elimination of the federal match of incentive payments is expected to reduce overall cse program expenditures and correspondingly reduce the rate of growth of child support collections the ocse expects that while states will increase their state contributions to cover some of the lost federal funds they will not completely make up the shortfall and overall cse expenditures will be reduced 65 64 center for law

cse program in 1975 when state or locality collected child support payments from noncustodial parent on behalf of family receiving aid to families with dependent children afdc the federal government was reimbursed for its share of the cost of afdc payments to the family66 although local units of government eg counties often enforced child support obligations in most states they did not make any financial contributions toward funding afdc benefit payments therefore the localities were not eligible for any share of the savings that occurred when child support was collected from noncustodial parent on behalf of an afdc family from the debate on the establishment of cse program congress concluded that fiscal sharing in the results of child support collections could be strong incentive for encouraging the local units of government to improve their cse activities 67

child support payments on another states behalf the federal government made the incentive payments directly to the states70 and each state was required to pass incentive payments through to local cse agencies if those agencies shared in funding the state cse program in order to improve costeffectiveness and encourage states to emphasize child support collections on behalf of both afdc and nonafdc families the incentive payment formula was changed so that states were paid minimum of 6 of their child support collections in afdc cases and 6 of their child support collections in nonafdc cases under this approach there was the potential to earn up to 10 of both afdc and nonafdc child support collections depending on the states costeffectiveness in running child support program ie ratio of state collections to the states cost of operating the cse program the federal government paid the incentive payments from its share of retained collections for afdc families and capped the amount of incentive payments any state could earn on the nonafdc cases at continued finance portion of the state afdc benefit payment states were required to split child support payments collected on behalf of afdc families with the federal government th child support collections obtained on behalf of afdc families are divided between the state and the federal govern ment according to their resp ective share of total afdc benefit payments small percentage of afdc collections is paid directly to families as noted above the federal share of afdc benefit expenditures ranged from 50 to 83 depending on state per capita income the federal share is also called the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap 70 before 1984 state that initiated ccessful action to collect child support from another state did not receive an incentive payment rather the state that made the collection received the incentive payment pl 98378 stipulated that each state involved in an interstate child support

approach state and federal partners recommended new incentive funding system based on the foundation of the cse national strategic plan over period of three months recommendations for the new incentive funding system emerged state partners consulted with state cse programs not represented directly on the workgroup the final recommendations represented consensus among state and federal partners on the new incentive funding system the secretary fully endorsed the incentive formula recommendations the secretarys report made recommendations for new cse incentive payment system to the

years thereafter 72 the incentive payment system had been criticized for focusing on only one aspect of the cse program cost effectiveness it was faulted for not rewarding states for other important aspects of child support enforcement such as paternity and support order establishment in addition because all states received the minimum incentive payment amount of 6 of both afdc and nonafdc collections regardless of the states performance many analysts claimed that the cse incentive payment system did not have real incentive effect 73 us department of health and human services admini
