fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108 136 this legislative provisi on capped several years when the director of the office of personnel management opm had advised federal ag encies that they needed to provide more rigorous and realistic ratings of their senior executives in fy2002 69 of career senior executives received the highest rating additionally certain components of the new system could help resolve the longstanding problem of pay compression within the ses key features of the new pay system which took effect on january 11 2004 include the limination of loca lity pay and nnual pay adjustments which were provided in conjunction with annua l adjustments for general schedule and executive schedule employees the replacement of six pay rates es1 through es6 w ith one broad pay range an increase in the cap on base pay from executive schedule iv exiv to exiii and the add ition of second higher cap exii for ses appraisal syst ems that have been certified by opm the certification process involves in part designing and implementing performance appraisal system that makes meaningful distinctions based on the relative performance of senior executives or seniorlevel sl or scientific or technical st professionals with th concurrence of the office of management and budget omb opm developed cer tification regulation which includes nine criteria agencies must meet in the design and administration of their appraisal systems barring any compliance problems that might arise after certification has been awarded full certification is for two calendar years provisional certification for one calendar year is awarded when an appraisal system meets design requirements but there is insufficient documentation to determine whether implementation meets certification requirements certification also determines the cap on aggregate compensation for senior executives and sl and st employees for an appraisal system that has not been certified the cap is exi for an appraisal system that has been certified the cap is the equivalent of the vice presidents salary the second higher cap vice president s salary and the establishment of certification process were enacted by sec tion 1322 of the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 for sl and st employ ees certification does not affect their base pay some of the issues that might arise with the implementation of the new ses pay system and certification process are how to define meaningful distinctions the possibility that some agencies might use forced distributions the potential for the politicization of senior executives and th systems implications for the notion of rank in person which is key feature of the ses this report will be updated as events

management of senior executives highly competent and skilled as leaders and managers members of the ses constitute major link between top presidential appointees and other federal employees about 90 of senior executives are career appointees who were selected for the ses on the basis of meeting executive core qualifications1 noncareer appointees do not have to meet the same competitive selection requirements but they also do not recei ve the same entitleme nts as career senior executives do2 approximately 70 of senior executives are in washington dc virginia and maryland two notable features of the ses are pay for performance and rank residing in the person not the position for senior executiv ses offers tradeoff in return for the opportunity to earn greater financial rewards through outstanding job performance executives give up some of the usual job security associated with the civil service the concept of rank residi ng in the individual is based on the notion that it facilitates reassignment of execu tives to functions agencies or positions where they are needed in 2004 the ses pay system was changed dramatically with these changes driven by two factors pay compression wh ich has been longstanding problem for senior executives and the presidents management agenda pma which was instituted in 2001 by the bush administrati on the previous pay system had six pay levels and pay compression re sulted in senior executives at the top three ses pay levels receiving essentially the same amount of base or basic pay in given year under the pma the bush administrati on has emphasized pay for performance for senior executives and has criticized agency performance management systems that it believes fail to make meaningful distinctions among senior

ses as noted previously under the prev ious pay system there were six rates of base pay es1 through es6 the lowest rate could not be less than 120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for gs 15 of the general schedule and the highest rate of basic pay could not exceed executive schedule level iv exiv3 within these parameters the president was required to adjust the rates of basic payfor senior executives whenever an adju stment was made under 5 usc 5303 in the general schedule rates of pay however the president determined the amount by which to adjust ses base pay 4 also under the former pay system ses members received locality pay when the pay agent d ecided to extend it to the ses which had been done every year5 the combination of basic pay and locality pay for senior executives was capped at ex iii6 while the statutorilyimposed floor pushed up from the bottom annual salary adjustments increased ses basic pay and in the absence of significant increases in executive schedule salaries statutory sa lary caps squeezed down from the top consequently as shown in table 1 the differences in amounts of pay between some ses pay levels were nonexist ent or negligible in each column

these execu tives earned virtually the same amount of basic pay negation of the financial distinctions among these three pay levels could undermine the concept of rank in person it is also possible that pay compression could affect recruiting retenti on and reassignments within the ses comparison among the four years shows that similar pa ttern occurred each year with the highest percentage of senior executives 34 36 clustered at es4 the smallest percentage of executives 67 were paid at the es6 level the remaining senior executives were evenly distributed in terms of percentages across the remaining four pay levels it is not cl ear why the highest percentage of senior executives is found at es4 possible explanation is that because of pay compression there was financial reason for moving senior executives to es5 and ultimately es6 presidents management agenda whereas pay compression has been long standing problem for members of the ses the other impetus for altering th ses pay system has its roots in the presidents management agenda introduced in 2001 the pma is focused on fostering government that is citizenoriented marketdriven and resultsoriented the strategic management of human capital is one of five pma initiatives7 an excerpt from the pma chapter on human capital states the managerial revolution that has transf ormed the culture of almost every other large institution in american life seems to have bypassed the federal workforce federal personnel policies and compensation tend to take the same onesize fitsall approach they took in 1945 excellence goes unrewarded mediocre performance carries few consequences and it takes months to remove even the poorest performers these realities contribute to the growing consensus that action is required the federal government has unique opportunity to redefine the way it manages human capital the administrations assessment of personnel flexibilities and outcomes achieved under demonstration projects will help permit more performanceoriented compensation accountability for results will be clear and meaningful with pos itive rewards for ccess and real consequences for failure8 the bush administrations interest in the performance of senior executives and how it could be connected to results organizational excellence and the administrations prioritie s was articulated initially in november 1 2001

and performance review board members to be rigorous in preparing recommendations on ratings and bonuses and most importantly you can personally communicate your intent to use the ses appraisal system to drive organizational excellence it is important that agencies ensure that executive performan ce plans reflect this administrations priorities including the presidents management agenda critical aspect of this process is establishing executive pe rformance goals and expectations in line with agency strategic goals and objectives regularly assessing performance against these goals and using performance as true basis for pay development and other personnel decisions9 noting that agencies had rated 85 of their executives at the highest level their system permits the director added these statistic s suggest that agencies are not making meaningful distinctions betw een those who merely do whats expected and those with consistent track record of outstanding performance10 second memorandum on senior execu tives from the opm director to department and agency heads dated september 27 2002 expressed similar theme reminding agency officials that performance appraisals should be based on results and urging them to be more discerning in preparing recommendations on ratings and bonuses the director wrote i believe that we have begun to see some shift toward resultsbased appraisals and greater accountability however we have long way to go as your fy2002 appraisal cycles come to close i once again urge you to ensure that measurable results not anecdotes from th basis of your senior executives performance appraisals by directing your performance review boards to be rigorous in preparing recommendations on ratings and bonuses you communicate your intention to use ses performance management systems to drive organizational excellence and hold executives accountable to facilitate this effort opm implemented new requirements in fy2001 for managing senior executive performance that emphasized results over process and gave agencies considerable flexibility to design systems tailored to their unique and changing missions cultures and needs these requirements call for the establishment of executive performance st andards that are in line with agency strategic goals and objectives they also require agency leadership to expect excellence communicate performance expectations and appraise performance against those expectations take action to reward outstanding performers and deal appropriately with those who do not measure up one of the dimensions of the human

performance rating an assertion that virtually everyone in washington is way above average despite james urging agencies to begin distinguishing the best performers from others almost nothing changed in 2001 more than 83 percent of senior executives received the highest possible rating five agencies gave 100 percent of their senior executives the hi ghest rating and six more gave it to 90 percent of their senior ranks such figures let the public know that federal managers are not yet serious about holding themselves or their staffs accountable12 the administration proposes to eliminat the current pay structure for senior managers senior executives and increase their pay ceiling under this proposal each agency will adjust pay for its senior managers on the basis of individual performance which will help address the current lack of meaningful senior manager appraisal systems13 in the meantime while the adminis trations legisla tive proposal was considered enacted and imple

however these data also suggest that more work is still required and we will be extremely interested in the information you report for fiscal year 2003 the necessity for more rigorous and realistic ratings is especially clear in instances where agencies are not fulfilling their missions and reporting demonstrable results14 opms acting director followed suit in march 2005 writing in memorandum on ses performance ratings and awards that an opm report shows that in fy2003 over 74 of agency executives received the highest performance rating possibl under the applicable performance appraisal system and more than half of those eligible received substantial performance bonuses both of these figures are essentially unchanged from fy2002 these results do not reflect the requirements of the new ses payfor performance system among other things regulations established by opm and omb require that agencies make meaningful distinctions in the performance ratings and pay of their ses members and that those ratings and pay decisions be consistent with organi zational results overall and with respect to an executives particular area of responsibility15 in late 2005 opm reported on fy2004 s performance ratings awards and salaries in related news release the di rector of opm is quoted as saying that the report is reflective of the transition to the new senior executive service payfor performance system and that it documen ts some good early news about ses pay and recognition and should reinforce that ma nagers are taking the evaluation process more seriously16 several months later

in 2007 shifting the cap on tota l compensation does not represent an increase in compensation it will not affect the amount of money an individual may receive the cap on total compensation is limit placed on the amount of compensation senior executive may receive in any one year if senior executives total compensation exceeds the applicable cap the difference between the two amounts is deferred to and paid the next calendar year thus senior executives whose agencies have certified ses appraisal systems are more likely to receive all of their compensation in one year instead of having some of their compensation for example performance awards deferred to the following year senior level and senior technical positions changes involving the cap on total compensation for senior executives also

departments and agencies have received provisiona l certification see table 5 for agency certification status policy issues the new pay system for the ses ushered in some fairly significant changes for senior executives and their supervisors implementation of rigorous performance management system that directs agencies to assign performance ratings based on measurable results and to make distincti ons among senior executives based on their job performances it intended to mitigate against if not eliminate rating inflation performance ratings are intended to accurately reflect the job performances of senior executives thus helping to ensure that they are being held accountable for their work in practical terms the new system is configured to ensure that top performers in the ses receive the greatest rewards in term s of performance ratings and by extension pay increases average performers are to receive ratings and pay increases if warranted commensurate with their performances as well when coupled with the increase in the cap on base pay and the addition of higher cap for performance management systems certified by opm these changes represent substantial effort to identify and reward the best performers in the ses while the anticipated benefits of the new system are significant several policy issues related to the systems implementation have been mentioned including its implementation and implications the system s emphasis on meaningful distinctions the concerns of senior executives and institutional issues meaningful distinctions and ratings distributions meaningful distincti ons is not defined according to the administration requiring agencies to make meaningful distinctions in the relative performances of senior executives is esse ntial to ensuring that individuals reap rewards commensurate with their perfo rmance and in particular that only outstanding performers receive the greatest rewards while opm has clearly stated the objective and rationale for this goal it has not explicitly defined or described what is meant by the term meaningful distinctions for example opms associate director for strategic human resource

in memoranda it has released on this subject opm makes general statements about agency ratings of senior executives indicating that some progress has occurred but also noting that more needs to be done although the evidence presented by opm consists of tables that list individual agencies see table 4 none is identified by name as an example of an organization that is making progress or that has failed to improve thus there is indication as to what precisely constitutes progress or what percentage of senior executives who have received the highest rating in the agencys ses appraisal system would render system acceptable from opms perspective the lack of an explicit definition or description of meaningful distinctions may be consider ed necessity forced distributions of ratings that is quotas are not permitted for senior executives49 and thus opm employees may not want to communicate to agencies that certain distributions of ratings would be preferable to others possible advantage of this approach is that opm officials are able to exercise significant degree of discretion in determining whether an agency has met the requirement to make meaningful distinctions among the performances of its senior executives additionally in the absence of an explicit definition opms view or criterion of what types of rating distributions qualify as reflecting meaningful distinctions could shift over time focus on the highest level what is clear about opms approach is that it focuses exclusively on only one portion of agencies rating distributions the percentage of senior executives who receive the highest summary appraisal rating referring to the implementation of the ne w ses pay system opm noted in report on alternative pay systems that stronger distinctions are bein g made with previous cases of extremely high and implausible percentages of outstanding ratings declining so that the outstanding description can truly carry its intended connotation of stands out as an exception50 table 4 displays the data that were included in opms 2004 2005 and 2006 memoranda on ses performance ratings and awards51 the data in the tables refer to fy2000fy2005 data provided subsequently by opm show that several agencies changed the number of levels in their ses appraisal systems during this period most changes during the period 20032005 were necessitated by

the percentages at labor and treasury decreased gradually over six years from 69 to 39 labor and from 66 to 44 treasury the remaining six agencies experienced dramatic drops in percentage s from one year to the next and in some cases increases in later years the agen cies that experienced significant oneyear decrease prior to 2004 when the new pay sy stem was implemented are as follows the department of energy decreased from 99 2001 to 18 2002 omb decreased from 88 2000 to 20 2001 opm dropped from 90 2000 to 37 2001 sba decreased from 82 2001 to 50 2002 ssa droppe d from 99 2002 to 41 2003 and usaid decreased from 79 2001 to 42 2002 it is notable that these significant decreases occurred prior to the implementation of the new ses pay system although as discusse d above the bush administration through opm had encouraged agencies beginning in 2001 to make meaningful distinctions among their senior executives possibly then the changes noted here reflect these agencies efforts to recast how they administered their ses appraisal systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33128crs29 55 linda m springer director us office of personnel management report on senior executive service pay for

association letter to linda m springer dire ctor us office of personnel management continuedawarding the toplevel rating to all or virtually all senior executives in given agency would not appear to meet opms br oad concept of meaningful distinctions however because opm at present is emphasizing only the percentage of executives who receive the topmost rating it is conceivable that an agency could in fivelevel appraisal system cluster virtually all of its senior executives at the top two rating levels as long as the percentage of individuals who receive the highest rating does not exceed certain levels explanations for the decrease in top ratings the office of personnel management contends that the lower percentage of employees receiving the top rating in recent years reflects the success of agencies efforts to make meaningful distinctions among the perform ances of their senior executives for example in her 2006 memorandum that touched on this issu the director of opm wrote the data indicate that federal agencies are taking seriously the requirement to develop rigorous appraisal systems and to make meaningful distinctions in performance ratings and pay in this regard reporting agencies shifted to appraisal systems with at least one level above fully successful systems and away from passfail systems we expect the 2006 rating cycle to continue improvement in holding senior executives accountable for achieving results and rating and rewarding them accordingly55 as the opm directors comments suggest one factor that seems to have facilitated decrease in the number of top ratings in some agencies has been the elimination of 3level appraisal systems in favor of 4 and 5level systems in every instance adoption of 4 or 5leve l system in 2004 or 2005 resulted in significant drop in the percentage of senior executives receiving the highest rating prior to the implementation of the new ses pay system the percentage of top ratings at some agencies had decreased these change s might have been related to the administrations encouragement be ginning with november 1 2001 opm memorandum which is cited above that agencies make meaningful distinctions among their senior executives others have suggested however that the reduction is function of forced distributions with limits on the number of top ratings that can be given to senior executives for example the senior executives association sea raised the issue of quotas with opm in late 2005 noting tw instances in which it appeared that agencies had established quotas or were directing employees to take actions that amounted to applying forced distribution in its letter to the opm director sea stated that the navys rating plan included page titled expectations and set forth percentages of executives who may be rate d as exceptional the association went on to say in its letter that the navys plan anticipates facto forced distribution for rating levels rather than an objective analysis of achievements56 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33128crs30 56 continued nov 9 2005 57 ibid 58 opm responds to report of quota use action jan 2006 p 1 59 springer certification of performance ppraisal systems

had received outstanding ratings in previous years the senior executive was instructed to lower whatever critical element she wanted in rating her colleague also senior executive57 i n t h january 2006 issue of action an sea publication it was noted that the opm director had responded to sea and promised to follow up with the two agencies to share seas concerns the opm director reportedly also said we will continue to work with all agencies to ensure they operate in accordance with regulatory requirements58 one of the provisions in the 2007 cer tification guidance issued by opm apparently is intended to address this problem in her memorandum accompanying the guidance the opm director stated i want to call your attention to concern we have about the implementation of the system specifically with the communica tions and training that agencies are providing for this reason we are asking agencies to submit narrative statement describing the relevant brie fings and other communications and training provided to their senior empl oyees rating officials performance review boards prbs and human resources sta ff both in preparation for and after the annual performance cycle we are asking for this information because of an apparent lack of knowledge among senior executives regarding their performance and pay systems we are also concerned that some executives per ceive their agencies are using quotas or forced distributions to determine ratings to avoid even the appearance of such practice it is particularly impor tant that executives understand the effect organizational performance can have on individual ratings and the overall rating distribution even the be stintentioned bestdesigned system can fail if not implemented properly and major aspect of any successful system implementation is effective communication of the system and its results to participants and appropriate training for those responsible for its operation we will factor the adequacy of your co mmunication plan and training into the certification decision59 opm noted in the same memorandum that it had developed briefing slides for agencies to use in explaining from g overnmentwide perspective the pay for performance system for senior executives and slst employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33128crs31 60 shawn zeller senior executive corps to see base salary increases government executive daily briefing july 26 2004 availabl at http wwwgovexecco mdailyfed 0704072604sz1htmit is unclear whether opms approach will be sufficient in addressing the question of forced distributions as dem onstrated by the text of the memorandum it appears that opm charact erizes this issue as st emming from poor communications concern we have about the implementation of the system specifically with the communications insufficient informati on lack of knowledge and erroneous perceptions some executives perceive their agencies are using quotas specific mention is made of the sea allega tions involving the navy or usda or any efforts by opm to verify independently whether ratings accurately reflect the performances of senior executives howe ver it has been reported that opms associate director for strategic human resources policy indicated that his agency would not set quotas on the number of high rankings that agencies could hand out and would allow agencies to continue to rate most employees highly as long as the agencies were able to justify the rankings60 aside from the information provided by the sea about the navy and the agricultural research service there does not appear to be any data available that either confirms or disproves the use of quotas for this and other reasons forced distributions could remain sensitive issue for some time particularly if similar pay forperformance systems are implemented throughout the federal government for example the general schedule gs pay system trends in ratings awards and pay table 5 shows that as the percentage of

available at http wwwchcocgov transm ittal_detailcfmid752 note percentages have been rounded the bush administration as noted above began promoting the idea of meaningful distinctions in fall 2001 which may have contributed to the 9 decrease in the percentage of highest ratings from fy2001 to fy2002 the largest decreases occurred however after implementation of the new pay system from fy2003 to fy2005 the percentage of senior executives receiving the highest rating dropped by 32 percentage points overall from fy2001 through fy2005 this percentage decreased by nearly onehalf from 84 to 43 during the same period the percentage of executives who received awards grew from 52 to 67 and the average amount of awards went from 12324 to 13814 an increase of 1490 or 12 the seeming disconnect between the decreasing percentage of executives receiving the highest ratings and the increasing percentage of individuals receiving awards and the growth in the average size of awards has several possible explanations individual agencies may be using the awards system to compensate for lower ratings or the loss of locality pay in variation on the latter the sea president reportedly has suggested that some agencies could be using larger awards to counteract any negative reacti on from reducing performance ratings61 n alternative explanation repor tedly offered by opms ssociate director of the strategic human resources policy division is that the bush administrations heightened focus on evaluating recogniz ing and rewarding individual performance likely has contributed to the larger payouts the associate director said there is potential here that weve raised the agencies sensitivity to the value of their executives theyre really looking at what their executives are doing and what theyre producing62 as reported in the federal times whether senior executive receives pay raise and the amount of any raise varies from agency to agency63 for example in 2006 senior executives who met or exceeded performance expectations that is individuals who received fully successful or higher rating were eligible for 19 pay increase however according to th is publication three of the five agencies that provided data to the federal times did not give the 19 increase to all eligiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33128crs33 64 ibid p 6 65 ibid 66 ibid 67 some of the tables may include data from more than one appraisal system federal agencies are permitted to establish more than one performance appraisal system for their senior executives and different agency components may choose to establish different appraisal systems additionally some agenci changed the number of levels in their appraisal systems during the period fy1999fy2005 and these changes are noted in the appropriate tablesexecutives the three agenci were hhs hud and the va64 while some might question the lack of consiste ncy or standardization acro ss the government the senior policy advisor to the opm director reportedly said the fact that there are differences across agencies might make great strategic sense65 possible reasons for differences among agencies include the following agencies adopted performancebased ses pay systems at different times so those who got late start may offer higher raises in an effort to quickly get their executives up to par on the more lucrative pay scale afforded under certified performancebased pay system some have adopted tiered pay structure in which different ranges of raises are available to executives holding different levels of responsibility and importance in their agency still other agencies could be making greater use of bonuses than others to augment raises for high performers66 ultimately the significance of the differences in how agencies allocate pay increases may be determined by senior executives themselves will they view the lack of standardization as inequitable or desirable whereby agencies are allowed to exercise discretion answers may vary depending upon perhaps where senior executive is employed ratings distributions by agency appendix displays the ses annual summary rating distributions fy1999fy2005 for the same agencies that opm includes in its memoranda on ses performance ratings and awards67 fy2005 data are the most current data available comp arisons of ratings distributions before and after the implementation of the new ses pay system could aid in understanding what constitutes meaningful distinctions and could show how senior executives in those agencies have fared under the new system several years of postimplementation data beginning with fy2004 data will be n eeded in order to make this comparison more definitively and discern the effects on members of the ses all references to tables in this section refer to the tables in appendix except as otherwise noted excluding agencies where at least 90 of the senior executives were awarded the highest ratings over several years dis

the judgment of other interested parties including some senior executives and ot her federal government employees will apparently hinge on whether they perceive the system as being equitable including

expressed cern about whether impleme ntation of the new pay system will be carried out in an equitable manner in the following comments several members of sea suggest that the new pay system could lead to the politicization of the ses having worked as career ses in several agencies for the past 22 years and witnessed the games that some politicals p olitical appointees play with the ses i would insist upon sufficient safeguards for example agency head wants to free up some ses slots for his or her supporters by encouraging current career ses staff to retire an arbitrary salary cut of lets say 20000 per year in salary for alleged poor performance impacting the persons high3 retirement annuity calculation would drive many retirementeligible ses out the door ive worked directly for large number and variety of political appointees more than few of whom responded to career executives on purely visceral level if they liked you your errors were reflection of desirable risktaking if they didnt like you your less than total successes were reflection of your lack of initiative in other words i find pay compression under the current system to be more desirable than wild card syst em which is what the proposal looks like to having the agency set the basic pay would always be political whether stated or not those on the right side or politically connected w ill be the ones to benefit and those on the other side d epending on what party is running the administration will not benefit regardless of performance68 one of the specific issues raised by th sea concerns the

opm the sea stated that with regard to the career ses it is important to remember the need to avoid the fray of politics and the specter of undue politicization one of the purposes of the ses is to help maintain consistency during political change given human nature there is strong probability that at some point the allowed 10 reduction will be misused by political appoi ntee in order to affect or influence desired politically motivated decision the mere threat or existence of the 10 reduction has the potential to become subtle and negative influence that can well contribute to the politicization of the career ses or at minimum result in arguments or perceptions that the car eer ses has been subject to improper political pressure this is particularly true considering the impact on career senior executives retirement annuity th at will result when pay is reduced69 in its response to seas concerns about possible politicization of the ses under the new pay system opm officials wrote t he new ses pay system provides greater opportunities for higher rates of basic pay and larger pay ad justments and with these opportunities come greater risks we believe it is necessary to provide agencies with the authority to reduce basic pay up to 10 pe rcent therefore we made changes in the regulations70 those parties concerned that the new system possibly could facilitate the politiciz ation of the ses suggest that the withholding of pay adjustments or the offering of pay increases also could be used in attempts to exert undue influence over senior executives dod

received 25 increase in base pay career senior executives in certain categories as described in the memorandum would have received 238 or 2 increase in base pay in 2005 by way of explanation for these

problematic furthermore the immediate negative effects that the pay system has had on some senior executives may serve as caution to other government employees and may influence efforts to implement payforperformance elsewhere in the federal government although the surveys findings may not accurately portray the implementation process the perceptions and beliefs of some senior executives may persist prove resistant to change and have farreaching implications missing from the sea survey however is any tangible evidence of problems caused by the shift to the new pay system one of the findings of the sea survey was that the morale of senior executives has been affected negatively next questions may include the following has this change in morale had any visible effect on individuals for example has attrition whether through retirement resignation or other means increased significantly since the new pay system was implemented for its part opm has not conducted its own survey and has not indicated that it plans to do so in her prepared rema rks at 2006 hearing on the ses pay system the opm director stated that her agency was reviewing the sea survey and believed it will help us understand areas where managers may be executing the system improperly77 possibly opm will use the sea survey then as an opportunity to explore any unintended conse quences of the new pay system and the sources and implications thereof institutional issues rank in person as noted previously funda mental principle of the senior executive service is that rank resides in th individual the final rule for the new pay system in discussing how to set pa for an individual upon his or her initial appointment to the ses supports this c oncept in setting new senior executives rate of basic pay an agency must consider the nature and quality of the individuals experience qualifications and accomplishments as they are related to the requirements of the ses position as well as the individuals current responsibilities78 another excerpt from the fina l rule however might undermine the concept of rank in person under th new pay system pay adjustment is permitted when an increase in pay is

on ses pay regulations referring to situations wher higher pay rate may be warranted the director of opm includes as an example the reassignment of current ses members into positions with subs tantially greater responsibility80 while the principle of rank in person may have been undermined incrementally over the years through pay compression and through individual decisions that linked pay with the level of respons ibility of particular position the rule issued by opm in december 2004 and the language in the 2006 memo could be construed as validating this linkage reassigning nior executive and providing him or her pay increase based on the fact that th new position includes greater responsibility than the former position runs counter to the notion that rank resides in the person it remains to be seen whether and how these two somewhat contradictory concepts rank in person and rank associated with position will be reconciled transparency the extent to which the administration of the ses pay system is transparent might aid in alleviating c oncerns about whether the system has been implemented in an equitable manner the final rule for the ses pay system requires agencies to provide for transparency in the processes for making pay decisions while assuring confidentiality81 this is broad statement and the lack of detailed guidelines could allow agency personnel br oad discretion in termining the extent and type of information they disclose uneven disclosure policies and practices across the federal government could be problematic par ticularly if some agencies appear less forthcoming than others dditionally lack of standardization among agency disclosure policies might undermin the usefulness of information that is made available to the public

for that year for example the agency may not have submitted certification application to opm or the agency may have submitted an application and opm did not approve it c this is the year in which the department or agency received full certifica tion full certification is for two years conclusion the ses pay system including the certif ication option that was established in 2004 is the most significant change to the ses since its inception in 1978 while the new system has higher caps on base pay th an the previous system and may help to alleviate pay compression its implementation signaled the elimination of locality pay and annual pay adjustments for senior executives the administrations emphasis on results performance and accountability has been interpreted in part as the requirement that agencies which seek certification of their appraisal systems must among other things make meaningful dis tinctions among their senior executiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33128crs44 compensation for senior executives is expected to be commensurate with their relative performance an agency may receive full certification or provisional certification for each of its appraisal systems whether an appraisal system has been certified by opm with omb concurrence also determines which cap applies to aggregate compensation for senior executives and sl and st employees whereas opms regulation and guidance provide one standard for gauging the success of the new pay system others including senior executives might be more concerned with different outcomes unintende d

performance87 gaining consensus on the basis for rewards and corrective actions determinations to award higher pay and bonuses and to take corrective actions because of poor performance must be based on credible process for evaluating performance that is tailored to the individual needs and culture of each organization avoiding the temptation to implement one size fits all approach and which is

proportion of high performers differs among agencies and work groups within agencies the amount and distribution of awards should be controlled via budget allocations and not by arbitrary quotas or forced distribution in addition the system should specifically allow for the possibility of team awards rather than individual awards where that makes the most sense reviewable credible system will provide for third party review preferably peer review and rational and reasonable process for the appeals of actions having material effect upon the employee results or outcomes of the pay for performance system should be openly available to those participating in the system to build the credibility of the system over time periodically evaluated and adjusted any new or revised performance management system should be tested and evaluated on an ongoing basis and refined based on the results all with stakeholder participation the test should be communicated to all employees before starting and the results and actions to be taken based on those results should also be communicated finally reviews of the system by an agency or by the office of personnel management should include an assessment of the impact of the system on agency workforce diversity goals and initiatives adequately funded the performance award system both in testing and full implementation must be adequate ly
