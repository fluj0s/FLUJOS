receipts as percentage of gross domestic product gdp over the period 19402005 table 1 presents the corresponding data the numbers indicate that during world war ii taxes increased from prewar level of about 7 of gdp to 209 in 1944 although tax receipts declined immediately after the war they remained substantially above th eir prewar level for the next five decades the level of taxe s remained quite stable the average for the postworld war ii period has been 183 of gdp the lowest level was in 1950 at 144 receipts reached their highest level as percentage of gdp in 2000 at 209 after reaching their peak in 2000 receipts d eclined for several years reaching 163 in 2004 but then rose to 175 in 2005 these high and low points are relatively small departures from the average and most years remained quite close to the norm within 30 of gdp from the longterm average the narrow range of variation has been consequence of both economic factors and conscious polic decisions for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20087crs2 inflation helped push revenues as percenta ge of the economy to relative peak in 1981 whereas the economic recovery tax act of 1981 subsequently reduced them
