homicide the instructions to the jury require finding an intent to commit murderthey should reflect whether the defendantrespondent killed atte mpted to kill or intended to kill but see tison v arizona 481 us 137 1987easing intent to kill qualification and allowing execution of criminal for felony murder when he did not in flict the fatal wound and did not intend to kill but was recklessly indifferent 8 justice oconnor concurred but noted that oklahomas death penalty statute set minimum age at which the death penalty could be imposed she noted that sentencing 15yearold under the oklahoma statute was inconsistent with the st andard for special care and deliberation required in death penalty cases 487 us at 85658lynaugh 2 justice oconnor writing for the majo rity found that national consensus existed to justify preclusion of the ex ecution of moderately retarded person3 arguably this case shows justice oconnors general support for the constitutionality of the death penalty for example she dissented from the majoritys decision to establish categorical rule forbidding the execution of any offender for any crime committed before his 18th birthday matter how deliberate wanton or cruel the offense4 however justice oconnor did write and join some opinions that limited states ability to impose the death penalty on some types of defendants and through certain means for example in nelson v campbell 5 writing for the majority justice oconnor allowed state prisoner to proceed with section 1983 challenge to the constitutionality of the states lethal injection method in penry v johnson 6 justice oconnor wrote the majority opinion that held that the constitution requires criminal jury in capital case to be able to give effect to mitigating ci rcumstances of mental retardation and childhood abuse conversely justi ce oconnor dissented from na rrowlydivided courts holding that the execution of criminals who merely aid and abet felony resulting in murder by cocriminals felony murder but who do not intend or attempt to kill anyone was unconstitutional7 the court has also ruled by onevote marg in that the eighth amendment bars the death penalty for crimes committed by persons under the age of sixteen because the death penalty provides little deterrence and is disproporti onate to the criminals guilt8 in 1988httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22224crs3 9 thompson

constitution new rule generally cannot be applied retroactively against th states during federal habeas review of state convictions since state courts coul d not be expected to defer to those rules not in existence when their consideration became final teague allows for retroactivity for two types of new rules as exceptions to the bar 1 new rules that place certain kinds of primary private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaki ng authority to proscribe and 2 rules that define procedure implicit in the concept of ordered liberty id at 307 new rule qualifies for the latter exception and applies retroactively if it is watershed rule that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding id at 31112 although teague was not capital case its

opinions in capital cases on occasion she jo ined in opinions upholding the rights of habeas petitioners12 for example in tennard v dretke 13 writing for the majority justice oconnor found that habeas petitioner was titled to certificate of appealablity on his claim that the states capital sentencing scheme did not give him constitutionally adequate means to present evidence of his low iq during the penalty phase of the capital case however she also authored and joined seve ral important decisions that taken together arguably construed her teague v lane14 retroactivity rule in way that

wrote this is case about federalism it concerns the respect that federal courts owe the states and the states procedur rules when reviewing the claims of state prisoners in federal habeas corpus claims id at 726 this decision was based on an earlier ruling murray v giarratano 492 us 1 1989 in which justi ce oconnor cast the decisive fifth vote justice oconnor has also joined in add itional decisions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel see also bell v thompson 125 sct 2825 2005finding that failure to consult defendants legal military medical and prison records for evidence of mental illness is not ineffective assistance of counsel florida v nixon 125 sct 551 2004finding that failure to obtain defendants consent to pleading guilty at guilt phase of capital trial does not automatically render performance deficient roe v floresortega 528 us 470 2000finding that failure to file notice of appeal is not ineffective assistance of counselineffective assistance of counsel justice oconnor tended to take skepti cal approach to fendants claims of ineffective assistance of counsel she authored the courts opinion in strickland v washington 16 which established the current standard for ineffective assistance of counsel writing for the majority justice oconnor stated an error by counsel even if professiona lly unreasonable does not warrant setting aside the judgement of criminal proceeding if the error had effect on the judgement judicial scrutiny of counsels performance must be highly deferential it is all too tempting for defendant to secondguess counsels assistance after conviction or adverse sentence and it is all too easy for court examining counsels defense after it has proved unsuccessful to c onclude that partic ular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distor ting effects of hindsight to reconstruct the circumstance of counsels challenged conduct and to evaluate the conduct from counsels perspective at the time because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation court must indulge strong presumption that counsels conduct falls within the wise range of reasonable professi onal assistance that is the defendant must overcome the presumption that under the ci rcumstances the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy17 when applying the strickland standard to the facts of subsequent cases justice oconnor did not find ineffectiv assistance of counsel as of ten as other court members for example in coleman v thompson 18 justice oconnor wrote the courts opinion not finding ineffective assistance of counsel in case where the lawyer for deathsentenced murderer missed the deadline for filing state habeas appeal by couple of days the question facing the justices was whether this error in state court should cost coleman the right to present his constitutional claim in fe deral court in the courts opinion because coleman was not constitu tionally entitled to lawyer for hi s appeal in the first place he also could not complain that the lawyer he had in fact retained was incompetent19 however she did cast the deciding vote to uphold an ineffective assistance claim basedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22224crs5 20 see wiggins v smith 539 us 510 2003 21 539 us 510 2003 22 id at 511 23 id at 538 24 125 sct 2456 2005 25 id at 2470 26 id 27 id 28 512 us 154 1994on trial counsels failure to examine records of the defendants pr ior conviction for rape and assault at the sentencing phase of the defendants capital murder trial20 in wiggins v smith 21 justice oconnor writing for the cour t remarked that any reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing such leads was necessary to making an informed choice about possi ble defenses particularly gi ven the apparent absence of aggravating factors from wiggins background22 because the trial attorney failed to conduct even minimally adequa mitigation investigation in to wiggins past the jury was robbed of the opportunity to review wiggi ns social history as such the court concluded that it was quite reasonable to ssume that the jury would have reached different sentence had they knew of such evidence23 in rompilla v beard 24 the court held that even when capital defendants family members and the defendant himself have suggested that mitigating evidence is available the defendants c ounsel is still bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows the pr osecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the sentencing phase of trial the court found that the defense counsels failure to examine the file on the defendants prior conviction for rape and assault at the sentencing phase of capital murder trial fell below the level of reasonable performance in addition the court concluded that such failure was prejudicial to the defendant warranting habeas relief on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel justice oconnor wrote separate concur rence in which she explained the three circumstances that made tria l counsels failure to examin rompillas prior conviction file unreasonable the first circumstance wa s rompillas attorneys knowledge that their clients prior conviction w ould be at the very heart of the prosecutions case25 second was the destructive impact that the prosecutors planned use of the prior convictions threatened to have on one of the defenses primary mitigation arguments26 the final circumstance was that the ttorneys decision not to obtain rompillas prior conviction file was not the result of an informed tacti cal decision about how the lawyers time would best be spent27 jurys role in capital sentencing in simmons v south carolina 28 justice oconnor writing for the majority held that when defendants future dangerousness is at issue the jury must be accurately informed whether there is any possibility of parole under the altern ative lifetime sentencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22224crs6 29 caldwell v mississippi 472 us 320 1985finding that it is constitutionally impermissible to mislead jury as to its role in determining death sentence 30 525 us 141 1998 31 530 us 156 2000in addition the 14th amendments due process clause bars prosecutors and trial judges from misleading juries29 in series of 54 decisi ons justice oconnor joined the courts more conservative bloc in refusing to extend the simmons rule for example in calderon v coleman30 the court held that even if jury instruction failed to meet constitutional standards the defendant must carry the burden of proving that properly informed jury would have voted for life ntence instead of the death penalty also in ramdass v angelone 31 the court found that jury need not be informed that the defendant probably would not be eligible for parole if he receives life sentence
