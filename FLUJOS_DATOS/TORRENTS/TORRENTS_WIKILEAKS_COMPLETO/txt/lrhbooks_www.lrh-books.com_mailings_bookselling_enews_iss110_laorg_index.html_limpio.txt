scientologists on earth and to answer that question the entire fieldall ots fsms and scientologistsare being called to action to grab their hats as part of the public phase fsms take the lead by disseminating to the public of angeles the math is simpletake the 30 thousand scientologists in the field and train them up to sell 25 books week one week alone would break all bookselling records and within 3 months you would have sold enough books to put lrh tech into the hands of every single person in angelesand gotten hundreds of thousands of new people onto the bridge with the proven success of the new york pattern it is now up to individual scientologists to get active lrh lays it out in hco pl 4 november 1973 publishing policy books and magazines where he says as almost the totality of dissemination becomes real only with books general dissemination is running at about 1100th what it should at this writing even though it may seem high already to you successful public reg once said its hard to sell public off the street even if they come in but if they have read book there is selling necessary one just signs them up we are the answer to this planets human problems why keep it secret learn book policy and use it l ron hubbard it begins with an active field lrh developed the class v org board as the pattern for scientology expansion and he made sure that every single activity and individual is represented on it in fact all scientologists whether staff or public have position on that org board why fsms introduce lrh tech to new public in angeles because it takes more than handful of dedicated staff to clear angelesit takes thousands of onsource scientologists out in the field contacting new people and putting lrhs tech directly into their hands to start them on the bridge this is described in hco pl 10 september 1990 iii the quality of division 6c division 6c checklist for quality the public divisions keep the orgs field alive and active this is function that has been being done since 1950 not only do the public divisions provide services to interest and involve the field but also these scientologists are organized guided and controlled so as to disseminate dianetics and scientology into their community l ron hubbard it is through the activity of the field in this public phase of scientology that clearing will become reality if scientologists pick up their dissemination hats and get involved in big way so dont wait any longerbe part of this vital movement today contact angeles org and tell them you are ready to start disseminating with lrh books i will make you wager i think you are wasting most of your time answering questions which are answered in books i think you are talking yourself hoarse to friends and other people and groups explaining over and over and over things that are already taken up in books i think your time is being devoured by attempts to reach through the natural conversational barriers of people you are not giving i am sure the newly interested person an opportunity to go and sit down quietly by himself without any social strain and study book on the subject only in this way will he come to decision about the subject which is his own independent decision having inspected the materials this has to be done quietly and it is best done through the pages of book if you are not furiously pushing dianetics the modern science of mental health and if you are not insisting that each newly interested person read it as something new startling and strange in the world you will be wasting most of your dissemination efforts hco pl 28 april 1960 books are dissemination young scientologists take dianetics to the street when word of the bookselling successes in new york first hit some of the first

have sold on one hand i thought disseminating to new public was for people who had knack for it special people who were trained at auditing new public or those who had super confront i was wrong i just didnt have the correct pattern or the correct patter and then sad to say i really needed the push and purpose drilled in on i had to want the products and know they were possible to achieve with this pattern and patter i know this is the easiest and fastest way to get the products to achieve the purpose furthermore it can help any scientologist who feels badly about not disseminating because it gives huge wins to anyone who does it with this patter i can find anyones ruin anywhere anytime anyone that is freedom for freedom because it is longer something i have to not confront and make
