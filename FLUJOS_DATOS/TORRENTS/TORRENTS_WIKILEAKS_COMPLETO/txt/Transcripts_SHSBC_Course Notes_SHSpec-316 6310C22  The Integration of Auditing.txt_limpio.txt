6310c22 shspec316 the integration of auditing your difficulties in auditing are all made manufactured by you in this universe difficulty always has to be manufactured living beings are theta beings they have to work pretty hard to be entheta beings one may not be aware of the labor involved but it is still being done there would be mass in the bank if it were not being created in the instant in which it has an effect on the individual thetan creates his own bank it is not that thetan has created his own bank it is that he is creating his own bank at this instant there is such thing as continued creation all creation must be done at the moment it is perceived there can be utterly unconscious creation that is the source of the reactive mind the reason thetan is creating is contained in the things he is creating trickily enough the thetan creates the item creativeness which then forces him to create person generally cant confront what it is that is causing him to create or what he is creating to cause himself to create he is not confronting the fact that he is creating it so it is gone notised not asised the difficulty with this creativeness is that in view of the fact that the thetan can create so much automatically he cannot differentiate what he is creating so he cannot asis what he is creating the easiest thing someone can do is to create an artist who is sweating over his creation has put some arbitrary barriers there such as time barrier eg it must be done in fortnight or economic barriers eg he has to sell it or he cant eat and possibly material barriers eg the paint he has must be used even if it is suboptimal you could sort this out with him easily this action taken to its final form is r4 you audit out all the gpms and ris youre auditing out the barriers which person has put in his own road in order to prevent imagined oppositions from having an effect upon him game of shadows we tend to poohpooh the trouble that the bank causes him because it is shadows but the individual does in fact have to be bailed out if groups etc are going to be made effective anything thats wrong with an organization is being created now by the organization it is the same with the individual difficulties in auditing are all made in this universe difficulties have to be manufactured except for the question of succession benevolent monarchy is the most nearly ideal form of government people wont accept it because it might fail next year benevolent people is preferable to benevolent monarchy you cant work with anything but the individual if you want to succeed the individual is the only thing there and the only thing that will ever be there so hes got to be in good shape in any given organization there is enough theta to make it whiz unless someone is keeping it from whizzing livingness is monitored by the amount of arbitraries to which it is devoted the amount of livingness present is reduced by the amount of livingness invested in notlivingness in arbitrary factors it isnt really reduced strictly speaking because it is all recoverable by auditing by asising the notlivingness auditing is recovering the water from the mud pies the theta from the arbitraries the entheta and enmest ta action is the flow of theta coming out of the mud the mud is the bank why cant you audit pc who has screaming ptps because there is too much attention theta invested in the ptps entheta an auditors action is to find some entheta and to invest it in an orderly fashion to recover more theta from entheta when there is never any theta present you have psychology and psychiatry when there is theta present you have overrestimulation and you get ta action there has to be some pc there if the pc is unconscious ie all mud you have to run some cchtype process to get him aware enough to be audited take pc who is pinned down in fox hole he is out of food and ammunition with mortar shells beginning to bracket him in that is how some pcs feel they dont dare take their attention off of pt all you can do is to find out what the mind is doing and parallel it in routine 4 pc can get so keyed in that he doesnt want to continue auditing on r4 person with heavy ptp on the perimeter of his consciousness that you have eased off with lowerlevel processes who was doing fine at getting ris before now wont run as well he gets fewer items they dont fire etc this happens because the pc has attention invested in ptps the same thing happens at lower levels with the ta being stuck there is free attention with which to asis aberrated stable data at levels i ii and iii the pc can run into level iv when neither the auditor the pc nor the process are equipped to handle level iv because there is actually more potential overrestimulation of the pcs ptp on the pcs track than there is in his present time environment when you look at gpms and their ris there is more potential restimulation on the track than there is in present time so the pc could be more restimulated by reason of keyedin gpms and ris than by simply getting knocked off in present time this liability is answered by auditing goals with in this lifetime prepchecks if the pc has given you some goal you could get rid of the level iv potentiality with such prepcheck probably but you will find while doing level iv that prepcheck of this kind is messy to work with when you have already found the pt goal you get to the bottom of the second gpm and end session with the ta at 30 week later the pc comes in with the ta at 50 something has keyed him in midruds dont handle 2wc on what has happened in the intervening week doesnt handle so you go on to list for the next goal and the ta goes down it was the next goal that had the case restimulated the pc went around talking about it i told joe it was _______ or _______ one of them at least was wrong goal and finding the next goal was the only thing that would bring the ta down so auditors at levels i ii and iii should be able to assess an arc break assessment that includes goal restimulated and item restimulated if you hit one of those the ta will come down ptps almost always appear on the goals channels the pc thinks that he is influenced by one or two ris and that his character is formed by one goal in reality it is the whole bank that influences him ptp usually occurs as keyin of an ri or gpm of one or another of the pcs goals chronic ptp is keyedin gpm out of sequence that can cause psychosomatic illness an educated pc will respond to an l4 or case analysis that spots the fact that gpm concerning that illness has keyed in if with good smooth spoton auditing there is ta action then r4 has gotten in the road spend session or two analyzing the case dont try to date gpm because it may span trillions to the x power of years you can date the top and the bottom of the gpm this will cause the gpm to move in find by case analysis what caused some chronic illness an ri gpm an implant gpm an actual goal etc actual goals stick on gpms as locks by themselves they are not aberrative gpms out of sequence gives psychosomatic illness ris can pull chunks of gpms along with them when the pc gets into the wrong gpm because of some similarity the bank isnt all chaotic it is actually pretty neat basically see fig 227 it consists of thirty bricks laid end to end each composed of forty subsections ris when you start thinking of the mind as vehicle of thought you are already licked in handling it it is not vehicle of thought it is made out of things like bricks and tar the spots of tar on the bricks are the implant gpms actual goals thousands of them are stuck onto each brick like lumps of dough the gpms look like black energy masses thats why thetans get restimulated by black energy masses the gpms can get shoved out of order say bricks five through eight have been inserted in between bricks 19 and 20 etc figure 22 actual gpms in the bank graphics inserted level i auditors dont have any business trying to straighten out gpms the meter is necessary because pc restimulated by the bank cant perceive the bank and can audit it hence there are three essential parts of auditing 1 the pcs body 2 the emeter 3 the auditor level ii and iii auditors should be skilled in arc break assessments they can prepcheck goals in this lifetime and can do level ivtype arc break assessments if they can bridge the comm gap with the pc there is one case that cannot be patched up well at levels ii and iii case that has been run badly on r4 that has been thoroughly loused up can only be remedied by having class iv auditor straighten it all up you could prepcheck or analyze wrong goal and find out what it is and perhaps where it belongs etc any case that has had goals run would probably do very well with list 4 and case analysis to sort things out and slip them back into line the bank is full of pictures but the gpms are what need to be sorted out and gotten rid of at lower levels you dont disturb the gpms as rule as you go up you get closer to them until at level iii with service facs you could get rocketreading goal which you may or may not be welladvised to do anything with since it may be the fifth goal back everyones ability to create is so good that they can keep creating whole bank they underestimate their own power to create and stop themselves people get stuck in their own mazes and are now lost in their own creations they will never sort themselves out of the maze by themselves they dont want to be this way even though they are creating what entraps them every now and then thetan in the betweenlives area tries to sort out the stuff but this stuff is all subitsa and without meter or anyone to itsa it to it is hopeless even now knowing all about the gpms one couldnt make it without body or meter cf the buddhist conception that the only condition from which one can reach enlightenment is that of being in human body lrh has tried meterless systems but none has ever succeeded an auditor is necessary because thetan restimulated by his own bank cant see it but an auditor not restimulated can see it with an emeter as an auditor you must realize how slight the barriers are in fact until r4m2 longer seems difficult or complicated to you lrh knows that auditing at this level can happen because he has been through it all the way from the complication to the simplicity so you start at the top and start going back goaloppose ris ris ris making mistakes when things go all weird you straighten it all out and come back up to pt with it all aligned there are different types and styles of auditing but keep in mind the fact that it is the same bank matter what level or what pc you are auditing level iii is the only level that is really dicey since you are moving ris and gpms around in your search for service facs you can audit the only reason you feel you cant is because of difficulties that you conceive to exist
