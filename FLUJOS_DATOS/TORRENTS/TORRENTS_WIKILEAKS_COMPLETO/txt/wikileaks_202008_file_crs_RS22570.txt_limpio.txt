naval base and andersen air force base the island three times the size of washington dc is home to about 171000 residents as the defense department has faced increased tensions on the korean peninsula

agreement to broaden military cooperation mostly dealing with changes and additions to us forces in japan it provides for the relocation of the headquarters of the iii marine expeditionary force and 8000 us marines from okinawa to guam by 2014 approximately 7000 marines will remain on okinawa the cost of the relocation is estimated at 1027 billion of this amount japan pledged to contribute 609 billion including direct financing of facilities and infrastructure on guam7 visiting south korea in june 2008 defense secretary robert gates announced that us troops there would remain at about 28000 instead of carrying out the plan of 2004 to restructure us forces by reducing troop strength from 37000 to 25000 by september 2008 us officials have indicated that further withdrawals of army forces are possible primarily to support the requirements of the army and marine corps in the active theaters of iraq and afghanistan the us air force plans to relocate expeditionary combat support units from south korea and japan to consolidate them on guam httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22570 concerns and issues for congress rationales one rationale for the military buildup on guam is its status as us territory thus the united states is not required to negotiate with sovereign countries on force deployments or face the risks of losing bases or access secretary of defense donald rumsfeld visited guam in november 2003 and expressed support for building up guam as he considered new round of base closings8 in contrast the united states had to close subic bay naval base and clark air force base in the philippines in 1992 and countries like south korea could restrict the use of us forces based there us forces based in guam also do not have to contend with political sensitivities over nuclear powered vessels moreover some countries including allies have raised doubts about their support for us forces in possible conflict between the united states and china another rationale is the expansion of options that guam offers to the evolving us force structure as commander of pacom admiral william fallon expressed his vision for guam as staging area from which ships aircraft and troops can surge to the asian theater he stressed flexibility saying we need to have forces ready to react and we must have builtin flexibility to meet emergencies including disaster relief9 in 2004 the navy

forces relocate to guam the state of its infrastructure has been of concern to some policymakers also guams political leaders have expressed concerns about the impact of additional deployments on its infrastructure including utilities roads and water supplies guams location in the western pacific also requires construction of protection for us forces and assets against typhoons in the fall of 2006 pacom officials briefed guam on some aspects of an undisclosed draft plan for military expansion the integrated military development plan with possible military projects worth total of about 15 billion11 in addition guams remoteness and conditions raise more questions about hosting military families training with other units in hawaii or the west coast and costs for extended logistical support addressing another concern former commander of marine forces pacific urged that guams buildup include more than infrastructure to develop also human capital communities and the environment12

possible conflict china has variety of ballistic missiles that could target guam north korea reportedly has developed new intermediate range ballistic missile taepodongx that could reach guam any such vulnerabilities could raise requirements for both counterterrorism measures and missile defense also some say that guam is still too distant from flash points in the asia and advocate closer cooperation with countries such as singapore australia the philippines and japan13 building up the us presence in those countries could enhance alliances or partnerships increase interoperability and reduce costs for the united states alliances the guam integrated military development plan parts of which were reported in october 2006 indicated that us army units withdrawn from south korea are not likely to be stationed on guam14 the pentagons restructuring plan reportedly intended to maintain us air power in south korea particularly the three squadrons of f16 fighters based at osan air base an emphasis on us offshore forces in south korean security could affect decisions regarding the mix of us forces based on guam and rotated into guam from other bases this might especially be true of heavy bombers which the air force rotates into guam from bases in the united states concerns about httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22570 maintaining deterrence after us reductions of ground forces might lead pacom to increase exercises of heavy bombers andor aircraft carrier strike groups near korea15 under the usjapan security treaty us concerns involve possible conflict between china and japan over their competing claims to the senkaku islands called diaoyu islands by china in the east china sea the united states administered the islands after world war ii and turned them over to japanese administration in 1972 clinton and bush administration officials have stated that the senkakus fall under the scope of the usjapan alliance16 in september 2005 the pla navy deployed five naval ships to the disputed area in the east china sea with competing territorial and oil claims for training guam has provided valuable and less constrained airspace and bombing ranges for the air forces of japan thailand singapore south korea and australia china chinas civilian and military commentators commonly suspect that the us defense buildup on guam partly has been aimed at china which has threatened to use the peoples liberation army pla against taiwan us policy on helping taiwans selfdefense is governed not by defense treaty but by the taiwan relations act tra pl 968 some concerns about the plas accelerated modernization since the taiwan strait crisis of 19951996 also have expanded beyond focus on taiwan to include pla preparations for possible conflicts with the united states and japan in southeast asia despite reduced tensions since the mid1990s china claims much of the south china sea as well as the disputed spratly and paracel islands in that sea as its sovereign territory 13 thomas donnelly rebasing revisited american enterprise institute december 2004 14 murayama kohei us to triple troops in guam but earlier than 2010 for marines kyodo news october 3 2006 15

submarine force both nuclearpowered and dieselelectric in november 2004 the pla navy sent hanclass nuclear attack submarine to waters off guam before intruding into japans territorial water17 in april 2007 pacom commander admiral timothy keating visited guam and acknowledged that its defense buildup was partly due to concerns about any tensions over taiwan and need to deter north korea at the same time he stressed us transparency saying were not doing this buildup under the cover of darkness18 still policy challenge has been to deter any aggression by china as well as to assure it that us goal is closer cooperation with this rising power as responsible stakeholder the commander of pacific air forces said in may 2005 that the plas modernization gave him pause for interest but did not make difference in significant force redeployment19 also in 2006 guam became focal point for improving military tomilitary relations with china to blunt charges that guams buildup targets china pacoms commander admiral fallon invited pla observers to the us valiant shield exercise that brought three aircraft carriers to waters off guam in june 2006 the pla navy sent deputy chief of staff and
