6404c16 shspec16 auditing by lists the auditor is success as magazine fred hare is the editor one of the goals series has turned out to be nonexistent why does it always take lrh to find these things it puts lot of responsibility on him this puts some extra strain on his case he is currently in zone of overcorrection looking so hard for things wrong that all he finds is invalidation of what is right auditing by list is done at level iii the needle level lower levels are tone arm levels few auditors getting started in auditing are aware of the skill needed for good metering with the needle unlike the ta the needle can be upset by session events although the ta can show if the pc is not getting gain but the process has lot to do with the ta too the needle registers first the session and second the process or reaction of the pc ta is not direct representation of the reaction of the pc to the session the ta does not analyze the session beyond saying whether the pc is getting gain not so the needle which first and foremost registers the session and secondarily registers the process or reaction of the pc the only difficult manifestation of the needle for the auditor to learn to cope with is the dirty needle its source is always the auditor nothing else it traces back to the auditors failure to handle the auditing comm cycle or the larger auditing cycle the absolute of never having the pcs needle dirty is unattainable but it is the auditors reaction that produces the dirty needle by not accepting his answer not acknowledging cutting his comm cycle or whatever level iii is almost totally devoted to needle at this level if you follow the needle you will get ta action and if you dont you wont the pc may have charge on question he may have interest in it if so the needle will not register if you miss seeing the noreaction and give the question again you get read by virtue of the pcs considerations protest or whatever the first reaction of the needle is to the session the second reaction of the needle is to the process or question if the auditor overlooks this the pc goes out of session and the needle will never clean up on the question etc therefore you dont let auditors at level iii assess anything since if they dont realize the readonsessionfirst rule they can foul up arc break assessments repeatedly and worsen the arc break the mark v emeter is beautifully balanced to read maximally on thought and minimally on body motions it reads just below the pcs reality at level where the pc can have reality the meter has greater degree of workability than you will ever need so calls for improvement are passe bad meter wont give you needle response on thought when needle is moving fast you can miss reads because the inertia of the needle prevents manifestation if the needle is quiet it is more sensitive if someone can really handle meter at level iii he will have trouble with assessments at level iv at level iii you have to learn to keep the needle clean by keeping the session good so the session at time gets in the road of the needle reads that you ars getting as you audit cleaning clean causes the pc to go against the session the needle is now not reading his bank it is reading his reaction in the session the auditor must know first that this can happen and second what to do when it does and how it manifests lrh claims to have made all these errors with the additional difficulty of not knowing that they were mistakes any change of pace of the needle is read it will be discoverable by the pc if it read on the meter on level vi there comes time when the pc stops reading well on the meter anyway because he doesnt have much reactive mind left and the pcs postulates in session are what give rocket reads if one has an ability with which one has lots of problems there is reactivity mixed up in it giving problems and taking the power out of the ability getting rid of the reactivity gives person the full scope of his ability the magnitude of his performance is then much greater pc who fears that he will lose his creative ability by getting rid of the bank needs to know this at level iii of course there isnt too much of problem the being is mostly reactive and the needle behaves pretty well on reactivity and doesnt get in your face too much on the session somebody can still be upset about the session and sometimes still even read bit on the needle at level iii the reactive read is larger than the analytical read but you have to be able to keep the needle clean by keeping the comm cycle straight and you have to be able to tell when the pc is running right and not in need of sessioncorrecting dont harass the pc when things are going all right and above all dont blame the pc for the strange behavior of the needle be aware that something has happened in the session that is showing up on the needle knowing these data you can do auditing by list auditing by lists has nothing to do with assessment on auditing by lists you are not interested in which level or item of the list reads best you are simply interested in going down the list and making sure that each one in turn is cleaned up if it reads youre not trying to go down list and find one of those levels assessment means reading down list to find which item reads best because that is the item auditing by list is effort to find the item it is just making sure that each question taken up in turn is longer reading which requires reading the question to find out if it reads and then continuing to get answers until the question longer reads noticing that the question is longer reading and passing on to the next differentiation between reads on the list question and session reads caused by the pcs reaction to something going on in session is necessary part of this action so you clean up the right things on the above cf method 3 and 5 list handling what if the needle gives one indication and the pc says something else for instance the pc may say and the meter reads then clean up possible session outnesses with protest inval and cleaning clean then recheck the question this keeps the pc from being invalidated by your insistence on somethings being there these lists by which you are auditing are nothing more than the plusminus misdemeanors and upsets that person could have an auditor should be able to make up list for particular pc only few prepared lists can be done over and over again l1 and l4 are the lists used for auditing by list with the questions asked for broad scope you can alternately clean l1 and l4 and keep getting different areas cleaned up rudiments and prepchecking are in fact kind of auditing by lists level iii is that level where you clean the list if one can get through that then he can assess at level iv you are using list in different way you are looking for the level to use in looking for service fac the reads that you get at level iii are much tinier than what you will get at level vi so dont take little reads at level vi pc who has been arc breaky gets all his bpc cleaned up and will come up shining when audited by list on l1 and l4
