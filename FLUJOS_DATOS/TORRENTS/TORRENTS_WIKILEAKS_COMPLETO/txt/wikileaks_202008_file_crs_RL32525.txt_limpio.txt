m kaiser specialist in american national government government and finance division congressional oversight of intelligence current structure and alternatives summary interest in congressional oversight of intelligence has risen again in the 110th congress in part because of the house democratic majoritys pledge to enact the remaining recommendations from the us national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states commonly known as the 911 commission its 2004 conclusions set the stage for reconsideration of the problems affecting congresss structure in this area the commissions unanimous report covering many issues concluded that congressional oversight of intelligence was dysfunctional and proposed two distinct solutions these were 1 creation of joint committee on intelligence jci modeled after the defunct joint committee on atomic energy jcae with authority to report legislation to each chamber or 2 enhanced status and power for the existing select committees on intelligence by making them standing committees and granting both authorization and appropriations power congresss interest in joint committee on intelligence dates to 1948 and the early years of the central intelligence agency cia and director of central intelligence dci similar recommendations have arisen in the meantime although the lions share were made before separate intelligence committees were established in the house 1977 and senate 1976 the numerous proposals for jci which would end the two existing intelligence panels moreover vary in their specifics and raise competing viewpoints over practical matters and matters of principle although it did not adopt either of the 911 commission proposals congress has pursued other initiatives to change its intelligence oversight structure and capabilities in the 110th congress the house altered its arrangements hres 35 when it created an advisory select intelligence oversight panel on the appropriations committee hybrid structure that combines members of the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the committee on appropriations the senate has also changed its relationship between appropriations and intelligence and its intelligence committee has advanced others in this regard other proposals some with long heritage include clarifying the independent audit authority of the government accountability office gao over the intelligence community particularly the cia placing the cia expressly under the government performance and results act increasing the coordinative capabilities and reporting of relevant inspectors general igs and adding new ig covering the entire intelligence community and separate ones for certain defense department entities this report first

ways to oversee intelligence an often perplexing and always difficult responsibility because of the secrecy and sensitivity surrounding intelligence findings conclusions dissemination and sources and methods1 the first oversight proposal to create joint committee on intelligence jci appeared in 19482 this was just one year after the establishment of the cental intelligence agency cia and the office of director of central intelligence dci both integral parts of the most farreaching executive reorganization in united states history3 numerous initiatives to change congresss oversight structure have materialized in the meantime including most importantly the creation of parallel select committees on intelligence in both chambers nonetheless congresss oversight capability in this area has been questioned the 911 commissions report released in 2004 notably concluded that congressional oversight of intelligence was dysfunctional and recommended either merger of appropriations and authorization powers into each select committee or the creation of joint committee on intelligence4 since then the houses and senates actions modifying each bodys own structure have followed different paths diverging not only from the 911 commission proposals but also from each other5 1 see among other sources crs report rl32617 perspective on congresss oversight function by walter j

often cited as an organizational model for joint intelligence panel as it has been for the 911 commission in addition the report looks at recent actions such as the creation of new and possibly unique in the history of congress intelligence oversight panel on the house appropriations committee consisting of members from both the parent committee and the select committee on intelligence the new panel would make recommendations regarding the annual intelligence community appropriations to the defense appropriations subcommittee this report also covers separate developments in the senate including memorandum of agreement moa in 2007 designed to improve coordination and transparency between the intelligence committee which handles authorizations for the intelligence community and the appropriations committee which handles appropriations for the same other ways seen as strengthening oversight in this field would be to 1 clarify and expand the authority of government accountability office gao over the intelligence community particularly the cia 2 remove the agencys exemption from coverage of the government performance and results act and 3 increase coordination and strengthen reporting requirements among the relevant offices of inspector general house and senate select committees on intelligence joint committee on intelligence would replace the current house permanent

intelligence community and concluded that effective congressional oversight was lacking the panels were set up to consolidate legislative and oversight authority over the entire intelligence community supplanting the fragmented system at the time which relied exclusively on disparate standing committees although titled select the intelligence panels are hybrids of standing and select committees adopting characteristics of both types for instance the panels have only temporary membership as select committees have because they are usually shortterm constructions yet each panel holds authority to report legislation to its own chamber power usually reserved to standing committees jurisdiction and authority the intelligence committees have broad jurisdiction over the intelligence community and report authorizations and other legislation for consideration by their respective chambers recent change in the house places three members of the intelligence committee on new select intelligence oversight panel on the appropriations committee hres 35 110th congress the new panel which appears unprecedented in the history of congress is to study and make recommendations to relevant appropriations subcommittees this includes the defense appropriations subcommittee which continues to prepare the annual intelligence community budget as part of the classified annex to the bill making appropriations for the department of defense most of the jurisdiction of the current intelligence committees is shared the select committees hold exclusive authorizing and legislative powers

jurisdictions for the intelligence community the house panels domain however also extends over an area that the senates does not tactical intelligence and intelligencerelated activities which covers tactical military intelligence in another departure the house select committee has been given authority to review and study on an exclusive basis the sources and methods of entities in the intelligence community8 membership and leadership the membership of the committees has been limited in time staggered and connected to the standing committee system and political party system in congress these features moreover differ between the two panels each select committee for instance reserves seats for members from the chambers committees on appropriations armed services foreign affairsforeign relations and judiciary the specifics differ however the senate requires two persons majority and minority member from each of these standing committees while the house calls for only one member from each standing committee with overlapping jurisdiction the two panels also differ in size 21 on the house panel and 15 on the senate counterpart plus ex officio members on each tenure and other membership features including partisan composition and leadership arrangements since its inception the senate panel has had only one more member from the majority party than the minority an eighttoseven ratio and its vice chairman who takes over if the chair is unavailable must come from the minority party the house select committee in contrast reflected the full chamber party ratio when it was established in 1977 twotoone plus one resulting in an initial ninetofour majorityminority party membership on the panel in the meantime however the minority party has been granted additional seats on the committee and the majorityminority party ratio in the full house has grown closer the result is select committee membership party ratio of 12to9 in the 110th congress secrecy controls the committees also have different secrecy arrangements regarding controls over their classified holdings secrecy oaths distinguish the two chambers all members of the house including of course those on the intelligence committee must swear or affirm not to disclose classified information except as authorized by the rules of the chamber the current oath is modeled after previous one which had been required only for the members of the house permanent select committee on intelligence the senate does not impose similar obligation on its members9 8 house rule 3l added by hres 5 107th cong january 3 2001 9 crs report rs20748 protection of classified information by congress practices and proposals by frederick m kaiser crs5 nonmember access to classified materials also separates the two panels the house committee has more detailed and exacting set of requirements for non members than its senate counterpart in addition the senate panel is authorized to disclose classified information publicly on its own following elaborate procedures in which the president and the full senate have an opportunity to act by comparison the house select committee cannot do so if the president objects to its release in that case the house itself makes the determination by majority vote joint committee on atomic energy as model the joint committee on atomic energy jcae set up by the atomic energy act of 1946 along with the atomic energy commission pl 585 60 stat 772773 is often cited as an appropriate organizational model for joint committee on intelligence reference the 911 commission also adopted10 the jcae an 18 member panel composed of an equal number of members from each house of congress held authority to report legislation to the floor of both chambers power unique among joint committees11 many reasons have been offered for considering the jcae as model favorable record for keeping highly confidential material secret largely bipartisan approach to policymaking considerable unity among its members close working relationship with the executive here the atomic energy commission in this secretive and sensitive area consolidated jurisdiction for growing field explicit comprehensive oversight mandate supported by then unprecedented directive that the executive keep the joint committee fully and currently informed and ability to streamline the legislative process in general and to act rapidly if necessary in particular instances 10 for background and further citations on the jcae see crs report rl32538 911 commission recommendations joint committee on atomic energy model for congressional oversight by christopher m davis harold p green and allen rosenthal government of the atom the integration of powers new york atherton press 1963 and kaiser proposed joint committee on intelligence pp 138141 11 one caveat to the unique status of the jcae is the temporary joint committee on deficit reduction it was authorized to report legislation but only on narrow subject and on case bycase basis in contrast to the jcae this joint panel was shortterm periodic addition to congress set up by the grammrudmanhollings act of 1985 the panel could come into existence only when legislation on budget sequestration was needed and was empowered to report only joint resolution setting forth specified reports from the directors of the office of management and budget and the congressional budget office pl 99 177 99 stat 1037 1100 1985 this provision apparently was never activated and was not included in the 1987 revision of grh crs6 given these attributes the joint committee became formidable congressional panel in its prime jcae was even considered by some as probably the most powerful congressional committee in the history of the nation12 despite this or perhaps because of it the jcae was abolished in 1977 nearly 30 years after its birth it was evidently the victim of number of reinforcing developments concerns inside and outside congress about jcaes close some thought cozy relationship with the executive agency it was overseeing changing executive branch conditions such as the breakup of the atomic energy commission into the nuclear regulatory commission and the energy research and development administration now the department of energy new rivals in congress as the expanding nature of atomic energy and nuclear power extended into the jurisdictions of number of house and senate committees efforts in the senate at the time to realign and consolidate standing committee jurisdictions and reduce the number of assignments for each member and relatively high number of vacancies on the jcae six of the 18 seats13 proposed joint committee on intelligence characteristics recommendations to create joint committee on intelligence have surfaced over nearly five decades most predating the establishment of the two select committees on intelligence in the mid1970s although many of these suggestions including that from the 911 commission have followed the design of the joint committee on atomic energy not all have consequently the specifics in the blueprints have varied in number of fundamental ways differences extend to 1 the range and exclusivity of the panels jurisdiction 2 makeup of their membership 3 selection and rotation of chairmen 4 possibility of and characteristics of vice chairmanship 5 requirements for representation of certain other committees as well as atlarge members 6 special secrecy requirements for members and staff including secrecy oath and security clearances 7 staff size method of selection and restrictions on activities 8 official disclosures of classified information 9 mechanisms for investigating suspected unauthorized disclosures of such information and 10 access by nonmembers to the joint committees classified holdings even suggested methods of establishment have varied methods of establishment joint committee on intelligence could be created by concurrent resolution joint resolution or regular bill the joint committee on atomic energy for instance was established by public law through the regular bill process ie the atomic energy act of 1946 pl 580 60 stat 772773 concurrent resolution has the advantage for its proponents of requiring only the approval of congress while joint resolution or regular bill must be signed by 12 green and rosenthal government of the atom p 266 13 kaiser proposed joint committee on intelligence pp 140141 crs7 the president or his veto overridden joint resolution or bill however may offer certain benefits to its supporters over concurrent resolution number of existing provisions in public law especially ones dealing with intelligence reporting requirements to congress designates the house and senate select committees on intelligence as recipients eg the intelligence oversight provisions and the reporting requirements for the cia inspector general codified at 50 usc 413415 and 50 usc 403q respectively bill or joint resolution when creating joint committee could amend these statutory provisions whereas concurrent resolution could not do so directly but concurrent resolution although solely congressional device could have the same effect by changing the rules of both chambers concurrent resolution could recognize that the powers authority and jurisdiction of the former select committees would be transferred to new joint committee jurisdiction and authority joint intelligence committee could consolidate jurisdiction for the entire intelligence community extending to all intelligence entities as well as intelligence and intelligencerelated activities including significant anticipated activities ie covert operations legislative authority over intelligence could be shared for all entities with overlapping jurisdiction or as is now the case in the house and senate it could be held exclusively for certain specified components eg cia and dni while being shared for others membership bicameral body requires equal membership from both the senate and house in addition to bicameralism joint committee on intelligence could be directed to accommodate three other criteria bipartisanship representation of specified standing committees and atlarge selection of members for example the membership from each chamber could be required to have representatives from standing committees with overlapping jurisdiction eg appropriations armed services foreign affairsforeign relations and judiciary as both the house and senate intelligence committees do now this selection might include both majority and minority party member from each represented committee jci could also call for specified number of members selected at large as the senate intelligence panel does now as an illustration an 18member jci could include nine senators and nine representatives with five majority and four minority party members from each chamber at least one member but not more than two could come from each of the four committees with overlapping jurisdiction this option maximum of eight from each chamber would still allow for one selection at large from each house by comparison larger committee or panel requiring only single member from each of the specified standing committees would allow for more members to be selected atlarge provision could also be made for ex officio members particularly the majority and minority party leaders from the senate and the speaker and minority leader from the house crs8 terms and rotation membership on the joint committee could have term limits or be given maximum length of service six or eight years as the house and senate intelligence committees have had or shorter or longer terms under term limits the total time on the committee might be measured either by continuous service or by non continuous service accumulated over specified number of congresses eg total of eight years over six congresses if jci had maximum lengths of service it could be treated as temporary assignment which might not count against other standing committee assignments in each chamber by comparison membership on the jci could be permanent14 if so it might be treated as if it were standing committee in each chamber counting against other committee assignments member terms could also be staggered so that new members would arrive with each new congress staggered terms however would mean that portion of the original membership could not serve the maximum period at least not as part of the original composition leadership the chair selected at the beginning of each congress or each session as some proposals called for could alternate between the two chambers andor political parties vice chairmanship could also be established this officer would replace the chair when he or she is absent as occurs now on the senate intelligence committee the vice chair could be member of the other body andor the other political party secrecy controls various types of secrecy controls could be applied to joint committee on intelligence to regulate access to its classified holdings by noncommittee members protect against the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and allow its authorized release such controls could 1 set requirements for determining access by nonmembers 2 require security clearances oaths andor secrecy agreements for committee members and staff and 3 provide for investigation of suspected security breaches conducted by the house and senate ethics committees controls could also spell out procedures for disclosing classified information to which the president objects either by joint committee itself by the joint committee in concert with either or both chambers or by either or both chambers as the final arbiter one of five distinct options might be adopted 1 the joint committee on intelligence could act alone 2 the panel could act only after one house responded to request from it to release classified information 3 the jci could act only after both houses responded 4 single house could disclose the information or 5 both chambers would have to agree to do so currently 14 the 911 commission referring to both joint committee on intelligence and new standing committee in each house recommended that members should serve indefinitely on the committees without set terms thereby letting them accumulate expertise 911 commission report p 421 crs9 disclosure procedures differ between the house and senate intelligence panels the house select committee does not have authority to release classified information on its own the full house must act to disclose it at the request of its intelligence panel if the president objects to the release on the senate side the select committee may disclose classified information on its own after both the president and full senate have acted15 it appears that this procedure has not been used by the senate panel staffing the number of staff on new jci would presumably be smaller than the combined total for both the house and senate intelligence committees hiring could be accomplished in seven different ways 1 by the majority party on the full jci 2 by the majority party from each chamber on the committee 3 by full committee vote 4 by the majority party and minority party separately 5 by the chair alone 6 by the chair and vice chairranking minority member together or 7 by individual members with each legislator selecting single staff member additionally staff could be selected by combination of several compatible ways eg individual member selections for some plus committeewide selections for others the staff could also be required to meet certain agreed upon criteria set by the committee such as fitness for the duties and without regard to party affiliation16 staffers could be required to have an appropriate security clearance for top secret and access to sensitive compartmented information as is now mandated by both house and senate select committees they could also be directed to sign nondisclosure or secrecy agreement not to reveal classified information again requirement for the staff of both intelligence panels budget and funding the budget for joint committee on intelligence would presumably be smaller than the combined budgets of the house and senate intelligence panels funding could be shared by both chambers deriving equally from the contingent funds of the senate and house pros and cons differences over the establishment of joint committee on intelligence tie into practical matters as well as matters of principle 15 the select committees charter provides for three responses from the full senate to an intelligence committee request to release classified information if the president objects to it the chamber can 1 approve the disclosure 2 disapprove the disclosure or 3 refer all or any portion of the matter back to the committee in which case the committee shall make the final determination with respect to the public disclosure of the information in question sec 8b5 sres 400 94th cong 2nd sess 16 the 911 commission for instance recommended that the staff of this committee should be nonpartisan and work for the entire committee and not for individual members 911 commission report p 420 crs10 pros supporters of joint committee on intelligence argue that it would make for more effective and efficient overseer than the current arrangement which the 911 commission concluded is now dysfunctional because of limitations on the two select committees17 according to its proponents single joint committee housing fewer members and staff than the two existing ones combined would strengthen oversight of intelligence for four primary reasons the executive would be more open and forthright with single small oversight body than with two with larger combined membership the legislators and staff on the jci recognizing that there is other authorizing panel to conduct oversight would attach greater importance to this responsibility committee composed of legislators from both chambers could better integrate and take advantage of congressional expertise and experience in the field and jci could be established with fewer restraints and restrictions than the separate select committees now have improve coordination cooperation and comity between the house and senate and among other relevant committees with overlapping jurisdiction in both chambers joint committee could serve as conduit of information and advice and as facilitator for policy formulation between the two chambers as well as between the political parties jci could also encourage mutual respect and trust between the chambers and parties this could occur by treating all of its members equally in committee leadership posts and voting by merging the stands of members of both houses in committee deliberations and decisions by taking joint committee consensus on legislation endorsed by members of both chambers to the floor of each house and by providing an opportunity for house members to be involved if only marginally and informally in senate function ie confirmation of presidential nominees streamline the legislative process because only one committee rather than two would have to consider and report legislative proposals and authorizations to the floors of both chambers members from the same joint committee moreover might comprise all or majority of the membership of conference committees which 17 competing views on joint committee on intelligence are available from members and committees of congress among other sources supportive arguments are included in us congress senate temporary select committee to study the senate committee system report

and hrept 100433 100th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1987 p 583 crs11 might be less necessary in the first place because of the bicameral bipartisan makeup of joint committee respond rapidly to investigate major development when conditions dictated increase the stature of overseeing and legislating on intelligence matters and thus make serving on an intelligence panel more attractive and important than on either select committee this could result from making the joint committee the equivalent of standing committee by granting it permanency and authority to report legislation to each chamber and giving the members indefinite tenure jci with these characteristics would be unique in the current era the first of its kind since 1977 and apparently one of only few in the history of congress also elevating its stature make for more efficient government single panel versus two would probably reduce the amount of time that the administration and intelligence officials would spend on capitol hill testifying briefing notifying and meeting with members and panels improve the protection of classified information in congresss possession smaller number of legislators and staff on joint committee would have access to it and single office would be easier to secure encourage trust between congress and the executive in this sensitive field this could occur by reducing the number of panels members and staff with access to such highly classified information and by easing the cooperative relationship between the branches by way of single committee instead of two pinpoint responsibility in congress for oversight and legislation affecting intelligence thereby avoiding any confusion or uncertainty about it cut back the total number of committee seats for legislators in the house and senate combined by replacing the two panels with single committee with fewer seats for instance new 18member joint committee with nine senators and representatives would be half the size of the combined total of 37 on the two select committees the replacement would modestly help reduce the number of legislators holding too many committee assignments andor being spread too thin reducing the number of seats available for representatives and senators would allow them to concentrate on one less committee assignment reduce costs because of fewer staff and single suite of offices crs12 cons critics of proposals for replacing the current house and senate intelligence committees with single joint committee contend that it would weaken oversight and compromise fundamental feature of the congress namely two different and sometimes competing bodies18 as viewed by its opponents jci would adversely affect oversight of intelligence this would occur by reducing the number of legislators and staff who have an incentive and opportunity to conduct oversight and by reducing the number of separate panels with different characteristics and incentive structures to conduct it in this regard the number of committees to which the president reports covert action plans is now only two the select committees on intelligence having been reduced from eight in 1980 at the request of the executive undercut the legislative benefits eg longer deliberation time and different viewpoints of relying on two committees from separate and distinctive chambers this usual situation allows two panels each reflecting different chambers types of constituencies and electoral schedules to examine the same legislation and authorizations and conduct oversight from different vantage points based on their own priorities and demands the loss of second view would be felt not only in the initial committee deliberations but also in later conference committee action which might be dominated by joint committee members cause loss in continuity stability and experience this would be especially evident in joint committee leadership if the chair and ranking member or vice chair rotated every two years this in turn would make membership on the joint committee less desirable than on other panels the turnover could also extend to staff because of the frequent change in leadership finally this loss of stability and experience could hamper congresss ability to influence public policy and compete with the executive result in more acute impact on congress if joint committee develops close and supportive relationship with the executive entities it oversees rather than neutral and critical one with single panel congress would have only one locus for oversight and 18 criticisms and concerns

two if this happens the impact on congress on oversight and on legislation would be more extensive and significant because of the absence of possible balance from second committee operate contrary to the longterm tendency to end reliance on joint committees either by abolishing them or not establishing them in the first place19 jci if authorized to report legislation to the floor of both houses would be unique currently it would be the only such empowered joint committee since 1977 when the jcae was abolished and one of the few in the history of the congress joint committee on intelligence would also raise the prospect of similar panels for other policy areas including homeland security which have wideranging jurisdictions that cross number of executive agencies and programs along with congressional committee jurisdictions harbor uncertainty regarding confirmation of presidential nominees it might be unclear whether house members should play any role at all in the process or if so perhaps only at certain stages eg initial meetings and interviews background investigations formal hearings artificially make the political parties equal or nearly so this could occur even though the differences in party ratios in each chamber could be substantial as they have been in the past artificially make the two chambers equal on the joint committee the number of members from each chamber would be the same even though the house is more than four times larger than the senate because of this situation representatives would have proportionately fewer opportunities to serve on joint committee than senators cut back the possibility of serving on an intelligence panel for all members of congress especially if there are term limits on jci membership this reduction in numbers would in turn reduce the diversity and representational characteristics of the membership compared to two separate committees bring about change in the different jurisdictions that the current select committees now hold the house panel having broader jurisdiction than its senate counterpart 19 the 911 commission p 421 for instance did not advocate joint committee for homeland security instead it called for consolidating jurisdiction in permanent standing committee in each chamber for additional discussion on such transformation see crs report rs21901 house select committee on homeland security possible questions raised if the panel were to be reconstituted as standing committee by judy schneider crs14 not necessarily improve protection of classified information over the current two select committees their controls over it are exacting and their reputations in this regard are good jci could also require new procedures for the public release of classified intelligence information held by the joint committee this would raise the prospect of and cause disagreement over whether the joint committee alone could do so whether one chamber could do so or whether both houses must act together as the final arbiter add confusion and conflict over investigations of suspected unauthorized disclosures of classified information this could arise for instance if the ethics committee from one chamber conducted investigations which involved members of the other body even if only tangentially and in an initial inquiry raise practical difficulties in setting meeting schedules times and locations for panel members from two different chambers of congress alternatives to joint committee there are other options which might enhance and regularize congressional oversight of intelligence these changes both formal and informal could have an impact not only on the structure of the current select committees on intelligence but also on their relationship with other committees and members in its respective chamber and its counterparts in the opposite chamber as well as the relationship between the legislature and the executive changing the select committees structure and powers the most direct and immediate among the options to increase and improve oversight of intelligence would be ways to enhance the status stature and resources of the existing select committees on intelligence or replace them with standing committees20 this might be accomplished through several different and sometimes competing means 20 the 911 commission emphasized the need for substantial change in congressional oversight either by establishing joint committee or by creating single committee in each house of congress combining authorization and appropriating authorities each panel would be standing committee and hold subpoena authority the membership would be relatively small and serve without term limits its composition would be nearly equal between the parties with the majority having only one more member than the minority and representing four panels with overlapping jurisdiction ie armed services judiciary foreign affairs and the defense appropriations subcommittee with one seat each on the new committee 911 commission report p 420421 for further information and analysis see crs report rs21908 senate select committee on intelligence term limits and assignment limitations by judy schneider crs15 grant the current select committees status as standing committees along with indefinite tenure for their membership to reduce turnover increase experience stability and continuity and make membership on the panel more attractive expand the authority of such committees giving them power to report appropriations as well as authorizations and to hold subpoena authority on their own place members of the select committee on intelligence on their chambers appropriations subcommittee on defense or create new appropriations subcommittee on intelligence possibly including intelligence committee members with comprehensive jurisdiction over ic appropriations establish special advisory and oversight body on the appropriations committee combining intelligence committee and appropriations committee members as the house has done under this plan the new panel would report its findings and recommendations for ic funding to the defense or other appropriate subcommittee thereby modestly expanding the effective jurisdiction and influence of the select committee21 add professional staff hire temporary consultants set up shortterm task forces andor increase the use of congressional support agencies especially in fields where the panels might require new or expanded expertise and skills although neither the house nor the senate adopted the 911 commission recommendations for intelligence oversight other changes have occurred through variety of mechanisms these include the chambers leadership existing committees and senate bipartisan working group these efforts have led to the senates restructuring its oversight panels and each chamber instituting new working arrangements between its intelligence and appropriations panels senate action the senates response to the 911 commission and other recommendations for oversight of intelligence has proceeded through several phases initial changes in 2004 several of these suggestions were approved by the senate on october 9 2004 when it agreed to sres 445 108th congress affecting its oversight of intelligence the resolution eliminated certain restrictions on serving 21 this proposal materialized in 2007 in the house with members of the intelligence committee serving on special oversight panel on the appropriations committee hres 35 110th congress the concept was raised in late 2006 by rep nancy pelosi then house minority leader and prospective speaker of the house tim starks pelosi wants intelligence appropriations oversight panel cqcom dec 14 2006 david

committee reduced the number of members from 17 to 15 and modified security procedures regarding the public disclosure of classified information sres 445 however did not transfer authority and jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations to the intelligence committee instead it created an intelligence subcommittee on the senate appropriations committee structural changes involving the committees on intelligence and appropriations in 2007 additional steps have been taken in the 110th congress prominent one is memorandum of agreement moa designed to improve coordination and transparency between the intelligence committee and appropriations committee22 the moa signed by the chairman of the select committee but not its ranking minority member and the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate appropriations committee and its defense subcommittee advanced several changes to accomplish this notify staff and allow them to attend the intelligence hearings of the other body allow each intelligence committee member who is also an appropriator to bring his or her intelligence staff members to appropriations committee hearings and markups permit all senators and cleared staff of one committee to review the bill report and classified annex of the other before action is taken and give the chairmen and ranking minority members of each the committee the opportunity to appear before the other panel to present their views prior to the markup of either the intelligence authorization or appropriations bills23 notwithstanding the effort the effectiveness of the new arrangements under the memorandum of agreement has elicited differing impressions the chairman of the senate intelligence committee emphasized that the agreement has made great strides toward bringing our committees together in unity of effort that was lacking before24 competing interpretation was offered by the intelligence committees ranking minority member who is also an appropriator he determined that the moa 22 hon john d rockefeller chairman opening statement in us congress senate select committee on intelligence congressional oversight hearing 110th cong 1st sess

synthesis of the two25 proposed changes involving the committees on intelligence and appropriations in 2008 in march 2008 14 of the 15 members of the senate select committee on intelligence led by chairman rockefeller and vice chairman christopher s bond offered another proposal to the senate leadership26 it called for the establishment of subcommittee on intelligence on the appropriations committee which would include members of the intelligence committee and would appropriate all funds for the national intelligence program nip as opposed to the current situation where such appropriations are divided among several appropriations subcommittees in defense of this option senators rockefeller and bond reminded the senate leadership that the 911 commissions bolder recommendation to consolidate authorization and appropriations authority in the ssci was considered and rejected by the senate during consideration of s res 445 in october 200427 this plan for new appropriations intelligence subcommittee was opposed by the leadership of the senate appropriations committee its chairman robert c byrd and ranking member thad cochran noted that other changes in oversight including those by way of the 2007 mou have been put into effect28 they argued that the proposed intelligence appropriations subcommittee led by members of the intelligence committee would prove counterproductive we strongly believe that consolidating authority over intelligence in smaller group of senators is precisely the wrong way to improve the senates oversight of intelligence29 the senators added that the separation of authorization and appropriations functions should be maintained and that consolidating appropriations for the entire nip in one subcommittee would have an adverse impact on other policies such as foreign policy that are handled by different subcommittees30 25 hon christopher s bond opening statement in senate intelligence committee congressional

appropriations on the new appropriations subcommittee on intelligence sres 655 would also include the chairman and ranking member of the defense appropriations subcommittee and as ex officio members the chairman and vice chairman of the intelligence committee in introducing the resolution senator bond emphasized that on the seventh anniversary of 911 it is noteworthy that there remains one unaddressed 911 commission recommendation and that is to reform the legislative branchs oversight of intelligence and terrorism activities which the commission rightly described as dysfunctional32 as an alternative to the bolder 911 commission recommendations which had been rejected the senator argued that many of us believe there is better less disruptive way to achieve reform through carefully constructive intelligence appropriations subcommittee33 house action in the house the option to consolidate authority by reserving seats for intelligence committee members on the defense appropriations subcommittee was raised at the end of the 109th congress by representative nancy pelosi then house minority leader and presumptive speaker of the house in the 110th congress34 the final product was variation on this theme hres 35 110th congress which passed the house on january 9 2007 created new select intelligence oversight panel consisting of 13 members and an eighttofive inter party ratio with three representatives from the intelligence committee joining 10 from appropriations including the chairman and ranking minority member of the full committee the chairman and ranking minority member of the defense subcommittee and six additional members from appropriations this special panel is authorized to study and make recommendations to all appropriations subcommittees on relevant areas specifically the annual intelligence appropriations to the defense subcommittee which retains authority to report it to the full committee concerns about restructuring the intelligence committees the set of changes producing restructured and strengthened intelligence committee in each chamber as called for by the 911 commission might also generate concerns and criticisms new standing committee smaller than the existing select committees in each chamber if combined with representation from four standing committees with overlapping membership and indefinite tenure for its members would substantially reduce 1 the number of members in each chamber serving on an intelligence panel at any one time 2 the number of atlarge seats available 3 the 31 sres 655 110th cong 2nd

likelihood of member finding seat on the committee these changes in tandem would also lead to fewer former members from the committee thus reducing the ability of the full chamber and nonmembers to be knowledgeable about how the intelligence community operates and intelligence policy and it could result in decline of the ability to question if not challenge the committee as well as the executive arguably this could result in the prospect of closed system making it easier for the intelligence panels to dominate the agenda and debate in their respective chambers and in the full congress second set of cautions might surround the proposed new authority particularly adding appropriations to its authorizing control and independent subpoena power such subpoena authority which could cover either or both materials and individual testimony would be held and used without needing approval in each instance by the chamber this might be seen as infringing on an important fullchamber power and removing check on this particular committee which would be already subject to fewer constraints than the current select committees have the addition of appropriations approval would apparently produce unique situation in the contemporary congress and rarity in its entire history reversal of this plan placing intelligence committee members on the defense appropriations subcommittee also appears to be rare if not unprecedented action this revamped panel could better coordinate and complement the actions of both committees this change moreover could indirectly increase the power of the select committee by reserving seats for its members on the relevant appropriations subcommittee the intelligence committee would play more direct and influential role in appropriating ic funds than it does now at this time other committee has comparable guarantee of seats on relevant appropriations subcommittee consequently the leftout authorizing committees particularly those dealing with sensitive national security matters might make the same appeal as intelligence that is to have seats reserved on the appropriate appropriations subcommittee following either avenue the intelligence panels power would be enhanced if it held both appropriations and authorization authority either directly or indirectly via its members on the defense appropriations subcommittee in either event however the intelligence panel might be perceived as too powerful it would hold two impressive and reinforcing authorities and would longer be subject to check and competition from significant outside source ie the appropriations committee in its chamber at the same time the transfer of appropriations would remove an important part of the appropriations committees jurisdiction reserving seats for intelligence committee members on defense appropriations could also reduce competing viewpoints and an independent check on ic appropriations either change might encourage other authorizing committees to request the same treatment that is to control both appropriations and authorizations although the appropriations and authorization processes are parallel to one another they are not identical and not always reinforcing or complementary the combined authority could result in substantially more work for the intelligence committee in each session with the need to scrub the intelligence budget twice each year or alternatively the transfer could lessen its examination of the appropriations and crs20 authorization if each were to occur only in alternate sessions within single congress the potential increase in the panels workload could have two adverse ramifications 1 shortchange either the appropriations or authorization process or both or 2 reduce the panels time for other legislative and oversight efforts by comparison to these two proposed changes consolidating authorization and appropriations in the intelligence committee or reserving seats on the defense appropriations subcommittee for intelligence committee members the establishment of the special intelligence oversight panel on the house appropriations committee is more limited in its impact only three of its 13 seats are reserved for intelligence committee members and the new panel can only make recommendations to the defense appropriations subcommittee which continues to report the annual intelligence community appropriations improving coordination between the two intelligence panels such changes would affect the intelligence committees individual structure and powers others could be designed to increase coordination and shared responsibility between the two intelligence panels so as to avoid duplication encourage cooperation develop working relationships across chambers enhance understanding and share expertise information and knowledge while at the same time maintaining the distinct characteristics of each panel these might include joint hearings and crosscommittee leadership meetings which may already exist on regular basis joint hearings one option along these lines is to schedule joint hearings for relatively routine and regular matters such as the initial annual authorization briefings from the executive another opportunity for joint session would occur when the inspectors general in the intelligence community especially at the cia submit their semiannual reports to congress these shared enterprises could allow the combined membership to receive the same information and data as each panel would individually establish working relationships among the two groups of members encourage crossfertilization among them and reduce duplication for the executive of course followup hearings could be handled separately by the two panels and may even be stimulated by such joint efforts the shared experience over the initial budget submission could also help to avoid duplication of effort over some modest matters while helping to set priorities for more significant ones joint hearings could also be conducted into critical events as they were with the select intelligence committees combined inquiry into 911 attacks35 another example of an inquiry with panels from both chambers was the irancontra affair an 35 us congress senate select committee on intelligence and house permanent select committee on intelligence joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 srept 107351 and hrept 107792 107th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2002 crs21 investigation conducted by two temporary committees working together and issuing joint report36 leadership meetings another means of encouraging interchamber cooperation is for the leadership of the two panels to meet regularly to discuss issues concerns and priorities recognizing of course the practical and political limitations on such exchanges these efforts might include only the full committee chairs or might extend to subcommittee heads and majority and minority members these sessions could be supplemented by meetings of senior staff on both panels at the direction of the leadership whatever the arrangement number of different opportunities exist to enhance awareness of common concerns and cooperation in examining them between the two panels constraints on coordination coordination between two panels from different chambers may encounter practical and political problems scheduling meetings and hearings especially if large number of members is involved for instance runs into several hindrances these include 1 different priorities and meeting arrangements for each committee 2 competing chamber and committee responsibilities for members especially senators each of whom serve on more committees than representatives and 3 different electoral and campaign requirements which affect the demands on members and the time they spend in the capital in addition rival political affiliations and policy stands along with competition between the chambers for influence over public policy might make cooperative ventures few and far between enhancing interchanges with other panels and members other approaches to increasing the powers of each panel and their cooperative ventures might be considered ease the exchange of information with noncommittee members allow for more oversight by other committees andor increase contacts among members of the appropriations and authorizing panels along these lines the 911 commission wrote the new committee or committees should conduct studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the house and senate37 placing intelligence committee members on the defense appropriations subcommittee or on special appropriations intelligence oversight panel as the house has done also eases interchanges between these two committees other ways of increasing coordination between the appropriations and authorizing committees through formalized member and staff involvement in the other panels hearings for instance have been advanced in the senate as noted above 36 us congress senate select committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition and house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran report on the irancontra affair srept 100216 and hrept 100 433 100th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1987 37 911 commission report p 420 crs22 goals this type of change could reduce the challenge of intelligence oversight on the select committees bring different viewpoints to bear on intelligence matters expand the knowledge of members not on the panels and allow for their informed judgments on intelligence policy and programs as well as on committee activities and operations strict controls over the classified information would have to be maintained the current committee rules which on the house side are more stringent than on any other committee might be modified to accommodate additional sources for review and oversight such revision could begin with comparison of access controls by other panels particularly the committees with overlapping membership in addition house and senate chamber rules authorizing secret or closed sessions might be used more often to allow for an open exchange of information between the intelligence committees and all the members of particular chamber along with this committee members might be allowed to present declassified versions of sensitive or otherwise classified reports to their colleagues in secret or open sessions techniques several potential techniques to expand noncommittee involvement and nonmember access to information follow ensure that relevant information is appropriately and expeditiously shared with committees with overlapping membership give greater allowance for other committees to conduct oversight of intelligence components activities and programs including standing committees without overlapping membership38 ease access for nonmembers to intelligence committee holdings by reducing the exacting requirements over the availability of the classified encourage the intelligence committees on their own initiative to share information as appropriate with the full membership of their house make more information available to nonmembers by securing declassification of certain intelligence reports or by providing classified and declassified versions of ic reports for the committees and for the general membership respectively the agencies proper or their inspectors general charged with preventing and detecting waste fraud and abuse might do either or both possibly at the request or directive of the intelligence committees limitations interchanges between the intelligence committees on the one hand and other panels and members on the other might be limited for several reasons concerns about the unauthorized disclosures of classified information might be raised as the possibility of leaks rises because of the increased number of 38 see especially house subcommittees on efficiency and on national security cia refusal 2001 crs23 individuals with access to sensitive information along with this intelligence agencies would likely be reluctant to respond to congressional requests for sensitive and classified information even from the intelligence committees if the agencies anticipate that all or some of it will be disclosed outside the sequestered intelligence committee rooms possibly to the floors of both houses another possibility which might retard informationsharing by the intelligence committees could be concern about reduction in their control over the intelligence agenda and debate as more members and panels became familiar with the relevant information and policies more questions might arise relating to the committees policy positions this development might be seen as weakening the committees condition that might reduce their and in turn congresss influence over intelligence agencies and policies in dealings with the executive other options several other options could enhance congressional oversight over the intelligence community using congressional support agencies other options might enhance the oversight capabilities of the select committees on

government gaos access however may be precluded in certain situations by the president if it involves sensitive or classified records such as foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities in instances where records are statutorily exempted from disclosure or in cases where an executive agency holds competing powers which are used to prevent gao access41 the last of these obstacles to full access has led to conflicts between the government accountability office and the intelligence community particularly the central intelligence agency cia42 the cia views its own statutory authority as keeping it offlimits to independent gao audits and investigations under this interpretation the cia has declined to participate in gao reviews as well as in some congressional oversight hearings held by panels other than the select committees on intelligence and the agency has on occasion attempted to enlist other components to do the same43 in contrast to the cias position however other ic entities have not asserted the same proscription against gao audits for instance the department of defense which houses the largest number of intelligence units has issued the following instructions

the director established an continued crs27 observations on oversight of intelligence obstacles to oversight congressional oversight of intelligence meets obstacles that are not usually present in other areas53 secrecy constraints the most significant constraint is the high degree and pervasiveness of secrecy surrounding intelligence policy information activities operations resources and personnel for congress this means that the legislature its committees and its members are circumscribed in number of ways what they know who receives the information how and in what form and forum who provides it what information can be shared with other members and panels how and in what detail and what nongovernmental sources can contribute to legislators knowledge to what degree and in what ways the secrecy imperative results in system that is often closed to outsiders not just the general public but also representatives and senators who do not have seats on the select committees on intelligence the impact of official secrecy is evident in the restrictions on access to and disclosure of classified information in the panels custody as well as on restraints covering what the select committee members themselves can discuss outside its confines54 these restrictions and their demanding requirements not only slow down or prevent access by nonmembers because of an anticipated lengthy delay in complying with the procedures but might also harbor chilling effect for some because of the strict limitations on disclosure and use of the information among colleagues outside the intelligence committees as noted above moreover other access controls adopted by the executive set limits on the government accountability office congresss chief audit and investigative agency the impacts and implications of secrecy are extensive and burdensome the 911 commission summarized the effects this way secrecy stifles oversight accountability and information sharing55 52 continued

policy including authorizing the budget congressional efforts here remain largely hidden and may have only marginal direct effects on members constituencies districts or states56 overcoming the obstacles objectives and goals the impact of these limitations on congresss oversight of intelligence is that it is significantly more difficult than in other fields and the usual incentives for members to serve on certain committees and conduct oversight appear to be more modest or even nonexistent for intelligence steps have been advanced however to increase congresss capacity to overcome these hurdles prospects along this line include 1 heightening the appeal of serving on the intelligence panel 2 enhancing the expertise and knowledge of members both on and off the panels 3 reinforcing the shared responsibilities between an intelligence committee on the one hand and panels with overlapping memberships on the other 4 expanding the contacts and coordination between the intelligence authorizors and appropriators 5 changing the relationship between the two chambers on intelligence matters through for instance joint committee or increased contacts between the existing committees and 6 developing new connections between congress and the executive that could lend themselves to more effective oversight the joint committee approach and alternatives growing out of these goals are number of recommendations to strengthen oversight of intelligence which have arisen since the genesis of the modern intelligence community six decades ago recent ones have come from the 911 commission which proposed two distinct alternatives one was to create joint committee on intelligence yet over the years the drafts for jci have differed in important respects membership leadership jurisdiction authority staffing and controls over classified information among other matters moreover rationales for jci have met with competing objections and concerns second major option advanced by the 911 commission was to enhance the powers and status of the intelligence committee in each house along with realigning committee jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations with the prospect of merging authorizing and appropriations in one committee the senate in sres 445 108th congress approved october 9 2004 followed this path but only part of the way when it removed the term limits on serving on its intelligence panel reduced the number of members and created separate subcommittee on intelligence on the appropriations committee in separate action leaders on the senate intelligence
