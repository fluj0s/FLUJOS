guidelines determine the sentences meted out as punishment for most federal crimes the gu idelines system is essentially scorecard system congress created the united states sentencing commission and

which hill had been indicted for possession with intent to distribute approximately 754 grams of cocaine base united states v hill 79 f3d 1477 1480 6th cir 1996 the firearms charge was based on the discovery of handgun in the master bedroom of an apartment hill shared with his girlfriend whom he claimed kept the gun for protection at the time of his arrest hill had prior convictions for 6 misdemeanors and felony for cr imes ranging from possession of drug paraphernalia to assault and battery and had been paroled most recently on july 1 1990 i base offense level the statutory index ussg appa identifies ussg 2d11 as the guideline section applicable to violations of 21 usc 841 and ussg 2k21 as the guideline section applicable to violations of 18 usc 922g under section 2d11 the base offens level is determined by the sections drug quantity table unless the offense resu lted in the death or serious bodily injury of another in which case the base offense level is 38 for first time offenders and 43 for those with prior controlled substan ce convictions ussg 2d11a the drug table appended establishes the base offense level according the weight and type of controlled substance involved in hill the 208 grams of crack would carry base offense level of 28 ussg 2d11c6 but the district court found th at the 754 grams of crack involved in the 1991 dismissed indictment c onstituted relevant conduct11 and thus should be counted for sentencing guideline purposes so that the appropriate base offense level for the combined weight of the crack 754 208 962 would be 32 ussg 2d11c4 the court of appeals found that th two single violations were too remote in time to be consider ed part of the common pattern necessary to consider the earlier possession relevant conduc t for sentencing purposes thus the base offense level for possession of between 20 and 35 grams of crack possession offense is 28 in cases such as hill that involve more than one ty pe of controlled substance the guidelines provide conversion device to permit them to be merged into single offense level the device involves ssigning various controlled substances equivalence weights using marihuana as standard in drug equivalency table provided in sec tion 2d11 appended infra at 27 thus for example 1 gram of heroin has been assigned drug equivalenc of 1 kilogram of marihuana in the casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30721crs6 of crack and powder cocaine 1 gram of pow der cocaine is considered the equivalent of 200 grams of marihuana and 1 gram of crack the equivalent of 20 kilograms 2000 grams of marihuana in hill this means 529 grams of cocaine yiel d marihuana equi valent weight of 1058 kilograms 529 x 200 10580 grams of marihuana and 208 grams of crack yield marihuana equivale nt weight of 416 kilograms 208 x 20 416 kilograms of marihuana together they have marihuana equivalent weight of 42658 kilograms which translates to base offense level of 28 section 2d11 modifies the base offe nse level for four factors it adds 2 levels if dangerous weapon is posse ssed ussg 2d11b1 it adds 2 levels to required minimum total offense level of 26 for drug smuggling involving private or chartered airplane or involving the fendant as the pilot captain navigator or other operator of any craft or vessel ussg 2d11b2 it adds 2 levels for distribution in prison or in correctional or

prime mover in continuing criminal enterprise provided authorities with all the information he had concerning the offens and related offenses and if one died or was seriously injured as result of the offense ussg 2d111b4 5c12 because hill pled guilty to possession of firearm over which he might have been found to have constr uctive possession and which th lower court could have found was possessed in connecti on with the offense hills offense level for the crack possession offense was increased by 2 bring the offense level to 30 with respect to the firearms charge in count three of hills
