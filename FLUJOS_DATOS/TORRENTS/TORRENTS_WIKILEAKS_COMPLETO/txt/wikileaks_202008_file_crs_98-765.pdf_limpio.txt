which are considered to be at disproportionately high risk for drug abuse crime academic failure or unemployment the national guard challenge challenge program and the starbase science and technology academies reinforcing basic aviation and space exploration program are two relatively new military youth programs challenge currently 48 million program is designed to help high school dropouts become more productive members of society by enhancing their skills education and employability boot camp followed by mentored development period is used to achieve these results starbase currently 4 million program is designed to stimulate interest in math science and technology among younger children particularly those in fourth through sixth grade handson educational programs exposure to technological environments and guidance by positive role models are used to achieve results both programs are targeted primarily though not exclusively towards minority and lower income youth both use military facilities and national guard or reserve personnel this report provides background information on civilmilitary cooperation and military youth programs in general and information on the challenge and starbase programs in particular it provides summary of each programs goals curriculum results and funding levels along with points of contact for further information this report will not be

responding to some domestic emergencies such as large scale disasters and civil disturbances the best known precedent for military involvement in the mitigation of domestic social problems is the

programs are type of civilmilitary cooperation in which military resources are used to assist young american civilians in variety of ways1 the main legislative impetus for recent military youth programs came after the collapse of the soviet union and the warsaw pact in 199091 which caused policy makers to reevaluate the focus of us military activities senator sam nunn then chairman of the senate armed services committee was particularly supportive of an effort to utilize some military resources in addressing the domestic needs of the nation he argued that our society faces numerous domestic challenges that in many respects are as daunting as any potential foreign threat to our national security while the soviet threat is gone we are still battling drugs poverty urban decay lack of self esteem unemployment and racismi am convinced that there is proper and important role the armed forces can play in addressing many of these issues2 congressional support for this concept led to the inclusion of several provisions in the national defense authorization act for fy 1993 which expanded the authority of the department of defense to use military resources to help meet domestic needs3 one provision in the bill authorized the chief of the national guard bureau working in conjunction with the governors of up to 10 states to establish pilot program known as the national guard civilian youth opportunities program4 the purpose of the program was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of military based training to improve the life skills and employability of high school dropouts5 after the 1994 elections the new republican majority in congress took another look at civilmilitary cooperative programs arguing that scarce military dollars were being used for several social health and other civilian programs that did not directly contribute to the militarys warfighting mission they scaled civilmilitary cooperation programs back significantly in the national defense authorization act for fy 19966 authority for the national guard civilian youth opportunities program was extended until august 1997 but the programs authority was to be terminated at that time7 just after this temporary authorization ran out however the 105th congress permanently reauthorized the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98765crs3 8pl 10585 sec 1076 november 18 1997 111 stat

national guard challenge program8 commonly referred to as the challenge program9 the starbase program has background similar to that of challeng in some regards but distinct in other ways starbase was originally started as privately funded initiative its purpose was to involve at risk youth in science math technology goal setting and positive life choices early on in their lives through handson educational programs exposure to technological environments and guidance by positive role models in 1992 just three weeks before congress authorized the predecessor of challenge in the national defense authorization act for fy 1993 language was included in the dod appropriations act for fy 1993 to establish the starbase youth education program10 the conference report which accompanied the bill earmarked 2 million for the program11 since then starbase has received federal funding each year though the amount has varied there appears to have been clear policy link between congress decision to establish challenge in the national defense authorization act for fy 93 and its decision to fund starbase in the dod appropriations act for fy 93 namely desire to utilize military resources to help young americans especially those at risk for economic and social failure to lead more successful lives this link was made clearer in the dod appropriations act for fy 199412 when congress provided funding for challenge starbase and one other program under the common designation of military youth programs13 however it should be pointed out that the legislative authority as distinct from funding for dod to get involved in program like starbase has different origin in 1990 congress was concerned that projected shortage of scientists and engineers would have negative effect on the nations defense capacity in response to this concern congress included provision in the national defense authorization act for fy 199114 which authorized the secretary of defense to sponsor and assist in science mathematics and technical education at all levels of education15 one subsection allowed the secretary of defense in coordination with the secretary of education to establish programs for the purpose of improving the mathematics and science knowledge and skillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98765crs4 16pl 101510 sec 247 november 5 1990 104 stat 1521 10 usc 2193 b

to colonel maynard k bean director of commonwealth challenge virginia this ged attainment rate compared very favorably with other state programs he stated of our graduates 74 percent have earned their ged diploma this percentage is substantially higher than other state programs in virginia which average about 58 percent united states congress house continuedof elementary and secondary school students and faculty members16 this provision provides the statutory authority under which dod supports program like starbase and implicitly ties such programs at least in part to specific national defense objective ensuring an adequate supply of scientists and engineers within the national labor pool to meet defense needs the challenge program the challenge program is designed to improve the life skills and employment potential of certain high school dropouts applicants must meet certain eligibility standards in order to be admitted to the program at minimum they must be between the ages of 16 and 18 drug free unemployed or underemployed and be physically and mentally capable of participating negative involvement with the criminal justice system can also be grounds for ineligibility17 the program consists of 22week long residential phase followed by year long nonresidential phase the residential phase is conducted in military style boot camp environment this phase is typically conducted on military base and staffed by state employees some of whom may be members of the national guard the curriculum revolves around eight core components leadership and followership community service job skills academic excellence responsible citizenship life coping skills physical fitness and health sex education and nutrition18 typical day in the residential phase of the program involves an hour of physical fitness training in the early morning followed by six hours of instruction an hour of military drill and ceremony and two hours of study hall upon completion of the residential phase challenge participants enter into year long nonresidential phase during this phase participants are eligible to receive stipends of up to 2200 to assist them in pursuing educational or employment opportunities they are also paired up with mentors who work with them individually the mentors assist the participants in making the transition from the imposed discipline of the residential phase to the selfdiscipline necessary for productive life the program has achieved some notable successes between 1993 and 1997 over 14000 individuals have graduated from the program based on the results of tests administered before and after completion of the program the average challenge graduate achieved 13 gradelevel increase in reading and 20 gradelevel increase in math seventyfour

out of the controlled challenge environment 561 of graduates reported placements in the work force and 243 reported that they were continuing their education20 nonetheless there has been some criticism of the program this criticism relates not to the effectiveness or goals of the program but to the broader issue of whether in an era of tight military budgets the department of defense should be spending money on program that is not so distantly related to national defense and so closely aligned to other spending categories challenge is currently operating in 20 states21 fourteen other states the district of columbia and one territory have applied for the program and are on waiting list 22 pending the availability of funds states on the waiting list are ranked in the order their application was received federal funding for challenge in fy 1998 is 48 million participating states are required to share some of the cost of funding the program the federalstate cost sharing ratio in fy 1998 is 7525 it will shift to 7030 in fy 1999 65 35 in fy 2000 and 6040 in fy 2001 and beyond the shifting ratio of cost sharing will probably free up enough funds to establish challenge program in one or two more states assuming that the federal contribution to the program remains at level comparable to fy 1998 however assuming the federalstate cost sharing ratios mentioned above the federal contribution would have to be increased to about 85 million to establish program in all the states on the waiting list the federal contribution would have to be increased to about 110 million to establish challenge program in every state and territory the starbase program starbase is an acronym for science and technology academies reinforcing basic aviation and space exploration the goal of the program is to ignite the interest of at risk youth in science math technology goal setting and positive life choices23 through handson educational programs exposure to technological environments and guidance by positive role models the starbase program was initially established in 1991 with grant from the wh kellogg foundation but since 1993 it has been federally funded programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98765crs6 24cited in starbase brochure 1997 1 25californi florida georgia iowa kansas minnesota north carolina oklahoma oregon south dakota texas vermont virginia wyoming and puerto ricostarbase facilities are most often located at air national guard bases although the air force reserve and the navy have also established facilities on their bases and the marine corps is considering doing so as well students from targeted local schools those schools with substantial minority or lower income populations are brought to the starbase facility for five days usually one day each week for five consecutive weeks during this time they receive instruction in scientific and mathematical principles conduct experiments witness hightech equipment demonstrations and interact with positive role models the curriculum varies depending on the resources available at the local facility and the age of the students the curriculum can be adapted to suit students from kindergarten through twelfth grade but currently operating programs tend to focus on students in the fourth through sixth grade typical day for fourth to sixth grade class might include instruction on the basic principles of flight construction and launch of model rocket tour of military airplane and interaction with military pilots and flight crews themes of selfrespect goalsetting and drug avoidance are often incorporated throughout the day since the programs inception in 1991 over 75000 children have participated in starbase activities and approximately 3000 teachers have been trained on how to incorporate more handson approach into their math and science curricula 1996 program evaluation by social consultants international24 stated that based on tests given before and after participation in starbase students showed 30 improvement in answers to math and science questions the evaluation also stated that starbase participants acquired more positive attitude towards math and science and improved their ability to set goals however there is lack of quantitative data regarding the longterm impact of this program as such it is not known whether starbase influences children in subsequent academic achievement and pursuit of careers in math science and technological fields later in life this absence of data makes it difficult to accurately assess the relationship between the programs cost and its social benefits supporters of the program plan to conduct more research into long term effects in the future additionally like the challenge program starbase receives criticism for depleting money from the department of defense that might be better spent on programs more closely related to national defense in addition to the original site in michigan the program currently operates at military sites in 14 other states and one territory25 sites may be added in south carolina and louisiana in 1999 depending on the availability of funds federal funding for starbase in fy 1998 was 4 million expansion of the program to additional locations would cost about 300000 per site
