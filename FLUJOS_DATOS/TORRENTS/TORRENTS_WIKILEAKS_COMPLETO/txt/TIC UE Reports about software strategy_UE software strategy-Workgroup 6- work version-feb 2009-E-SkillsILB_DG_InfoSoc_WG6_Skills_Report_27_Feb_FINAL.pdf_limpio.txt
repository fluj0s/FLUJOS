40 percen t of europeans have basic ict skills in view of the pervasiveness of ict this shortcoming is accelerating the social divide on the other hand companies both on the information technology supply and user side have n increasing need for ict skilled professionals figures from 2008 indica ted the demand to reach 250000 by 2010 only 180000 are likely to be ava ilable the economic downturn will probably release the situation howe ver the longterm trend of shortfall poses threat to job opportunities and europes competitiveness in the globalised world therefore it is critical for the success of european industries to reskill europes workforce for the needs of the knowledgebased economy industrybased qual ifications and certifications are key factors in keeping european industries competitive this fact needs to be recognized michael gorriz eurocio president brussels 29 jan uary 2009 4 introduction in this global economic downturn information commu nications and technology ict industries continue to contribute to european employment prov ide critical tools for european productivity expand economic contributions provide consumers an array of new benefits and develop some of the most innovative technology in the world inc luding green ict applications through smart infrastructures and new socalled cloud computing platforms 1 the working group believes the ictembedded economy is built on the innovative capacity and creativity of its individuals europe already has the talent to compete and lead globally without the incentive to develop intellectual talen t and human capacity the industry falters it is here that the european commission and eu member state governments need to focus their energy in considering how to best foster the european soft ware industries the working group encourages the commission to continue its work to s upport the ict skills capacity of europes talent eskills and human capacity building must remain critical crosssectoral focus point in all areas of policy initiatives started by the vari ous directorates generals concerned the group believes that core element of any software strate gy must involve enhanced efforts to promoting hightech education and ict skills capaci ty to stimulate greater innovative creativity within individuals including promoting eskills m aintaining and enhancing existing technical capacity and promoting innovative talent specifi cally eskills are essential to maintain and to raise european productivity and to deliver on the mbitious green ict goals in cooperation with and in support of related initi atives 2 and to contribute to comprehensive and effective software strategy in europe the dg i nformation society and the commission as whole should continue to support the activities of

education and ict skills capacity buildin g the global economy and particularly europes advan ced marketplace is increasingly dependent on ict and software in particular dual economic dependency on the software industry in europe has emerged today europe depends on its abi lity to supply or produce technology as european production of software increases comprisi ng nearly onethird of the european ict market europe also depends on demand or use of technology for greater economic productivity as commissioner viviane reding noted in speech before european software leaders the main significance of software is that it is eve rywhere today everything depends on software all the internet and telecommunication s services all machines from giant power stations through advanced jet planes down to the s implest coffee percolator all run on software 5 knowledge based industries require skilled employee s 6 in this environment the continued competitiveness of europe becomes more reliant on t he availability of workforce properly trained in eskills shortage of eskills not on ly prevents the adoption of new technologies it also hinders the use and consolidation of existing ict systems resulting in major inefficiencies and wasted resources demand for high end ict network skills to plan and implement internet technology in support of business processes is particularly acute the continuing growth of deskt op applications and mobile working environments means the demand for ict skills in these areas of distributed computing is also high furthermore digital literacy and professional esk ills are crucial enablers that allow countries and their citizens to exploit the full potential of the information society as europes economy becomes increasingly ictdependent digital illiteracy subs tantially reduces the opportunities available for participation in the labour market 4 see wwwerantiscomeventsdenmarkcopenhagenclimatec onference2009indexhtm 5 towards european

addition it is important to recognise that esk ills shortages are global phenomenon europes competitors also are finding it difficult to keep up with demand for their services in this market it may make sense to focus policy effo rts less on competition by comparison ie us versus them and more on promoting domestic ca pacity indeed the risk increasingly is less that highly skilled job will move offshore and mo re that there will be qualified engineer anywhere in the world to fill it the good news is that several european institutions and various commission services are deeply involved in eskills promotion and have been for so time7 our analysis and recommendations below reflect the current debate in europe reiterate existing policy recommendations support existing policy steps take n by european policy officials and highlight few new issues for consideration the working group believes these considerations can be structured into three major areas 1 promoting general eskills and lifelong ict learnin g among the labour force 2 enhancing innovative talent capable of managing an d expanding europes existing software capacity and 3 fostering innovative solutions and capacity buildin g through multistakeholder partnerships and enhanced businessuniversity coope ration challenge 1 promoting general eskills and lifelong ict learn ing among the labour force lag in digital uptake is not without parallels in historical economic patterns of innovation uptake such as with the agricultural revolution or industrialisation however the technology revolution has propelled an unprecedented level of speed of change on the economy with that speed comes many challenges some of which are not being met in this revolution the difference is not access to infrastructure alone i t is more than ever the human element knowledge skills and thought processes will make the difference in the technology revolution if the european labour force fails to keep pace th ere is risk that basic employment will move offshore indeed according to one oecd finding total of 20 of current employment could be replaced by ictenabled offshore outsourcing unfortunately according to eurostat research only 22 of european households have hig h levels of basic computer skills and 37 have basic computer skills 8 not surprisingly the level of eskills diminishe s as levels of education diminish in addition statistically kills are inversely related to age thus eskills are fundamental for the development of productivity and knowledge intensive products and services in knowledgebased economy ict uptake and acquiring generating and exploiting knowledge are key determinants of ccess for enterprises and individuals 7 for example the biannual european eskills confe rences organised by dg

7 the good news is that the european commission has i dentified this challenge invested resources in identifying solutions and prioritised the issue in its 7 september 2007 policy communication eskills for the 21st century foste ring competitiveness growth and jobs it stated it is crucial to rapidly adopt longterm eski lls agenda to promote competitiveness employability and workforce development reduce kills gaps and be in better position to address global competitive challenges strong efforts need to be made to improve coopera tion between the public and private sectors on longterm basis in order to ensure seamless framework linking basic skills training vocational and higher education an d professional development industry and policy makers should act more decisive ly and consistently regarding their strategies to promote the professionalism image an d attractiveness of ict jobs and careers and to foster better employment conditions and perspectives 9 these same skills challenges are being felt worldw ide as europe improves the basic technical capacity of its labour force so are other economie s worldwide the us competitiveness agenda as well as the recent us stimulus package includes strong emphasis on technology skills in the labour force korean and japanese governmen ts continue to emphasise math and science skills countries from ireland to india to china have spent decades doing their homework investing wholeheartedly in technically educated wo rkforces 10 one good case study is right here in europe irela nd the irish economy continued to thrive due in part to irelands unique workforce according t the irish development authority ida one of the major positive factors in irelands success has been that it has one of the highest educational participation rates in the world thirt yseven percent of the irish population now achieves at least tertiary university education having helped to lead the economy of ireland to its globally prominent position the government tinues to believe that its policy on investment in research and 4th level education ar key to irelands continued development as knowledge society in the new global economy 11 the importance of ict skills is further documented in domestic competitiveness studies show ing that irelands productivity growth is greatly influenced by the skills and knowledge of i ts workforce 12

would have been much slower business 2 000 2007 8 what is needed public policy recommendations to p romote general eskills implement existing industry recommendations 13 the european eskills forum the recommendations of the ict task force and the european commission eu officials already have developed strong analysis and recommendations in the eskills area at this stage we believe it is necessary to support existing efforts from the many committees nd recommendations already made including the european eskills forum the ict task force report the european commissions communication on eskills for the 21st century fo stering competitiveness growth and jobs september 2007 and the competitiveness council co nclusions on longterm strategy for skills november 2007 among others this long rm strategy focuses mainly on four key areas notably on motivating and empowering future generations with eskills promoting ict practitioner education and training boosting the mployability of the workforce with ict user skills and providing foresight and support for futu re skills needed in the changing environment the working group welcomes and strongly supports th is action plan on ict skills in short there is strong consensus on eskills development in euro pe what is required now is action we also applaud the european commission for recogni zing the persistent problem of digital illiteracy in both the communication but also thro ugh its monitoring and research we agree that the ambitious goal of digital literacy will t be reached by itself europe needs long term einclusion strategy to avoid the risk of marginali zing 3050 of european population and the communication represents an important step in this direction in this respect we would especially like to single out the call to bring the industrybased and formal education closer together if we want eskills to be disseminated th roughout the population we need to pursue more flexible approaches to learning bridging the different interests of industry governments and of all stakeholders concerned in order to achie ve this common goal we believe one of the most important concepts from these discussions is something summarised as access to access throughout the entire trainingemployment value chain from access to technology and physical infrastructure in schoo ls access to training and content curricula and certifications access to public funding and finally access to labour placements each is key14 each of these elements needs to work in tandem r the cycle simply doesnt work for example increased access to technology in the learning environment not only enables new ways to teach it excites an essential curiosity of children that ensures students are able to develop ict skills indeed one of the barriers oft cited by older adults in accessing technology is fear of damaging the computer or lack of familia rity with basic concepts computer in every classroom is critical but while innate curiosity can propel comfort and creativity with computer technology next step learning and critical innovative skills requir training the notion perpetuated in some studies that skills training is unnecessary is si mply incorrect skills training is unnecessary for example in floss in the same way it would be unnece ssary as child teaches itself how to use 13

development or cloud computing or others similarly public funding to help facilitate access as well as assistance in placing qualified labour helps to complete the training employment value cha in working in detail on the accesstoaccess concept the eskills industry leadership board ilb in conjunction with eu bodies and other inst itutional actors had developed in 2008 set of critical recommendations in this area and had c alled upon policymakers european citizens and relevant stakeholders to build on tested best p ractices and to highlight the role of multi stakeholder partnerships to provide sustainable ict training and industrybased qualification schemes recognized credentials and certifications 15 challenge 2 enhancing innovative talent capable of managing nd expanding europes existing software capacity 15 for the ilb recommendations see p 3 of the poli cy declaration 2008 eskills competencies action s towards sustainability recommendations to european instit utions governments industry and other stakeholder s concerned submitted to the european council of min isters in brussels 1314 march 2008 wwweskills ilborgdocseskills_ilb_policy_declaration_2008_f inal_22_febpdf focus group key r ecommendations to promote general skills and lifelong ict learning among the labour force implement numerous european commission and industry recommendations in the eskills area ensure access to critical infrastructures to foster ing lifelong learning for ict skills adopt tax breaks for companies that invest in educa tion for their employees ensure access to access throughout the entire training employment value chain including access to technology and physical infrastructure in schools access to train ing and content curricula and certifications access to public fund ing and finally access to labour placements recognize ict skills value credentials and support industrybased ict skills certifications to keep european software ind ustries competitive 10 it goes without saying that in production of know ledge based product such as software the most essential asset is human capacity the capaci ty to develop and sustain human talent in the software field is critical according to the europe an software association in germany alone the skills shortage is costing the economy up to 20bn year or 1 of gdp according to study recently commissioned by the german economics minis try 16 so what barriers are impeding and what factors are impacting europes ability to produce skilled labour pool among the key challenges are the absence of basic ict skills edu cation across europe inadequate number of university graduates in this area lack of awarenes s and recognition of industrybased credentials lack of lifelong ict learning programm and perception of foreign competition as the global economy has become more complex it h as become evident that to compete and maintain presence in global markets i t is essential to boost the human capital endowments of the labor force whose member s must have access to new knowledge be constantly trained in new processes nd in the operation of the latest technologies the importance of vocational and tinuous onthejob training neglected in many economies cannot be overstated as it increases the efficiency and productivity of each worker wef nov 2006 rethink of educational structures is required given the pace of technological change simple technical training is not appropriate to produce in novative capacity further educational styles which teach role learning rather than fostering cr eative dynamics in school are inadequate to give new engineers the power to think nonlinearly or linearly depending on the need in addition the eurostat data identified large ict sk ills gaps between highly educated only 11 with basic computer skills versus poorly educat ed 61 with basic computer skills with that variance in statistics and the stated european objectives of more aggressively bringing in underrepresented groups series of scholarships for basic level maths and science education may be useful underprivileged or lowerincome in dividuals could thus access better educational institutions incentivise university level graduation in computer engineering there are simply too few technical graduates graduating this means dual ffort to promote more interest among young people in these fields is critical along with incr easing immigration for highly skilled workers as the world economic forum wef consistently has hig hlighted education is critical ingredient of competitiveness the quality of science and math ematics education management training and specialised eskills training for the workforce is vital to achieving the economic benefits of ict use foster access to lifelong learning the need to constantly upgrade skills has been re cognised by the commission as critical to improving europes co mpetitive capacity given the fundamental importance of this recommendation it bears further mention here companies find new graduates unable to fulfil essential technical role s indeed as with doctors and lawyers 16 european software association european software industry looking for competitive advantage jun 2007 p 6 11 technical engineers must engage in lifelong learni ng programmes european businesses recognise the challenge and are concerned 75 of the respondents in survey across 10 european countries believe that the level of ict sk ills of their employees will influence the competitiveness of their organisations its ability to innovate and its ability to grow 17 the role of multistakeholder partnerships is essen tial part of the challenge with inadequate educational structures comes fundamentally to the s peed with which technology changes human capacity must be fostered to drive change rat her than hinder it while some of this can happen through modifications to the educational sys tem and increased math and science capacity there is only so much nontechnology dicated institution can do yet dynamism and new approaches in skills training is essential to supplement it is essential there be close cooperation between all stakeholders concerned t hat may mean enhanced partnerships between university and private sector institutions as envisaged under the bologna process it may mean more ict specific training centres or it may mean investment by individual companies to promote the greater welfare of the ind ustry by augmenting its technical capacity the commission clearly has recognised the value of publicprivate or multistakeholder partnerships in developing eskills further the commission has thoroughly analyzed the situation with respect to publicprivate partnershi ps throughout europe in the findings of multistakeholder partnerships for eskills in eur ope 18 we concur with commission findings and encourage full implementation and ongoing resea rch in this area to support the growth of multistakeholder partnerships for ict education an d training foreign resources are lifeline not threat european leaders are fully aware of foreign competition in the software field given the globa lisation of the sector however it may be necessary to rethink our perspective on foreign tal ent indeed increasingly foreign talent is an advantage to be leveraged by european companies ra ther than as replacement for european talent in this globally competitive environment the only way for european industry to compete is by leveraging the best and brightest globally this may require complete rethinking of what is considered national or european industry given how fundamentally global every aspect of the software industry is for example compan could have 20 engineers on staff in berlin 5 indian nationals 5 chinese nationals and 10 germa n nationals working on piece of software code that is transferred to manila for work during berlins evening the code probably originated from another work product developed by ngineers with mix of nationalities similarly one of the many ict companies manufactur ing in ireland would employ european talent as well as noneuropean talent but all those jobs are equally european in that they contribute to european productivity to the europea n economy and to european based innovations

from emerging markets drives european p roducers to be more competitive and to link up strategically with complimentary technology large established multinational players provide much needed research budget access to tech nology and large economic impacts in the european ict ecosystem european industry because it already is strong vibrant and competitive has itself managed these challenges and turned them into very successful economic and innovative stimulants ownership nationality location these terms increasingly are irrelevant in the technology sector importantly as well this challenge is not limited to europe from india to the us the availability of qualified engineering talent is in crisis inde ed while discussions centre on fears of foreign dominance in truth all countries are struggling t keep up the numbers of qualified engineers the us and japan consistently lament the lack of qu alified engineers increasingly major human capacity source suppliers such as india are also f eeling the crunch of global demand indeed few years ago indias lead software association na sscom issued study showing greater than 200000 person engineering shortfall further the countries are themselves increasingly trying to attract the worlds best and brightest for example indias department of biotechnologydbt and the british charity welcome t rust are sponsoring 100 million fellowship for up to 375 scientists our goal is to attract individuals who can go on to become leaders of indias growing biomedical research ente rprise says s natesh senior adviser to dbt 19 with the global supply of engineering talent shrink ing the issue of raising european talent becomes more complex not only does europe have to produce more engineers it must sustain existing talent retain talent and raise the bar f or attracting increasingly scarce foreign talent software development and management skills with the ever increasing use and reliance on hight echnology and constant development of software applications across the ictembedded econo my and society as whole professional capacities in software development and engineering in management and to gotomarket capabilities will be widely required in all areas of business an d industry with special emphasis on the growing serviceproviding sectors of the glo bal economy the world economy is experiencing the largest labor force migration

nt and engineering in management and to gotomarket capa bilities 14 many of the recommendations outlined above will fos ter that capacity in addition it is important for policy makers to consider the role th at other aspects of public policy may have on innovative skills development by promoting or fun ding only one type of technological development talent is increasingly pulled from exi sting technical capacity and experimental capacity this could draw talent away from new co ncepts ideas and software platforms the concept of technology neutrality should extend equally to technology skills as it does to other aspects of the technology sector government public policy should focus on promoting fundamental and professional ict skills that provid the framework for general technology development and technology use where specific tec hnical talent is to be funded government funding should be generally available to all techno logy options specific technical development should come largely through multistakeholder partn erships and industryled skills training programmes the balance between informal and formal is just as critical with respect to technical standards in general as it is with respect to eskills standa rds in particular ict digital literacy and professional training eskills credentials and ind ustrybased certifications proprietary or open source are part of much wider policy debate in urope that is facing similar topical issues as the general standards debate ironically it seems that the ict digital literacy and professional skills discussion similar to the general policy bate on technical standards is being engulfed in the notion of mandatory formal european quality st andardisation by some policy initiatives specifically there is question of whether to rely on formal or informal training and certification systems and whether best practices of tested inform delivery of global industrybased eskills standards and certifications have to be aligned to european quality criteria under discussion 24 as with the issue of technical and software standar ds the issue of eskills standards is not an eitheror question it is not choice simply of f ormal or informal standards and certification there are large range of opportunities available from company specific certifications proprietary and open source to technology and prod uct neutral associations to government institutions the real challenge here is for coop eration and close consultation to align european ecompetence frameworks and similar reference schem under preparation as close as possible to real market needs and recognized value credentials25 historically ict certifications were developed by professional societies such as the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee to hel p self regulate but subsequently companies discovered the value of creating their own certific ation processes to help promote efficiency with product use 24 see cepis survey of

changed the ict certification landscape initially created their certified network engineer cne certification programme to supplement an overburdened technical support function it served as first line of defence against common networking problems however the programme evolved to become part of an initiative to literally entrench novells products among highly targeted group of purchasedecision influencers in this initiative certification became means for stratifying distribution channels based on their competency once it recognised the benefits of novells use of certifications microsoft soon joined the fray with its mcp programme similarly cisco set up cisco career certifications the success of vendorspecific cer tifications in turn spurred most major ict firms to establish their own certification programmes by the late 1990s over 300 vendor specific certifications were being offered by software and h ardware firms vendorneutral certifications on the other hand rapidly gained momentum starting in the mid 1990s 26 it has to be noted that ict certifications are not only related to proficiency in product usage but also on the knowledge of diverse aspects related to ict and associated processes indeed there is large number of certifications related to ict business and management aspects in broader sense such as project management professional fr om the project management institute control objectives for information and related tec hnology from the it governance institute certified information systems auditor from isaca capability maturity model integration from the software engineering institute or the in formation technology infrastructure library from the itil certification management board just to give some examples 27 this development of multiple standards organisation s has led to divergence of skills against specific technology demands for example accord ing to one estimate 600 million rfid tags were sold in 2005 alone and the number of tags deli vered in 10 years will be over 450 times the number actually to be delivered this yearyet 2007 comptia survey showed that there are fewer than 1000 qualified ict professionals availa ble worldwide who

formal training and educational institutions often fail to provide proper education for eskills and for technical engineering talent and management up to the value credentials required by business undertakings and to meet the needs of market demand eskills business sector certification and trainin g continue to occupy an entirely separate domain from public sector educ ation policy groups

one thing is certain ict skills training like ict technology development is dynamic and rapidly changing any work in this field requires close c oordination among all relevant players government sponsored training on its own will natur ally fail to respond to the rapidly changing market private certifications alone will not mee t existing demand in this environment government should maintain careful partnership wi th the business and training sectors and with independent organisations multistakeholder partnerships that drive credential value communication and greater awareness are critical in this rapidly changing environment it does not m ake sense for government to act alone top down with respect to developing innovative capaci ty it does not make sense to specifically define

businessuniversity cooperation and lifelo ng ict learning is undertaken as it was reported universities are at their core organizations tha t cultivate knowledge seeking both to create knowledge and to preserve and convey knowled ge but they are remarkably inefficient and therefore ineffective in the way th at they leverage their own information resources to advance that core activity 31 to substantially improve stem education software d evelopment and managerial skills in europe and to meet the fast changing demand of soft ware skills to serve consumer needs enhanced cooperation between universities and ict b usiness is considered as strategic goal 29 ibid lueders p8 good examples of how to bridg this disconnect through traditional learning inst itutions partnering and cooperating

integrates ict and so ftware skills in all university activities including the ones related to the outside and surro unding software and knowledge intensive undertakings 32 this trend towards university 20 model to leap frog ict and software culture and skills should be recognized and supported the virtual space of university 20 emerges as the framework for universities to adapt to the soci computing phenomena and the networked information economy in this virtual space the acad emic and the business worlds will establish for the benefit for the european software interests needed associative partnerships this development deserves to be strengthened through continuous european awareness campaign on high tech stem education capabilities and ict careers opportunities in europe such as the new release of the erasmus mundus programme 2009 2013 which is cooperation and mobility programme in the field of higher education to promote the european union as worldwide centre of excellence in hightech learning 33 these erasmus 34 and other programmes like the eurec master degree for renewable energy 35 allow the creation support and promotion of much needed european academic qualifications in the field of ict the work group recommends that the european commission should as part of the european software strategy strengthen similar academic skills initiatives in the ict and software area and accor dingly the european union should strive to ease as much as possible the access of noneu stude nts to these eu hightech education programmes this promotion of european educational capabilities and academic ict career opportunities requires also the support of the corresponding pan european recognition of the quality of the various university ict degrees through

software industry is growing and eco nomically significant sector that has proven itself competitive both within the eu and internati onally many other companies involved in hardware distribution training education and rvices also depend on this software sector for their livelihoods and for the success of their own products and services the existing policy and legal framework has largely worked in contributing to the success of the software sector in europe the european software industry is at crossroad however issues of global competition shortage of qualified labour and rapidly changin g technological landscape are converging to test the potential of europes software industry the working group believes european industry can co ntinue to thrive and compete both within the eu and globally without managed approach to technology rather the group believes what is necessary is to provide europes industries with the critical tools of innovation the way forward is first and primarily to focus on the inte llectual assets and human capacity building in this knowledge based industry people fundament ally the ictembedded economy is built on the innovative and creative capacity of its individ uals the group believes europe already has the talent and creativity to compete and lead globa lly without the incentive to develop innovative talent the industry falters it is here that the group believes the commission n eeds to focus energy in all we encourage the commission to continue its work to support the innovative capacity of europes talent skills and human capacity building must remain crosssectoral and critical area of focus for the european software strategy as whole attachments key recommendations list of group members 20 key recommendations foster einclusion general eskills and lifelong i ct learning among the labour force through multistakeholder partnerships with industry and ot her stakeholders concerned ensure access to access throughout the entire trainingemployment value ch ain including access to technology and physical infrastructure in schoo ls access to training and content curricula and certifications access to public funding and finally access to labour placements recognize ict skills value credentials and support industrybased ict skills certification s to keep european software industries competitive consider eufunded scholarships for underprivileged individuals to supplement basic ict educational learning in key ict areas consider eufunded university scholarships for ict skills and software engineering degrees in cooperation between industry and universities provide financial or other support measures for notably individuals to invest in eskills training and qualifications adopt tax breaks or financial incentives for compan ies in particular smes that conduct ict training rd and other software related innovation and human capacity investment establish european software expertise network to enhance
