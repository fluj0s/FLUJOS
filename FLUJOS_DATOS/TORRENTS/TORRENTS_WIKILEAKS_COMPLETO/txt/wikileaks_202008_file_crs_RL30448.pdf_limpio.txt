provides education and related services jointly to di sadvantaged parents and their young children the purpose of the program is to integrate early childhood education adult basic educa tion and parenting skills edu cation into unified family literacy program esea s ection 1201 an assumption underlying even start is that children whose parents have low literacy or basic education levels are more likely to be educationally successful if in addition to receiving early childhood instruction themselves their parents receive educational services plus instruction in how to help their children learn further parents may be more motivated to participate in adult basic edu cation programs if one of th purposes of such education is to support their childrens educational development while some other federal education programs such as esea title i part programs also provide services to both disadvantaged young childre n and their parents even start is the only federal program specifically dedicated to this purpose under the even start legislation the u s department of education ed is authorized to make grants to states for assistance to eligible entities consisting of local educational

cognitive and school outcomes longterm outcomes of early childhood programs the future of children vol 5 3 pp 2550reauthorization of even start these data indicate that even start programs tend to target families with children under age 5 40 of partic ipating children were 02 years old and 28 were 34 years old the parents in the families served generally have low levels of education for ex ample in 20002001 44 of parents had 9th grade or less level of educa tion upon entering the program further the income of participating families is typically quite low 84 of families had income below the federal poverty level on ly 23 of participatin g parents in 20002001 were employed8 the share of participants who are hispanic was 46 in 20002001 while 30 were white 19 were african american and the remaining 7 were asian native american hawaiian or multiracial the percentage of participants from nonenglishlanguage backgrounds is hi gh 45 of new even start enrollees speak english as second language the top four reasons given by parents for enrolling in even start were desire to improve their educational status get ged their parenting skills their ability to be better teacher of their child and their childrens chance of future school success services provided in most cases even start programs do not directly provide all of the required rvices rather they coordinate and integrate services provided by other agencies especially early childhood education provided by head start or state preschool programs or adult basic education provided by aea grantees the services most often provided directly by even start programs are early childhood education and parentin g skills education in addition to the core services that all even start programs must provide the support services most often provided are child care meals trans portation and social services the average federal budget for even st art programs surveyed in 20002001 was 175439 the average federal even start pr ogram expenditures per participating family was 4708 in 20002001 the rates of actual participation in various even start activities by the families being rved in 2000 2001 were 84 for adult education 89 for parenting education and parentchild joint activities and 95 for early childhood education with 82 of families pa rticipating in all core services maintaining the intensity of services and rates of participation continue to be an issue about half of the even start families who joined even start between 1997 1998 and 20002001 left the program with in 10 months in 20002001 17 of families who left even start did so because they had completed their education goals under the program the majority of participants who left did so b ecause of job conflicts relocation motiva tional issues and other cerns such as poor health homelessness etc evidence from the research literature has indicated that children who participate in intensive highquality services score higher on literacy measures9 and evidence from national even start evaluations has indicated that families participate more when more intensive services are offered as consequence even start projects havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30448crs5 10 third national even start evaluation p 165increased the amount of early childhood ducation and adult education services offered however most even start pare nts do not use all the hours of services available for themselves and their child ren for example in 20002001 on average children birth to two received 30 of the rvice hours made available for children aged 3 and 4 5 and schoolaged the averages were 37 44 and 62 respectively outcomes the most recent national even start evaluation for 20002001 was based on two data sources an exper imental design study eds that tracked 18 projects that agreed to randomly assign new families to even start or control group and the even start performance information reporting system espirs which tracks annual data from the universe of even start projects although families participating in the eds we re randomly assigned to c ontrol and even start groups the 18 projects participating were not randomly selected the eds families were more likely than even start families as whole to be hispanic 75 versus 46 and to be participating in even start projects in urban areas 83 versus 55 the national evaluation collected data on 41 different outcome measures for the families participating in the eds the results indicated that the even start children and their parents did not perform better than the control group children and their parents even start children and their parents made gains in literacy and other measures but so did control group parents and children the data show that children and parents in the control group made the same kinds of gains on literacy assessments on parent reports of child literacy on parentchild reading on literacy resources at home on family economic self sufficiency and so on that were seen for even start families10 the only area in which even start children did significantly better than control group children was in teacher reports of
