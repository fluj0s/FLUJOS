international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade the world banks international development association ida summary the world bank is multilateral development bank mdb that makes loans and grants to low and middleincome countries to reduce poverty and promote economic development both the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were founded at the bretton woods conference in 1944 two of the world bank facilities the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and international development association ida lend directly to governments to finance projects and programs ida was established in 1960 16 years after the creation of the world bank to address concern that the poorest countries could not afford to borrow at the near market rate terms offered by the ibrd consequently ida was established as revolving fund providing concessional loans to the poorest countries subsidized by donor contributions and transfers from the ibrd ida assistance is highly discounted it is increasingly provided as grants and only available to lowincome member countries since ida provides loans and grants to the poorest countries at subsidized rates its resources must be periodically replenished donor nations have replenished ida 14 times since its founding on march 5 2007 donor nations began to discuss possible fifteenth replenishment of funds for ida this is the first replenishment since the g8 summit at the gleneagles resort in scotland in 2005 where world leaders proposed the creation of the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri the mdri cancels the remaining debt of the worlds poorest countries and pledges to double the amount of aid to subsaharan africa between 2004 and 2010 primarily in the form of grant based assistance donor governments

2007 donor nations began to discuss fifteenth replenishment of funds for the world banks the bank concessional lending facility the international development association ida this is the first replenishment since the 2005 g8 summit at the gleneagles resort in scotland where world leaders proposed the creation of the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri the mdri cancels the remaining debt of the worlds poorest countries and pledges to double the amount of aid to subsaharan africa between 2004 and 2010 primarily in the form of grant based assistance1 it is also the first replenishment since the 2005 paris declaration on aid harmonization in which ida and over 100 other signatories agreed to increase coordination among donors in an effort to raise aid effectiveness the declaration was prompted by concerns that aid is ineffective under the current structure the lack of coordination of donors on the one hand and the increasing restrictions on projects themselves through donor earmarks and time limits on the other have raised the cost and difficulty for implementing foreign aid according to one foreign aid expert managing aid flows from many different donors is huge challenge for recipient countries since different donors usually insist on using their own unique processes for initiating implementing and monitoring projects recipients can be overwhelmed by requirements for multiple project audits environmental assessments procurement reports financial statements and project updates2 thus the role of ida in the international aid architecture has emerged as the dominant theme of the ida15 negotiations higher levels of debt relief will lead to lower levels of ida assistance unless donors increase their contributions significantly over the next several years according to bank economists and outside experts some argue that by forgiving the repayment of debt owed to ida the bank has substantially reduced the amount of money it has to fund new operations the bank asserts that without additional compensation from donors and an increase in regular contributions idas future commitments would remain flat in nominal terms and decrease by 2 per year in real terms concerted effort toward aid coordination would likely result in higher levels of ida funding 1 crs report rs22534 the multilateral debt relief initiative by martin weiss 2 steven radelet primer on foreign aid center for global development working paper 92 july 2006 p15 crs2 analysts in the united states and in other donor countries actively debate the pros and cons of providing foreign assistance through multilateral organizations rather than solely on bilateral basis in addition to the aid fragmentation problem discussed earlier it is believed by many that multilateral aid is more effective since it is likely to be better insulated from political pressure than bilateral assistance in the world banks case since the banks charter disallows its involvement in the domestic politics of any of its member nations many analysts believe that the bank has greater degree of credibility among borrower nations and is thus better able to secure often difficult and economically painful reforms3 furthermore some analysts argue that major benefit of the world banks multilateral assistance is that the bank is not directly subject to the often shifting priorities of individual donor nations and is thus able to focus on longterm multisectoral development assistance for example some point out that the current international focus on combating hivaids and other infectious diseases may have implications for cost of service of other healthcare programs drugs and availability of resources in addition to possible braindrain as doctors and medical professionals switch focus to work for programs with higher profile and greater availability of funding in these cases the world bank often plays an important role by focusing on countrys overall development needs through their country assistance strategies and continuing to provide assistance to all sectors of countrys economy on the other hand some analysts raise concerns that the united states loses too much control over the provision of its aid with multilateral approach first they argue it is very difficult for donors to earmark funds when they are contributed multilaterally if other donors are not in broad support of the us aid agenda the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid through the us agency for international development usaid or another us agency second since the united states does not have veto power on world bank lending the bank sometimes provides assistance to countries despite strong us opposition for example the world bank has several loan projects in iran country that the united states has designated as statesponsor of international terrorism although congress requires the united states to oppose any world bank loan to iran or any other country sodesignated by the state department since the united states does not have veto several projects to iran have gone through over the past few years most recently the world bank approved 224 million water supply and sanitation project in may 2005 currently the world bank has ten active projects in iran worth 136 billion4 according to some members of congress purely bilateral approach might ensure that us funds are used to support aid programs to countries that run counter to us foreign policy others argue that for some countries it may in the 3

example since certain countries might not be willing to accept aid if it were offered by the united states for domestic political reasons background the world bank is multilateral development bank mdb that makes loans and grants to low and middleincome countries to promote poverty alleviation and economic development5 both the world bank and the imf were founded at the bretton woods conference in 1944 two of the world bank facilities the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and international development association ida lend directly to governments to finance projects and programs the ibrd provides middleincome developing countries with loans at near market rates using funds raised by the world bank on the international capital markets while many of these countries can borrow on the international capital markets and are increasingly doing so some seek loans from the world bank to gain access to world bank technical assistance and advisory services as well as the prestige and perceived legitimacy that come with world bankbacked projects ida was established in 1960 16 years after the creation of the world bank due to concerns that lowincome countries could not afford to borrow at the nearmarket rate terms offered by the world bank6 consequently ida was established as revolving fund providing concessional loans to the poorest countries and subsidized by both donor contributions and transfers from the ibrd ida assistance is highly discounted and is increasingly provided as grants both ida and ibrd also make nonproject loans to promote economic policy and institutional reform and share the same staff both are headquartered in washington dc7 5 the united states is member of five multilateral development banks mdbs the world bank interamerican

corporation ifc promotes private sector development in poor and developing countries by making loans and investments in small and mediumsized companies in many poor countries the banking sector is weak and there is little or access to equity financing complementing ifc investments the multilateral investment continued crs4 initial ida funding in 1960 was 11 billion 900 million from donor contributions and 210 million from ibrd net income8 according to the bank between ida1 19601962 and ida14 20062008 total resources for ida have increased on average 95 per year in nominal terms over the threeyear ida14 period ida will provide 33 billion in concessional assistance in real terms however since ida6 19811984 available resources for ida have been flat figure 1 figure 1 growth of ida since inception in nominal and real terms in millions source world bank the donor replenishment process donor contributions account for over 70 of all resources available for ida providing about 138 billion the remainder is funded by internal ida resources primarily principal repayments from ida borrowers and transfers from ibrd net income internal resources have accounted for about 46 billion of idas funding while transfers from the ibrds net income and budget surplus have provided 117 billion to ida as of the end of the world banks fy2006 idas total assets were 1029 billion this is 321

architecture crs5 every three years ida donors meet to negotiate the terms of new round of ida since 1960 there have been 14 such replenishments negotiations for the 15th round began march 5 2007 at the replenishment donors revisit the overall amount of ida financing for the round in addition the replenishment is the primary opportunity for donor nations to influence world bank policy making9 for the united states ida contributions are typically the largest component of the annual us contributions to the international financial institutions ifis ida replenishments comprise two distinct phases negotiating the replenishment round and annual contributions first the donor nations negotiate the overall amount of threeyear replenishment individual donor contributions and general policy considerations for the round following this each member country seeks annual contributions typically through its legislative process to meet their ida commitments for the united states participation in any given ida replenishment requires congressional authorization of the total ida package following this authorization the president seeks annual appropriations to the us share of each round this bifurcated process where the executive branch commits to overall replenishment amount prior to annual contributions are appropriated has led to an arrearage problem since the united states is obligated to contribute the amount agreed to at the replenishment congress authorizes us participation in the replenishment agreement including the terms of that agreement when it authorizes funding for us contributions to the plan the constitution does not require however that congress appropriate the sums necessary to meet the terms of international agreement negotiated by the executive branch and authorized by congress us arrears to ida are 3779 million these arrears have had bandwagon effect unpaid us contributions have triggered prorata withholding of contributions during ida12 and ida13 by three other ida donors totaling about 72 million notwithstanding us arrears the us remains the largest contributor to ida and the ibrd and has commensurate share of influence in world bank operations an appendix provides more information about us influence at the world bank 9 the establishment of ida meant the recognition that there was legitimate need for concessional assistance and that the bank could provide this assistance without compromising its strict standards for lending however ida with its periodic replenishments by member governments meant that the bank had to pay increasing attention to the views and priorities of the parliamentary bodies that provided the replenishment funds whereas the bank had previously to consider only the productive and economic aspects of lending now the internal politics of the shareholding governments began to play larger role in the banks activities world bank profile of its third president eugene r black cited in aid architecture crs6 ida assistance ida assistance is categorized as official development assistance oda10 by the organization for economic development oecd and is tracked in the oecds development assistance committee dac database donor nations provide wide variety of foreign aid some provided bilaterally other channeled through multilateral organizations according to the oecd bilateral assistance accounts for 75 of all international foreign aid however they consider oda bilateral if donor channels assistance to multilateral agency but specifies the recipient country if all aid that is channeled through international organizations is categorized as multilateral aid the division between bilateral and multilateral assistance would be 505011 from 1960 through the 1980s ida was the largest individual provider of multilateral assistance with the flattening of ida assistance over the past twenty years other multilateral organizations have surpassed ida as provider of multilateral aid idas share of multilateral oda declined from 42 in the 1970s to an average of 20 in the 20012005 period12 the primary cause of this decline is the increasing fragmentation of donor flows among multitude of agencies such as the united nations european commission world health organization part of the united nations and the imf and world bank among many others while ida assistance has decreased as percentage of overall multilateral aid for the poorest countries those eligible to receive ida assistance ida remains the largest provider of multilateral oda for core development programs excluding debt relief administrative costs of donors emergency assistance and other special purpose grants idas cumulative net oda for 2001 to 2005 exceeded 33 billion about 20 of total coredevelopment oda for idaeligible countries in the same time period ida contributed more than 20 of oda in 17 countries between 10 and 20 in 34 countries between 5 and 10 in 12 countries and less than 5 in 18 countries there are 82 lowincome countries currently eligible for ida assistance including 39 in subsaharan africa ida loans are typically interestfree and have 10year grace period with repayments stretched over 3540 years there is small service charge however currently 075 of funds paid out increasingly ida is 10 oda is defined by the oecd those flows to developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies including state and local governments or by their executive agencies each transaction of which meets the following tests i it is administered

small island economies which are above the percapita income cutoff but lack the creditworthiness needed to borrow from ibrd some countries such as india indonesia and pakistan are idaeligible based on per capita income levels but are also creditworthy for some ibrd borrowing these are referred to as blend countries and receive loans from both agencies in the world banks fy2006 which ended june 30 2006 ida made commitments to its members totaling 95 billion half of these commitments were in sub saharan africa south and east asia received 38 of new commitments with the remainder scattered

the us remains the largest individual contributor to ida its share in ida14 dropped to 1378 after maintaining above 20 share for much of the past three decades figure 3 the decrease in us percentage

weights used for ida loans are the same as for overall contributions to the world bank since european member countries combined hold much larger percentage of world bank shares than the united states some analysts argue that europe could exert more force in ida lending decisions andor future replenishment negotiations if they negotiate together13 ida14 on april 18 2005 the board of governors of ida approved the fourteenth replenishment of idas resources14 at the conclusion of the ida14 negotiations ida donors announced that at least 34 billion in resources would be made available to the 81

of this amount since treasury was unable to certify that the world bank complied with certain congressionally mandated transparency initiatives us policy the united states government pursued many priorities at the ida14 negotiations according to the administration the major us objectives at ida14 were implementing results measurement framework for performancebased allocation increasing the percentage of ida assistance provided as grants and increasing world bank transparency15 measuring results and performancebased allocation in recent years many observers both critics and supporters of the mdbs have cited need to better measure the performance of world bank projects criticism often voiced by the us administration is that it is unclear what mdb assistance has accomplished due to vague objectives and too much emphasis on outputs volume of aid rather than country outcomes 15 see secretary of the treasury john snow remarks ida14 replenishment meeting february 22 2005 available at httpwwwtreasgovpressreleasesjs2270htm crs10 the focus on performance requirements and measurable results follows from analysis undertaken by world bank economists that suggested that foreign aid such as that provided by the world bank is most effective for countries that have good policies according to the report aid has positive impact on growth in developing countries with good fiscal monetary and trade policies in the presence of poor policies on the other hand aid has positive effect on growth emphasis added16 the notion that effective aid is conditional on underlying economic policy performance has become central to the bush administrations foreign aid strategy and policy toward the world bank the bush administration has made measuring results and performancebased allocation central to us foreign assistance and has made the practice of these ideas central to the operations of new foreign aid initiative the millennium challenge account mca17 reportedly this plan was based heavily on world bank research18 most analysts agree that improvements in health and education levels good governance reduced corruption increased opportunities for private enterprise and improvements in the trade capacity and investment climate are necessary in order to raise quality of life and the standard of living in developing countries some argue however that the obstacles that block progress in these areas are substantial and much effort and time may be needed to realize gains furthermore the administrations emphasis on growth may beg the question of income distribution it is unclear how the administrations emphasis on growth fits with the assertion by the mdbs and their executive boards that poverty alleviation should be the mdbs principal goals introducing stronger performance requirements thus became one of the administrations most sought after goals at ida building on the new results measurement system the us administration would like to channel more ida resources to the strongest performing countries this would mirror new domestic us foreign assistance programs such as the millennium challenge corporation mcc that were designed with performancebased allocation strictly in mind the ida14 performance measurement system is twofold assessing both 1 progress on aggregate country outcomes and 2 idas contribution to country outcomes to assess country performance the world bank monitors set of 14 country indicators for all ida countries to analyze ida performance the world bank created output indicators measuring idas contribution in the health education water supply and transportation sectors regarding performancebased allocation ida14 allocations are determined using formula that includes the ida 16 craig burnside and david dollar aid policies and growth american economic review september 2000 17 see crs report rl32427 millennium challenge account by curt tarnoff 18 daphne eviatar do aid studies govern policies or reflect them the new york times july 27 2003 crs11 country performance rating19 gross national income gni per capita and population the ida performance rating is the dominant factor and higher performance can increase ida allocations exponentially grants the united states has advocated for several years the use of grants rather than loans at the mdbs concessional lending facilities this view is response to the debt situation of many of the poorest countries principally in sub saharan africa20 bilateral and multilateral debt of the poorest countries increased heavily between the 1970s and the present it has become increasingly clear that the poorest countries are unable to service their old loans let alone new debt thus president bush introduced proposal in 2001 that the world bank shift its assistance to the poorest countries away from loans to grants21 for ida14 deputies agreed on 30 of total ida assistance in the form of grants an 8 increase from ida13 according to bobby pittman us treasury deputy assistant secretary for multilateral development banks grants can be useful for ending the lendandforgive cycle22 other donor countries agree with the concept of grants yet assert that without commensurate increases in ida funding the banks financial strength may suffer they also note that most ida loans are repaid in full and on time and only minority of borrowers have needed debt cancellation some analysts argue that an unstated component of the longterm us administration policyshift towards increased mdb grants may be shrinking of the institution barring additional donor funds the capacity to provide future assistance will decline because of fewer loan repayments money from loan repayments accounts for about 40 of the resources available for ida to fund new aid without these funds new ida aid would have to shrink critics of grants also note that the world banks ida loans are already provided on highly concessional terms with little or interest 19 the ida country performance rating is determined by two world bank ratings the country policy and institutional assessment cpia and the portfolio performance rating arpp the cpia constitutes 80 of idas country performance rating and is combined index of 16 pieces of information evaluating economic management structural policies policies for social inclusionequity and governance the cpia system was us initiative and was put in place during the ida negotiations in 1998 the arpp assesses each countrys performance on implementing prior programs and accounts for 20 of the performance rating the cpiaarpp number is multiplied by country measure of good governance to determine the ida country performance rating 20 see crs report rs22534 the multilateral debt relief initiative and crs report

transparency increasing transparency and public disclosure of world bank documents and policies has also been longstanding us priority at the world bank section 581 of the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 directed the treasury department to pursue policy goals related to transparency and accountability across the mdbs these priorities influenced us objectives at ida14 major component of the ida14 agreement is the world banks commitment to full disclosure of the numerical ratings for the country policy and institutional assessments cpia which bank began releasing in 2005 the cpias are the main component for determining ida lending allocations although the world bank began disclosing the cpia ratings in 2000 nongovernmental organizations ngos argued that they were released in an aggregated format that did not reveal anything about how country rating differed between countries and how the ratings were calculated23 in addition to releasing the cpia indicators and their supporting data the ida14 agreement called on the world bank executive board to implement other important transparency reforms specifically the agreement directed the board to 1 disclose board minutes 2 strengthen procedures for documenting public consultation processes 3 make interim results of projects during their execution publicly available and 4 require an independent audit or assessment of internal management controls and procedures for meeting operational objectives while board minutes are still classified donor countries have noted progress on the other ida14 objectives on november 2021 2006 ida deputies and representatives from ida borrower countries met in washington dc to review progress on implementing the ida14 recommendations participants were satisfied with the level of ida commitments and progress made on reforms to date lastly during the fy2006 appropriations process congress added provision section 599d that 20 of the funds appropriated to ida be withheld from disbursement until the secretary of the treasury certifies to congress that several anticorruption measures primarily relating to world bank procurement guidelines are met treasury was unable to certify that the world bank had met all of the required anticorruption provisions by the completion of the fy2007 spending measure consequently the continuing resolution cr for fy2007 appropriations pl1105 as amended rescinded 3135 million from the fy2006 appropriations ida15 at the end of the ida14 discussions donor countries agreed that the scope of policy issues addressed during the replenishment rounds had proliferated beyond reason they concluded that significant progress on any one area may be constrained unless donor countries limited their priorities for each round consequently ida 14 participants agreed that for future rounds they would concentrate on fewer areas for 23 jeff powell the world bank policy scorecard the new conditionality the bretton woods project

2007 kickoff meeting for the ida15 round ida deputies selected three themes for ida15 1 idas role in the international aid architecture 2 the role of the world bank in postconflict reconstruction and fragile states and 3 improving the effectiveness of ida assistance negotiations for ida15 concluded on december 14 2007 at the meeting donors agreed to provide 416 billion an increase of us 95 billion over the previous replenishment ida14 321 billion the united kingdom pledged donations of 43 billion over three years making it the largest single donor to ida15 the united states increased its pledge by 30 to 37 billion and will see its share rise from 138 to 147 this will be the first time in idas history that the united states is not the largest shareholder24 several countries are contributing to ida for the first time china cyprus egypt and estonia latvia and lithuania25 idas role in the international aid system during the runup to the ida15 negotiations idas role in the international aid system emerged as the most pressing issue for ida deputies as noted earlier in this report the proliferation of providers of foreign assistance and its increasing fragmentation among narrowly defined projects has emerged as concern among foreign aid professionals responding to these concerns analysts have suggested that the trend of decreasing multilateral assistance be reversed and that greater percentage of foreign assistance be channeled through ida or other multilateral providers according to one brookings institution analyst bilateral donors should put the politics aside and get serious on aid scaleup and harmonization through ida26 possible questions identified by the world bank that ida15 deputies may discuss during the ida15 negotiations include 1 idas role in the global aid architecture 2 concerns regarding vertical or global aid funds aid programs that focus on specific policy issues rather than countrybased assistance 3 idas role at the regional level and the best division of labor between ida and the regional development banks 4 implications for ida of the 2005 paris declaration agenda on aid harmonization 5 idas role be in building country institutional capacity to promote good governance especially at the local level in countries that have weak or nonparticipatory central governments and 6 ida efforts to improve global aid harmonization 24 the diminished share however will not impact the weight of us voting at the world bank 25 the full ida15 report is available at httpsiteresourcesworldbankorgidaresourcesseminar20pdfs73449117252597

and the rise of civil conflict in many countries throughout primarily africa and south asia the world bank has significantly enhanced its involvement in postconflict countries and other socalled fragile states in 2002 the world bank launched the licus low income countries under stress initiative to provide special assistance for highrisk countries defined as scoring 30 or less on the world banks cpia rating in january 2006 the bank adopted the term fragile states to refer to licus countries and the program as of 2008 there are around 25 countries classified as fragile states by the bank the goal of the licusfragile states program is to provide additional and coordinated assistance targeted to the needs of fragile states which are characterized by weak policies institutions and governance thus many analysts argue that world bank assistance in fragile states requires additional focus on statebuilding and peacebuilding objectives in addition to the banks traditional emphasis on economic growth and poverty alleviation during ida15 member countries and ida officials are expected to further refine the ida strategy for fragile states this may involve better integrating fragile states issues in idas work for example staff incentives increased analytic work of fragile state needs increased coordination with bilateral donors and the creation of results measurement systems designed specifically for fragile states the bank may also revise the types of financial assistance that it currently provides to fragile states for many fragile states and other postconflict countries the world bank is unable to lend because the fragile state either does not have functioning government or is in arrears to the world bank in these cases where the world bank cannot lend directly trust funds have been established to channel donor funds earmarked for specific country or project ida officials have recognized this challenge and are looking to establish framework for arrears clearance in ida15 ida and development effectiveness building on efforts undertaken in ida14 increasing the effectiveness of ida assistance is the third focus of ida15 the challenges facing ida as well as the rest of the aid system are formidable according to one study of world bank evaluation despite the billions of dollars spent on development assistance each year there is still very little known about the actual impact of projects on the poor27 2006 report from the world banks independent evaluation group ieg found that while the bank has instituted numerous policies and procedures to manage better for results these efforts have not translated into improved bank processes at the operational project level28 according to the report bank managers and staff continue to struggle to link operations to clearly defined goals moreover the report found that performance indicators are inadequate staff are unclear how to use 27 judy l baker evaluating the impact of

and that the world bank culture acts as disincentive to managing for results by focusing on the amount of projects and money lent rather than the quality of individual projects members of congress have exhibited significant interest in improving the effectiveness of ida assistance senate hearing in spring 2006 focused on improving the effectiveness of world bank lending and several proposals were discussed which may resurface during ida15 for example several development experts discussed at the hearing the need for better results measurement and proposed creating fully independent evaluation group for the world bank while the bank renamed its internal evaluation group from the operations evaluation department oed to the independent evaluation group in 2005 it is not truly independent since oed staff are world bank employees and frequently rotate between oed and other bank offices however the ieg reports directly to the executive board not the bank president according to one hearing participant the world bank makes some attempt to achieve independence for its operations evaluation department oed which reports directly to the board of the world bank not to the president however staff move back and forth between oed and the rest of the bank negative evaluation could hurt staffs career prospects the oed evaluation is subjective unclear methods lead to evaluation disconnects it has to be asked how the largely positive findings of the evaluations can be reconciled with the poor development outcomes observed over the same period 1985199529 another testified that independence at the bank is purely cosmetic for temporary change of desk and new nameplate do not alter the signature on the paycheck nor the rewards of the banks personnel system the independent evaluation group is department of the bank like any other save the ceremony of reporting to an executive board that is passive at best for everyone save the titular director general revolving door leads back to standard line jobs and advancement at the bank because results are published there is strong pressure to display success outside verification is precluded because there is public access to the underlying data this hardly fosters disinterested and rigorous judgments even though the bank boasts that staff cannot review projects that they themselves designed30 in response to these concerns experts at the hearings proposed creating an outside independent evaluation group that would be able to perform rigorous and independent impact evaluation of what does and what does not work in world bank 29 william easterly accountability for multilateral development banks statement presented to the committee on foreign relations of the united states senate march 28 2006 30 adam

the life of the bank the united states has contributed the largest amount of resources 2649 billion total committed 1684 of total committed shares as the largest contributor the united states enjoys single seat on the world banks board of executive directors and carries 1638 of the total votes in world bank decision making congressional authorization is required by law before the united states may agree to participate in any world bank funding agreements such as the triannual ida replenishment agreements while congress does not have representative at the negotiations the executive branch is required to consult with members of congress before and during the replenishment process the us executive director ed is the primary us representative to the bank and sits on the executive board which is comprised of 24 members representing all of the banks 185 members the ed handles the daytoday operations of the fund the majority of bank decisions require 50 majority vote some special matters changes in the articles of agreement or approval of funding increases for example require an 85 affirmative vote since the us vote exceeds 15 funding increases amendments or other major actions can go into effect without us consent by tradition the president of the world bank is an american citizen the position is currently held by robert zoellick who began his term july 1 2007 while the executive branch manages the daytoday us relationship at the world bank congress decides the overall terms of us involvement in the bank by setting the level of us contributions and through legislation directing how the us shall vote at the bank there are three primary ways that congress can seek to influence or govern us policies towards mdb policy through conditions attached to new funding agreements through periodic sense of congress resolutions or legislation suggesting specific goals and priorities the united states ought to emphasize at the mdbs or directing how the us should vote on certain countries or types of projects and through oversight hearings for additional background information on the world bank and the other multilateral development banks mdbs see crs reports by
