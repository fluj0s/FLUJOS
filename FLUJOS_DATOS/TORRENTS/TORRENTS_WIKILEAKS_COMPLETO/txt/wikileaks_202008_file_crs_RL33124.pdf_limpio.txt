refined fuels commensurately much of the refined pr oduct shortfall was ma up by imports of refined products some of wh ich were made available by strategic supplies released by international energy agency i ea member nations on september 2 as part of the iea drawdown 30 million barrels of crude oil were made available from the us strategic petroleu m reserve spr which holds only crude only 11 million barrels was sold from th spr in part because limited refinery capacity reduced the call on crude natural gas production from gu lf of mexico and louisiana state lands has been recovering since the storms but the equiva lent of about 3 of us consumption remains shutin because of production or transport problems unlike refined products which can be imported there is little extra available

great deal of refining capacity in louisiana and alabama offshore oil and gas producti on was resuming when hurrican rita made landfall on september 24 and an additional 48 million barrels per day mbd of refining capacity in texas and nearby louisiana was closed the most profound impacts of the hurri canes were on refined product supply although natural gas supply to the us pipelin grid is also concern at one point about onethird of the nations refining cap acity was closed virt ually all have been restored although output at couple of its is still in the process of ramping up heroic recovery efforts at refineries nd increased imports of refined products met warm heating seasons needs and kept gasoline supplies flowing without isolated runouts about 400000 bd of crude oil from the outer continental shelf ocs and louisiana state lands is currently shut in th is is the equivalent of about 5 of total us petroleum demand impor ted crude has kept stocks at more than adequate levels refined product supplies we re initially made up from the release of 30 million barrels of gasoline middle distillate and othe r products from the strategic reserves of member nations of the organization for economic cooperati on and development oecd who are international energy agency iea members since those barrels arrived in early fall 2005 the world market private sector has provided the united states with an increased level of imports supply appears to have matched demand as prices fell throug h late 2005 and early 2006 number of crosscurrents bear on this situation including how fuel demand is affected by prices and when winter weathe r arrives and how cold it might be on the supply side of the relationship are factor s which include the rate at which us refining recovers and the availability on world markets of commercial refined products in addition some wa ivers of gasoline specifications have been granted by the environmental protection agency epa aimed at making gasoline easier to supplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33124crs2 with natural gas about 85 of the nations supply comes from domestic production there is very little opportunity to import replacement supply as of october nearly 10 of total nationw ide consumption was shutin because of production problems in the federal offshore gulf of mexico or because of damage to critical infrastructure another 3 of nationwide supply from louisiana state lands is shutin despite reduced output gas was still being placed in storage the additions during the week ending october 14 were 75 billion cubic feet bcf the amount of gas already in storage was equivalent to the fiveyear average although it was slightly below yearearlier levels gas sold from storage is used to ba lance seasonal demand swings and not to replace catastrophic loss of production give n that the current amount of shutin ocs and louisiana state lands gas is the equivalent of half the most recent weeks storage addition the perception of robust injection to storage should be adjusted accordingly despite the fact that supplies continue to flow wellhead prices have doubled since last summer issues for the onset of cold weather include timing and severity as with oil as well as demand destruction resulting from higher prices but if gulf of mexico production does not recover there is import safetyvalve and supplies could become tight and prices could spike in the immediate wake of katrina and rita much of the impacted area was without electric power but nearly all cu stomers who had been without power in texas have had service restor ed in louisiana power outages are more widespread although many customers listed as being without power are unable to receive it because of damage to the premises hurricane effects on crude oil production imports and transportation nearly 16 mbd of crude oil the equiva lent of 76 of us oil consumption was produced on the gulf of mexico federal offshore before the hurricanes struck production was virtually halted in the wake of both storms as production facilities were evacuated and wells were shut down the storms destroyed 111 production platforms and 52 were seriously damaged number of drilling rigs were destroyed which will limit futu re production from new wells yet to be completed oil production has begun to resume ou tput has begun to rampup reaching 600000 bd on october 11 but 60 of gulf of mexico oil remains shut in and over 50 million barrels of oil output have been lost since katrinarelated shutdowns began on august 26 the amount of lost output continues to mount as about 1 mbd of capacity remains shutin between october 1 and october 7 oil output rose by 300000 bd an encouraging sign of restarting operati ons but full assessment of damage to facilities including

oct 12 2005 2 ibidwhether production is steadily coming back or if all the production that has come back was the easiest to restore while currently shutin output presents significant challenges at production platforms within transport infrastructure and at coastal processing facilities produc tion can come back only as fast as pipelines and processing facilities return to service that said energy information administration eia administrator guy caruso has estimated that shutin pr oduction will continue being restored the amounts shut in will likely average 930000 bd in oc tober 724000

louisiana to illinois was shut for several weeks it is now operating at 80 capacity this limited crude supply to number of refiners in the central part of the nation and the sun pipeline and terminal st arted limited operations in ear ly october supplying number of texas and louisiana refineries some pipelines transporting refined pr oducts had service outages or throughput reductions as result of the hurricanes most notable was the colonial pipeline which transports fuels from the gulf northeastward ending in new york this is an important source of supply for consumers ll along its route and its outage resulted in very high prices in places like mary land and washington dc which at one point had the highest gasoline prices in th nation colonial received full commercial electric power on

crude for which they asked the results of crude oil and refined product offerings from government strategic reserves show demand for produc ts to be stronger than crude perhaps as result of so much

categorie s of petroleum inventories have experienced declines since katrina with the exception of gasoline total stocks have declined at rate of about 750000 bd how th figures might be interpreted is matter of some debate the obvi ous facts are that they have declined and that there is some level below which spot shorta ges and distributional problems begin to appear prior to march 2003 does weekly petroleum status re port referred to this as the minimum operational inventory moi subsequent issues have dropped any reference to moi because of differing view s within the industry regarding what the minimum level might be because of impr ovements and inventory management and logistics industry had r ecommended using lower figures than doe had previously been using doeindustry dialogue held by the national petroleum council in august 2004 failed to reach an agreement on moi and it has not been referenced since it was dropped when last shown on does charts of inventory levels8 these

gasoline stocks ava ilable 107 million barrels of extra stocks compared to about 88 mbd of demand before runouts would start to occur tight inventory situation might be exp ected to be cause for concern however prices for the moment at least are falling at the pump regular gasoline prices peaked at 306 an alltime high on septem ber 5 they have steadily declined falling to 270 in midoctober wholesale prices and gasoline traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex fell similarly the market does not appear to be res ponding to any shortagerelated fears but it may be responding to concerns about demand destruction resulting from high prices indeed the data for the four weeks ending october 14 show demand for gasoline and middle distillates each bout 200000 bd below the yearago

throug h september 15 2005 in order to help increase available fuel supplies for gasoline epa waived volatility standards that would have otherwise prohib ited the sale of gasoline produced for northern states in the south or the sale of winter gasoline in the summer months this waiver was intended to make it possible for gasoline normally prohibited in certain areas to be transported to those areas in response to supply limitations after september 15 many of the waived standards longer applied as the country transitioned from mmer to winter gasoline12 epa also waived national sulfur standards for diesel fuel so that through september 15 fuel produced for nonroad uses could be legally used in highway vehicles this waiver was intended to help mitigate some of the disruption in diesel fuel supplies13 in several cases epa has also issued waivers of specific standards for certain states or regions these waivers have b een issued on casebycase basis as some standards and
