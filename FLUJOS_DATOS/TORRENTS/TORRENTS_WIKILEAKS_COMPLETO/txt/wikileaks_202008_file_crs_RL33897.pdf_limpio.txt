through most of the last century us census bureau population projections to 2030 indicate that further and more dramatic growth is still to come this increase is in part due to longer life expectancies and the aging of the baby boom generation as the older population continues to increase in size and proportion and as individuals continue to live longer postretiremen t changes in where older americans live or the geographic distribution of the older population will likely have broad policy implications for federal state and local governments older americans are not unlike the rest of the us population in that they live in the most populous states california florida new york and texas the majority of the population age 65 and older lives within major metropolitan areas however the older population accounts for larger proportion of the total us population living in nonmetropolitan or rural areas some experts have expressed concern over the level of access older rural residents have to affordable housing and transportation options health and social services and medical providers and specialists older americans are less likely to move than the younger population and of those who do move most move within the same county or state among those moving to different states the pattern has been to relocate from colder to warmer climates from larger metropolitan areas to smaller cities and towns and from higher to lower cost of living areas over the past few decades migration patterns among the older population have led to an increase in the 65andolder population in some states in the southern and western regions of the country other states in the midwest and northeast have relatively high proportions of their resident population age 65 and older which is likely due to younger workers having left these regions combined with pattern of many older individuals remaining in these communities population shifts affect important aging policy issues that concern both the government and private sector including social services housing health care and transportation at the federal level funds for federal programs such as nutrition and supportive services under the older americans act oaa and the us department of housing and urban development hud section 202 housing program for the elderly are disbursed according to state population estimates at the state and local levels understanding geographic patterns and changes in population distribution can assist policy makers in targeting public funds for needed services improve service delivery and aid in

population age 65 and older grew steadily through most of the 20th century us census bureau population projections to 2030 indicate that further and more dramatic growth is still to come this increase is in part due to longer life expectancies and the aging of the baby boom generation those born between 1946 and 19641 in 2005 the older population defined as those individuals age 65 and older was estimated at 37 million marking 5 increase from the 2000 decennial census estimate of 35 million between 2005 and 2010 the older population is expected to increase by another 10 to 40 million and then by an additional 36 to 55 million by 2020 this dramatic growth in the older population is expected to begin in 2011 when the first of the baby boomers turn 65 years of age and to continue beyond 2029 when the youngest of the boomers reach age 65 the census projects that in 2030 the us population will have an estimated 72 million older americans more than twice as many as the number estimated in 2000 2 in 2003 those who reached age 65 could expect to live an additional 185 years on average 198 for women and 168 for men or until 835 years of age3 and while the population age 85 and older represents small segment of the older population the oldestold defined as those individuals age 85 and older are in fact the fastestgrowing segment of the older population between 2000 and 2005 the population age 85 and older increased by 20 and is projected to increase by another 20 to 61 million by 2010 between 2010 and 2020 the population age 85 and older is expected to increase an additional

americans are not unlike the rest of the us population in that they live in the most populous states and within major metropolitan areas while older americans are less likely to move than the younger population of those who do move most move within the same county or state7 among those moving to different state their pattern has been to relocate from colder to warmer climates from larger metropolitan areas to smaller cities and towns and from higher to lower cost of living areas 8 over the past few decades this has led to increases in the older population in some states in the south and west and in major metropolitan areas and counties within these states changes in the geographic distribution of the older population affect not only the states on the receiving end of retirement migration but states experiencing population change due to older and younger residents leaving the state often referred to as outmigration for example out migration has had large impact on the age distribution of the population in some states in the midwest and northeast particularly as young workers have left work in the farming and mining industries in some of these states greater share of the states resident population is growing older but not moving concept often referred to as aging in place 9 in addition to migration patterns among older and younger residents differences in the proportion of states older resident population are determined by patterns of fertility generally states with high fertility rates have higher proportion of younger residents and lower proportion of older residents according to some researchers the changing geographic distribution of the older population may result in disparities between resources and needs including medical services social services housing and longterm care10 this section of the report presents estimates of the older population by state and region as well as data on population change by region and selected metropolitan statistical areas and counties g21g157g138g157g142g561g6g146g156g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g18g152g153g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 in general the most populous states

this further suggests that retirement migration of younger senior population that is those age 65 to 74 may leave some states with an increasing oldestold population that is aging in place and more likely to be frail or in need of health and supportive services two states oklahoma and mississippi experienced declines in their oldest old population over the same fiveyear period figure 5 shows map

growth among the older population historically migration of the older population has been concentrated geographically in few states such as florida arizona california and texas while recent trends suggest wider variation in retirement destinations among older interstate migrants states experiencing high growth such as arizona nevada and georgia were among the leading destination states in 2000

local communities face increases both in the size and proportion of their older resident population due in part to longer life expectancy and the aging of the baby boom generation additionally some states and communities have been identified as retirement magnets that is they are popular retirement destination spots these retirement hot spots many in sunbelt states such as florida arizona and nevada are popular typically because they have warmer climates lower cost of living and lower population density relative to the retirees state of origin popular destination states have expe rienced an influx of older migrants who are typically in their immediate postretirement years between the ages of 65 and 74 with considerable disposable income married and in favorable health some experts believe that areas experiencing growth from younger senior population are likely to benefit from increases in consumption of local goods and services net increase in the state and local tax base and greater community involvement including volunteerism from an active retirement population 26 other states and local communities may face increases in the share of their older resident population due to younger workingage residents leaving for jobs in other states leaving an ever increasing older population as the economic and health status of older individuals declines with advanced age states and local communities with higher concentrations of older americans particularly those age 85 and older may face increased demands for public support for resources such as medical and health services social services housing transportation and longterm care the ability of state and local governments to pay for these services may be difficult communities with greater proportion of older individuals

greater health and social service needs and because they have fewer young people to count on for support27 related concern involves older persons who return from popular retirement destination states to their state of origin possibly due to changes in their economic social or health status such as widowhood or onset of chronic disease or disability these socalled counterstream migrants have been found to be on average somewhat older and more often widowed and living dependently with relatives and others than other migrants 28

decades due to several factors older individuals aging in place outmigration of younger workers leaving behind an older resident population and the movement of older individuals from metropolitan areas to smaller communities or inmigration of retirees according to researchers the older population particularly the oldestold in rural or non metropolitan areas are more likely to be poor than those living in urban or metropolitan areas 29 many observers believe that rural health services can be more costly to deliver and are less accessible either due to the recipients lack of close proximity to services or to fewer providers and less specialized services furthermore the range of health care services may be limited with few alternatives for patients given that the older population accounts for larger proportion of the total population in nonmetropolitan areas some experts have expressed concern about ongoing problems with the delivery of medical and social services to rural residents 30 as result congress has passed legislation that specifically includes provisions focusing on the special needs of the rural elderly for example under the oaa title iii services are available to all persons age 60 and over but are targeted to those with the greatest economic or social need particularly lowincome and minority persons and older persons residing in rural areas the law also requires that states in developing their intrastate funding formulas take into account the distribution of people with those characteristics the law further requires that the agencies set specific objectives for serving target groups and that program development advocacy and outreach efforts be focused on these groups service providers are required to meet specific objectives set by area agencies for providing services to target groups including the rural elderly and area agencies are required to describe in their area plans how they have met these objectives 27 frey boomers and

report is the us census bureau31 data used in this report are from census population estimates for 2005 and published data from the 2000 decennial census another source of population data cited in this report is the current population survey cps nationally representative sample survey of households conducted monthly by the us census bureau monthly cps supplements provide demographic and social data given that large amount of federal spending for programs and services to vulnerable older populations is distributed based on census population data the accuracy of data collection methods is important however some individuals including ol der individuals may be counted incorrectly or not captured in the census at all the census may not accurately capture older individuals who travel frequently or have multiple residences in one year for example this may affect the socalled snowbird population who choose to spend part of the year typically the winter months in state with warmer climate these older individuals would be identified in the state where they were residing on april 1 regardless of their permanent address alternatively some older americans choose to have permanent residence and instead travel continuously in the united states andor abroad live in vacation home or live and travel in recreational vehicles while it is difficult to quantify the number of older individuals who choose these lifestyles some observers indicate this population is increasing 32 according to experts reliable data at the state and local levels are needed to help governments accurately assess the wellbeing of their older populations33 information on the older population may also be difficult to obtain due to lack of data collection or specification by residential setting like many large national householdbased surveys that rely on census population data the cps does not sample the institutionalized population including those in nursing homes this exclusion can be an issue for researchers and policymakers who are interested in information on the entire older population particularly among the oldestold age group and as the use of assistedliving facilities and other types of residential settings as alternatives to institutional care has increased over the past 15 years data collection efforts that distinguish these types of noninstitutional community residences
