authorized to develop ne twork of 3025 miles of corridor roads at the end of 1997 2258 miles comprising 75 of the approved corridor roads were open to traffic duri ng the first 33 years of the adhps existence over 45 billion was appropriate d from the treasurys general funds for this road system the annual appropriati on levels fluctuated substan tially over this period the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 authorizes 450 million per year for the adhp during fy1999 to fy2003 from th highway trust fund this provides stability of funding for the adhp1 the federal share of the estimated cost to complete the adhp network at the end of fy1997 was 62 billion this report will not be updated program origins in 1964 the presidents appalachian re gional commission parc reported that appalachias geographic isolation from both the prosperous adjacent eastern seaboard and the midwest was the very basis of its developmental lag the parc report argued that appalachian development could not proceed until its regional isolation was overcome by its penetration by an adequate trans portation network2 congress responded to the report by passing the appalachian regional commission act of 1965 arca pl894 the act establishe d the appalachian regional commission arc as regional development agency designed to establish federal state and local partnership although the acts

this report discusses the adhp after br ief description of the adhp system the report describes the adhps opera tion organization spending history and status it then describes changes in its funding mechanism resultant from tea21 and issues of interest to congress related to the adhp appalachian development highway system adhs the core development argument in the parc report was that before development could take place in appalachia major investments had to be made in basic public facilities3 this infrastructurefocused developm ent theory coupled with the belief that the barriereffect of appal achias mountainchains was major cause of appalachian underdevelopment led to the proposal that development highway system be built to break the isolation of appalachias ec onomically depressed regions the arca incorporated the parcs recommendation and authorized the establishment of the adhp the adhp system was seen as network of highways that would work in conjunction with both the interstate highwa system and other federal aid highways the system of corridor highways and access ro ads was designed to pass through isolated parts of appalachia and link up with the interstate system the original network design reflects the parc reports suggestion that th routes not be chosen to ease congestion or upgrade heavily traveled areas but to stimulate traffic through remote areas that have developmental potential4 although the basic corridor network has b een adhered to it has been subject to controversy for example 1971 general ccounting office report concluded that the arc was allowing the individual states through their transportationhighway departments to direct priority construc tion to some highway segments that did not significantly increase accessibility to and th rough the region the 1971 study asserted that this had led to fragm ented pattern of construction5 the arc took issue with gaos conclusions noting that it made sense to assign priority to the least adequate sections and that the commission could not co mpel state to accept project without its consent6 with 75 of the adhs now open to traffi c many of the gaps mentioned in the gao study have been completed states still commonly propose giving construction priority to congested or heavily traveled portions of the corridors originally the network wa s envisioned as having 2350 miles but over time and as new states were added to the arc the system was increased to 3025 miles of corridorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98973crs3 7appalachian regional commission appalachian development highway system

cochairman is elected by the state members from among themselves for term of not less than one year decisions by the commission require the affirmative vote of the federal cochairman and majority vote of the state members by stat ute the arc transmits to the us secretary of transportation its designations of general corridor locations and termini of development highways local access roads to be constructed nd priorities for the construction of segments of the development highways before state member participates in vote on any of these desi gnations they must obtain the recommendations of the appropriate state transportation agency the us department of transportation us dot is authorized to assist in the construction of the system and the local access roads in way similar to its involvement in the federalai d highways as long as the involvement is not incons istent with the arca13 periodically the arc provides an estimate of each states cost to complete its share of the system funds are apportioned by the us dot to the states based on these cost to complete estimates the state transportationhighway depa rtments oversee the planning and construction of the corridors and access roads the federal matching share for any construction project is limited to maximum of 80 of the project cost in cases where state has begun construction of segment without the aid of federal funds the us dot upon application by the state and with the approval of the arc may authorize payment to the state of the federal share not to exceed 80 of the project costs from funds

higher than the 1960s average the decade of the 1980s was period of reduced spending the fy1982 appropriation was less than half that of fy1981 and the average annual fiscal year appropriation during the decade was 1086 million 36 lower than during the 1970s the reagan administration was opposed to the continued existence of the arc and each year the federal cochairman would recommend zero appropriation for the arc only to have congress appropriate funds to sustain the agency although at reduced levels ppropriation levels increased during the first five fiscal years of the 1990s from 105 million in fy1990 to 1798 million in fy1995 appropriations again fell to about th 100 million level for fy1996 and fy1997 the house report for the energy and water ppropriations bill hr ept 104679 referred to this as the continuing downsizing of the agency however in fy1998 the arc experienced another reversal of fortune when congress increased the appropriation for highways to 4025 million more than f our times the fy1997 level of 997 million this turnaround presaged major change in the longterm funding for appalachian highways tea21 and the adhp historically adhp funding had come from us treasury general funds passa ge of tea21 changed this by authorizing that 450 million in contract authority be ppropriated from the highway trust fund for each of the fiscal years fy1999fy2003 these funds remain av ailable until expended the congress can appropriate add itional money from the gene ral fund if it wishes16 tea21 guarantees the availability of at least 225 billion of new f

congress most of the policy issues congress faces concerning the appalachian development highway program are recurring issues that da back to the founding of the appalachian regional commission17 emphasis on highway construction as requisite for development the founding argument for the adhp was that appalachia was region apart and that development could not proceed until the regiona l isolation was broken advocates of this view argue that improvements in the poverty nd employment rates in areas served by the completed highway segments vindicate this policy critics of this view generally argue that these improvements reflect trends in the national economy rather than the impact of the adhs some also argue that these highways can exacerbate depressed local economies as small towns and businesses are sometimes bypassed by the new roads the federal role in regi onal economic development supporters of the arc and the adhp argue that given the size of the region the number of state and local jurisdictions involved and the amount of money needed federa l participation is necessary the parc report also argued that when it came to federal spending the appalachian region had for many years b een shortchanged opponents of federal involvement question the appr opriateness of concentrating special effort on 13 states to the relative disadvantage of nonparticipating states in rms of federal highway dollars available cost to complete the adhs tea21 authorized over five years 225 billion or roughly one third of the estimated federal share cost to complete the system during this period there could be proposals to dd appropriations add itional to the tea21s authorized levels to speed the adhs to comple tion or to direct extra funds to particular corridors as has already happened for fy1999 environmentalist opposition some of the remaining adhs corridor miles are to be built in the least developed parts of appalachia and critics charge that completing these corridors will destroy wild erness in remote areas supporters of completing the entire system generally assert that environmental problems are minimal especially given the planned implementation of environmental mitigation measures supporters also often assert that the economic and safety benefits outweigh any possible environmental costs
