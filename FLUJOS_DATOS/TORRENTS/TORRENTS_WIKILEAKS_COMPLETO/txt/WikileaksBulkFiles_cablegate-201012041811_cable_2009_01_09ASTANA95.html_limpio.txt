summary president nazarbayev told centcom commander general petraeus the situation in afghanistan greatly worries him the taliban should never be allowed to become coalition partner in the afghan government iran cannot be allowed to become nuclear state but the united states needs to talk directly with tehran and he is willing to be helpful kazakhstan will never again be colonized but has excellent relations with russia and china the west has underestimated the depth of russias wounded pride but he is willing to be helpful if the obama administration has wise response to russia end summary 2 sbu us central command commander general david petraeus met with kazakhstans president nursultan nazarbayev on january 14 for twice the scheduled time 70 minutes the us side included major general robert allardice centcom j5 polad michael gfoeller and the ambassador note taker security council secretary kaibek suleymenov presidential foreign policy adviser khairat sarybay and magzhan ilyassov of the presidential administration accompanied president nazarbayev afghanistan 3 s general petraeus thanked president nazarbayev for the recent formal ratification of the longexisting overflight and divert agreements as well as for kazakhstans willingness to participate in the northern distribution network for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan he briefed the president on iraq and afghanistan nazarbayev responded afghanistan greatly worries us i am often in touch with afghanistan president hamid karzai he says the situation is good and the economy is growing but i know he controls only 30 of his territory and if the afghan economy is growing its based on drugs we are already providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance but we need better security in afghanistan if we are to do more the united states and kazakhstan have common interest in strengthening afghanistan nazarbayev said he knows karzai wants to involve the taliban in his government and commented that would be greatly dangerous general petraeus explained that karzais position is more nuanced the goal would be to break up the taliban and reconcile some but we have illusion that mullah omar could ever join the government nazarbayev replied if theres chance to break up the taliban thats fine but the taliban leadership will never change its position 4 s nazarbayev told general petraeus youre aware of afghan history foreign country ever succeeded in invasion afghans have to govern themselves calling the situation in afghanistan very complicated nazarbayev said he knows some the potential candidates to succeed karzai but none of them could unify and lead afghanistan karzai is weak but its better to keep him on nazarbayev added hes heard karzai claim the taliban are trained in pakistan and said he accepts that as credible nazarbayev added central asia needs common policy on afghanistan but that hasnt happened he alluded to uzbekistans support for the ethnic uzbek leader dostum iran 5 s nazarbayev judged that iran is problem in the region and general petraeus fully agreed nazarbayev said i have good contacts among the leadership in iran ive tried to explain to them that kazakhstan was once nuclear but astana 00000095 002 of 003 fully gave up that status i tell them it would be to their benefit to be nonnuclear that would draw new assistance and investment general petraeus said he again fully agreed with the president but noted irans policy is determined by the revolutional guard alquds force commander not by president ahmedinejad or the foreign ministry nazarbayev noted he had once talked to ahmedinejad for two and half hours about such issues but in the end i realized i had just wasted my time he said supreme leader ayatollah khameni told him that even if iran compromises on the nuclear issue the united states would always find another reason to criticize because they hate us all the united states wants is to conquer the entire region and steal the oil general petraeus interjected we could have bought all the oil in the region for 100 years for what weve spent in iraq nazarbayev looking bit amused said i know im just telling you what he said without specifying his interlocutor nazarbayev said hed asked if tehran is willing to talk to the united states and they said yes i conveyed this to presidentelect obama during our postus election phone call general petraeus commented the united states had had three rounds of talks with iran about iraq but had gotten nowhere nazarbayev said i have illusion us negotiations with iran would be easy or fast but we cannot let iran have nuclear weapons i want to be helpful with iran 6 s nazarbayev added he has discussed irans nuclear ambitions with russian president medvedev and prime minister putin i emphasize to them nuclear iran is in ones interests general petraeus responded that its important to get russia to be helpful with iran they seem conflicted sometimes they help sometimes they send weapons nazarbayev said i told obama that he has good chance to have good relations with mevedev thats important for us too since russia and kazakhstan are neighbors russia 7 s general petraeus told president nazarbayev kazakhstans special relationship with russia is not problem for the united states its not zerosum game for us you can have good relations with russia and china as well as with us nazarbayev said he fully agreed adding i tell russia and china we have our own resources we are kazakhs we were colonized for over 500 years first by the golden horde then by the western chinese then by russia weve been independent for only 17 years and we do not want to be colonized again we will never be under russia or china we have enough resources and reasonably educated population to make our own choices we want stability development and cooperation we all have to have russia inside the tent id like the united states and the european union to help with this 8 s nazarbayev said the west had made real mistakes after the collapse of the soviet union by not treating yeltsin with respect he said yeltsin had once gone to the natorussia council where he had been teased nazarbayev explained russia has great but now injured pride it was once great empire and russian soldiers had played large role in winning the great patriotic war ww ii but the west seems to refuse to understand this for russia maintained nazarbayev face is everything nazarbayev said he had frequently told president medvedev that being an energy superpower is not enough its essential to develop international leadership with spirit of cooperation nazarbayev said medvedev was almost there but then the georgia mistake happened nazarbayev concluded if the new us administration has wise response to russia id be glad to help with the relationship 9 s note while waiting for nazarbayev to enter the meeting room general petraeus ask foreign policy adviser sarybay why kazakhstan had moved its capital from almaty to astana 00000095 003 of 003 astana sarybay answered there are probably 20 different reasons people give in fact in the first few years of independence several maps appeared that made our northern border unclear and so the president planted the flag this is the first time we are aware that senior official has confirmed nazarbayev moved his capital to prevent russian nationalists from annexing the northern third of kazakhstan which hotheads including some in the duma at that time claimed was historically part of russia end note 10 s comment nazarbayev looked as fit as ever and was very wellbriefed discussing details of the uskazakhstan military relationship without notes he was not shy that he sees himself as an international statesman we know he was genuinely pleased with presidentelect obamas telephone call and we judge his offers to be helpful for the united states with iran and russia are genuine end comment 11 u general petraeus has cleared this cable hoagland
