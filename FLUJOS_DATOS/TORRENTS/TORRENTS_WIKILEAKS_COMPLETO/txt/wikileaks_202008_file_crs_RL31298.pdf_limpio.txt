to the rehabilitation act strea mlining the vocational rehabilitation process one of the objectives of the 1998 reauthorization legislation was to streamline and simplify thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31298crs4 8joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on hr 1385 congressional record july 29 1998 p h6693vr process for consumers of services the legislation built upon related provisions that were enacted in the 1992 reauthorization of the act the 1992 amendments included provisions to make the eligibility process more efficient and timely and to make it easier for state vocational rehabilitation counselors to accept persons for service many vr consumers continued to advocate additional ways to streamline the rehabilitatio n process this interest was reflected in number of provisions in pl 105220 including simplifying certain aspects of the eligibility determination process and changing the way in which consumers vr services are planned these provisions are described below presumptive eligibility by recipients of ssdi and ssi simplifying eligibility determinations pl 105220 changed prior law to require that an individual is presumed to be eligible for vr services if heshe is eligible for cash payments under the social security disability ssdi or supplemental security income ssi programs under prior law there was presumptive eligibility provision the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference stipulated that this provision does not create an absolute entitlement to vr services in order to receive vr services an individual must also require services to prepare for secure retain or regain employment the statement also indicated that the presumption of eligibility is only the first step in an overall evaluation of whether or not an individual will receive vr services and that an individual must demonstrate hisher desire to work in order to receive services receipt of services is also contingent upon availability of funds consistent with state policies8 another provision designed to ease the eligibility determination process reduced the need for development of new eligibility documentation the law allowed state vr agencies to use existing current information available from other programs to determine eligibility for vr services and to develop the individualized plan for employment ipe key element in the development and planning of rehabilitation goals and services for consumers the eligibility determination process may include information used by education agency officials and the social security administration ssa and information provided by the individual and hisher family among other sources vr consumers rehabilitation services plans after vr counselors determine an individuals eligibility and assess hisher vocational rehabilitation needs the next step is to develop written document that sets forth the individuals employment goals under the 1998 law each individual eligible for vr services must have an ipe during the reauthorization process some observers asserted that the planning process used by state vr counselors on behalf of clients was too cumbersome and unnecessary for all consumers and involved expenditure of vr counselors time that could otherwise be spent on other responsibilities in addition there was ongoing concern about expanding client involvement in the rehabilitation process observers indicated that some consumers may need only limited assistance not longtermhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31298crs5 9joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on hr 1385 congressional record july 29 1998 p h6693 10prior law referred to persons with severe disabilities pl 105220 changed this to refer to persons with significant disabilities throughout the lawintensive planning and intervention and can identify what services they want without going through an extensive planning process with vr counselors pl 105220 responded to these concerns by requiring that consumers be more involved in their vr planning process and that they have more choice in the development of their ipes specifically the law required that eligible individuals exercise informed choice in selecting an employment outcome services that they will receive service providers and methods to procure services the law also required that the state vr agency provide consumers with options for developing the ipe including information on the availability of assistance from vr counselor in developing all or part of the ipe but it allowed consumers to determine the extent of vr counselor assistance the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on hr 1385 stated that the conferees expect that these changes will fundamentally change the role of the clientcounselor relationship and that in many cases counselors will serve more as facilitators of plan development9 pl 105220 added certain other new provisions related to the ipe it required that the ipe provide for timelines in achievement of employment outcomes and required it to be amended as necessary by the consumer in collaboration with the counselor when there are substantive changes in goals services or providers it also required that the ipe identify the need for extended services by persons with the most significant10 disabilities who are in supported employment the law retained many requirements related to the ipe that were required by the prior law for example it retained requirement that the plan be written the law continued to require that the plan identify consumers employment goalsoutcomes consistent with hisher unique strengths resources priorities concerns abilities and capabilities and informed choice services to be provided providers and methods to procure providers and rights and remedies available to the consumer among other things information and referral services for persons not served under states order of selection criteria under the law states that cannot serve all individuals who are eligible for services must establish an order of selection process order of selection refers to process whereby state establishes criteria to serve first those eligible individuals with the most significant disabilities each state sets up its order of selection criteria in accordance with certain federal regulatory requirements under prior law persons who did not meet states criteria may not receive any vocational rehabilitation services pl 105220 directed states to provide at least minimum level of services to persons who otherwise would not be served because they are too far down on the state list for order of selection that is while it retained requirement for order of selection the law specified what assistance persons not served under order ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31298crs6 11joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on hr 1385 congressional record july 29 1998 p h6692 12among other things these included requirements that the rehabilitation counselor and the consumer jointly develop agree upon and sign hisher individualized employment plan and that it be developed in accordance with consumers unique strengths resources priorities concerns abilities and capabilitiesselection criteria will receive from the state vr agency for such persons states are required to implement an information and referral system the system is required to provide information and guidance to assist these individuals in preparing for securing retaining or regaining employment in addition states are required to refer these individuals to other federal and state programs including components of the statewide workforce investment system established by pl 105220 best suited to meet their needs among other things the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference indicated that individuals with disabilities who do not meet the vr agencys order of selection criteria are also to be served by the statewide workforce investment system it stated as follows the conferees intend to alleviate the backlog of eligible individuals who do not receive services from the state vocational rehabilitation program because they do not meet the states order of selection criteria many of these individuals do not receive services from the state workforce system and are inappropriately referred back to the state vocational rehabilitation program because they have disability the conferees expect that through the changes made throughout the conference agreement in integrating the state workforce system states will serve individuals with disabilities throughout the entire state workforce system not only through the state vocational rehabilitation program11 consumer choice enhancement of consumer choice is an important goal in providing vr services during the reauthorization process advocates asserted that the more freedom client has to choose his or her own options for employment and training and to participate in development of vocational goals the better the chances of positive employment outcome the issues surrounding expanded consumer choice were addressed by number of 1992 amendments to the act12 pl 105220 expanded on the 1992 amendments to place more emphasis on consumer choice first as discussed above the law required state vr agencies to give consumers more responsibility for the development of their vr plans in addition it required that the state vr agency develop and implement written policies and procedures on informed choice these policies and procedures must address ways to inform each applicant and eligible individual about opportunities available to exercise informed choice policies must also address consumers decisions on assessment

dewine indicated that while the vr program is to be linked to the workforce investment system funds appropriated for the vr program are not to be compromised or diverted to other workforce populations 14joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on hr 1385 congressional record july 29 1998 p h6692statewide workforce investment system created by wia specifically the law included as one of the purposes of the rehabilitation act to assist states in operating statewide programs of vocational rehabilitation which are integral parts of statewide workforce investment systems in addition the legislation required the state vr agency to enter into cooperative agreements with other entities that are components of the statewide workforce investment system cooperative agreements may provide for use of customer service features such as common intake and referral procedures customer data bases resource information and human service hotlines staff training aimed at promoting participation by persons with disabilities in workforce investment use of information and financial management systems that link all components to other electronic networks and other cooperative networks that facilitate job placement13 interagency agreements and responsibility for payment for vr services pl 105220 required the governor to ensure that interagency agreements are in effect between the state vr agency and other public agencies including the state medicaid program and public institutions of higher education the purpose of these agreements is to assure that services under an ipe will be provided to individuals with disabilities to clarify financial responsibility of public agencies to provide these services and to specify the conditions terms and procedures under which the vr agency will be reimbursed by other public agencies for vr services among other things the law also stipulated that if other agencies are obligated to pay for vr services and fail to do so vr agencies may claim reimbursement from such agencies however the joint explanatory statement also referred to the responsi bilities of public institutions of higher education under provisions of the americans with disabilities act as follows the conferees recognize that colleges and universities already have responsibility to provide certain services under the americans with disabilities act ada the conferees encourage state vocational rehabilitation agencies and public institutions of higher education in developing interagency agreements to consider the requirements of the ada and other laws as well as agreements that may currently be in place14 the statement also cautioned that state vr agencies are not to interpret the interagency agreement provisions as shifting the obligation for paying for specific vr services to colleges and universities pl 105220 also addressed interagency agreements with state public school systems state vr agencies are required to develop plans and policies that provide for the transition of students with disabilities from public schools to vocationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31298crs8 15joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference

agencies regarding transition planning for students with disabilities procedures for determining state lead agencies responsible for transition services and procedures for outreach to students with disabilities who may need transition to vr services the joint explanatory statement stipulated that state vr agencies are not to interpret these new interagency agreement provisions with state educational agencies to mean that payment for specific transition services will be shifted to state educational agencies the statement indicated that state vr agencies are still responsible for paying for transition services15 reporting on program outcomes pl 105220 added several new state reporting requirements these included reporting data on the number of persons who do not have significant disabilities and who receive information and referral services as described above also the state is required to report on the number of persons who after vr participation were employed 6 months and 12 months after securing or regaining employment rsa regulations issued before passage of pl 105220 defined vr case closed successfully if the person is employed for 90 days after termination of vr services regulations issued since passage of the law essentially retain the same requirement but refer to employment outcome maintained16 therefore under the prior law there was need to follow person for longer period for reporting purposes other outcome data to be collected include reasons for an individuals termination of vr services without achieving an employment objective earnings at the time of application and termination of vr services and information necessary to determine the success of the state in meeting state performance measures established under the workforce investment act of 1998 as well as standards and indicators for evaluating the vr program established by the commissioner of rsa other selected provisions other provisions of pl 105220 eliminated number of state plan
