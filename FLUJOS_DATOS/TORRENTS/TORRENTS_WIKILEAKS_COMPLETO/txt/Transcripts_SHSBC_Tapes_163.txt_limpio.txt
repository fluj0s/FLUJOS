meter data instant reads part ii shsbc 149 renumbered 163 lecture given on 24 may 1962 based on the modern level zero cassettes it was not not included in the older preclearsound cassettes and has not been checked against older versions thank you 24 may saint hill special briefing course ad 12 all right now you seem to be considerably interested in what meters do and you seem to be having an awful lot of trouble one way or the other i was going to talk to you about goals assessments in this particular lecture but i wont i will talk to you definitely about meters you know you can get into more holes full of complication than anybody could easily dig you out of in long while you get complicated and if you just would stop figuring and start looking i remember when one time got motorcycle off the boat and i was straightening the motorcycle up and trying to get the thing to function out in camden new jersey i was trying to get this motorcycle going so lights wouldnt light you know and so we kept throwing switch and so forth and it was just at that time this first cliche first time i had put out this cliche and so on it was look dont think see which was very funny and this little francisbarnett british motorcycle had very complicated lucas light system headlamp and everything else and it was very complicated very hard to get apart all kinds of wires and condensers and all sorts of things so i started taking it apart and took the bulb out and took the wires apart and unhooked everything we had parts that were lying around good square yard and then i happened to look down at the battery and the terminals werent connected we had all the job of putting it all together again it would have taken about one minute to have put the terminals on the battery that was marvelous example of lookdont think because id sure done lot of figuring right there on that motorcycle you see and the net result was dismantling the works you get doing this and you get to figuring out what this is and the significance of that and the complications of something else and so on and i know what youre up against because theres textbook called duttons which teaches navigation and it is the textbook used by the united states naval academy at annapolis its their key book on the subject and doubt about it its marvelous textbook there is doubt whatsoever that duttons is just absolutely wonderful as textbook not single datum of any kind on the subject of navigation that is not to be found in duttons they modernize it also every year its marvelous you open it up and sentence by sentence they machinegun you with exact pertinent data with amplification or further definition of any kind whatsoever they dont bother to tell you its textbook on navigation of ships from here to there they simply start in telling you this is the earth and the sun and the planets and the alidadeamplitude angle dihedral in betwixt barograph is an instrument used to measure barometric pressure it is read at two oclock four oclock and eight oclock i dont know what do you read you read its directions what do you read you read the manufacturers label on the bottom of it what do you do well duttons never bothers to inform you about that theyre above all that you see unfortunately i collided on restudy of earth navigation i collided with duttons back in the middle thirties hard you see there was everything there but an understanding see there was understanding of what this was all about whatsoever but there sure were hot data man every datum in it was hot but there was never any side amplification such as you must always precisely locate the exact position of battleship see see it never says also that it is sometimes disastrous not to locate the position of battleship your imagination is never invited it is dry feast of bare bones it drove stark staring mad i never learned how to navigate from it finally got book that i think mixters primer of navigation or something like this and read this book and it didnt treat it very seriously and it was very happy about the whole thing and i dug up few data from that actually though i thought it would be easier to go back and evolve the whole thing so i did some time in 44 an admiral was walking around on the bridge and i was calculating something or other and he says well i see he says that you how is this hed just flown in you know from stateside he wouldnt be there long because it wasnt very safe where we were and he said i see he said but but how is this youre using commander weems new textbook on aerial navigation and it puzzled him because it was just now in print in the states and we couldnt possibly have connected that fast i had accidentally evolved it as simple method of navigation and somebody else had evolved it that was all but it didnt come from duttons but i imagine its now part of duttons and i imagine nobody can savvy it now i mean i imagine thats totally totally lost but this is method of losing information is you just give bunch of machinegun data and expect everybody to hew the mark on that exact data and its never amplified you see so we have lots of examples of that particular character it is the importance of datum that must be weighted weighted you weight the importance of datum and you are so accustomed on this planet you are terribly accustomed to studying unweighted data somebody opens up krishnamurti and he shows you three places in this book of krishnamurtis whereby its exactly parallel to exactly what we say in scientology so therefore krishnamurti is scientology and poor old peggy conway i showed her one day that these were totally unweighted data they had importance assigned to them whatsoever but were there with equal importance with about three or four thousand other datum these other data were all there of equal importance and they were some of them were really wild data see so they were all equally important in other words there was selection of importances and people keep forgetting this they think all data are equal and its as big mistake as to consider all people are equal or anything else is all equal because its pretty hard to get an equality mathematically its impossible to get an equality you take an apple out here off tree and if you had another apple which is exactly the same size shape age skin thickness pattern of the skin everything else youd say well that apple is equal to that apple theyre not equal theyre not occupying the same space how could they be equal all the characteristics of one apple would have to be equal to all the characteristics of the other apple and theyre both occupying different positions in space so they cant possibly be equal now in order to study ive heard this phrase learn how to study ive had it thrown at in very fine universities very fine schools and so on learn how to study they say and then they sit back we should remember this that there are several ways of laying out data one is to lay it all out with equal weight with amplification other explanation nothing to assist understanding we just machinegun out whole bunch of data brrrr see thats supposed to be real good your technicalscientific writer of today is educated to do this and sometimes criticizes the writings of dianetics and scientology because it doesnt do only this all right now theres another way of handling this stuff and that is to throw it all out with tremendous obfuscations you sort of interlard it with of course you boob you couldnt understand this anyway because its all so complicated and they do that in various ways with footnotes refer to jervis crack page 39 you see of course that book hasnt been available for the last century so youve had it you see well what theyre doing is doing priesthood type of action and most of the professors writing in modern university and so on are guilty of that theyre trying to create priesthood now the reason navigation sprung to mind and the reason i talk about navigation is theyre exclusively devoted not this dutton its of another kind but the navigator himself is devoted to the development of priesthood it is not for nothing that the early navigators of the south pacific were priesthood and they were the reigning priesthood of polynesia well those birds with hole in coconut shell and that sort of thing navigated themselves all over the place quite interesting how they did it but it was priesthood and they surround this with bunch of magic and they surround it with bunch of nonsense of one kind or another well chemistry professor is just as guilty he gives you whole bunch of nonsense but the reason navigator springs to mind if you were to go on bridge of naval vessel that had navigator and to ask him how he was finding his position he wont have you shot because thats illegal instead of that he will either ignore you with contemptuous sniff or utterly overwhelm you with bunch of irrelevant bunk that man is totally dedicated to the protection of cult navigation is what makes him important and if every fool knew how to navigate he wouldnt be important anymore and thatd be that the textbook bowditch on this subject im choosing an esoteric field navigation not that youre interested at all in navigation but just because its far enough afield that it wont confuse the issue bowditch was fellow up in the new england states who decided that celestial navigation should be decelestialized so he did bunch of tables and things of this character and he went out on china trip and out of his little manual which was about quarter of an inch thick he taught even the cook to navigate by star sights it was marvelous he taught everybody on the ship he was teaching everybody up and down the new england coast how to navigate out of this little tiny book you should see that book today hahaha its also published by the united states navy and it is that thick its that high and its that broad its the most marvelous thing for keeping passageway door open you ever saw but it has everything in it that has nothing to do with navigation and it has tables developed which nobody has used for ages and his original tables i dont think are even in it anymore and yet its called bowditch see the whole thing has been obfuscated whole thing has been masked that is the way somebody swells up his importance he makes himself very important hes one of the twelve men in the world that can understand einstein oh i dont know if there was anything there to understand i think that more than twelve men could have understood einstein i took one of the twelve men in the world who could understand einstein and i went around to him to have him explain it to as the associate editor of the college paper in short article i was making friends in those days i wanted him to give short article for this college paper so that i could explain einstein to the student body he was very insulted he was very upset but his i wrote an article but years afterwards i was talking to friend and he was pretty good scientist he was good enough to be kicked out of the government he was one of the sixtyfour that were released for doing their duty and he said theory of relativity well lets see mass equals mc 2 well lets see if we cant do i wonder if it couldnt be explained rather simply and so we boiled it down and told it to kid and he understood it perfectly there wasnt much to this except what the vast importance of the person see somebody is using this as cloak of rare bird feathers you see so he can stand before the idol and tell everybody how important he is see well these methods of communication of thought methods of communication of data now were in an interestingly peculiar field because the data that is being communicated is in actual fact totally new data that everybody already has that makes it very peculiar data indeed now theres language that embraces this because language comes after the fact before the fact rather of the data and so you get few terms mixed up in it its nothing compared to medical terms or other fields nevertheless it has the frailty of having new terms but you have to have new terms otherwise everything you described would be whole package i could probably dream up an example and say well the combined impulses derived from force and duress in the past which have become forgotten but which are capable of impinging themselves upon the individual wouldnt you like to say that every time you said reactive mind that would be pretty grim wouldnt it so naturally you get conversant with this you start developing bit of shorthand but the shorthand mustnt itself be terribly obscure and most of our stuff is not obscure we dont invent words where we dont need them but we do invent words where we shouldnt be confused now we lack complete dictionary that we should have theres doubt about that so that you could look up any phrase and understand it better weve been in the throes of making up dictionary for years i had the notes on my desk recently just few days ago to start recompiling the thing trouble is its costly thats the only thing thats wrong with dictionary youd have to put two or three people on it for several months to really knock dictionary together because youd have to listen to every tape on which every word had ever been defined at any time and put all the definitions down for single word immediately following it and then that would be worthwhile dictionary would also he quite worthwhile textbook but it happens to be labor its mostly labor listening to tapes taking down every definition looking up all the textbooks taking down every definition you know writing each word on piece of paper and then writing each definition that has ever been defined for it because theyve been defined several times well we that is barrier there is doubt about that but what 1 try to do the way i try to teach you this is teach you one very simply and try to give you the weight of the datum you know how heavily this is weighted in comparison to other data see i tell you this one is important see and then because there are quite few important datum i very often make the mistake of not saying to you that theres lot of data along this line thats not important see that dont amount to anything theyre merely interesting well i tell you that even that too occasionally thats an awful lot of bricabrac and phenomena well what happens is that i give you datum thats important and you very often pick up piece of bricabrac thats right next door to it that is interesting see and you get the two things confused you know this other one is fascinating theres doubt about it you start fooling around with things in the mind and there are fascinating things the floor of the ead is strewn with them man i dont know how you can live in there see there are many fascinating data they are terribly terribly interesting why if i sat down and wrote everything i knew about needle phenomena or phenomena which could be disclosed by meter my god itd be something on the order of four or five million words i know tremendous lot of oddities fantastic things that you can do all of which amount to hill of beans theyre just of importance at all amongst all of that there are only few important data and they are boiled down into that savagely condensed book emeter essentials now that is an example by the way of terrific boildown the instant read however is not described in that book it is now described in the second edition but in the original edition its not described now obviously it should also be part of my responsibility to tell you whats not important but look but look thats four or five million words see compared to few hundred that would be job man and you want to know about teaching you some of this stuff what is utterly staggeringly fantastic you see is trying to guess what youre going to do wrong next and i tell you man that would keep somebody awake all night if he really worried you know i worry about it enough but trying to guess which way the mistake is going to go because you see it can go into any of those unimportant channels see and theyre just infinite in number now right now youre riding the hobbyhorse of the interim read the prior and interim read because the word latent read is forbidden you see i mean the subject of latent reads were not interested in ive omitted saying that theres such thing as prior read see well it is also forbidden see prior read is as bad as latent read you only want an instant read but what is an instant read it is that read which takes place immediately after the expressed thought now if you sum that up as definition you will see that it precludes that it is thoughts that impinge not words on the reactive mind its thought not words you may express them in words but they impinge in thought the reactive mind doesnt actually react to words the words translate through symbolism into thought you see you got the symbols of the words and then that melts down into thought the reactive mind responds to the thought impulse so you can have lot of thought impulses in one thought have you seen any gorgeous goodlooking luscious marvelous sensational women lately how many reads would you get man thats up to you and the gods now because you are thinking the thought and if you read this as straight thought through the reactive bank at first only at first will impinge on every thought contained in the major thought so you get whole bunch of prior reads and then it finally grooves in that this is what youre talking about see the major thought is have you seen any women lately see have you seen any gorgeous beautiful luscious you know women lately thats the big thought and itll register as have you seen any beautiful women lately as well as you and seen and gorgeous and get the idea well the funny part of it is is you can groove in the major thought or the minor thought have you seen see youre going to get reactions by this time thats sort of punctuated reading of something youre going to get action action action action and then action on the thought well you saw an example in the demonstration i gave you last night of prior read and i threw it away and asked the pc again because i couldnt tell if it was read or not read i just threw it away i didnt pay any attention to it it was the one time in the session when that occurred that something fell on the middle of the last word obviously invalid but it showed that it might have been instant it all depended so i just checked it again but that only happened in whole hour of session only happened once see how rare that was now you got the packaged thought now if you repeat that thought through to the pc you have restimulated the thought majeure see not the thought mineure the thought majeure we could have lot of fun if we were really fishend tails white tie you know type of subject treatment you know on the subject of dianetics and scientology you know and you would be learning about the thought majeure you see and the thought mineure oh yeah we could be fancy dont let kid you actually the trick of communicating the whole subject of the human mind with as few words new words as we use is quite trick that is actually one of the big things that we got you know we dont have to go four years to study latin so that we can abuse it the thought you seen any beautiful women lately is inherent in your statement and so most of the time you simply read it and you almost always will get reaction by the way and so on whatever it is all of your interim spots may get reaction but youre only interested in the reaction which occurs with the last word the end of the last word its not after you stop speaking its when the whole thought is completed therefore youd never use more than one clause but you can even get away with using several clauses and still get reaction lot of phrases and clauses and so forth but it may take you two three or four reads to ring it in that is one of the reasons you read goal three times it might fall interimly might fall randomly but you want to get the thought expressed the thought has got to be expressed through to the pc so you could never read it really successfully less than three times aloud to get the whole thought thats all the whole thought delivers through most of the time oddly enough the whole thought does deliver through and react but just that once in the hours session you see well we got some other interim reads but only one interim read came so close to the end that fellow could have made mistake indistinguishably close halfway through the last word well now the point is this is the pcs thinkingness isnt turning on the read its the pcs reactingness which is reading so theres understandingness of any kind consulted on an emeter read it is all stimulusresponse there is understanding of any kind its as though the reactive bank can listen and react oddly enough it can it is the auditor to the reactive bank not the auditor to the analytical mind to the reactive bank that always gives you latent read you got an instantaneous proposition here doesnt matter how mysterious it is or isnt its just youve just got an instantaneous proposition its you read the thought and it reacts in the reactive mind and honest the pc can be doped off ninetenths unconscious goofed off everything else and it will still read ive seen pc sitting there practically snoring and everything reading i made several tests on this i was flabbergasted you could have said to him women women women you got react react react see just this nice pang pang pang three instant reads nice strong ones and you could have said what did i say and hed say snort what whats this what i dont know what did you say he didnt know either see how crazy that is until you actually explore that it still looks to you as though you say something the pc analytically hears you and then reacts to what you said and it is not that cycle at all that is not the cycle which takes place i dont care to elucidate even what cycle takes place rather than invent knowledge but that cycle does rat take place see i can tell you which one doesnt take place you say it and he reacts what reacts reactive mind and thats got to contain timelessness and notknowingness in order to get reaction if you dont have timelessness and notknowingness you dont get reaction on the meter its as simple as that if he thinks of something in order to get reaction you always get latent read you dont get an instant read oh you want black magic there it is the reactive mind of most people is black enough look at the gpm sometime but of course you have all of your latent reactive thinkingnesses of former identities are stacked up there like genghis khans pyramid of skulls theres plenty of them and all of that combined thinkingness and reactingness and so forth has amounted to gpm so itd be wonderful and marvelous that it didnt respond but remember it it i said it not the pc actually this is technically incorrect how did the pc respond on the meter the pc never responded on the meter it did it did and when it responded it did it instantaneously exactly peculiarly at the end of the thought majeure ill hang you with one just so you can feel upstage so if youre at some party sometime where theres nothing but professors you could say well we mostly deal in the thought majeure but there is this weirdity now frankly you think sound travels at eleven hundred feet per second and so forth and such and undoubtedly there are lags developed in here because of sound and so forth but remember i dont know that see this is to some degree an invented piece of knowledge and we could calculate it out and say that the auditors length of time to pour out to the end plus the length of time of his voice impulse to the pcs ears plus the length of time to the reactive bank plus the time consumed in restimulating the electrical responses of the reactive mind plus the lag of the emeter would be how long it took for the read to read instantly now i dont know maybe we could sit on one mountain top and have an emeter lead from mont blanc over to mt punk or something of the sort and we yodeldeehoo you see across and ask some restimulative question and see how long it takes and measure the electrical current and measure the amount of time in the air and maybe we could do lot of things like this and maybe we could learn great deal and im sure if some professor liked to mountain climb he would spend the rest of his life establishing that fact however were more interested in the subject majeure rather than the subject mineure anyway so the main thing were interested in is the thing reacts instantly and it reacts instantly at the end of the thought and of course it will react to interim thoughts you say have you you swine damaged any pigs lately in this session see well now youre throwing yourself curve if you add in this session because its clause after the thought the modifying clause coming after the thought fumbles the whole thing up so you should say in this session and then you should drop the interjection you swine and you say in this session have you damaged any pigs now this is the liability of reading meter supposing the pc has an item called pigs now youll get into one of the worlds most marvelous tangles because its reacting on the word pigs and you dont know whether its acting on the thought majeure or the thought mineure you dont know which is which and thats the only time you can really get tangled up say the pcs goal to catch catfish and youre trying to test out the way to list it now want to catch catfish you know who or what would not want to catch catfish who or what would not oppose catching catfish who or what would oppose catching catfish will all react on an instant read just like the goal wont they isnt that horrible thats very confusing because then you cant tell which is the right phrasing to line up on unless you read them two or three times to groove it home at which time oddly enough the goal will longer react as the goal but will only react as thought majeure and thats little test that you ought to make just to convince yourself show yourself what it is take some highly restimulative interimlyworded sentence i dont care what it is that as major thought adds up to whole that you know would be hot on the pc hes got some old item thats still in see some kind like this put that on the end and then you will see after you have read it about three times that it only acts on the thought majeure and will not act on that item but the item will act separately you can take the item out of the sentence even though it occurs to the end of the sentence you can take it out of its just marvelous you know and you can set it out there all by itself and you say pigs pigs first time it doesnt react its cautious see pig now you say pigs pigs pigs pigs after that pigs pigs pigs pigs pigs you put it back in the thought majeure in this session have you injured any pigs read this is mysterious man of course it might read the first time as just an additional pig but then groove it in again groove it in again in this session have you injured any pigs it wont react mysterious now the mysteriousness of it is is below the unknowingness there is terrific power of retention in the reactive bank it is another one of its characteristics it has fantastic continuity fantastic survival otherwise it wouldnt be here and what is put into it then acquires this characteristic of fantastic survival so you have time notknowingness and survival so what you pour into it will continue to react the delicacy of its operation is another astounding thing if the goal is to injure pigs thats the actual goal and the wording which you have on the list is to injure pig at first to injure pig will react and will then cease to react and will react and itll splutter and monkey around and you wont quite know what youre doing on the thing and all of sudden the pc you can never change it for the pc the pc is liable to say oh well thats that thats to injure pigs pang its marvelous precision this is an old study in dianetics is the fantastic precision with which this thing will do it to injure pigs thats fine itll react from there on out see but to injure pig sporadic not in dont also think that total retention is total wisdom it isnt so you get this kind of circumstance where if youre tiny bit offbeat you wont get the reaction now oddly enough you can get generalized thought which is close enough in to get the reaction and thats where you get your what questions from thats why you actually ought to fish for your what question what about wrecking cars what about stealing and wrecking cars the pc unfortunately used the word swiping cars and youre trying to get on stealing cars and my god you never get what question last night we had word if id used any other word than that exact what question if i hadnt used the word conned it wouldnt have reacted the pc said it so that must be at the base of the chain of the overt your clue must be taken from the pc now you can play ducks and drakes with this thing you can throw it all over the place and so forth as long as central pin stays there to hook in and identify you got to have something that will identify you got to have thought that associates and so on well youre doing an interesting thing youre taking the whole of an overt act which was all in terms of action anyhow and youre putting it in terms of english which it might not even have occurred in and that thought embraces the action which took place which was the overt oh my god nobody would be able to build machine that did it that would be utterly incredible and yet the reactive mind can do that much of stretch but what about stealing lot of cars what about stealing cars what about stealing and wrecking cars bang on another instance the pc said well i swiped scooter and you say to him what about stealing childrens toys you know bbc you know type of response nothing happens see you have to sound out your what question now you can alter it this far what about swiping toys thatll be dead on thats okay but you altered the doingness you see and the thought of the doingness shifted you have to keep that pretty well the same dont you see and you have to have at least some associated object to make this thing react but it will react every time the odd part of it is why does it react after toys why does it go toys see toys click why its the total thought all i can tell you is it does and if you have question which reads what tick about dirty needle stealing tick toys fall you ignore everything but the fall you dont do another blessed thing with prior read you just skip the lot if it doesnt fall at the instant you said s see toys toys fall if it falls at t fall its not an instant read dont tell why the reactive mind does this i couldnt care less just take it from that it does then it cleans up and everything squares up and the pc feels better and it falls apart its almost as if its drawn itself complete plan of how you take apart most fantastic thing all you had to know about the whole thing from beginning to end was exactly you had to be able to look and observe interim reads are so common that if you tried to pay any attention to an interim read on have you tried to damage in this session have you tried to damage anyone suppose youre asking such question and it fell on damage you knucklehead the worst you could do you saw do it one time on an earlier session i wrote damage over in the margin i knew it would be hot prepcheck question but ignored it for that because it didnt fall on anyone see its just curve of the and then the action see in this session have you tried to damage anyone uhp there it goes right on that see not earlier not later but right on marvelous why it works this way god knows you know i think even people with the bigthetan theory would would doubt would doubt it its too incredible but that is the fact and youll find out this pans out every time you find out if you clean off that instant read at the end of the thought major youll be all set and if you start monkeying around with the interim reads of the thought minors you are going to fall on your ead every time now you very often will get into severe trouble putting together goals to go out and pick potatoes and sometimes have girl in the potato patch man and it falls on to go out and it falls on and pick potatoes and to have girl and it falls on potato patch and theres instant read after patch after youve said it three times there is instant read after patch well id say it has something to do with the goal probably in some version or form or another as it will eventually arise and id get all the invalidations and the missed withholds and suppressions off of listing thats another one i should take up with you ill take it up with you right now when i say listing i dont mean items when i say take it off the subject of listing i dont mean take it off the items of listing when i say listing i just mean listing you say is there any missed withhold on listing see have you suppressed listing have you invalidated listing have you ever committed an overt with listing thats the way you phrase it see thats listing listing it is subject you could even say goals listing and when i tell you items or individual items why then i mean goal or an item or straight line is there any item on this list which has been invalidated thank you is there any item on this list on which there is missed withhold too complicated phraseology you cant get across the thought majeure easily so you say is there any item on this list which has been invalidated say it the second time and you get your click marvelous to behold youll get your click and you clean that click off there is the subject of listing and then theres the subject of goals theres the subject of items in general all of these things are different things that you can do things with you understand now in this rundown of the goal if you dont get your instant read on the end of the goal by the third time youve read it it aint it and you certainly better ignore it but very possibly not positively at all but very possibly potatoes have something to do with this goal or maybe its girls have something to do with the goal of course we cant guess now ive even gone so far experimentally as to try to pick out all of the various words that have reacted and put goal together for the pc doesnt work evaluates for the pc and throws the whole thing into that the pc will give it to you eventually you get all the withholds off the subject of listing all the withholds off the subject of auditing all the withholds off the subject of items goals that sort of thing any overts that might have occurred in this direction just explore around get them all over and all of sudden you say well are there any more goals oh yap yap yap yap and yap yap yap and yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap to lay girls in the open all right youre nulling on down there was your potato patch see only this one will go open bang open bang open hang you see your read instant read instant read instant read every time it does not matter how many reads you get that are prior to the instant read you ignore them please believe you just ignore them it does not matter how many reads you get after the instant read ignore them but you must put across your thought majeure to the pc and if you got the thing all participially occluded why prepare to stand there for several reads before itll finally embrace but oddly enough matter how complicated it is i dont know i think you could probably get fall on uncle tom s cabin where it says the end you get your instant read you know but you would have had to have read it to the reactive mind fifty or sixty times and i dont think anybody could stand that so that stable datum get used to that stable datum live with it and you wont have any trouble on the thing and god almighty never ignore one teowuwtsw never ignore one on the subject of rudiments middle rudiments something like that little while ago when i was talking to you about that goal did you get an arc break and it goes zumphzzm arc break goal zzzmzzzumph you know little while ago when i was talking to you about that goal did you get an arc break now youll notice theres less randomness in it little while ago when i was talking to you about that goal did you get an arc break clank you put the thought majeure across and it now is impinged and it will react but why did it take so long thats because its so complicated you would have gotten your instant read like this in this session have you had an arc break clank see simple fast complicated takes you while complicated thought majeure takes lot of pounding before it is finally embraced and will give you an instant read now you say in this session have you told halftruth untruth see that package question possibly leads you astray because there you are using packaged bunch of instant reads actually youre shorthanding in this session have you told halftruth in this session have you told an untruth in this session have you tried to impress in this session have you tried to damage anyone see oddly enough you could package the whole thing together and use the interim reads oddly enough only that one will go down particularly after the third or fourth or fifth session with the pc because the reactive bank is now grooved into that thought majeure theyre very obliging pc who is under control really responds this is all rather incredible why does the reactive mind react why does the emeter work well i wont be so stupid as to try to force on you the same orders that the six hundred had at balaklava which is some sort of musical instrument they didnt play well theres this type of think about this i could say to you the instructors could say everybody could say to you now look when it gets an instant read read it now you dont have to understand it just when it gets an instant read read it that way that thats it see and you say yeah but why does it read that way see and so forth youve got perfect right to ask that question see got perfect right why does it only give an instant read and why can you groove in thought majeure and why does it sometimes read on the thought mineure see why why why why why like little arthur says see youve got perfect right to say that and i got perfect right to tell you i dont know it just does this is whole set of fortuitous accidents based on direct lookingness and on figureness theres very little think involved with this thing you see the emeter itself i think was decca voltmeter which guy held both sides of and it reacted in its most primitive state i think it was richard saunders at elizabeth new jersey was monkeying around with this he wanted to show doctors that there was response and he knew they would look at meters so he pinched the living daylights out of pc you know made him black and blue you know while they were holding on to this thing and then told him to recall it and got the same response on the meter well fortunately today were not dealing with that level of insensitivity on the subject of meters because think of how youd look at the end of session but this was picked up one way or the other or independently gone at by mathison i gave lecture described what kind of an instrument we really had to have mathison went home and he breadboarded one up it functioned remarkably well for its original state it was very limited pcs went off the top of it and went off the bottom of it with the greatest of ease i think they possibly still do on mathisons but anyway time went on and around washington why i eventually thought it would be good thing to have this one and don breeding and the rest of the boys got scratching their head over this thing and old joe wallace and so on and they kept hanging things together and then theyd do perfect one you know and then theyd scrap it because they could do one that you know behaved electronically better you know and id take pistol out of my desk and hold it on them and make them build the first plan and then theyd put fifty on the line or twentyfive on the line or something like that and come back and tell that if they just eliminated the ruddy rod and put couple of condensers there that itd work much better and id say you dont you build the original one see and they built some of these other ones and they responded perfectly electronically but they did not respond mentally this meter responds mentally anybody alters that meter its practically over our dead body because its just empirically worked out its marvelous that it works at all but do you know people give you explanations for the working and for the circuit and for this and that about this thing theyre talking in their hats theyre talking through their hats they can give you all of the stuff and so forth but that stuff all got assembled in there on the basis of just breadboarding something now weve developed theories as to how this thing works now weve developed all kinds of things theres magnetic thing in here that swings that were dependent on james watt edison all the modern electronics guys transistors everybody else on all of their knowhow but this hung together makes an emeter why i dont know weve got doctors meter costs several times what one of these things cost reg got one we played around with that thing it doesnt work we dont know what it does but it does something else the needle goes by so fast you cant even see it go weve learned exactly nothing from it which i think is marvelous except this one fact you all knew that thats doctors are frauds but we have an example of this theyve tried to copy our emeter and they just havent gone anywhere with it they couldnt tell anything with this thing its marvelous and we got it and im glad to have it its not wasted instrument there is the peak of medical electronics now why does it work why does the reactive mind do this what you figuring for for gods sakes the thing is laid out on red carpet this is how it works this is how it reacts and this is how you use it oddly enough its invariable utterly invariable now one of these days youre going to get clear youre going to get very bright youre going to figure out exactly why an emeter responds this way exactly what wavelengths the thetan operates on in order to put reactivity together exactly how many condensers fit together amongst the ruddy rods you understand and how you can all do it on thought transference and set up an emeter on table and read president coolidges reasons why he wouldnt run you see read through time yes by all means get in that shape yes by all means get that design when you do write letter ill publish it theres more phenomena around this subject not just this meter than you could easily count up on an ibm comptometer and theres an awful lot of particles in one of those now where do we got the figure wheres the think regs engineer who is sharp apple you see him around here once in while he has hard time with this man it violates all of his principles of electricity and the body and everything else this thing is ghost instrument he concluded the other day that well theres nothing else to register there but thinkingness or what did it or how did it or something it wasnt that he was baffled that this reacted against the mind because thats rather common hes baffled about other things he always thought it worked on the amount of sweat and then he suddenly realized that you cant sweat and unsweat that fast so there must be something else involved here and lot of things but you walk up to most guys and theyll tell you its sweat measures sweat all right good measures sweat i dont know what thats got to do with it either it doesnt measure sweat it measures think but theres lot of boys can put these meters together that dont measure think oddly enough you can put the commonest type of wheatstone bridge together and give it damping and the thing oddly enough will register even think so theres nothing very mysterious about it the mind is hung together electronically its hung together with electricity there are standing waves standing masses in it which are timeless these things are drifting along in present time and it obeys all of your electrical laws and impulses but remember something the human being is the author of this universe and hes also the author of all the electronics in this universe actually there are flows and currents in the human mind that have not yet been discovered in electronics see that junior subject can now study senior subject is of course weird joke but it can which is quite peculiar now youre not interested in why an emeter reads really unless you want to do some research in that particular line beyond this one thing thetan is an electric eel and it measures electric currents thats about as close as i care to come to it myself i never speculate on this but you talk about oddball offbeat data on the subject of the emeter why does the meter go tickitytick back and forth with an exact pattern every time when person wants to leave or go away or blow out of his head or so forth the theta bop the study of the theta bop could be very long and very involved i can tell you numerous ways to produce theta bop lots of ways did you ever think of leaving anybody you get theta bop you see did you ever think of dying you get theta bop try not to be three feet in back of your head you get theta bop shoot him with 45 youll get theta bop i mean its an interesting thing well we get the coordinative action then and one of the ways that you could deduce or surmise that people could exteriorize and what exteriorization was and how people leave their bodies at the time of death and that sort of thing can be traced with theta bop what do you want to trace it for why dont you just learn how to get out of your head and see how it is and get back in again see you dont have to figure these things out because youre on the main road anyhow you dont have to go at it with bunch of logics and substitutes because its there to look at so you can go around picking up pebbles all over the road you can get them in your shoes you can fall in the ditch you can run into milestones and culverts and bridge abutments and the neighbors fence you can do all of these things but let call to your attention that there is main highway and you can go down it at 110 miles an hour and its the instant read prior reads dont count latent reads dont count just instant reads thats all and the instant read will abide by the major thought that youre putting across to the pc and oddly enough will occur exactly as though somebody over there had been informed when you were going to stop talking probably the ogpu or the nkvd i dont know they have an intelligence service involved you can be very mysterious about the whole thing but the funny part of it is it becomes terribly simple and when you look at it in that way when you clean up everything in this way emetering becomes very odd now if youre so involved in prior reads and so involved in latent reads and so involved in why it reads and if you also have number of invalidations of the meter and also suspect that it doesnt work because it hasnt worked on you you see one day it didnt read when you knew it should have read why naturally youre going to have hell of time with meter so break it down to that simplicity look at the only important read that is on the machine and youve got it the only other thing i can tell you about read is when it goes more than one simple read it is dirty needle and is measuring somewhere on the track missed withhold all the goals and items that you want have single tick the only reaction you will get on proven goal item single tick double tick then the whole goal or item is missed withhold soon as you get the missed withhold off itll longer read missed withholds are always more than one tick you never have goals and items finally proven out with any other pattern i have seen some prove out with rock slam ive seen some prove out with rock slam but laterly i have realized that there wasnt much of list every time that occurred if thered been little bit more of list they would have proved out with tick its all right as goal but i see these things months and months afterwards when theyve settled down and they all prove out with tick you understand thats all youre really interested in with meter now you talk about speeded rises speeded falls slowed rises slowed falls yeah but those are all instant reads now youre talking about out rudiments now youre talking about reading the significance of the thought majeure but its still an instant read it is merely change of needle pattern so theres significances about what this read is and what that read is and ive just rattled them off to you see there are more than that you see the dirty needle is always missed withhold thats doubletick arrangement any change of needle pattern at the instant youre finished is an instant read and that goals and items when they check out if theyre valid turn out to be single ticks frankly you could get along with just the data which ive given you in this lecture and if you applied that and didnt go scrambling around the road for bunch of new data why man youd have all the rudiments in youd be sailing and everything would be fine okay audience yes i dont say stop thinking think all you want to but dont stop looking thank you
