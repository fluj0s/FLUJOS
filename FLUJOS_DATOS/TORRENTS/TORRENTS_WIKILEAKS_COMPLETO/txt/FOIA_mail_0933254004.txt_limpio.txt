from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to jennifer f crossley jcrossleyueaacuk subject re masking of wwf maps date thu jul 29 091324 1999 jenny thanks for these after entering into debate with barrie pittock i have decided to shift to using the 1 sigma level as mask for all maps this will not affect any of the temperature plots you have done until now but means that the china and camerica precipitation maps will need redrawing using 1 sigma please let know when these are done note also for russia and that everything from now on for wwf both t and p should use 1 sigma as the mask sorry about this and i realise this squeezes even more time away from the rcm given what has happened and your role in producing these plots you may interested in the exchanges i have had with barrie pittock it illustrates nicely the nuances of presenting climate scenarios in different fora read these three emails in reverse order mike ___________________________________________ dear mike thank you for your careful consideration of my trenchant comments i am now much happier with what you are doing and indeed grateful for your hard work and enterprise is getting the new scenarios out so quickly for both ipcc and wwf shifting to one standard deviation is certainly an improvement along with some discussion of possible changes in extremes i fully appreciate that analysis of daily output is timeconsuming future task but meantime an appropriate caveat is needed maybe an additional upfront paragraph discussion of the very issues we have discussed re providing best estimates of changes even if their statistical detectability can only be established after long time period has elapsed would be useful i should perhaps explain my delicate position in all this as retired csiro person i have somewhat more independence than before and perhaps reduced sense of vested interest in csiro but i am still closely in touch and supportive of what car is doing also i have who is now leading staff member of wwf in australia and who is naturally well informed on climate change issues moreover michael rae who is their local climate change staffer is member of the csiro sector advisory committee along with some industry people as well and well known to so i anticipated questions from wwf australia and from the media later when the scenarios are released regarding the scenarios i did not want to be in the position of feeling the need to seriously question in public their presentation or interpretation you have allayed my fears on that score so that is great roger may still follow up with some more detailed comments he is collating from people in car best regards barrie ________________________________ barrie thanks for your trenchent comments re the scenario maps lets get the bit about extremes out of the way because in what wwf have asked us to do or what tim carter and i have done for wgii we cannot produce new detailed analyses for all the 15 regions we are doing of gcmbased changes in daily or subdaily events clearly for some many impacts such changes will be important and we do and will make comments to this effect in various places by the way we do show some analyses of changes in the probability of extreme seasons if not extreme days your main point of contention however is about the portrayal of changes in mean seasonal t and p and we are talking about 30year climate averages here my reason for introducing the idea of only showing changes in t and p that exceed some level of natural variability was pedagogic one rather than formal statistical one i concede that using 95 confidence terminology in the wwf leaflet is misleading and will drop this and the pedagogic role of this type of visual display is to bring home to people that some much or all of gcm simulated changes in mean seasonal precip for some regions do not amount to anything very large in relation to what may happen in the future to precip anyway classic example is the african sahel where none of the gcms get precip changes anything like as large as have been seen this century the reasons for this may be 1 because the ghg signal is poorly defined ie scatter of gcm p changes both above and below zero andor 2 because even with tighter bunching of gcm predictions in one direction these may still not be large relative to natural variations in 30year mean precip my approach of taking pseudoensemble of gcms standarising and scaling and then plotting the median in relation to natural variations is i think one of the more elegant ways of showing this of course we could define natural variability to be the 1 sigma rather than the 2 sigma level or simply the interquartile range of control climates or even just the 4060 percentile range what one chooses is matter of judgement and probably for wwf i should use less extreme threshold than 2 sigma the point behind all this is to emphasise that precip changes are less welldefined than temp changes and that we should be thinking of adaptation to present levels of precip variability rather than getting hung up on the problems of predicting future precip levels this pedagogic thinking is hard to communicate in short wwf brochure your concern about my message is well taken however and i intend to remove any reference to 95 confidence levels to reword the text to indicate that we are plotting precip changes only where they are large relative to natural variability and to reduce my threshold to the 1 sigma level of hadcm2 control variability eg this has the effect of showing precip changes for the majority of australia even in the b1 scenario but i do not intend to abandon the concept i think it important even for greenie groups to present sober assessments of magnitudes of change thus making it clear that future changes in t are better defined that future changes in p and also to point out that future emissions and therefore climate change may be as low as the b1 scenario is b1 climate change negligible i almost think so whilst also being possibly as high as a2 is i think very important the alternative is to think that such more subtle presentation is too sophisticated for wwf but i think hope not thanks again barrie for forcing to think through this again mike _________________________________________________________ at 1752 280799 1000 you wrote hello mike i am giving preliminary response to your suggestion that peter whetton comment on your scenario material in case there is some urgency peter did write an email last friday night before going on weeks holiday but unfortunately the email system failed and it probably did not go and has been lost he asked roger jones to respond on behalf of the group but roger is snowed under at present peter and i did discuss it on friday our main concern although there are other more detailed ones is your use of the 95 confidence limits of natural climatic variability as some sort of threshold for change this is reasonable thing to do if you are addressing the question of whether climatic change will be detectable at scientific level of confidence but that is certainly not the question i would expect wwf to want answered nor is it the one most relevant to giving policy advice the relevant question is what is the best estimate of climate change given the assumption that increasing gh gases will cause change the contrast between these questions the statistical criteria they require and thus the answers is what i was driving at in my comment on your paper in nature it is very serious difference with serious consequences for how people will interpret your advice the results as you present them suggest that many areas will have precipitation changes particularly which are small compared to natural variability and therefore it does not matter but if the change in mean is some appreciable fraction of natural variability say 50 that is very serious matter which ought to concern policy makers because it will have cumulative impacts especially in regard to large changes in the frequency and magnitude of extremes floods and droughts surely you understand that refer to the standard diagrams of the impact on extremes of shifting normal distribution by one standard deviation what you are doing is using strict type i error criterion when others wwf might think type ii error criterion is more suitable the precautionary principle and reasonable people like of course think criterion in between which measures risk of serious impacts is what is needed for policymakers the reference i gave in my comment in nature may not be the best but look at my argument in qjrms 109 pp4648 1983 for clearer exposition on this point the other related matter is that your scenarios for wwf and for that matter for ipcc wg2 do not discuss the importance of changes in extremes which are arguably the most important changes however poorly understood they may be at present this and the other caveats you are intending to include in the ipcc material re scaling sulfate aerosol effects longer timescales and change after stabilisation of concentrations should be in the wwf material also even if they complicate things bit i have not checked whether some of that is in your wwf stuff as yet i would be very concerned if the material comes out under wwf auspices in way that can be interpreted as saying that even greenie group like wwf thinks large areas of the world will have negligible climate change but that is where your 95 confidence limit leads sorry to be critical but better now than later best regards barrie dr barrie
