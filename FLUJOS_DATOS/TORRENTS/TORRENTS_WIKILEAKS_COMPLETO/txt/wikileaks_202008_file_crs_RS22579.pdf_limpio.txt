of columbia hous v oting rights act of 2007 would provide for permanent increase in the size of the us house of representatives from 435 seats to 437 seats the bills specify that one of the seats is to be allocated to the district of columbia while the other seat is to be assigned either by using the normal apportionment formula allocation procedure hr 1905 or specifying that the seat wo uld be allocated to utah thus adding fourth seat s 1257 while both versions treat the district of columbia as if it were state for the purposes of the allocation of house seats each restricts the district of columbia to single congressional seat under any future apportionments on april 19 2007 the house approved hr 1905 revised version of hr 1433 by vote of 241 to 177 roll call vote 231 and sent it to the senate for consideration1 on june 28 2007 s 1257 was reported out of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs with amendments on september 18 2007 cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was not invoked in the senate on yeanay vote 57 42 leaving the measure pending

house was imposed in 1929 by 46 stat 21 2627 altering the size of the house would require new law setting different limit article i 2 of the constitution establishes minimum house size one representative for each state and maximum house size one for every 30000 persons or 9380 representatives based on the 2000 census in 2003 house size of 473 would have resulted in state losing seats held from the 103 rd to the 107th congresses however by retaining seats through an increase in the house size other state delegations would become larger at house size of 473 californias delegation size for example would be 57 instead of 53 seats g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g153g155g142g140g142g141g142g151g157g561 general congressional practice when admitting new states to the union has been to increase the size of the house either permanently or temporarily to accommodate the new states new states usually resulted in additions to the size of the house in the 19th and early 20th centuries the exceptions to this general rule occurred when states were formed from other states maine kentucky and west virginia these states representatives came from the allocations of representatives of the states from which the new ones had been formed when alaska and hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960 the house size was temporarily increased to 437 this modern precedent differed from the state admission acts passed following the censuses in the 19 th and early 20th centuries which provided that new state representatives would be added to the apportionment totals 1

new mexico by providing for an increase in the house size from 433 to 435 if the states were admitted as noted above the house size was temporarily increased to 437 to accommodate alaska and hawaii in 1960 in 1961 when the president reported the 1960 census results and the resulting reapportionment of seats in the reestablished 435seat house alaska was entitled to one seat and hawaii to two seats massachusetts pennsylvania and missouri each received one less seat than they would have if the house size had been increased to 438 as was proposed by hr 10264 in 1962

and the apportionment that would occur as result of the provisions of the proposed legislation ie 437 seats dc allocated seat and utah allocated seat in addition the apportionment of 437 seats of the house of representatives is shown based on the 2006 state population estimates and providing for seat for the district of columbia if the district of columbia had been treated as state in the reapportionment of congressional seats following the 2000 census and the house size had remained at 435 north carolina would have not gained an additional seat in comparison with the 1990s the states delegation would have remained at 12 representatives if the district of columbia were to receive representation as if it were state and the house size were to be increased to 437 dc would be titled to one representative and utah would be entitled to four representatives one more than the state received in the reapportionment following the 2000 census other state would be ef fected by the change this is the impact that the proponents of the proposed legislation hope to achieve if either of the pending bills are enacted and the most recent estimates of population of the states are used as projection for what might happen in the 2012 apportionment the district would get its seat and utah would retain its fourth seat however arizona florida georgia and nevada would each pick up seat and texas would be allocated an additional two seats iowa louisiana massachusetts new york ohio and pennsylvania would each lose single seat this is primarily due to change in state populations since the

the equal proportions formula provided in 2 usc 2aa table 2 displays the end of the priority list that was used to allocate representatives based on the 2000 census the law only provides for 435 seats in the house but the tables illustrate not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula ending at 435 but the states that would just miss getting additional representation2 2 the figures in table 2 for the population needed to gain or lose seat are misleading because it is unlikely that one states population total would be adjusted without others changing as well since the method of equal proportions used to allocate seats in the house uses all state populations simultaneously changes in several state populations may also result in changes to the populations needed to gain or lose seat httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22579g6g146g156g157g155g146g140g157g561g152g143g561g5g152g149g158g150g139g146g138g561g20g142g153g155g142 g156g142g151
