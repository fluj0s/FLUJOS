exports to oman were transport equipment 56 and machinery 24 the us international trade commission usitc predicts that the economic effect of the usoman fta is likely to be minimal since trade levels

to the persian gulf 35 miles directly opposite iran it is not member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec oman is moderate islamic country which has sought to maintain good relations with all middle east countries it also has 170 year history of political and economic cooperation with the united states and has supported the us war on terrorism5 oman is an important gateway to the persian gulf region oman has many reasons for wanting to negotiate an fta with the united states it is country whose proven oil reserves could be exhausted within 15 or 20 years yet almost 40 of the countrys gdp twothirds of its export earnings and three 3 prenotification was given on october 17 2005 three days after negotiations were concluded subsequently the agreement was

of near eastern affairs background note oman february 2006 crs3 fourth of its government revenues currently come from oil revenues it is therefore trying to liberalize and diversify its trade regime as it seeks to broaden economic opportunities for fastgrowing workforce as result it is looking to expand its economy beyond oil and gas exports it sees the united states as an important ally in the

uae japan and the united kingdom for 2004 most recent data in 2005 the most important us imports from oman see table 1 were oil and natural gas 75 constituting 1 of all us oil and gas imports from mefta countries and apparel 10 the most important us exports to oman were various types of transport equipment and road vehicles totaling 56 and various types of machinery 24 since 2001 us exports to oman have almost doubled to 593 million for various reasons while us imports from oman at 555 million have increased by about third primarily because of increases in the price of petroleum imports as result for 2005 the united states had small trade surplus with oman foreign direct investment in oman total us foreign direct investment in oman was 358 million in 2003 nearly double the 193 million

for us companies date section on foreign direct investment statistics 9 ibid crs5 is likely to be minimal because trade with oman is low us apparel workers are group that is potentially adversely affected apparel imports from oman declined by 57 in 2005 over 2004 because the world trade organization wto agreement on clothing and textiles act expired in january of 2005 ending the trade quota system among wto partner countries the usitc reports that tariff reductions and elimination under the usoman fta should restore some of the competitiveness of omans apparel exports among us purchasers and estimates that the resulting increase in imports would come at the expense of workers elsewhere in the world not us workers10 tariff provisions under the usoman fta the united states and oman will provide each other immediate dutyfree access for tariff lines covering almost all consumer and industrial goods with special provisions for agriculture and textiles and apparel for agricultural products oman will provide immediate dutyfree access for current us exports in 87 of agricultural tariff lines and the united states will provide immediate dutyfree access for 100 of omans current

including representatives ben chandler phil english darrell issa william jefferson gregory meeks and paul ryan congressional support on the senate side was led by senator charles grassley chairman of the senate finance committee and by senator craig thomas chairman of the subcommittee on international trade which held hearings on the usoman fta on march 6 2006 arguments in favor of the agreement ustr portman asserted that the usoman fta will contribute to economic growth and trade between both countries generate export opportunities for us companies farmers and ranchers help create jobs in

access across the entire services regime provide secure predictable legal framework for us investors operating in oman provide for effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws and protect intellectual property furthermore he argues that this agreement will support and accelerate the market liberalization that oman started as part of its accession to the wto in 2000 portman contends that joint usomani efforts will advance economic growth and democracy raise living standards and promote peace 17 sec 2104e of the trade act of 2002 requires that advisory committees provide the

economic interests of the united states and achieves the applicable overall and principal negotiating objectives set forth in the trade act of 2002 crs10 and economic stability in the middle east region of almost 350 million people and 70 billion trading relationship with the united states18 the overall advisory committee for trade policy negotiations actpn also notes that the agreement will strengthen the likelihood of additional agreements in the region and improve and strengthen overall us relations with the countries of the middle east19 in addition those in favor of the agreement assert that oman is one of the most open countries in the middle east economic freedom of the world 2005 published by canadas fraser institute reports p 4 that when measures of economic freedom and democracy are included in statistical study economic freedom is about 50 times more effective than democracy in diminishing violent conflict economic freedom ranked oman 17th out of 127 countries in terms of degree of economic freedom afforded in five basic areas20 the only mefta country it ranked higher was the uae which tied for 9th place with australia luxemburg and estonia other mefta country rankings were bahrain 24th jordan 25th israel 50th and egypt tied for 78th with iran and morocco21 in 2003 oman passed new labor law extending its labor protections for domestic workers to foreign workers who predominate in the private sector in response to some calls to strengthen the omani labor law further chuck ditrich national foreign trade council vice president urges patience acknowledging that oman still has some areas that may need further legislation but argues that omani laws must be viewed in the context of very traditional society that is committed to modernization22 for example the government of oman reportedly recognizes the need for more explicit provisions for collective bargaining in its laws23 moreover oman has reportedly undertaken consultation with the ilo for technical assistance in complying with ilo core labor standards24 18 office of the ustr united states and oman conclude free trade agreement oct 3 2005 19 letter from william frenzel former member

letter from ambassador hunaina almughairy omani ambassador to the united states continued crs11 arguments against the agreement three of the 27 reports by trade advisory committees mandated under the trade promotion authority language of the trade act of 2002 have some criticisms of the usoman fta those committees on the environment intergovernmental affairs and labor environment most members of the trade policy and environment committee agreed that the environment and public participation provisions were acceptable however they noted that the usoman fta lacks some environmental provisions which have appeared in other agreements and which would have been appropriate examples of such provisions are the extensive public participation framework from the central america free trade agreement cafta and some basic environmental provisions which appeared in the ftas with chile and singapore25 intergovernmental affairs the intergovernmental advisory policy committee in principle supported the trade liberalization objectives of the agreement however the committee stressed the need for trade agreements to continue to respect the authority of state and local governments to regulate in areas under their jurisdiction they also stressed the need for ongoing consultations with subfederal governments26 labor the labor groups are the most vocal critics they argue that potential losers from the agreement would be workers in oman who would miss out on the opportunity to be more fully protected by labor standards other implied losers would be us workers for whom the agreement does little to level the playing field main arguments against the fta offered by labor interests are concentrated primarily on two basic issues weaknesses in the agreement and weaknesses in omani laws and enforcement for which the agreement does not adequately compensate weaknesses in the agreement labor critics point out that the trade act of 200227 requires us negotiators to seek provisions that treat us principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to both 1 the ability to resort to dispute settlement and 2 the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and remedies however critics argue the agreement does not do this further they 24 continued to the minority chief counsel of the trade subcommittee house ways and means committee accompanying response from the

sec 2102b12g this law gives the president authority to negotiate trade agreements that will then be considered by congress on an expedited basis crs12 argue the fta is step backward from protections offered oman under the generalized system of preferences not all labor provisions are treated equally the usoman fta identifies three basic labor commitments for partner countries 1 commitments to comply with ilo standards 2 commitments to enforce their own labor standards 3 and commitments to not derogate from those standards in order to attract trade and investment however critics argue only the second of these three commitments is enforceable through the dispute resolution procedures of the usoman fta this treatment they argue contrasts with provisions of the usjordan fta which makes all three commitments enforceable through the dispute resolution process28 unequal treatment of labor compared to most nonlabor provisions second there are different dispute resolution procedures for labor and nonlabor eg intellectual property violations for labor and environmental violations the potential penalty for the one labor and environmental violation failure to enforce ones own laws that is open to the dispute resolution procedures is capped at 15 million per violation per year for nonlabor and nonenvironmental violations there is cap on any monetary assessment step back from gsp in addition the aflcio sees the usoman fta as being step back from the generalized system of preferences gsp program under gsp trade preferences for developing countries including oman are dependent on such countries taking steps to afford their workers internationally recognized worker rights challenge to gsp eligibility for any country begins with petition to the office of the ustr documenting that country is not taking steps to afford its workers such rights in june of 2005 the aflcio petitioned the ustr to remove oman from gsp status arguing that it was not affording its workers internationally recognized worker rights29 the ustr subsequently rejected the petition and oman continues to hold gsp status weaknesses in omani law and enforcement when there are weaknesses in the agreement critics argue if countrys basic laws and enforcement of those laws are strong enough workers can still be protected oman critics argue lacks protections in certain areas omani gaps in ratification of ilo core labor standards first as of the date of this report according to the ilo website oman has ratified conventions relating to only two of the four basic ilo core labor standards enumerated in footnote on p 7 those protecting against child labor and those prohibiting forced 28 even though both parties committed to this enforcement pattern in the usjordan fta the countries exchanged letters just before congress debated the agreement promising to make every effort to resolve any differences without recourse to formal dispute settlement procedures 29 before the united states trade representative petition to remove oman from the list of beneficiary developing countries under the generalized system of preferences gsp june 15 2005 source ustr website at httpwwwustrgov crs13 labor oman has not ratified conventions related to the right to organize and bargain collectively and the elimination of employment discrimination30 lack of other omani laws andor enforcement furthermore various sources suggest that omani labor laws andor enforcement do not fully cover certain aspects of the following areas relating to core labor standardsinternationally recognized worker rights right to organize and bargain collectively the state departments country reports on human rights practices 2004 finds in the area of right to organize and bargain collectively that omani law does not provide workers with the right to form or join unions but does permit them to form representation committees with the goal of taking care of their interests the lac reports that where representation committees exist however they are by law not authorized to discuss wages hours or conditions of employment31 country reports for 2005 adds an unofficial estimate that 25 representation committees representing 91 of employees in the private sector have been registered since 2004 and reports that provisions of the law apply to omani women and foreign workers as well as omani men32 right to strike furthermore according to country reports for 2004 the omani law does not address strikes or explicitly provide for the right to collective bargaining however it reports that the 2003 omani labor law removed 1973 prohibition on strikes and details procedures for dispute resolution country reports for 2005 also indicates that while labor unrest was rare there were four reported strikes during the year the most significant one closed the largest seaport for two days33 prohibition of forced or compulsory labor country reports for 2004 also finds that the omani law prohibits forced or compulsory labor including that of children country reports for 2004 further notes that even though the protections of the 2003 omani labor law apply equally to foreign and domestic workers at times foreign workers who account for 80 of private sector workforce and 50 of all workers in oman were placed in situations amounting to forced labor country reports for 2005 echoes the finding that some situations amounted to forced labor and adds that employers sometimes withheld documents that would release workers from employment contracts and allow them to change employers 30 ilo database of international standards 31 labor advisory committee for trade negotiations and trade policy lac the us oman free trade agreement november 15 2005 p 5 country reports for 2005 indicates that the minimum wage is insufficient to provide decent standard of living for worker and family 32 country reports for 2005 was released march 8 2006 33 materials received by crs on april 4 2006 from the firm of baker donelson bearman caldwell berkowitz representing the omani government also report that there were 33 strikes in 2004 in oman representing almost 6000 workers in 17 industries crs14 without such documents foreign worker must continue to work for his current employer or become technically unemployed and consequently candidate for deportation country reports for 2005 further reports that many foreign workers were not aware of their right to take such disputes to the labor welfare board which in most cases released the worker from the service contract without deportation awarded compensation for time worked under compulsion reimbursed the worker for back wages and subjected the guilty employer to fines however country reports 2005 states there were available

of 23 to 15 on july 20 the house passed the bill by vote of 221 to 205 on september 19 the senate reconsidered the implementing legislation and passed the house version of the same bill by vote of 63 to 31 this action was necessary because the constitution requires that all revenueraising legislation which encompasses trade bills since they affect tariffs originate in the house the bill was signed by the president and became pl 109283 on september 26 2006 other labor issues report of alleged sweatshop conditions in plants in jordan producing for export to the united states has been issued by the national labor committee nlc nonprofit organization that promotes worker rights around the world the 161page report has raised concerns within congress that similar conditions might exist or occur in other mefta countries including oman if the usoman fta were to go into effect crs15 the nlc report entitled usjordan free trade agreement descends into human trafficking and involuntary servitude released in may of 2006 documents conditions in 28 separate factories in jordan in foreign trade zones where clothing is produced by jordanian and foreign guest workers mostly for export to the united states the report estimates that tens of thousands of foreign guest workers who entered employment willingly were subsequently stripped of their passports and trapped in involuntary servitude sewing clothing in factories for companies including walmart kmart gloria vanderbilt target kohls jc penney victorias secret and l l bean34 the senate finance committee responded to the concerns on may 18 2006 by unanimously adopting an amendment in its mock markup of the administrations usoman fta draft implementing legislation the amendment offered by senator kent conrad would prohibit any products made in oman with slave labor including under sweatshop conditions so egregious as to be tantamount to slave labor or with the benefit of human trafficking from benefitting from the agreement committee republicans including chairman chuck grassley joined democrats in voting for the conceptual amendment the committee then unanimously approved the usoman draft implementing bill as amended35 any amendments passed by committee during the mock markup process are advisory in nature rather than obligatory the administration responded that while they would consider the amendment they had some concerns first they argued the amendment might fall outside the scope of the provision in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 sec 2103b3ii requiring that any new statutory language be necessary or appropriate to implement the trade agreement36 second the administration argued sec 307 of the tariff act of 1930 already prohibits the importation of merchandise produced in whole or in part through prison forced or indentured labor including by those who voluntarily entered into employment but were later subject to facto slave working conditions in response to the administrations argument senator conrad pointed out that sec 307 of the tariff act of 1930 may not be applicable to apparel produced under slave labor conditions in oman this he argued is because apparel is longer made in great quantities in the united states and sec 307 does not apply to goods produced under forced or indentured labor if those goods are not domestically produced in quantities that meet the consumption demands of the united states37 third the administration argued that the amendment may be unnecessary because fta language requiring oman to enforce its own labor laws which prohibit forced labor is strong enough or enforceable enough to discourage or affect its practice in addition the administration pointed out oman has approved core labor 34 the report is available at httpwwwnclnetorg 35

commitments oman promised to issue royal decrees and ministerial decisions to strengthen the countrys labor laws in response to congressional concerns by later than october 31 200638 while some republicans argued that oman needs time to craft new laws with technical support from the ilo some democrats argued for changes in omani laws before the usoman fta implementing legislation is

amended by the decree omani law would permit the right to form unions the right to bargain collectively and to engage in other union activities the law would also prohibit employers and others from

issues on port security in the spring of 2006 the us interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states raised objections to the acquisition and continued operation of contracts by the dubaiowned dubai ports world company from british firm that managed port facilities in several cities including new york new jersey baltimore new orleans miami and philadelphia after several members of congress expressed opposition to the 9 billion merger on the grounds that the company might not be as vigilant on port security as required the company agreed to 45day review of its operations at those ports on march 9 the house appropriations committee voted 622 on provision in the fy2006 supplemental funding bill for iraq and afghanistan war operations and other costs that would have effectively prevented dp world from operating in the united states41 the following day dp world officials announced that they would divest the newlyacquired us port operations to an american owner42 the oman fta provision provision in the oman fta became the focus of increased attention some argue that this provision could obligate the united states to open up landside aspects of its port activities to operation by companies such as dp world others argue that the provision is not new to bilateral trade agreements and does not change current us policy the provision contained in annex ii of the usoman fta addresses cross border services and investment in the area of transportation more specifically the provision sets out two categories of transportation activities those for which the united states reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measures and those activities for which the united states does not reserve the right to adopt or maintain any measures those activities which are exclusions from the above list the list for which the united states reserves the right to maintain any measure includes requirements for investment in ownership and control of and operation of drill rigs us flagged vessels fishing vessels plus requirements related to documenting vessel under the us flag promotional programs certification licensing and citizenship requirements programs certification licensing and citizenship requirements manning requirements and all matters under the jurisdiction of the federal maritime commission the excluded list for which the united states does not reserve the right to adopt or maintain any measure includes two categories of activities one unconditional 41 crs report rs21852 the united arab emirates uae issues for us policy by kenneth

second category b for which the united states waives its right to adopt or maintain any of the listed measures on the condition that comparable market access in these sectors is obtained from oman includes the following activities landside aspects of port activities including operation and maintenance of docks loading and unloading vessels directly to or from land marine cargo handling operation and maintenance of piers ship cleaning stevedoring transfer of cargo between vessels and trucks trains pipelines and wharves waterfront terminal operations boat cleaning canal operation dismantling of vessels operation of marine railways for drydocking maritime surveyors except cargo marine wrecking of vessels for scrap and shift classification societies some in congress argue that the provision excluding the above activities from the us governments right to adopt or maintain any measure should be removed from the agreement because it poses potential security risk to the united states others are arguing that the provision merely restates what is already the situation in the united states and is not problem the arguments on both sides follow arguments in favor of the provision those arguing that the provision excluding certain activities from the us right to adopt or maintain any measure should remain in the agreement argue that43 it complies with most favored nation treatment obligations basic obligation of free trade agreements such as the usoman fta is the obligation subject to specified exceptions to treat service suppliers and investors of other parties less favorably than the united states treats its own service suppliers and investors this provision meets those requirements provision exists in other ftas this provision is already included in other agreements including the north american free trade agreement nafta the dominican republiccentral america free trade agreement and ftas with australia bahrain chile and morocco omani companies already have this right proponents argued that omani companies are presumably already able to acquire contracts for and perform these services currently there are us laws that prevent either an omaniowned company or any other foreignowned company from contracting with port owners to perform landside aspects of port activities in the united states44 43 except as otherwise noted these

ensuring security at us ports and nothing in the agreement amends or diminishes the authority of these agencies omani companies are currently interested in us port operations while oman already provides market access to us service suppliers and investors the ustr is not aware of any omani companies that are currently involved in any us port operations or that might be interested in such operations in the future however if they were the essential security exception would fully protect the united states according to proponents if an omani company were to express such interest in the future the essential security or national security exception explained below could arguably be invoked to fully protect us national security needs the united states could deny fta benefits to owners of shell operation to businesses whose owners were nationals of countries subject to us sanctions or to any potential investment pursuant to the essential security exception described below if nonomani persons set up an enterprise in oman that was merely shell ie that was engaged in substantial business activities in oman and that enterprise sought to make an investment in the united states the fta contains specific language that would arguably permit the united states to deny the ftas investmentand services related benefits to that enterprise moreover even if the enterprise set up in oman had substantial business activity in oman the united states could deny fta benefits to it if its owners were nationals of countries subject to us sanctions finally the us government retains the authority to block any potential investment pursuant to the essential security exception described below the essential security exception offers protection chapter 21 of the usoman fta contains several exceptions to the agreement article 212 addresses essential security and provides that nothing in the agreement shall be construed to require party to furnish or allow access to any information which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests or b to preclude party from applying measures it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations for the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security or the protection of its own essential security interests an essential security exception has been included in all us trade agreements dating back to the 1947 general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the united states among other countries has consistently interpreted this language worded similarly to article 21 of the usoman fta to be selfjudging and therefore that national security matters are not appropriate for adjudication in third party dispute settlement mechanism in other words under these provisions it can be argued that nothing in an agreement can prevent the united states from applying measures that it considers necessary for the protection of essential security interests moreover proponents will argue that review of national security claims by crs20 international tribunals are without precedent and are highly unlikely because arguably tribunal would accept jurisdiction over the question of what constitutes countrys national security45 the exonflorio amendment offers additional protection for national security issues in addition us law in particular the exon florio amendment to the defense production act of 195046 authorizes the president to block proposed foreign investment in the united states that threatens national security the president has delegated to the interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius the responsibility to continuously monitor foreign investment in the united states to ensure against threats to national security and cfius review could still be performed at the discretion of cfius while it is theoretically possible for oman to bring legal challenge to the actions of the united states before thirdparty tribunal proponents argued the united states would appear to be on solid legal grounds for asserting not only that the panel does not have the legal authority to determine the validity of such matter but also that the inconsistent measure is permitted and justifiable given the broad self judging language of the national security exception47 arguments against the provision those arguing that the exception provision of annex ii should not have been included in the usoman fta argue that such provision could pose serious threat to congress ability to ensure the security of us port infrastructure specific arguments against the provision are as follows48 the specific commitments in annex ii raise significant national security concerns opponents argue this is because language in annex ii regarding landside port operations introduces new rights of establishment for foreign companies to own sensitive us infrastructure these fta provisions arguably subject us laws or policies whether enacted by congress the executive or the states that restrict foreign ownership to challenge in dispute resolution andor to suit under the investorstate enforcement provisions the united states will be required to offer oman the right to bid to operate at us ports the very activities about which congress expressed national security concerns during the dubai ports world debate under the fta this right is conditional upon obtaining comparable market access in this sector from oman however this right covers the very port activities 45 crs general distribution memorandum national security issues and the proposed us oman free trade

sensitive infrastructure within the us memorandum from lori wallach may 11 2006 crs21 about which congress expressed national security concerns during the dubai ports world debate annex ii language goes beyond us commitments in the wto generally the service sectors to which the right to establish for foreign companies applies in these ftas is the same as the service sectors that the united states agreed to in the 1994 wtos general agreement on trade in services gats however opponents argue the oman fta adds to the us commitments by specifically including or by not specifically excluding landside operations of ports opponents also argue that the wto text and practice says that national security claims are theoretically reviewable the reason for this they argue is that neither the gatt agreement nor the fta expressly exempts these provisions from review by an international tribunal49 under annex ii the united states may not ban enterprises of party from owning and operating covered services nor can either country limit the number or size of such services or require specific forms of ownership ie require us partners or require that it be nonprofit organization if the united states took action to deny company its new right to establish opponents argued it would be violation of the fta and subject to dispute resolution and trade sanctions50 under the fta such disputes can be brought in two fora both of which raise concerns in governmenttogovernment dispute resolution fora judges with narrow trade expertise would decide between us national security needs and trade commitments governmenttogovernment dispute resolution cases are not heard in us courts but in threeperson trade tribunals under procedures agreed to in article 20 of the fta in these cases each country in the dispute may select one judge from its country and these two tribunalists would choose third judge from list of trade experts provided by each country in such scenario judges with narrow trade expertise and perspective including nonus individuals would be empowered to balance competing us interests national security needs against us trade commitments to decide which comes first in the investorstate dispute resolution fora and world bank tribunalists would be empowered to second guess us national security claim investorstate enforcement is enumerated in chapter 10 of the usoman fta

of the expected future profits it would be denied by an adverse us action the case would be adjudicated by united nations or world bank tribunalists who would be empowered to second guess national security claim and possibly order the us government to pay the foreign company for its lost future profits51 if the us were to raise an essential security exception after cfius review an fta panel would likely deny the exception if the us were to raise the essential security exception included in chapter 21 article 212 as defense before trade tribunal and cfius review had been completed without finding of security threat as in the case of dubai world ports opponents argue there is doubt that an fta panel would not permit use of the ftas essential security exception to excuse consequent government action that interfered with the fta investor right to establish port operations if cfius review predetermined that an acquisition were not in the national security interests of the united states this would not terminate an fta claim however the converse is not necessarily true if cfius review did determine that an acquisition were not in the national security interest of the united states opponents argued this would not terminate an fta claim this is because the fta sets out procedures for responding to validly raised claims thus even with cfius review it is argued that the united states would still be required to respond in united nations or world bank tribunal essentially requiring litigation on the essential security defense outcome of congressional vote on the fta and potential consequences if it had failed to pass oman joins four other mefta countries with ftas and the proposed mefta is now onequarter of the way complete an agreement with oman could be pathway to create private sector jobs for omans burgeoning population and gateway to more openness in the middle east if congress had not approved the usoman fta any one of number of things could have happened on one hand oman could have just continued trading with the united states as usual on the other hand oman could have looked elsewhere to countries such as china russia or india for support in diversifying beyond the production of oil which could run out in roughly 1520 years in addition had the usoman fta not been approved there might have been broader implications for example oman has been letting the united states use several military facilities while many argued that it would have been be in omans interest to continue to cooperate with the united states military oman might have
