ambassador william kennard pershing and hedegaard agreed that the us eu cooperation remains important particularly in light of the statement issued by the basics following their january 25 meeting they agreed on the need to operationalize the copenhagen accord and ensure it is incorporated into the unfccc process pershing said it would be important to convene the ministers prior to the may meetings in bonn and suggested meeting of the mef to include relevant nonmembers hedegaard questioned whether guaranteed loans should be included in the 30 billion fast start financing package and pershing suggested meeting among the key donor states be held in the near term to discuss and if possible agree on common approach to what financing would be listed in each countrys contribution end summary 2 sbu pershing told hedegaard that the prospects for climate and energy legislation this year increased following the state of the union address he said the president is very focused on this issue and committed to legislative package not just an energy bill hedegaard said that she would be traveling to washington in midmarch as part of an eu delegation and asked if it would be useful for the delegation to meet with senators ambassador kennard cautioned the commissioner noting that any messages to the hill must be constructive 3 sbu pershing said the focus for the us team in january had been to encourage as many countries as possible to associate with the copenhagen accord he expects the final number to be about 120 countries which is in the range of the 100150 that the usg had hoped for although still less than would be desirable he said that submissions by some major economies were opaque hedegaard said chinas submission was open to interpretation pershing said brazils and indias submissions were as well and were probably the result of their january 25 agreement citing special envoy for climate change todd sterns february 9 speech pershing stressed two points 1 the heads of states made commitments at copenhagen and the united states does not take these commitments lightly and 2 the accord is the result of long and arduous process there is plan b for negotiation of different agreement 4 sbu hedegaard asked about chinas perceptions on the accord pershing said the letter from premier wen to secretary general ban ki moon and danish prime minister rasmussen was positive but he was more concerned about communications from wei chinas climate negotiator he noted that there had been formal bilateral climate discussions between the us and china since copenhagen but indicated that these would likely resume in february pershing said the us and eu must deal with china specifically on the subject of transparency hedegaard then asked did you agree with china on mrv or not i was presented with paper that china india and the us could agree upon pershing replied the question is whether they will honor that language hedegaard said she does not have high expectations for cop 16 in mexico and that we must avoid the expectations that it will resolve all of the unanswered problems from copenhagen she asked whether the copenhagen accord could be moved into the lca longterm cooperative action or kp kyoto protocol working groups for future discussions pershing said the two tracks have not yielded much progress but the lca would be easier particularly since the united states is not member of kyoto he said in theory the accord should guide the work of the cop but hes not sure if the basics will allow this he said the basics led by india are resisting any changes to the unfccc guidelines under which developing countries report on their ghg emissions and actions he said african and latin american states are looking to turn copenhagen into binding agreement but the basics are opposed to this hedegaard suggested the aosis alliance of small island states countries could be our best allies given their need for financing 5 sbu hedegaard said that in light of the basic announcement the us and eu must coordinate more closely she asked whether the mef process should be continued and suggested meeting of annex i countries pershing said the forum for further discussions has not been resolved but he suggested that nonmembers could be invited to participate in mef discussions he said meeting of the mef ministers prior to the mayjune meeting in bonn could help frame expectations for mexico hedegaard said she supports the mef process but said constructive signal from the cop at bonn will be important brussels 00000186 002 of 002 6 sbu hedegaard asked if the us was prepared to move forward on fast start funding she said some countries like japan and the uk will press the inclusion of loan guarantees as part of the package and asked whether the us will need to do any creative accounting she added 30 billion had been promised it cannot be lent she asked for pershings thought on the soros proposal which she said was tempting in the longterm but she is not sure it will work for fast start funding note in december 2010 george soros proposed that developed countries return their imf special drawing rights sdrs to the imf which could in turn lend the funds to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation soros estimated the amount from sdrs could provide about 150 billion end note pershing replied that this proposal is just another form of loan guarantee and we were skeptical of its utility he also said he would share our analysis on it on fast track financing pershing said the administration anticipated the need and budgeted funds in 2010 and 2011 he said some us funding would be directly applied for mitigation and adaptation and other sources would be indirect citing for example program funds from various agencies and funds for food security he concurred that it would be valuable to agree on what funds would be included in each countrys reporting and said donors have to balance the political need to provide real financing with the practical constraints of tight budgets he suggested that the small group of key donors those that provide about 90 of the financing convene quickly to discuss this issue 7 u the deputy special envoy for climate change has cleared this cable
