sponsors or statement that there are earmarks must be disclosed in specified public documents for committeereported legislation and conference reports either list or statement must be included in the applicable report language regarding nonreported legislation the chair of each committee of initial referral is required to have list or statement printed in the congressional record prior to consideration of the legislation the proponent of managers amendment must also have list or statement printed in the congressional record prior to consideration of the amendment while the house has established rules designed to provide time for members to review the contents of committee reports conference reports and joint explanatory statements before floor consideration the house may waive these requirements in cases in which committee provides time for review members have an opportunity for example to draft amendments striking specific earmarks in reported bill or lobby against co nference report under house rule xiii clause 4a committeereported legislation may not generally be considered on the house floor until the accompanying committee report has been available to members for at least three calendar days 12 house rule xxii clause 8a provides similar threeday availability requirement for conference reports the conference report and attached joint explanatory statement must be available in the congressional record for at least three calendar days prior to consideration and copies of the conference report and joint explanatory statement must be available for at least two hours before consideration 13 the house however typically adopts special rules providing for consideration of conference reports that waive all points of order including these the earmark and sponsor disclosure requirements are not selfenforcing member must raise point of order on the house floor against consideration of the legislation amendment or conference report point of order raised under this subsection may be based only on the failure to include list of earmarks and sponsors or statement that there are earmarks in the report language or congressional record as applicable14 in response to parliamentary inquiry the speaker pro tempore explained that the rule does not contemplate question of order relating to the content of the statement offered in compliance with the rule argument concerning the adequacy of the list or the probity of disclaimer is matter that may be addressed by debate on the merits of the measure or by other means collateral to the review of the chair 15 each committee therefore is left solely respon sible for determining the contents of the list the house rule prohibits house consideration of special rule that waives the public disclosure requirements and includes special procedure to implement this prohibition if member raises point of order against considering special rule that includes such waiver the presiding officer does not rule on the point of order instead the house decides by majority vote whether to consider the special rule16 the house rule provides 20 minutes of debate equally divided and 12 for more details see crs

similarly the senate can not vote on adoption of conference report unless the chair or majority leader or designee makes similar certification the chair or majority leader must certify that list or chart or other similar form of all earmarks including those in the applicable measure conference report or accompanying report language if any and the name of each senator who submitted request for each item listed has been available on publicly accessible congressional website for at least 48 hours before such vote19 in the case of measures they must also certify that the list of earmarks and senate sponsors on the congressional website are in searchable format lists associated with conference reports should also be in searchable format but only to the extent technically feasible if the presiding officer sustains point of order against vote on motion to proceed consideration on the motion is suspended until certification is made and the sponsor or designee of the motion requests consideration to resume under rule xliv paragraph 3 if point of order is sustained against conference report it would be set aside these rules are not selfenforcing senator must raise point of order against the vote 20 senate rule xliv provides two procedures to wa ive these requirements and restricts appeals of the presiding officers rulings on such points of order unlike the house the senate does not have generally applicable mechanism to waive its ru although waiver motion is available for points of order under the budget act and similar requirements the senate standing rules must continued the congressional budget act for dealing with special rules that waive the application of section 425 of the act prohibiting the consideration of legislation that includes an unfunded federal intergovernmental mandate 17 points of order raised under this requirement are based solely on whether the rule includes waiver of rule xxi clause 9 and not whether such waiver is necessary for example point of order was raised against the consideration of special rule providing for consideration of the conference report for the department of defense appropriations act for fy2008 because it waived all rules of the house including rule xxi clause 9 and hres 491 congressional record daily edition vol 153 november 8 2007 pp h13312h13314 18 the senate typically decides to consider measure by unanimous consent but may also do so by motion to proceed which requires majority vote to adopt hous epassed measures not reported from senate committee are not included because they do not include earmarks requested by senators 19 under the rule the certification authority rests with the majority leader or his designee and committee chairs not subcommittee chairs 20 for general information on

divided and controlled by the majority and minority leaders or their designees these points of order may also be waived if the majority and minority leaders jointly agree that such waiver is necessary as result of significant disruption to senate facilities or to the availability of the internet 22 the senate rule places restrictions on consideration of appeals of the chairs rulings on these points of order any senator may appeal the presiding officers ruling on most senate rules such appeals are generally debatable and debate may be ended by cloture requiring threefifths vote of all senators to adopt the cloture motion or by motion to table which would uphold the chairs ruling the appeal procedure included in rule xliv allows only one appeal and limits debate to one hour while majority vote is generally required to overrule the chairs ruling under senate rules appeals of rule xliv require threefifths vote the same as waiver motion 23 amendments in the reported bill or offered from the floor that include earmarks are covered under the rule but the procedures differ those amendments in the text of the reported bill are subject to the same point of order described above that applies to reported measures regarding amendments offered from the floor the rule recommends that the sponsor of an amendment that includes an additional earmark 24 ensure as soon as practicable that 1 list

for spending earmarks added to certain conference reports or accompanying joint explanatory statements during the 110th congress the disclosure requirement only covers conference reports to regular appropriations bills it does not cover other spending measures or revenue or tariff measures hres 491 reiterates the prohibition in rule xxi clause 9 against consideration of conference report specifically as it relates to airdropped earmarks in conference reports for regular appropriations bills analogous to rule xxi it requires the joint explanatory statement include list of earmarks added to the conference report or joint explanatory statement and the name of any member or senator who requested an earmarks on the list as with the house public disclosure procedures described above the dispos ition of point of order under hres 491 is not based on the sufficiency of such list unlike point s of order raised under rule xxi clause 9a however points of order under hres 491are not resolved by ruling of the presiding officer whereas under rule xxi clause 9a the presiding officer rules based on whether the required list or statement has been provided under the standing order point of order is resolved by question of consideration the standing order also prohibits consideration of special rule waiving this requirement under rule xxi clause 9b the presiding officer does not rule on point of order against consideration of special rule that waives the requirements of clause 9a instead as discussed above the house decides by majority vote whether to consider it similarly under hres 491 the presiding officer does not rule on points of order raised against consideration of special rule waiving the application of the standing order and the point of order is resolved by question of consideration as result point of order made against either the conference report for regular appropriations bill or special rule waiving the requirement of the standing order would be disposed of by question of consideration as with rule xxi the standing order provides for 20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled for considering these questions of consideration due to this provision the standing order allows the house to debate and vote on whether to consider conference report or special rule waiving the requirement even when the standing order may not have been violated 29 g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g20g158g149g142g561g26g14g11g24g496g561g18g138g155g138g144g155g138g153g145g561g350g561 the senate rule establishes new procedure to strike certain new spending

authorizing or re authorizing funds the rule also does not apply to limited tax or tariff benefits added in conference the provision in senate rule xliv concerning conference is not directed against congressionally directed spending items as are the provisions c oncerning disclosure described above but instead allows any senator to raise point of order against any provision or provisions in conference report that contain specific spending level for specific program project activity or account when specific funding level was provided for the applicable item in the house or senate passed versions of the measure the presiding officer may sustain points of order against one or more provisions in the conference report this rule does not apply to language in joint explanatory statements only those provisions in the legislative text of conference reports the rule supplements senate rule xxviii which generally prohibits conferees from including in conference report new matter not dealt with in either the house or senatepassed versions of measure under current senate practice and precedents however earmarks airdropped into conference reports are not typically interpreted as new matter rule xxviii provides that in cases in which one of the versions of the bill is an amendment in the nature of substitute which is typically the case the conferees may include germane modification of the subjects in disagreement under existing precedents earmar ks added to conference report are often considered germane modifications for example regular appropriations measures provide funding to each department and large independ ent agency by distributing the spending among several accounts 31 funding levels for programs projects or activities within an account such as most earmarks included in legislative text are generally considered germane modifications senator may raise point of order under rule xliv against any provision or provisions in conference report that contain specific spending level for specific program project activity or account when specific funding level was provided for the applicable item in the house or senatepassed versions of the measure if point of order is sustained the offending provision is stricken from the conference report after all points of order have been dealt with the senate decides whether to send to the house the remaining text of the conference report the decision is debatable under the same limitations that may apply to the conference report and amendments are allowed the senate may waive this point of order with regard to single provision or all provisions constituting new directed spending or appeal the presiding officers ruling by supermajority vote threefifths of all senators must vote to waive the rule or overrule the presiding officers decision under this senate rule any senator may propose motion to waive all points of order provided in this rule with respect to pending measure or motion threefifths vote of all senators is required to adopt the motion all motions to waive all such points of order against the pending measure or motion are collectively debatable for more than one hour equally divided and controlled by the senate majority and minority leaders or their designees such motions are not amendable 31 each account generally includes similar programs projects or items such as research and development account or salaries and expenses account for small agencies single account may fund all of the agencys activities these acts typically provide lumpsum amount for each of these acc ounts few accounts include single program project or item which the appropriations acts fund individually httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34462g10g152g158g156g142g561g138g151g141g561g21g142g151
