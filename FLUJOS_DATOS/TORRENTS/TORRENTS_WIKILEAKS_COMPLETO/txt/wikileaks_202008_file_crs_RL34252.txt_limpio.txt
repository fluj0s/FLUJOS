access to foster care act of 2005 pl 109113 permits states to claim reimbursement under title ive of the social security act on behalf of otherwise eligible foster children whose maintenance payments are provided to foster parents or institutional foster care providers via forprofit foster care placement agency prior law stipulated that if state sought to claim federal title ive support on behalf of an otherwise eligible foster child the childs maintenance payments could only be made by public or nonprofit agency noting that the use of forprofit foster care placement agencies is limited the congressional budget office cbo estimated this change would have an insignificant effect on federal foster care spending the change was effective with the date of the laws enactment november 22 20052 violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act of 2005 the violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act pl 109162 reauthorized funding for the court

prospective volunteers from the federal bureau of investigation fbi and stipulates that any casa program that makes such request is required to pay the reasonable costs associated with the check finally with regard to casa pl 109162 prohibits use of federal funds provided under the casa program for lobbying and requires the inspector general of the department of justice to prepare report that looks at the types of activities funded by the 2 congressional budget office cbo s 1894 fair access to foster care act of 2005 as cleared by congress on november 9 2005 3 for additional information

fy2007fy2011 for grants to the american prosecutors research institute apri to improve prosecution of child abuse cases more specifically apri is expected to use these funds to provide technical assistance and training to attorneys and other individuals who prosecute child abuse cases in state or federal courts although pl 109162 references program authority previously provided in statute for this kind of training and technical assistance section 214a of the victims of child abuse act it did not amend that prior law which expired with fy2005 and had authorized annual funding of 5 million with mention of apri however congress has continued to provide funding for this purpose under that expired funding authority and these funds are administered by the department of justice in fy2007 just over 2 million was appropriated5 grants related to childrens exposure to domestic violence section 303 of pl 109162 amended the violence against women act to add authority for four competitive grant programs related broadly to services education protection and justice for young victims of violence just one of these grant programs is discussed in this report because it specifically requires child welfare agency involvement in administering any grant funding under this grant program the department of health and human services hhs specifically the family and youth services bureau fysb is

domestic violence are present to be eligible to receive this grant an entity must be collaborative partnership that includes child welfare agency an agency serving victims of domestic violence or dating violence and law enforcement agency it may also include courts and other relevant social service providers funding for this single grant program was authorized at 5 million for each of fy2007fy2011 however specific funding was provided for this grant program in fy2007 4 for more information on casa see crs report rl32976 child welfare programs authorized by the victims of child abuse act of 1990 by emilie stoltzfus 5 this training and technical assistance funding is typically provided alongside funding for the childrens advocacy centers cac program funding authority for that program also expired with fy2005 but it has continued to receive appropriations for more information on the cac and the related training and technical assistance see crs report rl32976 child welfare programs authorized by the victims of child abuse act of 1990 by emilie stoltzfus crs4 deficit reduction act of 2005 an omnibus budget reconciliation measure the deficit reduction act dra pl 109171 title vii subtitle d made legislative changes intended to clarify which children are eligible for federal foster care and adoption assistance support under title ive of the social security act it also placed certain limitations on the ability of states to make claims for federal reimbursement of the costs of administering their title ive foster care programs including limits on the length of time child may be considered candidate for foster care and new rules or restrictions on administrative claims related to foster children placed in unlicensed relative homes or other settings that are ineligible under the federal foster care program separately the legislation raised the mandatory funding authorization for the promoting safe and stable families program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act it further amended both the child welfare services title ivb subpart 1 and the court improvement section 438 of the social security act programs to require both ongoing and meaningful collaboration between courts and child welfare agencies further it amended the court improvement program to authorize two new grants related to data collection and training which are intended to improve court handling of child welfare proceedings the law appropriated 100 million 20 million in each of fy2006fy2010 for those grants finally the dra amended the foster care and adoption assistance plan requirements under title iv of the social security act to assert that the programs confidentiality provisions are not intended to limit states flexibility in determining public access to child abuse and neglect proceedings provided that at minimum states policy on this issue ensured the safety and wellbeing of the child parents and family6 for more detailed information on the child welfare provisions of the deficit reduction act which are included in title vii subtitle d of that act see crs report rl33155 child welfare foster care and adoption assistance provisions in budget reconciliation and crs report rl33350 child welfare the court improvement program both by emilie stoltzfus 6 the dra also made changes to the medicaid statute title xix of the social security act that were intended to clarify when state child welfare agencies could use medicaids targeted case management tcm option to provide certain services for children in foster care as of november 2007 the administration had not yet issued the required regulations to implement those provisions crs5 safe and timely interstate placement act of 2006 pl 109239 amended title ivb and title ive of the social security act to encourage the expedited placement of foster children into safe and permanent homes across state lines and made several additional changes to child welfare policy under those parts of the law timely interstate placement procedures and incentives the law establishes federal 60day deadline for completing an interstate home study necessary to determine the suitability and safety of the home and 14day deadline for state that requests this interstate home study to act on the information in the study for any home study begun before october 1 2008 states may have up to 75 days to complete the study if they can document certain circumstances beyond their control that prevented its completion within 60 days the new law also authorizes 10 million in each of fy2007fy2010 for incentive payments valued at 1500 each to states for every interstate home study that is completed in 30 days funds were appropriated for these payments in fy2007 pl 109239 also prohibits states from restricting the ability of state agency to contract with private agency to conduct interstate home studies further for children who will not be reunited with their parents pl 109239 encourages or in some cases requires identification and consideration of both instate and outofstate placement options as part of currently required case review and planning activities for children in foster care other changes separately the bill requires courts as condition of receiving certain funding intended to improve their handling of child welfare proceedings to notify any foster parent preadoptive parent or relative caregiver of foster child of any proceedings to be held regarding the child and emphasizes the right of these individuals to be heard at permanency planning proceedings finally the law strengthens language requiring the child welfare agency to maintain and update complete health and education record for each child in foster care and requires that youth leaving foster care custody because they have reached the age of majority typically at 18 years of age must be given free copy of their health and education record7 7 for more information see us department of health and human services hhs administration for children and families acf new legislation the safe and timely interstate placement of foster children act of 2006 august 11 2006 available online at httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscblaws_policiespolicyimim0603pdf crs6 adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 an omnibus measure the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 pl 109248 includes additional federal requirements related to criminal background checks of prospective foster and adoptive parents and newly requires states to check child abuse and neglect registries for information about prospective foster or adoptive parents section 1528 the law also requires the establishment of national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect section 633 criminal records checks state procedures for criminal records checks of prospective foster and adoptive parents must now include check of national crime databases ie an fbi check and must be done before the placement of any foster child can be finally approved with prospective foster or adoptive parents under prior law the kind of criminal record check for example state vs fbi vs local was not specified and the federal requirement for these checks extended only to children for whom state intended to make federal foster care or adoption assistance claims under title ive of the social security act as under prior law except in those states opting out of the requirements see discussion below if criminal record check reveals certain felony convictions of prospective foster or adoptive parent state may not claim title iv foster care or adoption assistance for child placed in his or her home however this does not absolutely prohibit the state child welfare agency from placing foster child in the home of such prospective foster or adoptive parent if the agency nonetheless determines that the home is safe for the child at the same time use of this placement by the agency disqualifies the child for title ive and the agency may not then seek federal reimbursement of the otherwise eligible costs it incurs on the foster or adoptive childs behalf9 for most states these criminal record check requirements became effective with the first day of fy2007 however prior law allowed states to opt out of the federal criminal records check procedures and pl 109248 permits those opt out states to have until the first day of fy2009 to come into compliance with the prior law as well as the new requirements these states are idaho oklahoma oregon california 8 for more information see us department of health and human services hhs administration for children and families acf new legislation the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 september 1 2006 available online at httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscblaws_policiespolicyimim0604pdf 9 section 471a20a effectively prohibits state from receiving federal title ive foster care or adoption assistance support on behalf of an otherwise eligible child who after the enactment of the adoption and safe families act of 1997 pl 10589 is placed in the home of foster or adoptive parent where record check shows that the prospective foster or adoptive parent was at any time convicted of felony child abuse or neglect spousal abuse crime involving children including child pornography or crime involving violence including rape sexual assault or homicide but not including other physical assault or battery or if the record check shows felony conviction for physical assault battery or drugrelated offense that was committed in the last five years crs7 new york massachusetts ohio and arizona 10 further any state may be granted limited additional time to meet the new requirements if hhs determines that state legislation is needed to permit the state to comply with the new federal rules child abuse and neglect registry checks many child abuse and neglect cases are not the subject of criminal court proceedings and information on the perpetrators is therefore unlikely to appear in criminal records check however this data may be included in state child abuse and neglect registry as of the first day of fy2007 pl 109248 requires all states to check any child abuse and neglect registry they maintain for information about prospective foster or adoptive parent and any adult living in their household the check must be made before approving placement of foster child in the home and without regard to whether the state plans to claim title ive support for the child states must also request and all states must comply with such requests information from any other states child abuse and neglect registry where the prospective foster or adoptive parent or other adult has lived in the past five years there are federal stipulations about how states must use the information from these registries national registry of substantiated child abuse and neglect finally pl 109248 requires hhs in consultation with the justice department to create national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse or neglect information in this national registry is to be accessible only to federal state tribal or local government entity or an agent of such public entity that needs the information to carry out its responsibilities under law to protect children from child abuse and neglect separately the law requires hhs to conduct study on the feasibility of establishing data collection standards for national child abuse and neglect registry and to make recommendations and findings on 1 the costs and benefits of such data collection standards 2 data collection standards currently employed by states tribes or other political subdivisions and 3 data collection standards that should be considered to establish model of promising practices11 the law authorized total funding of 500000 for fy2006 and fy2007 to carry out the study and required that report of this study be submitted to congress by the end of july 200712 however funds were appropriated under this authority 10 these states were identified by hhs as the optout states in july 2006 pl 109248 eliminated the ability of any additional states to opt out of the prior law provisions 11 nearly all states have child abuse and neglect registry but the information included and access to this information varies for more information see us department of health and human services child welfare information gateway establishment and maintenance of central registries for child abuse reports current through august 2005 available online at httpwwwchildwelfaregovsystemwidelaws_policiesstatutescentregallpdf 12 section 633g of pl 109248 provides that this report was to be submitted to the judiciary committees in both the house and senate and to the senate health education labor and pensions committee and the house education and workforce committee the law further stipulated that the report was to be submitted to these committees by the continued crs8 the acting head of the hhs administration for children and families acf stated in july 27 2007 letter that completion of the feasibility study and careful consideration of its conclusions should be undertaken before establishing the national registry he further noted that in responding to constituent inquiries concerning the registry hhs acknowledges that work on the national registry cannot begin because funds are not available for the feasibility study13 child and family services improvement act of 2006 the child and family services improvement act of 2006 pl 109288 amended andor reauthorized the child welfare services promoting safe and stable families court improvement and mentoring children of prisoners programs all authorized under title ivb of the social security act and made one amendment to the section of title ive of the social security act that defines the case review procedures required for each child in foster care promoting safe and stable families amendments the promoting safe and stable families program pssf title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act primarily authorizes formula grants to all states for provision of family support family preservation timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support services pl 109288 extended through fy2011 the programs annual funding authorization of 545 milliontitle ivb subpart 2 program funding however has never reached the full authorization in fy2007 the pssf program received 434 million targeted funding for each of fy2006fy2011 pl 109288 targets less than 40 million of this pssf funding for two specific purposes to support monthly caseworker visits to children in foster care and to improve outcomes for children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abuse from this sixyear funding setaside of 240 million the law stipulates that total of 95 million is to be distributed to all states by formula to support monthly caseworker visits with children in foster care and 145 million is to be made available as competitive grants to regional partnerships which must in nearly all cases include public child welfare agency that provide services and activities to improve the outcomes of children affected by parentscaretakers abuse of methamphetamine or other substances in late september 2007 hhs announced 53 grantees in 28 states who are each 12 continued department of homeland security dhs however as the same section of the law requires hhs to make the study and related recommendations this reference to dhs appears to be drafting error 13 copy of letter from daniel schneider acting assistant secretary for children and families acf hhs to senator dianne feinstein july 27 2007 provided to crs by the hhs office of assistant secretary for legislation human services crs9 expected to receive total funding under this grant program of between 15 million and 37 million across grant periods ranging from three to five years14 increased funding to tribes in addition the law increased the funding setaside from the pssf program for tribal child and family services tribal funding under this program grew from roughly 5 million in fy2006 to about 12 million in fy2007 further in fy2006 roughly 80 tribes had access to the pssf funds for child and family services as compared to more than 130 tribes in fy2007 other changes pl 109288 also amended the pssf program to require states to report on their actual use of funds under title ivb of the social security act and it requires hhs to annually submit report to congress on these state expenditures under prior law states reported planned expenditures only and these data have not been readily available to congress finally the law limits administrative spending under the pssf program both federal and statelocal dollars to more than 10 of funds spent by the state child welfare services amendments pl 109288 made amendments to the child welfare services program cws title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act which authorizes formula grants to states to develop broad range of child welfare services and activities the cws program was first authorized in 1935 significant amendments had not been made to it in more than decade funding authority under prior law the cws program had permanent funding authorization meaning it never needed funding reauthorization15 the 2006 amendments reorganized certain provisions in the program and limited funding authority for the program to fy2007fy2011 this places the program on the same reauthorization cycle as the pssf program pl 109288 did not change the funding authority for this program which was set at 325 million beginning with fy1990 however funding for this program has never reached this full authorization level in fy2007 the program received 287 million program purposes pl 109288 emphasized that cws funds are provided to assist states in developing and expanding child and family services that use communitybased agencies new purposes section further adds that these services should protect and promote the welfare of all children prevent neglect 14 the list of grantees is provided under the heading targeted grants to increase the well being of and improve the permanency outcomes for children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abuse in fy2007 childrens bureau discretionary grant awards available at httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscbprograms_fund discretionary2007htm 15 permanent funding authority means that the program is authorized to receive appropriations every year on permanent basis by contrast many social service programs have timelimited funding authority eg funds are authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2007fy2011 and this typically prompts congress to consider reauthorization legislation just ahead of the funding expiration crs10 abuse or exploitation of children support atrisk families to allow children to remain safely in their own homes or to return home in timely manner to promote the safety permanence and wellbeing of children in foster care and adoptive families and to provide training professional development and support to ensure wellqualified child welfare workforce with the exception of the attention to communitybased agencies and the mention of staff training support these purposes are largely in keeping with the prior law definition of child welfare services that previously defined how states could use funds provided under this program new requirements pl 109288 also included several new state plan requirements states as of september 28 2007 are required to have procedures to respond to and maintain child welfare services in the wake of disaster and must also describe in their state plan how they consult with medical professionals to assess the health of and provide medical treatment to children in foster care further states were required to establish as of october 1 2007 standards for the content and frequency of caseworker visits of children in foster care those standards must at minimum ensure that the children are visited on monthly basis and that the caseworker visits are wellplanned and focused on issues pertinent to case planning and service delivery receipt and use of funds restrictions for any state to receive funding under the cws program in fy2008 pl 109288 specifies that it must provide data to hhs showing the percentage of children in foster care that were visited on monthly basis by the caseworker handling the childs placement and the percentage of those visits that occurred where the child lived further on the basis of this data hhs and each state must develop plan to ensure that later than october 1 2011 at least 90 of children in the states foster care caseload are visited monthly and that the majority of the visits occur where the child lives states failing to make the planned progress toward this goal will be required to spend more of their own ie state or local or both funds in order to receive their full allotment of cws funding pl 109288 made number of additional changes related to the use of cws funds beginning with fy2008 the law limits the use of program funds both federal and statelocal for administrative purposes to more than 10 also beginning with fy2008 the law prohibits any use of federal cws funds for adoption assistance payments or child care above the amount of federal cws funds spent for those purposes in fy2005 and it prohibits the use of both federal and statelocal cws funds for foster care maintenance payments above the amount of those funds spent for foster care maintenance payments in fy2005 other program amendments pl 109288 extended for five years fy2007fy2011 grants to eligible state highest courts to assess and improve their handling of child welfare proceedings under the court improvement program16 it reauthorized the mentoring children 16 funds for this court improvement grant are set aside from the total funding provided for the pssf program and are in addition to the funds approved for two other court continued crs11 of prisoners program for those same five years authorizing funding of such sums as may be necessary and provided new authority for hhs to support demonstration of the effectiveness of vouchers as way to improve the delivery of and access to mentoring services for children of prisoners finally pl 109288 amended the case review procedures included in title ive of the social security act to require that the court or courtapproved administrative body conducting required permanency hearing for child in foster care to consult with the child in an ageappropriate manner regarding the proposed plan to find permanent home for the child or to help the child transition to independent living for more information about the changes made by pl 109288 to promoting safe and stable families child welfare services and other programs see crs report rl33354 the promoting safe and stable families program reauthorization in the 109th congress by emilie stoltzfus tax relief and health care act of 2006 an omnibus measure the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109 432 made several changes to provisions that were enacted in the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 that affect children in foster care specifically section 6036 of the dra requires most individuals to submit certain forms of citizenship or nationality documentation in order to be eligible for medicaid pl 109432 section 405c however exempts all foster children without regard to title ive eligibility from this requirement the change was made effective as if it was included in the dra separately pl 109432 amended title ive of the social security act to require states to have in effect procedures for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of each child in foster care whether or not the state claims title ive support for the child17 finally this law amended section 1123a of the social security act to specifically require that state compliance with this new federal requirement be checked as part of periodic conformity reviews eg the child and family services review these changes were effective as of june 20 2007 six months after the enactment of pl 109432 16 continued improvement grant programs that were provided in the dra as discussed earlier in the report 17 the law does not specify what states must do with this information current law prohibits states from claiming title ive support for certain noncitizen children there are prohibitions on states serving noncitizen children with state dollars for more information see section 71 and section 84b of the child welfare policy manual available online at httpwwwacfhhsgovj2eeprogramscblaws_policieslawscwpmindexjsp for
