over the last ten years see figure 1 although some of the increase in trade could be attributable to nafta there are other variables that affect trade such as exchange rates and economic conditions

source us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis the sharp rise in us investment in mexico since nafta implementation is also result of the liberalization of mexicos restrictions on foreign investment in the late 1980s and the early 1990s prior to th mid1980s mexico had very protective policy that restricted foreign investment and controlled the exchange rate to encourage domestic growth affecting the tire industrial sector mexicos trade liberalization measures and economic reform in the late 1980s represented sharp shift in policy and helped bring in st eady increase of fdi flows into mexico nafta provisions on foreign investment help ed to lock in the reforms and increase investor confidence under nafta mexi co gave us and canadian investors nondiscriminatory treatment of their investments in mexico as well as investor protection nafta may have encouraged u s fdi in mexico by increasing investor confidence but much of the growth may have occurred anyway because mexico likely would have continued to liberalize its foreign inves tment laws with or without naftahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32934crs8 8 federal reserve bank of dallas the binational importance of the maquiladora industry southwest economy issue 6 novemberdecember 1999 9 mexicos exportoriented industries began with the maquiladora program established in the 1960s by the mexican government which allowed foreignowned businesses to set up assembly plants in mexico to produce for xport maquiladoras could import intermediate materials dutyfree with the condition that 20 of the final product be exported the percentage of sales allowed to the domestic market increased over time as mexico liberalized its trade regime us tariff treatment of maquiladora imports played significant role in the industr under hts provisions 98020 060 and 98 020080 the portion of an imported good that was of usorigin entered the united states dutyfree duties were assessed only on the value added ab road after nafta north american rules of origin determine dutyfree status rece nt changes in mexican regulations on export oriented industries merged the maquiladora industry and mexican domestic assemblyfor export plants into one program called the maquiladora manufacturing industry and export services immex 10 data from mexicos instituto nacional estadística geografía informática inegi provided by global insight inc at the lix maquiladora industry outlook meeting on june 8 2007 in paso texasnearly half of total fdi investment in mexico is in the manufacturing industry of which the maquiladora industry forms major part see section on mexicos exportoriented assembly plants below mexicos maquiladora industry is important to the economic re lationship of the united stat and mexico in several ways in mexico the industry has helped attract investment from countries such as the united states that have relatively rge amount of capital therefore mexico is able to attract some of the foreign direct investment it was seeking when it liberalized trade and inves tment barriers for the united states the industry is important because us companies are able to locate their laborintensive operations in mexico and lower their labor costs in the overall producti on process many economists believe that maquiladoras are an important part of u s corporate strategy in achieving competitively priced goods in the world marketplace8 other analysts are concerned that the industry has caused us companies to move their manufacturing facilities to mexico at the expense of us workers mexicos exportorien ted assembly plants9 mexicos exportoriented assembly plan ts are closely linked to usmexico trade in various laborintensive industries such as auto parts and electronic goods these exportoriented plants generate rge amount of trade with the united states and majority of the plants have us parent companies fo reignowned assembly plants commonly called maquiladoras account for substantial share of mexicos imports and about half of its exports the larges t maquiladora operation delphi automotive systems headquartered in the united states has 51 plants with 66000 employees in

operations help us companies remain competitive in the world marketplace by producing goods at competitive prices in addition the proximity of mexi co to the united states allows production to have high degree of us content in the final product whic h could help sustain jobs in the united states critics of these types of operations argue that they have negative effect on the economy because they take jobs from the united states and help depress the wages of lowskilled us workers after nafta mexicos regulations governing the maquiladora industry changed significantly beginning in 2001 the north american rules of origin determined the dutyfree status for given import and replace the previous special tariff provisions that applied only to maquiladora operations the initial program ceased to exist and the same trade rules applied to all assembly operations in mexico and not just those in the maquiladora program12 nafta rules for the maquiladora industry were implemented in two phases with the firs t phase covering the period 19942000 and the second phase starting in 2001 during the initial phase nafta regulations continued to llow the maquiladora industry to import products dutyfree into mexico regardless of the country of origin of the products this phase also allowed maquiladora operations to increase maquiladora sales into the domestic market phase ii made significant change to the industry in that the new north american rules of origin determined duty free status for us and canadian products exported to mexico for maquiladoras the elimination of dutyfree imports by maquiladoras from nonnafta countries under nafta caused some initial uncertainty for the companies with maquiladora operations maquiladoras that were importing from third countries such as japan or china would have to pay applicable tariffs on those goods under the new rules mexico had another program for export oriented assembly plants called the program for temporary imports to promot exports pitex that was established in 1990 to allow qualifying domestic pr oducers to compete with maquiladoras pitex plants are usually in areas located in central and southern mexico while maquiladoras are more common in states along the usmexico border in recent years the differences in the customs status of maquiladoras and pitex plants diminished and the mexican government decided to merge the two exportoriented programs in 2007 the mexican government announced new set of regulations on exportoriented industries these new rules merge the maquiladora industry and pitex plants into the maquiladora manuf acturing industry and export services or immex in 2008 maquiladora industry data will be in cluded in mexican manufacturing reports without di stinction for maquiladora plants13

production to the us market the maquiladora industry expanded rapidl in the 1990s the number of plants grew from 1920 at the end of 1990 to 3590 in 2000 after 2000 the number of maquiladoras fell to 2860 in 2003 since 2004 the number of plants has stayed at approximately the same levels totaling 2819 in 200714 some observers believe that the correlation in maquiladora growth afte r 1993 is directly due to nafta but in reality it is combination of factors that has contributed to growth in this sector trade liberalization wages and economic conditions both in the united states and mexico have all contributed to the grow th of mexican exportoriented assembly plants although some provisions in nafta may have encouraged maquiladora growth in certain sectors maquiladora activity is more influenced by the strength of the us economy and relative wages in mexico maquilador operations usually increase during periods of economic expa nsion in the united states drop in mexican wages may also be an incentive for us companies to shift production to mexico between 1993 and 1996 relative wages in xico fell considerably due to the peso devaluation since 1997 however xican labor costs have risen and some manufacturers have closed their mexican pl ants and shifted production to other low wage countries in 2001 maquiladora employme nt levels fell for the first time since 1982 between 2000 and 2004 maquiladora employment levels fell from 130 million workers to 112 million workers pproximately 176000 jobs were lost and 780 plants were shut down nationwide durin g this time since 2004

of high growth in january 2008 remittances to mexico were down nearly 6 the biggest drop in 13 years18 the decline in the level of remittances is due to combination of factors the slowdown in the us economy the weakening job ma rket in the construction sector tighter border controls and increased antiimmigration sentiment in the united states may all be factors in the reduced number of seasonal migrants in the united states and their ability to send remittances to mexico19 worker remittance flows to mexico have an important impact on the mexican economy in some regions more th an others some studies on rem ittance flows to mexico report that in southern mexican states remittances mostly or completely cover general consumption ndor housing one study estimates that 80 of the money received

ons that nafta has achieved many of the intended trade and economic benefits as well as incurred adjustment costs this has been in keeping with what most econo mists maintain that trade liberalization promotes overall economic growth among trading partners but that there are significant adjustment costs most of the trade effects in the united states related to nafta are due to changes in us trade and investment patterns with mexico at the time of nafta implementation the uscanada free trade agreement already had been in effect for five years and some industries in th united states and canada were already highly integrated mexico on the othe r hand had followed an aggressive import substitution policy for many years prior to nafta in which it had sought to develop certain domestic industries through trade protection one example is the mexican automotive industry which had been regulated by series of five decrees issued by the mexican government between 1962 nd 1989 the decrees established import tariffs as high as 25 on automotive goods and had high restrictions on foreign auto production in mexico under nafta mexico agreed to eliminate these restrictive trade policies not all changes in trade and investment patterns between the united states and mexico since 1994 can be attributed to naf ta because trade was also affected by other unrelated economic factors such as economic growth in the united states and mexico and currency fluctuations als traderelated job ga ins and losses since nafta may have accelerated trends that were ongoing prior to nafta and may not be totally attributable to the trade agreem ent overall mexico has experienced slight shift in the composition of trade with the united states since the late 1980s from oil to nonoil exports in 1987 crude oil and natural gas comprised 17 of mexicos exports to the united states th percentage of oil and natural gas exports had declined to 106 in 2004 but increas ed to 144 in 2007 due to higher oil prices effects on the us economy the overall effect of nafta on the u s economy has been relatively small primarily because twoway tr ade with mexico amounts to less than three percent of us gdp thus any changes in trade pa tterns with mexico would not be expected to be significant in relati on to the overall us economy in some sectors however traderelated effects could be more significan t especially in those industries that were more exposed to the removal of tariff and nontariff trade barriers such as the textile and apparel and au tomotive industries since nafta the automotive

removal of many nontariff ba rriers to trade including rules of origin provisions enhanced protection of in tellectual property rights less restrictive government procurement practices and the elimination of performance requirements on investors from other nafta countries these provi sions may have accelerated the ongoing trade patterns between the united states and mexico because the united states and canada were already highly integrate d most of the trade impacts on the us automotive industry relate to trade liber alization with mexico prior to nafta mexico had series of government decrees protecting the domestic auto sector by reserving the domestic automobile market for domestically produced parts and vehicles nafta established the removal of mexicos restrictive trade and investment policies and the elimination of us tariffs on autos and auto parts by 2006 the automotive industry has had the high est dollar increase 41 billion in total us trade with mexico

and apparel produc ts to benefit from the free trade provision goods were required to meet the rules of origin pr ovision which assured that apparel products that were traded among the three nafta partners were made of yarn and fabric made within the free trade area the strict rules of origin provisions were meant to ensure that us textiles producer s would continue to supply us apparel companies that moved to mexico without rules of origin provision apparel companies w ould have been able to im port lowcost fabrics from countries such as china and export the fi nal product to the united states under the free trade provision42 while some us industr ies may have benefitted from increased demand for us products in mexico creating new jobs other industries have experienced job losses data on the effects of trade liberalization with mexico are limited and the effect on specific sectors of the us econom is difficult to quan tify traderelated job gains and losses since nafta may have accelerated trends that were ongoing prior to nafta and may not be totally attributable to the trade agreement43 quantifying these effects is challenging because of the other economic factors that influence trade and employment levels the devaluation of the mexican peso in 1995 resulted in lower mexican wages wh ich likely provided an incentive for us companies to move to lower their produc tion costs traderelated employment effects following nafta could have also resulted from the lowering of trade barriers and from the economic conditions in mexico and the united states

negative growth in mexico after nafta and that some of the benefits mexico experienced after nafta really began in the late 1980s when mexico began trade liberalization measures overall the study finds that nafta has brought economic and social benefits to the mexican economy but that the agreement does not suffice to ensure economic convergence in north america45 it is challenging to isolate the economic effects of nafta from other economic or political factors for example mexico has experienced at least two major events outside of nafta that had economic cons equences mexicos unilateral trade liberalization measures between 1985 and 1988 and the currency crisis of 1995 both affected economic growth per capita gdp and real wages in mexico other challenges in evaluating the effects of nafta on the us and mexican economies relate to the time element or being able to compare sufficiently long timeframes to separate trends befo re and after the agreement went into effect and across countries to provide relative measures of any observed effects46 the world bank study on nafta found that the benefits of nafta and of trade in general have been unequal acro ss regions and sectors in

security labor mobility or corporate taxation53 if the united states continues to deepen economic integration with mexico one area that may need more attention is the issue of the difference in income levels between the two countries the economic relationship with mexico is unique because of mexicos proximity to the unite d states but also because of the wide differences in levels of economic
