misadventures that can befall coworkers dianetic assist actions are given in section eight class v new era dianetics auditor is required to deliver any of these assists dianetic assists are often needed in order to bring about fullrecovery on case one would do well to become qualified to deliver these assists the advanced assist actions in section nine are run on an emeter these actions address such things as postulates to get injured or get ill prior confusions mystery about the illness or injuryand number of other factors that should be handled on any person who is receiving an

an important feature to help you locate what assist processes should be used in any given situation the final section contains six comprehensive tables which list the processesapplicable to specific

alleviate the immediate spiritual effects of illness injury orupset so that the person can then put his attention on progress up the bridge to total freedom use of the emeter the large majority of assist processes in this handbook can be run without the use of an emeter and with formal auditor training there are restrictions on scientologists using assisttechnology the processes which do require an emeter and trained auditor are those given insection six section eight and section nine ideally one should be trained to use an emeter and use it in delivering assists end phenomena every assist process is run to its end phenomena the definition of end phenomena is those indication in the pc and meter which show that chain or process is ended the end phenomena of an assist process is generally cognition and very good indicators preclear happy this applies to all assists in this volume except where otherwise specified in theinstructions one such exception is postulate processing contained in section three which is run until the postulate is located and the preclear has very good indicators auditors trained in the use of an emeter have additional data on end phenomena that they apply when they audit in assist auditing the auditor sets out to accomplish specific result for the preclear such as helping to relieve the sniffles or speed recovery from leg injury the auditor must realize that an injured person who is under heavy emotional or physical stress may not have rave indicators in thefirst assist session in such case simple expression of relief would be the end phenomena it is not uncommon to have to give person assists day after day in order to bring about full recovery one must carry on through with assist processes until that full result is achievedbasic guidelines in doing assists 1 the basic rule of an assist is to do it get it done 2 always seek first aid and medical attention when needed an assist is not substitute for medical attention or treatment by qualified doctor first call the doctor then assist the person as you can 3 inform the person of the fact that the assist has begun with start of assist and ended with end of assist an assist like an auditing session has beginning and an end if needed give short explanation of what is meant by assist 4 always follow the auditors code 5 dont get discouraged if you dont get full recovery of the person with single assist session keep at it until you do get result 6 never promise person you will cure some illness or physical condition assists are not medical treatment an assist helps the person heal himself 7 never force preclear who is injured or ill they require much lighter auditing than they stand up to when well 8 in handling an ill or injured person keep the sessions short where possible 9 above all use the assists in this book good understanding of these assist processes and real familiarity with how to use this handbook will enable you to bring about some astonishing results you will discover vast rewards in the ability to easily alleviate discomfort and travail in those around you you could even accomplish miracles hubbard communications office saint

done as usual whenever needed by preclears medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed and wheretreatment is routinely successful medical treatment should be obtained as an assist can at times cover up an actual injury or broken bone chances should be taken especially if the condition does not easily respond in other words where something is merely thought to be aslight sprain to be on the safe side an xray should be obtained particularly if it does not atonce respond an assist is not substitute for medical treatment but is complementary to it it is even doubtful if full healing can be accomplished by medical treatment alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds recovery in short one should realize that physicalhealing does not take into account the being and the repercussion on the spiritual beingness of the personinjury and illness are predisposed by the spiritual state of the person they are precipitated by the being himself äs manifestation of his current spiritual condition and they are prolonged by any failure to fully handle the spiritual factorsassociated with them the causes of predisposition precipitation and prolongation are basically the following 1 postulates 2 engrams3 secondaries 4 arc breaks with the environment situations others or the body part 5 problems6 overt acts 7 withholds 8 out of communicationness the purely physical facts of injuries illnesses and stresses are themselves incapacitating and do themselves often require physical analysis and treatment by doctor or nutritionist these could be briefly cataloged äs

vitamin and biocompound deficienciesi mineral excesses j mineral deficiencies k structural malfunction l erroneous examination merroneous diagnosisn erroneous structural treatment 0 erroneous medication there is another group which belongs to both the spiritual and physical divisions these are i allergies ii addictionsiiihabits ivneglect v decay any of these things in any of the three groups can be cause of nonoptimum personal existence we are not discussing here the füll handling of any of these groups or what optimum state can be attained or maintained but it should be obvious that there is level below which life is not verytolerable how well person can be or how efficient or how active isanother subject entirelyoiycertainly life is not very tolerable to person who has been injured or ill to woman who has just delivered baby to person who has just suffered heavy emotional shock and there is reason personshould remain in such low state particularly for weeks months or years when he or she could be remarkably assisted to recover in hours days or weeks it is in fact sort of practiced cruelty to insist by neglect that person continue on in such state when one can learn and practice and obtain relief for such person we are mainly concerned with the first group 18 the group is not listed in the order that it is done but in the order that it has influence upon the being the idea has grown that one handles injuries with touch assists only this is true for someone who äs an auditor has only smattering of scientology it is true for someone in such pain or state of case whichwould have to be pretty bad that he cannot respond to actual auditing but scientologist really has business having only smattering of auditing skills that could save his or the lives of others and the case isvery rare who cannot experience proper auditing the actual cause of not handling such conditions is then to be found äs iv neglect and where there is neglect v decay is very likely to follow one does not have to be medical doctor to take someone to medical doctor and one does not have to be medical doctor to observe that medical treatment may not be helping the patient and one does not have to be medical doctor to handle things caused spiritually by thebeing himself just äs there are two sides to healingthe spiritual and the structural or physicalthere are also two states that can be spiritually attained thefirst of these states might be classified äs humanly tolerable assists come under this heading the second is spiritually improved grade auditing comes under this second headingassi st summ oryany minister and this has been true äs long äs there has been subject called religion is bound to relieve his fellow being of anguishthere are many ways minister can do this an assist is not engaging in healing it is certainly not engaging in treatment what it is doing is assisting the individual to healhimself or be healed by another agency by removing hisreasons for precipitating and prolonging his condition andlessening his predisposition to further injure himself or remain in an intolerable condition this is entirely outeide the field of healing äs envisioned by the medical doctor and by actual records of results is very very far beyondthe capability of psychology psychiatry and mental treatment äspracticed by them in short the assist is strictiy and entirely in the field of the spirit and is the traditional province of religion minister should realize the power which lies in his hands and his potential skills when trained he has this to give in the presence of suffering he can make life tolerable he can also shorten term of recoveryand may even make recovery possible when it might not be otherwise when minister confronts someone who has been injured or ill operated upon or who has suffered grave emotional shock he should beequipped to do and should do the following contact assist where possible and where indicated

good trs good metering sessions are all that should be tolerated in assistsarysummary religion exists in small part to handle the upsets and anguish of life these include spiritual duress by reason of physical conditions ministers long before the apostles had äs part of their duties the ministering to the spiritual anguish of their people they have concentrated upon spiritual uplift and betterment but where physicalsuffering impeded this course they have acted to devote themselves only to the alleviation of physical duress is of course to attest that the physical body is more important than the spiritual beingness of theperson which of course it is not but physical anguish can so distract being that he deserts any aspirations of betterment and begins to seek some cessation of his suffering the specialty of the medical doctor is thecuring of physical disease or nonoptimum physical conditions in some instances he can do so it is invasion of his province to assist the patient to greater healing potential and ills that are solely spiritual innature are not medical the psychiatrist and psychologist on the other hand took their very names from religion since psyche means soul they by actualstatistics are not äs successfui äs priests in relieving mental anguish but they modernly seek to do so by using drugs or hypnotism or physical means they damage more than they help the minister has responsibility to his people and those about him to relieve suffering he has many ways to do this he is quite successfui in doing so and he does not need or use drugs or hypnotism or shock orsurgery or violence until his people are at level where they have need of physical things he has äs duty preventing their spiritual or physical decay by relieving where he can their suffering his primary method of doing so is the assistassist summoryas the knowledge of how to do them exists and äs the skill is easily acquired he actually has right to neglect those for whose wellbeing he i s responsible äs only then can he lead them to higher levels of spiritual attainment an auditor has it in his power to make pcs recover spectacularly that power is in direct proportion to his flawlessness äs an auditor only the most exact and proper tech will produce the desired result if you truly want to heip your fellows that exact skill and those results are very well worth having l ron hubbard founderoryhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 12 march 1969 issue ii physically ill pcs and preots with note on drugs one can very easily go to extremes on mental illness versus physical illness one school says all trouble comes from physical illness another says it all comes from mental illness the psychiatrist mixes the two and says all mental illness is physical it is time every auditor particularly class viiis took hard look at this area the body is capable of having physical illness acute momentary or chronic continual broken bones pinched nerves diseases can any ofthem occur to body inclependent of any mental or spiritual action the mind or spirit can predispose the illness or injury by this is meant person can be distraught and have an accident or decide to die and get disease but the disease or injury when hes got it is body circumstance and responds best to skilied medical ordinary usual put on tourniquet seta bone give shot treatment on sick or injured person you can reduce the time of healing or recovery by removing the spiritual or mental upset providing the person can be audited but usually after effective physical treatment the facts are real enough auditing person with broken leg after it is sei and he is comfortable to remove the engram of the accident or treatmentand the earlier reason he or she was distraught or had the accident can improve the bone knitting time by äs much äs twothirds by actual test this would be six weeks down to two wccks but the bone has to be set body is biological object it has all manner of internal communication systems and organizcd interrelated functionsphyskolly iii pcs and preotsnow if you tried to audit preclear when he was acutely ill you would find him hard to audit confused and distracted and unable tofollow commands he may become overwhelmed easily he certainly isnot likely to respond properly because the body is sending all sorts of pain or discomfort messages and confusions it is very much in his waytwo things are going on at the same timehis case äs spiritual beinghis body äs distracting pain or sensation object the pc assigns the body to his case or his case to his body you have to get the body out of the attention area to some degree before anything helpfui usually occurs by way of auditing now let us take the pc with longterm illness he has been sick with something since the age of 8 he really doesnt know hes sick physicallyhe blames it all on his own case in lot of cases we audit him and he has enough relief to then get physically well for he was mentally or spiritually suppressing his body these successes and they are numerous could cause us to do an all mental concentration and lead some to insist all illness was from the mind this makes some make the mistake of omitting physicalexamination and treatment in all cases certain schools of healing in thepast got the entire field in disrepute by assuming and stating and actingon just that when you find pc who does not easily respond whether he answers up to 7 cases physically ill or not you sure better get him to thenearest clinic for thorough physical examination including head andspine xrays and get him examined pathologically for you will usuallyfind he is physically ill in suppressed pain or discomfort there are curesfor lot of these things now and not requiring exploratory operationseither dont throw away all the grades of auditing on him hes sick physically thats why you do white form long history of accident and illness should prepare you to be alert and to send him to clinic if hisresponse to auditing is the least bit poorcally cs ond then when you have the physical side of it in hand audit him at assist level when he is well give him his grades dont force auditing into physical healing it works much of the time special types of auditing running out injuries etc assist healing markedly that doesnt mean you should avoid all medical treatment failed cases are medically ill or injured cases without exception so why fail there are medical doctors and clinics there are standard usual treatments you dont have to buy exploratories and questionableactions these are done only when the medical doctor cant find outeither when this impasse occurs start doing assists or look for engrams there are some bizarre or stränge postoperative after operation or postinjury after injury conditions which do surrender miraculously to auditing suppurating incision operation cut that remains open andunhealing bone that will not heal after having plate put on it suchthings usually surrender to auditing these facts should be used but theydo not contradict that medical treatment was needed in the first place the psychiatrist is an example of the other extreme to spiritual healing instead of all mind he is saying all physical holding either extreme produces failures the psychiatrist got into his all physical by sensing that insanity symptoms seemed to resemble persons in pain or delirium in these cases the stress of physical suffering is pouring back into and overwhelming the mind after considerable study on this i realized that an error could have been made out of statement all insanity is physicalphysicolly ilt pcs and preotsthis is probably the case in the large percentage of the insane but from this one cannot then say all mental trouble is physical because that can be demonstrated äs not true we see it äs easily äs in case of aperson falling ill on the receipt of bad news who then gets good news and gets well the great voltaire on his deathbed received news that he had been awarded the legion of honor after lifetime of being scorned byauthority he promptly got up put on his clothes and went down to receive the award in the case of insanity having physical causes one could discover this say it and be promptly misunderstood in this way the sufferer is in general agony from nerve long ago crushed this actual pain is distributed from its point of concentration to the whole of the nervous system the person cannot think looks dazed cannot work or act anoperation removes the pressure causing the condition the person is then sane in that he can perform the actions of life after few successes of this nature the psychiatrist leaps to the conclusion all mental trouble is physical he teaches some student saying all mental trouble is physical the student goes off tries to figure it out dreams up special insanity virus or genes or special illness called insanity he then resorts to all manner of odd and often brutal treatments by cutting or shocking nerve channel one can stop the painmessages but such actions lay in new complications which usually terminate in premature if not immediate death or injury this teils one why tranquilizers psychotropic drugs make patient rational or at least able to function for short while they too have their side effects usually all they do is like aspirin reduce the pain patients do not always know they hurt they suppress the pain or sensation it seems normal to them or life when they receive adistressing experience or have an accident they cease to suppress and may go insane which is to say become continuously overwhelmed by pain or unwanted sensation they cannot think or act rationally they may even be insane only during periods of the day or month that coincidewith the time of the accident but they are in physical distresscally s and ias they cannot eat or sieep their condition worsens by exhaustion and they may go into various states including deathlike motionlessnessor actually die the correct action on an insane patient is füll searching clinical examination by competent medicaldoctor he may find disease fractures concussion tumors or any common illness which has escaped treatment and has become chronic perpetual he should keep looking until he finds it for it is there notsome insane germ but some ordinary recognizable illness or physical malfunction the wrong thing is to cut nerves or subject the person to more pain electricity can force nerve channel to flow or paralyze it that is probably why it seems to work sometimes but it cures nothing and more often confirms the insane condition and certainly fills the patient with dread and terror injures him and shortens life the problem in insanity is often how do you keep the patient from injuring himself or starving or dying before he can be examined by competent medical doctor in properly equipped clinic this i s done by rest security feeding under drugs if necessary patient can be built up by various biochemical compounds diathermy and other mild means that add to his stamina treatment of what really troubles him such äs continual sensation from oncebroken leg which was never set broken spinal disc or suchpathological ills äs disease can then be treated properly and correctedphysically iii pcs and preotsrecovered from the treatment the patient will be found not to be insane any longer auditing can then occur any and all engrams traumas erased and the persons recovery will be greatly accelerated of course the real target of auditing is the improvement of the ability to handle life greater intelligence reaction time and other benefits like the spiritual healer of another age who said all was mind and forbade physical healing the practitioner who says all is body and scornsmental healing is an extremist each of these is at the opposite ends of aristotles pendulum each has seen with his own eyes few remarkable cures thus each is confirmed in his belief and will hotly argue and even attack others who do not share his or her extreme view the truth äs i s usually found lies in between there is insanity virus even heredity remains unproven since families perform similar actions are prone to similar physical ills and they also mentally pattern or copy each other eimer physical or mental facts can similarly prove that insanity runs in the family when it seems to doso thus hereditary insanity is an apparency which gives rise to the folk tale there is the spiritual identity of man the mind the thetan call it what you will there is the physical body of man and that even if cellular is still material or physical or whatever you call thateally cs and tsproponents of both extreme allnesses are likely then to go off on an erratic course of search and research äs the truth includes both and whenyou do include both you then begin to add up successes toward the desirable 100 of the physical sciences in result one cannot call either extreme more than an art and the proponent of the purely physical doesnot have science just because sciences are also physical one has science only when one can predict and attain uniform results by the application of its technology it was very natural for the psychiatrist to think he had foe in scientology äs all he had to hear was spirit and he was off since that has been his opposite foe for long time to heal man one has to realize he is dealing with two thingsthe spirit and the body when preclear comes to us because he wishes to be physically cured of real current illness or malfunction we do not serve him well if when we see he does not respond to auditing we do not require füll physical clinical study of his body until real illness is foundand treated if we already know he is ill we should call in the doctor and we should limit auditing to assists this is also case of crossed purposes we are trying to give him greater capability and freedom he is only trying to stop hurting go ahead sign them up but at the first smallest clue like the white form that he is being audited only to get well we should have in good contact medical doctor or clinic who is friendly and does not do unusualthings to people and get the preclear diagnosed to really find what is wrong with him get it cured if it is medically feasible and then with aphysically well pc give him his auditing if this is done routinely another benefit will also occur the preclear so audited will not again become ill easily and will retain his very real auditing gains when he has thesephysicolly 111 pcs and pre otswe are good enough to often get by the ability of the body to get well often asserts itself when preclear is given auditing since the source of perpetuation continuance is removed from the illness and it changes letting pc who has badly set continually painfui bone go on up the grades is doing him disservice he probably will not attain or retainhis gains the stable datum on which i operate äs case supervisor is that if pc does not get good gains quickly i want to know and will find what is physically injured or ill about him before i go on letting him be audited the xray machine and other clinical actions become must for he is insuppressed pain and each time he gets change he puts on füll stops äs it started to hurt he wont get the same gain again and tomorrow the same process or type of process wont work he stops the pain if it startsto hurt and puts new stop on his case this is true of those cases who really have physical illness slow gain poor result is physically ill pc the exercise of these points requires judgment for person can be given treatments which will not heal him where this is the case and thetreatment

grenade into the switchboard you may get more complaints but yousure dont have telephone anymore which i suppose is the basic way to stop all complaints nobody can ring up even if the house were on fire drugs such äs marijuana are craved only when the being needs them to stop undesirable physical pain or sensation then they backfirecausing more distress than they eure some pcs taken off marijuana for few weeks can be audited some cant those who then cant be audited are in pain whether they consciously realize it or not in theirunconscious mind below their selfsuppression they hurt so those who cant be audited well when taken off some drug like marijuana should be gotten to good clinic and given the works competent medical doctor will find the broken bone the disease thediabetes

july 1978 dianetic assists the use of dianetics to the medical doctor there is everything to be said for correct medical treatment in the handling of the sick and insane insanity is most often the suppressed agony of actual physical illness and injury to treat this agony with shock and brain operations is nurembergtype offense and is indictable äs mayhem or manslaughter the medical treatment of insanity requires some awareness by the patient of his whereabouts and present time these are usually quite unbearable so he has sunk into the past to escape the agony of thepresent the touch assist given to such injured persons permits healing to occur by restoring the person to the present and his whereabouts to some degree healing after medical treatment might not occur rapidly if the insane or chronically ill person remains in the past unable to confront the present thus the touch assist speeds and often permits healing after medical treatment and sometimes in minor injuries and illness permits the doctorto accomplish healing without further treatment there is the touch assist the contact assist and the auditing assist the touch assist done äs described elsewhere brings the patient s attention to injured or affected body areas when attention is withdrawn from them so is circulation nerve flows and energy which for one thinglimits nutrition to the area and for another prevents the drain of wasteproducts some ancient healers attributed remarkable flows and qualitiesto the laying on of hands probably the workable element in this wassimply heightening awareness of the affected area and restoring the physical communication factorsoionetic assiststhe contact assist is remarkable when it can be done the patient is taken to the area where the injury occurred and makes the injuredmember gently contact it several times sudden pain will fly off and theinjury if minor lessens or vanishes this is again physical communicationfactor the body member seems to have withdrawn from that exact spotin the physical universe the restoration of awareness is often necessary before healing can occur the prolongation of chronic injury occurs in the absence of physical communication with the affected area or with the location of the spot of injury in the physical universe the auditing assist is done by trained auditor using an emeter it consists of running out the physically painfui experience the person has just undergone accident illness operation or emotional shock this erases the psychic trauma and speeds healing to aremarkable degree if done properly in addition to assists there is dianetic auditing of an acutely ill person which handles the current and past illnesses and injuries byerasing the physical trauma the last is skilied activity practitioners who have the idea such things do not have causes will of course fall to locate the causes sickness can be composed let us say of headache nausea apathy and weariness such sickness may be bizarre without medical reason by first getting the patient to find and say what shock occurred when the sickness began getting when and getting it recounted the illnesswill lessen the emotional state will altercalled release of affect by then finding an earliersimilar instance and getting that one dated and recounted further release of affect may occurif the good indicators smiles etc do not occur in the patient one again asks for an eariier incident dates it and gets it recounted physically sick persons divide into two classes acutely ill and chronically ill person who is acutely ill is

to deliver processes given incs series 9 hcob 21 june 70 fourth section sick pcs you try not to run heavy engram chains on acutely ill pcs äs they are physically not up to it cannot stand sessions long enough to getanywhere with chain and usually all that happens is the pc feels spinnyand left in restimmed condition you can run touch assists and lightobjective processes on chronically ill pc you can begin exactiy äs you would with an acutely ill pc with the difference that when he improves you can run outthe physically painfui experience the person has just undergone withnarrative r3ra after this you can proceed with regulär new eradianetics needless to say all this requires skilied auditor but the skill can be acquired in dianetic training course the important thing is not to teil the patient what caused it but to let him teil you otherwise the symptom suppresses the approach in any of these assists is quiet gentle permissive never forcing the patient speaking only the words required to do theprocess the temporarily insane by reason of emotional shock where medical illness exists should be permitted rest and should then be handled by an assist äs above or normal dianetic auditing most often rest and further harassment result in return to sanity in short timesuch äs few days but not in terror atmosphere such äs psychiatricasylum where the patient is in the risk of being hurt or killed electricshock prolongs the condition and brain surgery is of course not treatmentbut murder äs at best it deprives the person of his coordination anddianetic assistsat worst shortens his life the occasional and rare brain tumor is of course an exception but this is medical not psychiatric matter matterwhat manifestations the person exhibits most medically ill people doexhibit symptoms of mental derangement at some stage of their illness the acceleration of healing of medical illness or injury such äs broken bones or the aftereffects of delivery or operations can be accomplishedby the dianetic auditing of the resulting trauma soon after füll medicaltreatment or attention the improvement factor is about onethird thenormal time of recovery by some thousands of test cases such auditing is done by usual dianetic procedure in addition to the above assists there is regulär dianetic auditing which handles chronic discomforts and prevents future illness äs well äsimproving the state of wellbeing of person the mechanisms of the mind revealed in dianetics are of great use to the field of medicine they are easy and quick to apply about one months training is all that is necessary to acquaint an otherwise educated and intelligent person with the fundamentals andskills necessary to assists considerably more time of course is necessary to train skilied scientology auditor but this is not the subject of this paper there is conflict of interest between any healing profession and dianetics dianetic materials and papers are fully available there is conflict between dianetics and political practices such äs psychiatry since electric shock brain operations and general degradationof the person may prevent the patients recovery by dianeticscas answers exist now for insanity there is reason to continue medieval or fascist solutions to the problem of the psychosomatically ill orthe insane and we are doing everything in our power against fantasticopposition to end the torture and killing of the insane regardless of thepolitically desirable ends envisioned by some groups dianetics like any other true treatment like aspirin or penicillin was originally designed to handle the apparent basic cause of psychosomaticillness the first research was intended to heip allied prisoners of war degraded by the japanese and chinese prison camps and who after vj day were transferred to oak knoll naval hospital later in 1954 in amuch more advanced state of development dianetics was successfullyemployed to eradicate the results of

contact assist it can be followed by atouch assist and other types of assists but the contact assist should always be done first if the mest is available do contact assist information there is an old old principle in scientology which consists of putting the injured body member exactiy on and in the place it was injured this is caued contact assist and is the mostcommon assist for accidents and injuries it is remarkable when itcan be done procedure 1 remember that first aid and physical actions orten have to be taken before contact assist can be begun first aid alwayscomes first look over the situation from the standpoint of how much first aid is required and when you have solved that situation then render the assist auditing will not shut off apumping artery but tourniquet will 2 take the person to the exact spot where the accident occurred if the object was hot you let it cool first if the current was on you turn it off before doing the assist 3 teil the person we are now going to do contact assist 4 have the person get into the same position he was in before the accident happened if he had tool in his hand or was using one he should be going through the same motions with it 5 teil the person to move slowly through the accident just like it happened have him duplicate exactiy what happened at thetime of the injury by making him touch the exact spot with his injuredbody part you have him gently touch the thing that hurt him if he pricked his finger on thorn in the rose garden you get him to gently touch the same part of the same finger that was pricked to the sameexact thorn if he closed his hand in door you would have him go back arid with his injured hand touch the exact spoi on the sarrw door duplicating the same motions that occurred at the time of the injury there are hardly any commands involved with it the less you say the better off you are 6 repeat this over and over agairi until the exact somatic türm on and then blows off pain gone accompanied by cognition you have to get him to touch the exact point to produce this exact phenomenon when this occurs end the assist by telling the person end of assist run until the exact somatic türm on and then blows off pain gone accompanied by cognition notes on running contact assist must sometimes be done on gradient lets say child stubbed his shin on the lawn mower and now doesnt want to come nearer than one hundred feet from that lawnmower you would make him do contact assist with his shin and body at that point one hundred feet from the same lawn mower having him go through the motions of the accident gradually gradient by gradientyou narrow the distance that he is willing to approach it and eventually he will go u p and do contact assist on the lawn mower you must never forcibly drag the person up to the spot where the injuryor accident occurred if you try to force the pc you could overwhelm him contact assists can be done by oneself on oneself but one must be surc to do it until the somatic blows any type of injury can and should be handled with contact assist it is always the best type of injury assist when the exact spot is available and should precede any other assist actions

reestablish communication with injured or ill body parts it brings the persons attention to the injured or affected body areas this is done by repetitively touching the ill or injured persons body and putting him into communication with the injury his communication with it brings aboutrecovery the technique is based on the principle that the way to heal anything or remedy anything is to put somebody into communication with it every single physical illness stems from failure to communicate with the thing or area that is ill prolongation of chronic injury occurs in the absence of physical communication with the affected area or with thelocation of the spot of injury in the physical universewhen attention is withdrawn from injured or ill body areas so are circulation nerve flows and energy this limits nutrition to the area and prevents the drain of waste products some ancient healers attributedremarkable flows and qualities to the laying on of hands probably theworkable element in this was simply heightening awareness of the affected area and restoring the physical communication factors for example if you do touch assist on somebody who has asprained wrist you are putting him almost forcefully back intocommunication with that wrist äs completely äs possible whenhe is fully back in communication with it he hasnt got sprained wrist cuntnnud 45in addition to control and direction of the persons attention touch assist also handles the factors of locatwn and time if person has been injured his attention avoids the injured or affected part but at the same time is stuck in it he is alsoavoiding the location of the injury and the person himself and the injured body part are stuck in the time öf the impact touch assist permits healing to occur by restoring the person to the present and his whereabouts to some degree procedure 0 administer any first aid that may be needed before you begin the assist if the person is bleeding from an artery and is going to lose all the blood in his body in the next four or five minutes the proper sequence is to apply tourniquet and then do atouch assist 1 have the preclear sit down or lie downwhatever position will be more comfortable for him 2 teil the pc that you are going to be doing touch assist and explain briefly the procedureteil the pc the command you will be using and ensurehe understands it the command used is look at my finget except when you are dealing with somebody who is lower level case the command used for such pc is feel my fingenbosic assists for illnessesand injurieswhen using the command look at

at or feel 5 acknowledge the person 6 continue giving the command touching and acknowledging when the person has indicated he has done the command when doing touch assist on particular injured or affectedarea you approach the area on gradient and recede from k on gradient you approach the injury or affected area go away from itapproach it go away from it approach it closer go awayfrom itfurther approach to point where you are actually touching the injured or affected part and go away further you try to follow the nerve channels of the body which includes the spine the liinbs and the various relay points like the elbows the wriststhe back sides of the knees and the fingertips these are thepoints you heacl for these are all points in which the shock wave can get locked up what you are trying to do is get com municanon wave flowing again through the body because theshock of injury stopped it matter what part of the body is being helped the areas touched should include the extremities hands and feet and the spine the touching must be balanced to both left and right sides ofthe body when you have touched the persons right big toe you next touch the left big toe when you have touched point few inches to one side of the persons spine you next touclithe spot the same distance from the spine on the opposite sidethis is important because the brain and the bodyscommunication system interlock you can find that pain in the left hand runs out when you touch the right hand because the right hand has got it locked up in addition to handling the left and right sides of the body thebodys back and front sides must also be addresscd in other words if attention has been given to the front of the body attention must also be given to the backthe same principle applies in handling particular body pari for instance you might be handling an injury on the front of the right leg your touch assist would include the front of the right leg the front of the left leg the back of the right leg andthe back of the left leg in addition to the usual actions ofhandling the extremities and spine 7 continue the assist until the preclear has very good

only get small improvement giving another touch assist on the following day you could expect bit more improvement next day you may get asomatic blowing through completely it might take many more

disassociate persons on drugs touch assist can be done on person who has been given painkillers or other drugs this isnt optimum but it is sometimes necessary under emergency conditionswhere person has been injured your objective should be to getto him and give him touch assist before anyone gives him painkiller if the body has been very badly damaged the person may still be in agony after your assist but you will have gottensome of the shock off at this point medical cloctor couldadminister painkiller and repair the physical damage if person is given an assist over drugs you must later come

tochiropractors many of whom now use itin our theory it is nerves that hold the muscies tense which then hold the spine out of place there are twelve big nerves which run down persons spinespreading out from the spine across both sides of the shoulders andback these twelve nerves brauch out into smaller nerve channels and nerve endings nerves affect the muscies and can if continually tensed pull

day person who has machine or books or objects continuallyat fixed distance from him leaves his work and tends to keep his attention fixed exactly where his work was the wrong thing to do regardless of whether one is bookkeeper an accountant clerk an executive or machinist is to leavework go home sit down and fix attention on an object more orless at the same distance from one as one confronts continually at work procedure take walk around the block this consists of walking around the block until one feels rested the person is to walk around the block and look at things until hesees the things he is walking near it does not matter how manytimes he walks around the block he should walk around the block until he feels better this is run to extroversion of attention onto the world in which one lives notes on running in doing this it will be found that one wdll become little brighter at first and then will become very much more tired he will become sufficiently tired that he knows nowthat he should go to bed and have good nights sleep this is notthe time to stopwalking since he is walking through exhaustion he is walking out his exhaustion the factor that is important is the unfixing of his attention from his work to the material world in which he is living this is terrifically good therapy worker who is tired and exhausted and has only been doing clerical work who goes

reach and withdraw use of process reach and withdraw is very simple but extremely powerful method of getting person familiarized and incommunication with things so that he can be more at cause over and in control of them reach and withdraw can be used on any person in order to familiarize him with the objects and spaces and boundaries of hiswork information one would not expect person to be at cause over or to have much control or understanding of or skill in something with which he was not familiar the keynote of familiarity is communication reaching and withdrawing are two very fundamental actions in this universe and reach and withdraw is actually breakthrough from advanced technology by reach is meant touching or taking hold of it is defined as to get to come to andor arrive at by withdraw is meant move back from let go reach and withdraw is valuable tool to use to get person into good communication with his work environment especially the tools and objects he uses pilot would do reach and withdraw on all the objects and spaces of his airplane his hangar the earth secretary would do reachand withdraw on her typewriter her chair walls spaces her desketc one person was run on reach and withdraw on large piece of equipment he was having trouble installing the installationseemed hopelessly bugged during the reach and withdraw herealized that large cable necessary to hook up the machine wastotally disconnected hed never even seen the cable beforeprocedure the commands are l reach that _______ 2 withdraw from that the following commands may be substituted if the wording is more appropriate to the particular person place or thing being addressed 1 touch that _______ 2 let go of that _______ thing or part of something eg the big red button on the front of the machine or space or person is named in the blank and the commands are given 1 2 1 2 and so on with anacknowledgment given after the execution of each command it is done on that one thing until the person has minor win or three consecutive sets of commands with change in the persons motions or attitude then another object part of anobject space or person is chosen and the commands are taken to win on that item and so on always point to the object each time you give command so there will be mistake made by the person doing it one doesnt keep the person reaching and withdrawing endlessly from the same part of anything that is being used but goes to different points and parts of an object being touched if you keephim reaching for the same point on an object or just the generalobject time after time you are actually running duplication process not reach and withdraw the person would be taken to win or three sets of commands with change on that one object or space not on each different part of it that he is reaching and withdrawing fromso when the person has minor win or does three sets of commands with change go on to the next object or space the auditor walks around with the person doing the action ensuring that he actually does get in physical contact with the points or areas of objects spaces and boundaries you can run reach and withdraw on space or room by having the person walk into the room and walk out of the room over and over this is used when youre running reach and withdraw on aroom or space rather than an object of course you would also run the other objects connected with the persons duties run to win or cognition accompanied by good indicators on the whole area being addressed reach and withdraw would not be run past major win
