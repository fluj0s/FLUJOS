wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33442 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl33442 nuclear power outlook for new us reactors larry parker and mark holt resources science and industry division march 9 2007 abstract this report includes analyses of the potential eﬀect of the tax credit for nuclear power provided by the energy policy act of 2005 and possible competitive eﬀects of various proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions under baseline assumptions the cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants is likely to be higher than power generated by new coal and natural gasﬁred plants the new nuclear tax credit would more than oﬀset that cost disadvantage but it is limited to the ﬁrst 6000 megawatts of new nuclear generating capacity that is the capacity of about four to six reactors although the credits could be spread among larger number of new reactors under current rules if the tax credit results in new reactor construction the next question will be whether nuclear construction would continue without further credits greenhouse gas legislation could also be an important factor in nuclear power economics analysis shows that some proposals if enacted could push the cost of coal and natural gasﬁred electricity above projected nuclear costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33442g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

order was placed for new nuclear power plant in the united states several utilities are now expressing interest in building total of up to 30 new reactors the renewed interest in nuclear power has resulted primarily from higher prices for natural gas improved operation of existing reactors and uncertainty about future restrictions on coal emissions substantial tax credit and other incentives for nuclear generation provided by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 are also likely to improve the economic viability of qualifying new reactors new nuclear plant applications can also take advantage of amendments to the atomic energy act made in the early 1990s to reduce licensing delays currently there are 103 licensed and operable power reactors at 65 plant sites in 31 states generating about onefifth of us electricity although new us reactors have started up since 1996 us nuclear electricity generation has since grown by more than 20 much of this additional output resulted from reduced downtime notably through shorter refueling outages licensed commercial reactors generated electricity at an average of 898 of their total capacity in 2006 after averaging about 75 in the mid1990s and about 65 in the mid1980s falling operating costs have helped renew the economic viability of the nations fleet of nuclear power plants from 1989 to 1998 12 commercial reactors were closed before reaching the end of their 40year licenses by the late 1990s there was real doubt that any reactors would make it to 40 years since 2000 however 44 commercial reactors have received 20year license extensions from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc giving them up to 60 years of operation and more are pending the nuclear production tax credit in the energy policy act could have significant impact on the economic viability of new nuclear power plants under base case assumptions new reactors are not competitive with either coalfired or natural gasfired facilities however if new reactors are able to take full advantage of the nuclear production tax credit nuclear power appears competitive with either natural gasfired or coalfired facilities other factors will also be important in the commercial decision to invest in new nuclear plants such as fossil fuel prices and the regulatory vironment for both nuclear power and future fossil fuelfired generation if natural gas prices remain at historically high levels future nuclear plants will be more likely to be competitive without federal tax credits however natural gas prices have been highly cyclical in the past raising the possibility that nuclear costs could be undercut in the future any substantial mandatory greenhouse gas control program would probably affect the cost of new coalfired and natural gasfired generation relative to nuclear power particularly if nuclear power is assumed to have greenhouse gas emissions continued delays in nuclear waste disposal facilitiesforcing spent fuel to be stored at plant sitescould also affect the decision to construct new reactors

of new nuclear power plants in the united states was almost unimaginable during the 1980s and 1990s vague rumors about possible new reactors would occasionally prompt flurry of speculation but they were invariably unfounded in fact reactor has been ordered in the united states since 1978 and that plant was later cancelled as eventually were all us reactor orders after 1973 us reactor has been completed since 1996the tennessee valley authoritys watts bar 1 which had been ordered in 1970 today there are still orders but interest in new us reactors is longer merely rumor in 2003 three utilities submitted applications to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for early approval of potential reactor sites under costshared program with the department of energy doe in 2004 doe announced costsharing agreements with two industry consortia to apply for nrc licenses to construct and operate new reactors since then dozen more utilities and other companies have announced plans to apply for

company news r eleases the renewed interest in nuclear power has resulted primarily from higher prices for natural gas improved operation of existing reactors and uncertainty about future restrictions on coal emissions until the recent price volatility low fuel costs had helped gasfired power plants dominate the market for new electric generation capacity since the late 1980s nuclear powers relatively stable costs and low air emissions may now appear more attractive particularly combined with substantial tax credit for nuclear generation and other incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 new nuclear plant applications can also take advantage of amendments to the atomic energy act made in the early 1990s to reduce licensing delays 1 in announcing the new reactor license applications however utilities have made clear that they are not committed to actually building the reactors even if the licenses are approved large uncertainties about nuclear plant construction costs still remain along with doubts about progress on nuclear waste disposal and concerns about public opposition all those problems helped cause the long cessation of us reactor orders and will need to be addressed before financing for new multibilliondollar nuclear power plants is likely to be obtained federal energy policy may play crucial role in determining whether the current interest in new nuclear reactors leads to significant expansion of the us nuclear power industry nuclear opponents have long maintained that nuclear power will never be economically viable without federal subsidies and should be abandoned in favor of safer alternatives but supporters contend that nuclear power will be vital in diversifying the nations future energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that federal subsidies for at least the first few new reactors are justified the greenhouse gas issue has also prompted some environmentalists to support nuclear power expansion this report includes analyses of the potential effect of the tax credit for nuclear power provided by the energy policy act of 2005 and possible competitive effects of various proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions under baseline assumptions the cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants is likely to be higher than power generated by new coal and natural gasfired plants the new nuclear tax credit would more than offset that cost disadvantage but it is limited to the first 6000 megawatts of new nuclear generating capacity that is the capacity of about four to six reactors although the credits could be spread among larger number of new reactors under current rules if the tax credit results in new reactor construction the next question will be whether nuclear construction woul d continue without further credits greenhouse gas legislation could also be an important factor in nuclear power economics analysis shows that some 1 energy policy act of 1992 title

commercialization of nuclear power in the 1960s the atomic energy commission anticipated that more than 1000 reactors would be operating in the united states by the year 20002 but by the end of the 1970s it had become clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly that dramatically and more than 120 reactor orders were ultimately cancelled currently 103 licensed power reactors operate at 65 plant sites in 31 states not including the tennessee valley authoritys tv as browns ferry 1 which has not operated since 1985 tv is spending about 18 billion to restart the reactor by mid2007 despite falling short of those early expectations however us nuclear power production has grown steadily since its inception and now exceeds electricity generated from oil natural gas and hydro plants and trails only coal which accounts for more than half of us electricity generation nuclear plants generate more than half the electricity in six states the nearrecord 823 billion kilowatthours of nuclear electricity generated in the united states during 20063 was more than the nations entire electrical output in the early 1960s when the first largescale commercial reactors were being ordered and more than twice the 2005 total electrical generation of great britain 4 as indicated in figure 1 although new us reactors have started up since 1996 us nuclear electricity generation has since grown by more than 205 much of this additional output resulted from reduced downtime notably through shorter refueling outages which typically take place every 18 months licensed commercial reactors generated electricity at an average of 898 of their total capacity in 2006 after averaging around 75 in the mid1990s and around 65 in the mid1980s 6 reactor modifications to boost capacity have also been factor in the continued growth of nuclear power production since 1996 nrc has approved more than 60 requests for power uprates totaling about 2500 megawatts of electrical generating capacityabout the capacity of two large reactors7 the uprates largely offset the closure of five poorly performing reactors totaling 3700 megawatts of capacity in 1997 and 19988 further uprate requests are pending 2

from nrc giving them up to 60 years of operation license extensions for seven more reactors are currently under review and many others are anticipated according to nrc 12 the license extension trend has been spurred partly by favorable rate treatment of nuclear plants unrecovered capital costs stranded costs in states that have deregulated the power generation sector 9 uranium information centre

plants as larger nuclear operators purchase plants from utilities that run only one or two reactors several such sales have occurred including the march 2001 sale of the millstone plant in connecticut

nuclear power facility involved twostep process 1 an nrc issued construction permit that allowed an applicant to begin building facility and 2 an operating license that permitted the facility to generate electricity for sale15 this procedure resulted in some celebrated cases in which completed or nearly completed plants awaited years to be granted operating licensesdelays that drove up the costs of the affected plants in 1989 nrc issued regulations to streamline this process in three ways16 the early site permit program allows utilities to get their proposed reactor sites approved by the nrc before decision is made on whether or not to build the plant these preapproved sites can be banked for future use standard design certification for advanced reactor designs allows vendors to get their designs approved by nrc for use in the united states so utilities can then deploy them essentially off the shelf the combined construction and operating license col provides onestep approval process in which all licensing hearings for proposed plant are expected to be conducted before construction begins the col would then allow 13 nuclear news word list of nuclear power plants march 2006

acceptance criteria itaac were met this is intended to reduce the chances for regulatory delays after plant is completed17 the relationships among these three components are illustrated in figure 2 col application could reference preapproved site and certified plant design so that most siting and design issues would not need to be revisited upon completion the reactor could begin operating after nrc determined that the itaac had been met the overall goal of these reforms was to introduce as much regulatory certainty into the process before company has to make major financial investment in project however the process has never been used so it remains uncertain how much time will be saved by referencing preapproved sites and certified designs or how difficult the itaac checkoff process might be figure 2 relationship between combined licenses early site p ermits and standard design cer tifications source nrc the procedures envision threestep decisionmaking process allowing the utility to make gonogo decisions at several points before major investment is made in the project the first step to building new facility is to conduct utility level project analysis including needs assessment environmental impact scoping analysis and identification of siting issues this is anticipated to take about 24 years and some utilities have already begun this process see table 1 assuming

to evaluate safetyrelated issues such as seismic and geologic data population demographics and potential consequences of hypothetical accidents second the utility will have to evaluate environmental issues such as maximum radiological and thermal effluents third the utility will have to address emergency planning issues such as evacuation routes the utility may use the nrc early site permit process to conduct this evaluation but is not required to do so assuming the utility finds the site suitable and the project potentially economical it submits the above information along with further details to the nrc to obtain col this additional information includes financial data justification for the capacity addition and complete details on reactor design on this last point the utility is likely to reference standard design certification but is not required to do so the utility must also provide the itaac for the eventual nrc approval to operate the plant the nrc reviews the application holds hearings and makes decision on granting the col the licensing process is currently estimated by nrc to take about three and half years although nrc chairman dale klein has called for that schedule to be shortened 18 nrc established the office of new reactors in 2007 to handle the potential influx of new reactor license applications after the license is issued the utility must decide whether to begin building the power plant current projections of nuclear power construction schedules assume that plant can be built in 5 7 years at the end of construction the nrc veri fies that the new plant meets the itaac in the col and the facility is allowed to operate overall the process is anticipated to take 1015 years if this streamlined process works as intended it may remove some of the previous regulatory uncertainty surrounding new nuclear plant construction and make financing of such projects more feasible this is particularly true for the roughly half of the states that have restructured their electricity markets thus resulting in utilities employing project financing rather than more traditional funding with project financing the proposed developer of power plant seeks financing for the project using only the project as recourse for the loan as opposed to securing the loan with the larger holdings of the utility itself with the project being the only collateral wall street looks very closely at the risk profile of the project in determining whether to finance it and on what terms the nuclear industry and the nrc hope that the new licensing process will help improve the risk profile of new facilities by increasing the certainty that plant will be built expeditiously and begin operations in timely manner it is also possible that an increase in nuclear power plant permit applications could make the new process more routine shortening approval time as has happened with licensing renewal requests for existing facilities which are now generally approved in about 18 months however there are several reasons to believe that the longer end of the 1015 year range is more likely at least in the shortterm first this is an untried process as noted above uncertainties include some timehonored ones such as the environmental impact statement and safety evaluation report as well as new issues pres ented by the new procedures such as nrcs certification of utilitys itaac second public input is likely to be vigorous initial efforts by utilities to obtain early site permits have been slowed by substantial public comments on each 18 weil

intervention into the process particularly where traditional ratemaking authority remains states can be very resourceful in delaying nuclear power when they so choose the classic example is the shoreham nuclear power station which was completed and licensed but never began commercial operation because of the sustained opposition from the state of new york finally judicial intervention is not unusual when opposition interest groups attack permits environmental impact statements and other regulatory decisions in attempts to forestall construction and operation when existing nuclear plants were licensed opposition often focused on the potential for reactor accidents in the post911 environment concerns about terrorist attacks are likely to be raised as well19

nuclear power 2010 program to demonstrate those processes offering to pay up to half the licensing costs incurred by industry applicants the programs original goal was to pave the way for deployment of at least one new nuclear power plant by 2010 and thus reduce regulatory uncertainty for further license applicants although the programs original goal of deploying reactor by 2010 will not be achieved industry interest in the effort has been substantial under the program three utilities applied to nrc in 2003 for early site permits to build new reactors at existing plants in illinois mississippi and virginia nrc approved the illinois permit march 8 2007 and anticipates final action on the others later this year 20 two industry consortia will continue to receive doe assistance over the next several years to apply for cols and conduct first of kind engineering for new nuclear power plants although they have not committed to ordering the reactors if the licenses are issued doe awarded the first funding to the consortia in 2004 doe assistance under the program including the early site permits is planned to reach multiyear total of about 550 million the two consortia receiving col assistance under the nuclear power 2010 program are consortium led by dominion resources that is preparing col for an advanced general electric reactor after originally considering canadian design the proposed reactor would be located at dominions existing north anna plant in virginia where the company is seeking an nrc early site permit with doe assistance consortium called

tax credit for up to 6000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity for the first eight years of operation up to 125 million annually per 1000 megawatts an eligible reactor must be placed into service before january 1 2021 as discussed below this credit is expected to significantly improve the projected economic viability of proposed nuclear power plants major factor in determining the potential impact of the nuclear production credit is the allocation of the credit among eligible reactors under the energy policy act the 6000 megawatts of capacity that could receive the credit is to be allocated by the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of energy the internal revenue service issued interim guidance on may 1 2006 that would provide the tax credit to electricity generated by any reactor that 1 applied for an nrc combin ed license by december 31 2008 2 began construction before january 1 2014 and 3 was certified by doe as meeting eligibility requirements 21 under the guidance if license applications with more than 6000 megawatts of eligible nuclear capacity are received by december 31 2008 the 6000megawatt cap will be allocated proportionally among the eligible plants therefore if 12000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity met the application deadline and eventually went into operation then only half the electrical output of each reactor would get the tax credit if license applications by december 31 2008 totaled less than 6000 megawatts then additional reactors would become eligible until the limit is reached according to the irs guidance the deadline for automatic eligibility for the tax credit appears to provide strong incentive for nuclear plant applicants to file with nrc by the end of 2008 which is sooner than some of the anticipated filings shown in table 1 however if most of those reactors were to become eligible for the credit the credits effect could be diluted to the point where it would longer provide sufficient construction incentive the credit would most dramatically affect nuclear plant economics if 100 of reactors output were eligible however if each new nuclear unit were to receive the credit for all its electrical generation then only four or five reactors ranging from 12001500 megawatts could be covered within the 6000megawatt limit because reactor designs from three different companies are currently under consideration only one or two units of each design might be constructed under this scenario that might not be enough to reduce costs through series production to the point where further unitsineligible for tax creditswould be economically viable on their own g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g20g146g156g148g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 continuing concern over potential regulatory delays despite the streamlined licensing system now available prompted congress to include an insurance system in epact that would cover some of the costs of such delays the

200622 criteria established by the rule for receiving coverage under the program include the issuance of col detailed construction schedule documentation that construction has started and detailed schedule for completing the inspections tests analyses and acceptance criteria required for reactor operation to begin the first two reactors to meet all the criteria would receive the 500 million coverage coverage is to be provided for delays caused by nrcs failure to follow its own rules if any in reviewing reactors itaac nrcs failure to meet doeapproved itaac schedules nrc pre operational hearings and litigation standby support coverage is not provided for delays caused by failure of the sponsor to take any action required by law regulation or ordinance23 this includes delays caused by nrc orders to reconduct itaac or to correct preoperational deficiencies found by nrc however the program does cover delays caused by licensingrelated litigation in state federal or tribal courts even if court rules against nuclear plant sponsor24 the standby support program is intended to reduce uncertainty about the col licensing process that may pose an obstacle to nuclear plant orders because the first two reactors would presumably face the most uncertainty about the untried process they would receive the most coverage it is apparently hoped that the licensing experience of the first two reactors would provide enough confidence for the next four to proceed with half the coverage and then for additional reactors to be built with regulatory risk insurance

criterion that includes new clean coal projects the loan guarantees may cover up to 80 of plants estimated cost if borrower defaults doe is to pay off the loan and can either 1 take over the project for completion operation or disposition or 2 reach an agreement with the borrower to continue the project to prevent default doe may make loan payments on behalf of the borrower subject to appropriations and an agreement by the borrower for future reimbursement because it is generally believed that wall street continues to view new commercial reactors as financially risky the availability of federal loan guarantees could be key element in attracting funding for such projects and reducing financing costs the federal government would bear most of the risk facing potentially large losses if borrowers defaulted on reactor projects that could not be salvaged loan guarantees may be especially important for nuclear projects undertaken by deregulated generating companies as opposed to traditionally regulated utilities which can recover their regulatorapproved capital costs from ratepayers even for regulated utilities loan 22 71 federal register 46306 august 11 2006 23

financing the nuclear energy institute contended in september 2006 testimony25 doe issued its initial solicitation for loan guarantees under epact on august 8 200626 the total amount of the loan guarantees in the initial solicitation is limited to 2 billion and does not include nuclear technology along with the in itial solicitation doe issued guidelines for considering those initial proposals and said it was working on final regulations to govern future loan guarantee solicitations the deadline for applications under the initial solicitation was originally november 6 2006 but was subsequently delayed to december 31 2006 epact requires that before loan guarantee is granted the estimated subsidy cost including estimated default losses must be covered by specific appropriation or by an upfront payment from the borrower does initial solicitation says that because appropriations for the program are not anticipated each borrower will have to pay the estimated subsidy cost according to the solicitation the subsidy cost will be calculated for each loan and must be approved by the office of management and budget omb 27 omb will undoubtedly want to ensure that the payments are high enough to cover all the anticipated default and other subsidy costs incurred by the doe loan guarantee program the size of the payments required by omb could strongly affect the value of the loan guarantees to borrowers also important to potential borrowers is the percentage of project costs that can be covered by the doe loan guarantees although epact section 1702c allows doe to provide loan guarantees for up to 80 of projects estimated cost does guidelines for the initial solicitation expresses preference that the loan guarantees cover not more than 80 of projects debt28 therefore if project has significant nondebt financing the loan guarantees could cover considerably less than 80 of the total cost the nuclear energy institute contended that the procedures outlined in the guidelines are so restrictive and so conditional that they would not support financing of nuclear power plant 29

high natural gas prices and the countrys twodecade reliance on natural gas for new electric generating capacity have raised concern that the country is becoming too dependent on natural gas for electricity currently about 22 of the countrys electric generating capacity is natural gasfired compared with about 7 two cades ago this situation raises at least two questions 1 whether the recent rise in natural gas prices is harbinger of future prices or just another peak in the historic boombust cycle of us natural gas prices and 2 whether nuclear power is an alternative generating option that th federal government should subsidize to help address question number one the potential for increased natural gas prices has been illustrated by recent events however power plants are longlived facilities with lifetimes estimated at around 65 years and current maintenance practices can extend that life almost indefinitely in the emerging competitive environment for new power plant construction the financial investment lifetime may be on the order of 20 years this shorter time frame to recover power plant investment reflects the uncertainty existing in the electricity market 33

is whether the current upturn in natural gas prices is relatively shortterm phenomenon or does it reflect new longterm premium for natural gas based on its environmental and technological advantages and future availability if the former then building new nuclear power plants would be questionable venture economically unless their capital costs could be reduced substantially if the latter nuclear power construction could become attractive in the future if prices persist at above approximately 665 per mmbtu 2004 however it should be noted that volatile natural gas prices do not have any direct effect on generating costs at coalfired facilities in contrast to natural gas prices coal prices generally have been on slow steady decline for 30 years the increasing share of coal being supplied by large lowcost surface mining operations in the west has contributed to longterm downward trend in coal prices coal prices have risen in the past couple of years as demand has increased however with abundant reserves sustained increase would seem problematic g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g561g9g138g156g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g561 any substantial mandatory greenhouse gas control program would probably affect the cost of new coalfired and natural gasfired generation in all current proposals before the congress nuclear power is assumed to have greenhouse gas emissions this green nuclear power argument has gotten some traction in think tanks and academia as stated by mit in its major study the future of nuclear power our position is that the prospect of global climate change from greenhouse gas emissions and the adverse consequences that flow from these emissions is the principal justification for government support of the nuclear energy option 34 the industry also has been attempting to promote nuclear power as one solution to rising greenhouse gas emissions 35 few wellknown environmentalists have expressed public support for nuclear power as part of the response to global climate change although major environmental group as yet has publically adopted that position36 despite strong bush administration opposition to mandatory greenhouse gas reduction programs number of congressional proposals to advance programs designed to reduce greenhouse gases were introduced in the 109th congress37 and similar efforts have continued in the 110th congress none of these proposal have passed either house of congress the first effort to pass mandatory greenhouse gas reduction program failed in 2003 on 4355 vote in the senate similar effort was defeated in 2005 during the debate on the energy policy act of 2005 on 3860 vote this second less favorable vote reflects the changed votes of four senators who reportedly objected to the addition of nuclear power incentives to the 2005 version of the proposed legislation 38 the proposals would have placed cap on us greenhouse gas emissions based on 2001 baseline the cap would have been implemented through tradeable permit program to encourage efficient reductions 34interdisciplinary mit study the future of nuclear power massachusetts institute of technology 2003 p 79 35 see the nuclear energy institute

by the congress led 13 senators to introduce samdt 866a sense of the senate resolution on climate changeduring the debate on the energy policy act of 2005 the resolution finds that 1 greenhouse gases are accumulating in the atmosphere increasing average temperatures 2 there is growing scientific consensus that human activity is substantial cause of this accumulation and 3 mandatory steps will be required to slow or stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions based on these findings the resolution states that it is the sense of the senate that the congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions this should be done in manner that will not significantly harm the us economy and will encourage comparable action by other countries that are the nations major trading partners and contributors to global emissions the resolution passed by

radioactive spent fuel produced by nuclear reactors poses disposal problem that could be significant factor in the consideration of new nuclear plant construction the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa pl 97425 commits the federal government to providing for permanent disposal of spent fuel in return fo r fee on nuclear power generation however the schedule for opening the planned national nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain nevada has slipped far past nwpas deadline of january 31 1998 doe currently hopes to begin receiving waste at yucca mountain by 2017 46 in the meantime more than 50000 metric tons of spent fuel is being stored in pools of water or shielded casks at nuclear facility sites47 nwpa limits the planned yucca mountain repository to the equivalent of 70000 metric tons of spent fu because us nuclear power plants discharge an average of 2000 metric tons of spent fuel per year the yucca mountain limit is likely to be reached before any new reactors begin coming on line therefore even if yucca mountain eventually begins operating as planned it is unclear what ultimately would be done with spent fuel from new nuclear power plants under current law in the near term continued storage at reactor sites and interim storage at central locations would be the most likely possibilities the primary longterm options include lifting the statutory cap on yucca mountain disposal developing additional repositories and reprocessing spent fuel for reuse of plutonium and uranium the bush administrati ons global nuclear energy partnership proposal unveiled in february 2006 envisions reprocessing as way to reduce the amount of longlived plutonium and highly radioactive cesium and strontium that would need to be placed in yucca mountain thereby expanding its disposal capacity 48 the extent to which the nuclear waste issue could inhibit nuclear power expansion is difficult to assess nrc has determined that onsite storage of spent fuel would be safe for at least 30 years after expiration of reactors operating license which was estimated to be as long as 70 years as result the commission concluded that adequate regulatory authority is available to require any measures necessary to assure safe storage of the spent fuel until repository is available49 therefore nrc does not consider the lack of permanent repository for spent fuel to be an obstacle to nuclear plant licensing however the administration was concerned enough about repository delays to include provision in its recent nuclear waste bill to require nrc when considering nuclear power plant license applications to assume that sufficient waste disposal capacity will be available in timely manner 50 six statescalifornia connecticut kentucky new jersey west virginia and wisconsinhave
