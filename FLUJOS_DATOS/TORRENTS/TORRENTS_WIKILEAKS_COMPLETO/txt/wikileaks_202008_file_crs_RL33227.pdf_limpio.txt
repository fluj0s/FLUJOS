women in afghanistan and iraq challenges and issues for congress background the issue of womens rights in afghanis tan and iraq has ta ken on new relevance following the usled military actions in afghanistan in 2001 the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 and subsequent reconstruction efforts in both countries one of the major questions facing the united states in the postwar reconstruction process is the extent to which it can help women participate often for the first time in their lives or the recent history of their countries in political educationa l and economic life after years of warfare genderbased repr ession and economic ex clusion advancing the position of women and committing adequate resources to womens and girls education have both been li nked on global level to th achievement of efficient and stable development partic ularly in postconflict regions1 congressional initiatives focused on women in these countries have covered range of political economic and social issu particular areas of emphasis include the incorporation of women in local nd national governance the inclusion of womens rights in new constitution par ticipation by women in the workforce universal access to education provision of adequate health care and supplying humanitarian assistance to needy families this report focuses primarily on foreign aid appropriated by congress to united states agency for international development usaid and the state department for humanitarian and reconstruction activities in afghanistan and iraq but also touche s upon iraq programs funded thr ough the departments of health nd human services agriculture labor and defense2 afghanistan overall conditions for women in afghan istan have vastly improved since the fall of the taliban in 2001 pa rticularly in terms of ducation and job opportunities many refugees have returned millions of afghan girls now attend school and it is longer illegal for women to work gr eat deal remains to be done however in

finding culturally appropriate jobs in most areas of afghanistan women still find it difficult or impossible to work in open areas where they may come into contact with men within easy commuting distance of home at tolerable hours with reasonable pay furthermore most afghan women and for that matter most men have had little or education and lack employable skills while women have gained substantial ground in political participation especia lly since passage of the recent constitution guaranteeing them minimum number of pa rliamentary seats they nevertheless continue to face conservative attitudes in many rural areas of the country particularly in the south and east3 among the breakthroughs in 2005 woman was appointed governor of province bamiyan4 iraq in marked contrast to the talibans re pressive treatment which was rooted in longstanding rural afghan customs iraqs policies toward women have historically been more liberal even compared to other countries in th middle east iraqi women fared reasonably well under the pr ovisional 1970 constitution which granted them equal rights with men including the ri ghts to go to school own property work and hold political office the c ondition of women worsened somewhat under the regime of saddam hussein however particularly after the first gulf war when hussein turned more to islamic and tribal traditions that held women in inferior positions in addition the economic cond itions brought about by in ternational sanctions after the gulf war are said to have affected wome n disproportionately5 conditions appear to be improving for some women living in iraqs cities who are regaining greater civil rights and educati onal opportunities in the wake of the us led invasion of 2003 the political process in particular has opened up the new constitution requires 25 fema representation and wo men are serving in the government as members of the cabinet and the iraq governing council there are women governors in the provinces however although progress is being made on the po litical front in other ways women are worse off under increasingly islamist policies especially in southern iraq women in

challenges especially in climate of uncertainty nd insecurity while conditions for women in afghanistan have improved markedly since the fall of the taliban afghan women are still among the most socioeconomically disadvantaged in the world female literacy is estimated at 20 while girls school enrollme nt has skyrocketed in the last few years there are still onethird fewer girls than boys in primary school23 turning to health according to the world health organization who afghanistan has the worlds second wors t maternal mortality rate and fifth worst neonatal mortality rate24 while iraq is good deal more industrialized than afghanistan its health indicators prior to the 2003 invasion were very poor its ne onatal mortality rate was in fact worse than that of afghanistan iraq has historically had much better and more genderbalanced educational system than afghanistan but girls school attendance especially in rura l areas still lags behind that of boys25 while congressional funding for democracy build ing civil society development and participation in the workforce will have an important affect on womens lives in each country the rehabilitation of the basic education and hea lth care infrastructure for afghan and iraqi women is equally if not more vitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33227crs9 designating funds for women one of the key ways congress has had an impact on the situation for afghan women has been through series of legislative earmarks to date in iraq although some funds have been designated to include women such as 10 million for the iraqi womens democracy initiative congress has not used legislative earmarks extensively for womens programs future developments in consideration of the funding appropriated in recent years there are some similarities in the approach taken by the united states to improve the lives of afghan and iraqi women however not only are afghanistan and iraq starting from different economic and social points but the timetables for reconstruction will differ as well based on events and challenges on the ground although it is too soon to draw specific lessons from either country as congress examines the progress of reconstruction programs for women it may be important to consider the effect of religious vers us secular forces the variation in local traditions and cultures and the differences between rural and urban communities to see if the assistance provided to afghan and iraqi women is effective and can be used as model in future postconflict regions
