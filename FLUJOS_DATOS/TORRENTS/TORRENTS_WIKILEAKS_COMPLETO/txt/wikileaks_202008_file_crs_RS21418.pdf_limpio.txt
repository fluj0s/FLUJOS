summary among many genetically engineered crops being developed are number modified to produce pharmaceutical compounds none ye t commercialized proponents say such plantbased proteins could be produced more cheaply than by conventional methods and economically benefit farmers but critics see risks such as potential environmental food safety and trade problems among the i ssues is whether the current system for regulating biotechnology is ad equate this report will be updated if events warrant introduction1 since the first genetically engineered ge crop varieties became commercially available in the mid1990s us farmers have been rapidly adopting them in efforts to lower production costs and raise crop yiel ds among many new ge crops now in development but not yet co mmercialized are plants that could be factories for pharmaceutical compounds which could be extr acted and purified for specific human and animal health uses worldwide hundreds of ge plantbased pharmaceuticals are being developed proponents be lieve they could produce proteins that might for example be used to vaccinate against andor treat various forms of cancer infectious diseases nervous system and cardiovascular dis eases metabolic disorders nd agents of biowarfare number of applications could be approved within 10 years according to some experts in the united states in 2004 seven co mpanies and univers ities had usda permits to field test pharmaceutical pr oduction in the following crops corn 3 permits tobacco or tobacco mosaic virus tmv using tobacco as the host 3 and safflower 1 test

using tobacco as the host 18 rice 8 and alfalfa barley rapeseed sugarcane and tomato 1 each according to usdaaphis data compiled by information systems for bi otechnology at virginia tech h ttp wwwisb vtedupotential benefits proponents contend that pl antbased pharmaceuticals could be far cheaper alternative as low as pe nnies per dose compared with many dollars to produce those now made by more conventi onal methods these conventional methods require major investments in both large vol umes of purified cu lture mediums and in manufacturing plants plantbased pharmaceuti cals on the other hand are highly cost efficient protein producers which could be easily incorporated into the existing agricultural infrastructure and by well managed farms proponents argue many thousands of acres could be c onverted to pharming for higher earnings corn farmers for example might gross thousands of do llars per acre for pha rmaceutical varieties compared with several hundred dollars for the feed corn they grow now advocates argue noting that there has been support from some major corn growing regions for this technology many experts consider pharmaceu ticals from plants to be safer than those from mammalian sources as sm all amounts of pathogenic material from host animal could mix with and contaminate the ne w compound known plant viruses have infected humans unlike animal pathogens potential risks corn is the crop most extensively used and researched for ge uses including pharmaceuticals corn also is the most widely planted us crop at approximately 80 million acres annually most of it destin ed for animal feed and indirectly meat and poultry and corn meal oil and syrup used in many processed foods some critics want pharmed corn to be ba nned from areas where food and feed corn are produced critics worry that corns open pollination makes it difficult to prevent pollen drift and gene flow into other corn varie ties and are concerne d about impacts for food crops and wildlife also some major foreign buyers already are reluctant to accept any us crops for which ge varieties are used despite us asser tions that approved ge crops all of them nonpharm are different than and as safe to consume as those produced by more traditional means keep ing ge pharmed corn separate from food and feed implies higher production costs rge scale production of pharmed corn also might bring more foreign opposition to pr oducts of agricultural biotechnology regulation the basic federal guidance fo r regulating all biotechnolog products including plant based pharmaceuticals is the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology 51 fed reg 23302 published in 1986 by the white house office of science and technology policy stp key principle is that genetically engineered products should continue to be regulated according to th eir characteristics and unique features and not according to their pr oduction method the framework provides regulatory approach intended to ensure the safety of biotechnology research and products using existing statutory authority and previous agency experience with traditional breeding techniqueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21418crs3 3 ceq and ostp

301 et seq and the public health service act 42 usc 201 et seq and the environmental protection agency epa which must approve the use of all pesticides including those genetically engineered into plants developers of plantbased pharmaceuticals mainly work with aphis and fda often at the same time both agencies shar information about product during its development and testing such pr oducts also may be subject to state laws3 aphis4 ge plants that are or might be plant pests are considered regulated articles under aphis regulations 7 cf r 3403409 aphis authorization must be obtained prior to import interstate movement or environmental rel ease including field testing to gain nonregulated status so that plant can be freely commercialized with further oversight developer must pr ovide aphis with extensive information on plant biology and genetics nd potential environmental and plant pest impacts that may result from the modification aphis conducts formal environmental assessment ea and has public comment periods before deciding whether to approve the petition it is only after years of field testing scientific review of extensive data and public comment period that nonregulated stat us may be granted until then regulated plant cannot be introduced into the environment even field tested unless its developer obtains authorization through either the 1 notifica tion or 2 permit process sponsors follow aphis guidance on testing and movements to ensure that the plant will not damage agriculture human health or the environment pharm plant developers must utilize the permit not the notification process notification the majority of ge crops ar developed under the notification option less rigorous process than per mitting developers must obtain authorization from aphis before interstate movement import or field testing of ge organism aphis then either authorizes or denies the notifi cation within 10 days fo r interstate movement and 30 days for field test notification aut horization is valid for one year with renewals through additional notifications the developer must submit report within six months after completion of field tests and also in form aphis of any unusual occurrence during tests under the notification process the agency generally inspects about 10 of currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21418crs4 5 aphis said it has strengthened its ea guide lines including posting eas for pharmaceutical and industrial crop field tests on its website and accepting public comments on themtrials annually once nonregu lated crop can go into co mmercial use and is longer subject to confinement measur and other aphis oversight permit ge plants for pharmaceuticals fall into distinct regulatory category handled differently by aphis than ge plants for food or feed use the permit process is much more stringent than notification star ting with application which must be at least 120 days in advance of environmental release and at least 60 days in advance for movement required pe rmit information is more extens ive than under notification as is the subsequent list of permit c onditions an environmental an alysis ea may have to be conducted under the nationa l environmental policy act nepa 7 cfr 372 et seq with opportunity for public comment pr ior to permitting generally confined field trials do not require an ea if they fit certain cat egorical exclusions under nepa 7 cfr 3725 which aphis has applied to virtually all recen t plantbased pharm tests however an ea is required when the organism involves new species or the organism or novel modification raises new issues5 once aphis initially agrees to permit letter and proposed conditions go to the state which can add its own conditions before approval or even deny the permit aphis says it defers to the states on final decisions about permits aphis specifies field test movement and storage proce dures to ensure that ge plants and seeds for pharmaceuticals do not ter the food and feed supply requires chain of custody and identity preservation system that tracks seeds from shipping through planting harvest and product extraction nd sets forth federal auditing requirements among other rules aphis inspects all pharmaceutical field trials at least nnually aphis materials footnote 4 summarize in more detail the confinement measures for pharmaceutical organisms that were field sted in 2002 examples of such measures which are cropspecific include geographically isolating test plots planting bufferborder rows of non ge crops preventing pollina tion or otherwise blocking reproduction adequately identifying and segregating the organism post harvest restrictions on test plots destruction of leftover ge plant material and contingency plan to deal with any accidental releases develope rs are subject to civil or possibly criminal penalties for violating permit conditions unlike plants engineered for use as food or feed which may be granted nonregulated status ge pharmaceutical plan t has been declared nonregulated by aphis agency officials told crs that they cannot envi sion deregulating pharmaceutical plants thus meaning that in commercialization they w ill be grown under both aphis permit and fda regulation in the case of plantmade veterinary biologic also aphis fda fda currently regulates modified plant products as it regulates human and animal drugs and human biologic products fdas rules ar found in 21 cfr 201 et seq 301 et seq 501 et seq 601 et seq pharmed ingredient intended for therapeutic use must meet the same quality standards of safety purity potency and effectiveness as traditionally synthesized pharmaceuticals regardless of the production method fda regulations require manufact urers or sponsors to file new drug applications ndas or biologics license applications blas which include all reports of clinical studies and information on the safety and supply of raw ingredients used to make the finished product als the ingredients must be reproducible with consistent quality over an extended timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21418crs5 6 in 2001 starlinktm corn ge corn approved only fo r animal and not human food was found in taco shells crs report rs20732 starlinktm corn controversy backgroundwhen pharmaceutical company or sponsor already holds an approved application and wants to substitute plan tbased pharmaceutical ingredient in the drug or biologic it must file supplemental pplication reconfirming the safe ty and efficacy of the final drugbiologic product however as the app lication is being review ed and evaluated the agency must reinspect the facility and producti on line where the new drug or biologic will be manufactured to ensure that it will be made to specification and according to good manufacturing practices gmps the entire manufacturing process from seed banks field preparation planting cultivating harv esting storage transportation extraction to the purification of ingredients to be used in the finished product must also comply with gmps the sponsor also needs to demonstrat that the pharmaceutical ingredient contains allergens antinutrients toxic compounds or heavy metals or other materials from the host plant that could adversely affect the sa fety or effectiveness of the pharmaceutical under nepa fda must consider the potential environmental impact of its decisions most drugs and biologics are eligible for exclusion from this rule because their ingredients are manufactured in enclosed facilities many plan tmade pharmaceuticals likely would be field produced and not necessa rily be excluded however it is likely that fda would defer to aphis for environmental reviews of pharmaceutical plants grown outdoors fda reviews for nepa would probably focus on potential environmental impacts posed by uses after harvest that are not subject to aphis oversight fda is evaluating number of regula tory options should plantbased ge pharmaceutical ingredients end up in the f ood supply should this happen fda might consider the food adulterated and take some sort of admin istrative action some critics of current rules have suggested the agency approve plantmade pharmaceutical proteins as if they were food additives in such instances if trace amounts were found in food the food would not be considered adulterated automati cally and there might not be need for recall6 however the food additiv approval process is length and costly in addition by establishing acceptable levels the agency is stating that this material is safe for consumers which may not be true for th reasons agency officials do not want to spend limited resources establishing ac ceptable levels when the pharmaceutical ingredients are not ordinarily found in f ood an fda official told crs personal communication january 17 2003 he added th at because of cons umer reaction food manufacturers are unlikely to accept such material regulatory concerns and issues the prodigene case in 2002 material from gealtered corn plants that had been testplanted in prior growing season in nebraska for pharmaceutical use for prodigene inc was inadvertently mixed w ith some 500000 bushels of soybeans which had to be quarantined by usda to keep them out of the food supply in december 6 2002 press release usda announced that prodi gene had agreed to pay civil penalty of 250000 to reimburse usda for destroying the beans post 1 million bond and meet higher field testing compliance standards usda officials observed that the soybeans never reached the food or feed supply evidence that current regulatory oversight is effective critics countered that the prodigene case illust rates the dangers of growing plantbased drugs and predic ted consumer backlash if government regulation is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21418crs6 strengthened proponents argue that careful management and oversig ht of test sites can address such concerns nonetheless concerns persist am ong both consumer groups and the food manufacturing industry about producing ge plantmade pha rmaceuticals in food crops these critics believe that any crossconta mination of th food suppl could create situation in which fda would consider such foods adulterated under safe food law and subject to enforcement actions some food industry representatives want 100 prevention systems in place before the firs t product is commercia lized some critics suggest that only nonfood crops should be us ed for ge plantmade pharmaceuticals or at minimum that ge food plants shed po llen other potential issues include whether manufacturers of plantbased pharmaceuticals will be able to maintain consistency in dosages and overall quality and unanticipated environmental problems eg threatening endangered species regulatory modifications even before the prodigene incident regulators were reassessing oversight procedures for ge crops in general and plantbased pharmaceuticals in particular also aphi s published in the march 10 2003 federal register notice tightening permit conditions for any 2003 field sts of ge plants with pharmaceutical and industrial traits the new changes include 1 traditional corn can be grown within one mile of pharmaceutical or industrial field st sites involving openpollinated corn and within onehalf mile of test sites for controlled pollinated corn twice the prior distance rules and border rows of nontransgenic co rn longer can be used to reduce these distances 2 for all pharmaceuti cal crops corn and other fallow zones around test sites are doubled to 50 feet 3 restrictions on what can be grown on test site and fallow zone in the next growing season 4 use of dedicat ed machinery eg harvesters planters and storage facilities for both the product and mach inery to be used only for pharmaceutical production adequate cleaning for other uses is longer acceptable 5 equipment cleaning and seed cleaning and drying procedures must be submitted for aphis approval 6 an aphisapproved staff nd cooperator training program 7 an increase in aphis field site inspections from one per season to five per season plus two visits the following year to look for any volunteer plants 8 more recordkeeping requirements in the january 23 2004 federal register aphis published notice of its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement eis evaluating its biotechnology regulations generally and requesting public comment on number of possible changes these include whether to broaden ap hiss regulatory scope to cover ge plants that may pose noxious weed risk or may be used as biolog ical control agents whether to establish new categories for field testing that delineat requirements based upon relative levels of potential risk and whether to change ie strengthen its environmental reviews and permit conditions for ge plants producing pharmaceuticals and industrials the agency received over 3000 comments on its proposal aphis was expected to publish draft eis sometime in 2005 another focal point has been draf t document published september 6 2002 guidance for industry drugs biologi cs and medical devices derived from bioengineered plants for use in humans and animals available at
