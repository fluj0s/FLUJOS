april 2007 the agencies offered banks and thrifts favorable cra considerations if they established low and moderateincome lmi homeowner program that would transition troubled borrowers from higher to lowercost loans to help mitigate the impact of subprime mortgage lending on the housing market and the economy3 several states also have separate community reinvestment laws applicable to banking institutions under their supervision as an obligation associated with the safety net of federal deposit insurance the current cra law does not cover credit unions or insurance and securities companies it imposes statutorily set rules cra literally requires that federal banking regulatory agency evaluate how each of its regulated institutions affirmatively meets the credit needs of its entire community including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution and take such record into account in its eval uation of an applica tion for deposit facility by such institution it thus encourages socially responsible funding and deposit services to areas and entities of low and moderateincome its application often involves sociological

institutions ratings as whole and for each state of operation or metropolitan area if in two or more states larger banks receive more cra scrutiny than smaller ones since large institutions generally

rmation acquisition or merger of bank holding companies or statemember banks ve been denied by the federal reserve board since 19888 as result these numbers reveal very little about how cra ratings influence regulators denial of bank and thrift expanded activities since an institution could receive rating of needs improvement or substantial noncompliance and still get approval one reason is that applicants are able to resubmit their applications later when they make the necessary cra improvements consequently rating below satisfactor carries only psychological penalty including potentially bad press burden or benefit some bankers have identified cra as the most burdensome regulation placed upon them and view it as an obligation similar to tax without offsetting return they view cra as forcing them to provide charity type loans for societal payoffs to some it might appear to destroy value in the banking industry as banks make fewer pr ofitable community development loans that lower

requirements in september 2006 the agencies issued guidance on subprime lending22 it was restrictive in tone it warned banks of the risk posed by nontraditional mortgage loans includi ng interestonly and paymentoption adjustablerate mortgages the agencies expressed concern about these loans because of the lack of principal amortization and the potential for negative amortization after rapid rise of for eclosures on subprime mortgages in april 2007 the agencies indicated th at since significant tion of the problem subprime mortgages were made to low and mode rateincome households those

us ed to allocate cra credits for banking institutions investments in programs such as low income housing tax credit lihtc funds these lihtc funds provide banking institutions tax credit which lowers the investing institutions tax liabilities and earns them cra credits for complying with the community reinvestment act of 1977 unfortunately the description of the methods gave the impression that the regu lators had made changes to the methods they are using to allocate cra credits the result was that institutions and their representatives began to contact members of congress and regulators urging them to change it back specifically the complaints were that the regulators were prorating the cra credit given to institutions for their investments in low income area community developments according to the investme nts proximity to the geographic area in which the banks operate this is likely to reduce the incentive for these institutions to make such investments the regulators began doing this to make sure that the cracredited investments were being made in the communities from which the institutions garnered their deposits in fact the regulators did not change their methods of allocating cra credits the proration was only applicable to investments in national funds whose numbers have grow n dramatically in recent years for these funds the regulators ve always prorated the cra credits because nation funds are likely to be invested in low income areas outside the banks geographic area therefore the regulators prorate the cra credits according to the amount an institution invests in the nati onal fund in relationship to the total investment of the fund and where the fund makes its investments if the national fund makes investments in low income communities in the banks geographic area the bank would get cra credit for its investment in that fund on the other hand statewide and regiona l investments continue to get 100 cra credits favorable cra considerations were offered by the fdic in its guideline to encourage banks to offer affordable smalldollar loans while the guideline does not prescribe the specific nature of the smalldollar loans the fdic intends these

brief summary of the provisions the stated purpose of hr 1289 is to enhance the availability of capital and credit for all citizens and communities to ensure that community reinvestment keeps pace as banks securities firms and othe r financial services providers become affiliates as result of th enactment of the gramml eachbliley act and for other purposes the bill has three titles and 32 sections the first provision would repeal the regulatory agencies 2005 rules discu ssed above applicable to the community reinvestment act of 1977 and reinstate the banking ag encies regulations in effect before the publication of the revisions hr 1289 would amend the bank holding company act of 1956 bhca to ma ke nonbank affiliate s of bank holding companies subject to cra if they engage in lending or offering of bankingproduct services at minimum satisfactory cra rating would be required for securities firms mortgage banks or insurance company affiliates of financial holding companies to be cra

securitized loans bna banking report march 29 2007 p 34 httppubsbnacomipbna bbdnsfeha0b4e9g9conclusion the cra is now being examined from number of different perspectives including its role in regulatory relief s ubprime lending relief and smalldollar loans as well as expanding cra to other nonba nking financial services from the perspective of regulatory relief cra has been described by some bankers as burdensome both in terms of paperwork and the opportun ity costs of alternative investments consequently to relieve smaller banks of this regulatory burden the agencies 2005 rules changes simplified th compliance requirements for smaller institutions in addition congress passed th financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 that reduced the frequency of onsite examinations of smaller banking institutions consumer advocates argue that regulatory relief has weakened cra enforcement the community reinvestment moderniz ation act of 2007 would repeal the 2005 rules and require the nonbanking aff iliates of bank holding companies to comply with cra it would also extend cra to other the banking activities of nonbanking affiliates if bank holding companies are conducting more banking activities through their insurance securities and mortgage banking affiliates and away from the holding companies banks the act could increase low and moderateincome community lending this implies that the cra requirements in hr 1289 may directly counter the promised benefits of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which regulates the commingling of financial services the reason is that hr 1289 would require cra complia nce of the services provided by the holding companies for example securities and insurance activities will now have to comply with the cra under current law these affiliates are not required to comply with the cra the regulatory agencies use of cra cred its in their guidance lacks consistency consumer advocates supported regulators fforts to use cra credits to encourage banking institutions to offer programs that extend smalldollar loans to lmi individuals and families to reduce their dependence on moreexpensive payday lenders and autotitle loan providers the regulators also have consumer groups support for their efforts to provide fina ncial assistance to subprime borrowers according to the fdic general council sa ra kelsey we encourage bankers to play this role and will be supportiv of such restructuring efforts as we were in similar efforts by banks following hurricane katrina such efforts will be considered as meeting the goals of the community reinvestment act26 but the guidance is in conflict with the september 2005 guidance on subprime lending which warns of the risk in making these types of cracredited loans this apparent inconsistency suggests that more concrete guidan ce that balances safety and soundness requirements with lenders ability to offer credit to lmi individuals and families is necessary to be able to hold banks and their regulators accountable in their role in eliminating the subprime lending nd predatory lending concerns
