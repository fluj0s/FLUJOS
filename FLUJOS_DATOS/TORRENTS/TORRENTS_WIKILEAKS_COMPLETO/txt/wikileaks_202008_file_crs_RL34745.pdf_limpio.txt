when government officials become aware of an impending disaster they may take steps to protect citizens before the incident occurs evacuation of the geographic area that may be affected is an option to ensure public safety if implemented properly evacuation can be an effective strategy for saving lives evacuations and decisions to evacuate how ever can also entail complex factors and elevated risks decisions to evacuate may require officials to balance potentially costly hazardous or unnecessary evacuations against the possibility of loss of life due to delayed order to evacuate some observers of evacuations notably that from new orleans during hurricane katrina claim evacuations pose uni challenges to certain segments of society from their perspective speci alneeds populations the transitdependent and individuals with pets faced particular rdships associated with the storm this they claim is because some evacuation plans and the way in which they were carried out appeared to inadequately address their particular circumstances or needs in responding to these challenges th ensenator obama introduced s 1685 in the 109th congress which would have directed the secretary of homeland security to ensure that each state provided detailed and comprehensive information regarding its predisaster and postdisa ster plans for the evacuation of individuals with special needs in emergencies presidentelect obama indicated during his campaign that he would continue to pursue similar evacuation polices another facet of evacuation is sheltering displaced individuals for shortterm sheltering federally provide d resources include food wa ter cots and essential toiletries when displaced individuals need longterm sheltering federal policy provides financial assistance for alternative accommodations such as apartments motels and hotels recreationa l vehicles and modular units while federal law provides for certain aspects of civilian emergency evacuation evacuation policy generally is established and enforced by state and local officials in the 110th congress members of congress focu sed in part on policy options that addressed issues of equity during evacuations as well as attempts to integrate federal state and local evacuation efforts more fully examples of such legislation introduced in the 110th congress include hres 1376 hr 534 hr 535 hr 1269

evacuation policy issues for congress introduction1 threats of impending disasters such as hurricanes floods volcanic eruptions the movement of airborne hazardous material or uns table conditions at nuclear power plants may provide officials an opportunity to save lives by encouraging or mandating civilian evacuation moving population out of harms way through evacuation can save lives and substantially reduce exposure to hazards evacuations however can create complex challenges for officials and emergency managers for example officials need to time the evacuation accurately to ensure the impending disaster does not occur while people are evacuating evacuations can also be hazardous reportedly more people died during the hurricane rita evacuation than from the actual hurricane2 officials also need to ta ke into account individuals who lack adequate transportation or have special needs specialneeds individuals generally require more time to prepare to evacuate and travel out of the area in such cases it may be safer to have the speci alneeds population remain in the area and shelter in place3 evacuation has three basic components first is the departure of people from stricken or threatened ar ea second is the temporary resettlement of evacuees and the provision of shelter and re sources to them third is the final return of evacuees to either to their predisaster residence or an alternate location this report examines the federal role in the removal and return of citizens from affected areas4 the report reviews potential lessons learned from the hurricane katrina5 evacuation it also suggests several policy options that congress might consider if it wished to integrate federal state and local evacuation efforts more fully or address some of the social disparities that could complicate or hinder evacuationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34745crs2 6 the appendix to this report identifies selected federal statutory citations that appear to be most pertinent to domestic evacuation this report does not comprehensively review all federal evacuation policies 7 state laws generally authorize governors to order and enforce the evacuation of residents under

eligible activities and funding by keith bea 9 42 usc 5192a1examples of federal evacuation policy in general federal policy defers to the states to enact laws pertinent to evacuation6 using authority from state laws and local ordinances state and local officials may suggest or require the evacuation of residents from homes and communities before certa in catastrophes occur7 rather than taking the lead in evacuations the federal government facilitates the evacuation process through federal statutes that authorize agency heads to use federal resources to assist in the evacuation of civilians brief descriptions of four federal authorities follow stafford act prehurricane katrina the robert t stafford disaster and relief emergency assistance act hereafter the stafford act authorizes the president to direct the secretary of defe nse to use resources to perform necessary emergency work to preserve life and property this may take place even before the president issues major disaster or emergency declaration8 the president may also issue the declaration before the incident to lessen or avert the threat of catastrophe by providing assistance for precautionary evacuations 9 stafford act post hurricane katrina as mentioned previously the final component of an evacuation is the return of evacuees to their predisaster residences or if needed to alternativ locations as amended by the post katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 hereafter the post katrin act section 425 of the stafford act states that the president may provide transportation assistance to relocate individuals displaced from their pr edisaster primary residences as result of an incident or otherwise transporte d from their predisaster primary residences to and from alternative locations for s hort or longterm accommodation or to return an individual or household to their predis aster primary reside nce or alternative location as determined by the president u nder this authority the role of the federal government has been expanded not only to assist in the removal of citizens but to return disaster victims or to relocate them scant information exists on the implementation of this relatively new authority for the return of evacuees to their predisaster residence the issue of returning evacuees to their residences will be touched on later in the report national response

management agency fema and the partment of homeland security dhs establishes the roles and responsibilities of federal nd certain nonfederal entities when incidents overwhelm state or local governments for example the nrf identifies state local and tribal gove rnments as having the responsibility of ordering the evacuation of persons from any portions of the state threatened by the incident giving consideration to the re quirements of specialneeds populations and those with household pets or service animals10 the nrf includes incident annexes which are documents that address specific hazard situations11 one of the annexes the mass evacuation incident annex assigns dhs and fema the responsib ility of coordinatin g mass evacuations with the support of other federal ag encies and nonprofit organizations the annex also provides overall guidance for integrating the efforts of federal state local and tribal governments during the evacuation of large numbers of people according to the annex federal support to mass evacuation operations will be provided at the statetribal level and scaled to the incident regardless of the scale of the incident coordination among numerous command entities will be required to carry out the major functions of evacuation operations12 national hurricane program established in 1985 femas national hurricane program nhp helps protect communities from hurricane hazards through various projects and activities the nhp also provides assistance to state and local agencies in developing hurricane evacuation pl ans one of the ways this is achieved is through nhps hurricane evacuation studies hes hes helps states and localities determine the probable effects of hurricane identify appropriate shelters and predict public response to hurricane and hurri cane advisories13 nhp also conducts hazard and vulnerability analyses for coastal communities analyses include an assessment of hurricanes impact review of existing roads and transportation systems and an anal ysis of the population eg demographic characteristics the information gained from analyses helps communities determine evacuation zones areas vulnerable to th

teach transportation planners journal of transportation engineering vol 132 11 january 2006evacuations lessons learned general lessons learned from evacuations studies on evacuations have identified several techniques that can make evacuations more effective for example informing citizens about evacuation routes and shelter locations as part of community preparedness activity can help reduce the amount of time it takes for household to evacuate without this info rmation households are generally slow to react to an evacuation order14 making provisions such as gasoline portable restrooms and water available along the route can also positively influence the effectiveness of an evacuation having tow trucks along egress routes to move vehicles can also help to keep the roads clear15 the use of hazard analyses and evacu ation analyses may also produce more effective evacuation hazard analyses are used to identify areas susceptible to hazards impact evacuation analyses asse ss the size of the affected population and its capability to transport itself additi onally evacuation analyses help identify modes of transportation to be used in th evacuation and potential evacuation routes these lessons were derived primarily from disasters and emergencies such as wildfires hazardous material spills and hurricanes that would not be categorized as largescale or catastrophic incident the evacuations as result of some of these do not involve longterm displacement or the need to evacuate large population hurricane katrina and rita however did ffer lessons on largescale evacuations lessons learned from hurricane katrina and rita hurricanes katrina and rita increased our knowledge of evacua tions from largescale incidents studies and reports covering the evacuations prompted by hurricane katrina also found techniques that make evacuations more effective16 in general they stated that implementation of the evacuations of many of the individuals ffected by hurricane katrina went relatively smoothly because of successful evacuation procedures some examples of these procedures include the use of traffic manage ment techniques such as contraflow making the inbound nd outbound lanes unid irectional which proved to be very effective the use of conference calls to coordinate evacuation efforts also produced positive results however reports also asserted that other aspects of the evacuations needed significant improvement the evacuation of new orleans and jefferson parish washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34745crs5 17 douglas brinkley the great deluge new york

washington gp 2006 pp 594595particularly troublesome in fact they were so problematic they tended to negatively shape public perception of the evacuation as whole one account that criticized the hurricane katrina evacua tion said that the call to evacuate appeared to be weak bureaucratic and confusing17 perhaps as result of such criticisms calls to evacuate during hurricane ike18 used stronger language to convey the seriousness of the event it is unclear however if stronger language was more effective than other factors in getting individuals to heed notices to evacuate another factor that influenced the way in which people were evacuated for hurricane ike was the experience of gasoline shortages and gridlock in some disasters phenomenon known as shadow evacuation takes place shadow evacuations consist of individuals leaving the area w ithout being told to do so during the hurricane rita evacution nonmandated depart ures burdened evacuation routes and created fuel shortages in hurricane ike efforts such as persuading individuals in nonevacuation zones not to leave and as king families not to evacuate in multiple vehicles helped redu ce shadow evacuations19 the hurricane katrina evacu ations also underscored the significance of timing an evacuation according to one view rge metropolitan areas generally need 48 hours to evacuate for louisiana the pr eferred minimum amount of time to conduct major evacuation is 72 hours20 however the earlier an evacuation is ordered the greater the likelihood there will be an error in the weather forecast the inability to predict storm track compounds the difficu lties of evacuation decision making in the case of hurricane katrina evacuati ons were declared late or not at all in two of louisianas most populous ar eas new orleans and jefferson parish according to one congressional report more complete evacuation of these areas could have saved lives nd reduced human suffering21 another congressional report concluded that the incomplete evacuation led to the need for posthurricane evacuation federal state and local offi cials had not anticipated the need for second evacuation as consequence problems in communication lack of situational awareness and shortage of bus drivers re sulted in poor implementation of the second evacuation22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34745crs6 23 examples of specialneeds

experienced difficulty durin g the evacuations some households who wished to leave the area could not because of lack of transportation special needs populations were underserved because some were too frail for transport24 others depended on service an imals animals that are trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities such as gu iding people who are blind alerting people who are deaf or pulling wheelchairs some of these individuals were helpless because their animals could not navigate flooded streets others elected not to evacuate because shelters had provisions for their pets and they feared leaving their pets behind much of the posthurricane katrina legislation is directed at these problems for example some of the legislation enacted after hurricane katrina includes grants for states and localities to develop evacuation plans and ensure that these plans include provisions for special needs popula tions another example is legislation directed toward ensuring that evacuati on plans address indivi duals with household pets and service animals table 1 in the appendix to this report includes some of this legislation finally the house report25 concluded that the responsibility to evacuate did not reside solely within the government ma ny individuals were aware of the need to evacuate but chose not to some had waite d out hurricanes in the past and believed they could do the same for hurricane katrina others simply failed to recognize the seriousness of the hurricane despite the severity of the event the amount of evacuation planning that takes place and the necessary resources at hand there will always be individuals who choose to remain in the affected area potential congressional issues during review of issues related to evacuation displacement and sheltering policies congress might move to consider options for better integrating federal state and local efforts during evacuati on congress might also review options addressing issues of ine quity

adequate documents for personal identification problem for many victims as result of being evacuated from their homes or the loss of or damage to persona l items and records has specific consequences under immigra tion laws enforcement of immigration laws may also inhibit foreign nationa ls access to emergency disaster relief according to 401 of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 unauthorized aliens are elig ible for shortterm inkind emergency disaster relief and services or assistance that deliver inkind services at the community level provide assistance without individual terminations of each recipients needs and are necessary for the protection of life and safety unauthorized aliens who are receiving federal disaster aid however have immunity from deportation according to dhs officials in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 many displaced aliens reportedly feared that seeking government help might lead to their deportation dhs arrested detained and ordered deported an unspecified number of unauthorized aliens displaced by the 2005 hurricanes29 it is possible that this situation may inhibit those who fear deportation from evacuating potentially placi ng these individuals at risk during catastrophic incidents congress might ect to review the relationship between evacuation policy and immigration policy

of west virginia and the commonwealth of pennsylvania or their signees be incorporated into efforts to integrate the activities of federal state and local governments in the national capital region technology congress might consider expanding fema grants for the research and development of emerging t echnologies that could improve evacuation planning and decisionmaking such dvances in technology include the use of geographic information systems gis to help emergency managers make more informed decisions regarding evacuations some of the ways in which gis can be used are determining efficient evacuation routes and identifying and mapping areas containing populations who might have difficulty evacuating eg nursing home residents hospital patients and nonenglish speaking groups recently gis and aerial photography were combined to creat realtime application called virtual alabama the program offers panoramic view of the alabama coastline allowing emergency mangers to direct assets and responders where th ey are needed most the program also allows for realtime evacuation routing and vehicle and asset tracking31 citizenevacuation system is also being developed that employs radiofrequency identification rfid and wireless technologies to help individuals during emergencies and disasters wh finished the system should provide realtime information on evacuees to assist officials in tracking the evacuation of specialneeds populations and tracking indivi duals to help reun ite families after an emergency or disaster the system is also designed to help reduce the number of dangerous searchandrescue operations that need to be conducted during and after disasters32 another example of an em erging technology might be software tool that applies operations research methods to help emerge ncy managers better decide whether and when to order evacuations33 using operation research methods enables modeler to identify bottlenecks in evacuations and used to predict

optimize the location of relief supplies before hurricane made landfall34 congress could consider approaches for making such technology more readily available to state and local emergency managers or fund further research in the area reentry into evacuated zones evacuation policy may present difficult choices to inhabitants of hazardous areas individuals who choose not to evacuate remain in their residences and retain access to their property whereas in some instances evacuees may not be granted reentry to their residences for prolonged periods of time this tension may be problematic for the implementation of evacuation policy for at least two reasons first it creates disincentive to evacuate and potentially places individuals at risk because some ma be concerned about being absent from their property for prolonged period second it may create an inequity between those who evacuate and those who stay because those who remain may be able to protect their property and begin the recovery process more quickly than those who evacuate if this topic were of inte rest congress might explore options related to this tension for example congress might create incentives for individuals to evacuate and create mechanisms to ensure timely yet safe return to an evacuated area many city and count codes require dama ged residences to be inspected before individuals are allowed to reenter their hom after large disasters however there often is lack of inspectors available for conducting inspections if this were of concern congress might consider expanding the stafford acts public assistance program35 to include programs that bring outside inspectors to an affected area to hasten the inspection process citizen participation in evacuation planning it has been argued that the success of an evacuation is significantly enhanced when citizens participate in evacuation planning citizens are less likely to resist evacuation orders when there is increased citizen particip ation because they believe they had say in how the evacuations should be conducted36 congress might explore options for increasing citizen participation in state and local evacuation planning such options might increase citizen buyin and could lead to more complete evacuations evacuation fatigue hurricanes generally occu r in close succession which sometimes necessitates more than one evacuation under such circumstances individuals may become burne d out and reluctant to heed orders to evacuate this was concern for officials during hurricane ike they stated that evacuation fatigue may have contributed to an incomplete ev acuation if congress wished to addresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34745crs10 37 the national advisory council nac advises the administrator of fema on all aspects of

transportation assistance to relocate displaced individuals to and from alternative locations for short or longterm accomm odation or to return an individual or household to their predisaster primary residence or alternative location this amendment expands the role of the federal govern ment beyond merely assisting states and localities in evacuations by authorizing the federal government to return evacuees to their predisaster re sidence furthermore administering the return of evacuees raises i ssues that may involve oversig ht by congress if evacuees were flown out of the area does the fede ral government cover the cost for return airfare or can the return of evacuees be accomplished with less expensive mode of transportation such as bus ce the hurricane katrina evacuation many individuals and households have purchased new furnishing and belongings is the federal government res ponsible to pay for the return of these belongings if so the federal government may have to reimburse individuals and households for such items as moving vans and rental trucks if individuals and households do not get reimbursed for moving their belongings some may not have the economic means to do so themselves on august 13 2008 the national advisory committee nac37 stated that while it s upports the re turn of disaster victims to their homes when transported by fema nac could not reach consensus on how to proceed with the return policy and identified some concerns relating to the issue38 for one nac noted that providing transportation for evacuees back to their homes may prove to be difficult for fema to manage another concern was the clarity of the policy nac requested that fema establish clear guidance concerning the criteria for transportation assistance some may argue that such concerns may indicate need for congressional oversight if this amendmen t proves costly or difficult to administer congress may elect to reexamine this policy concluding observations prior to hurricane katrina evacuations were primarily state and local responsibility because of lessons learned from hurricane katrina federal policy has become more active and establishes standards to be

obamas platform of addressing th requirements of specialneed s populations in evacuation policy may also deepen federal involvement39 as the federal government becomes mo re involved in evacuations there may be fundamental shift in the roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved in evacuations federal assumption of more responsibility in evacuations creates standards and guidelines
