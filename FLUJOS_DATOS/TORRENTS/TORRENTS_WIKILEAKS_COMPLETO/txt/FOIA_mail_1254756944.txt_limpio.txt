from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to kbriffaueaacuk subject message from tom wigley date mon oct 5 113544 2009 keith heres message from tom it might be worth sending anything youve got to him to have look through shorter responses are probably better detail can go in poster pointing out how often or not yamal is used is useful i dont think they have done this i think many people confuse this with the polar urals chronology that is different and it is based on density mm rely on people not checking cheers phil date mon 05 oct 2009 035757 0600 from tom wigley wigleyucaredu useragent thunderbird 20014 windows20080421 to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re geo re ccnet scientific scandal unfolds xcanitchi2 000 xbayesprob 00001 score 0 tokens from rptn f028 xspamscore 030 hold at 500 porn_rp_nastyspfnone0 xcanitprostream ueaf028 inherits from ueadefaultbasedefault xcanitstatsid 32219749 e7f62debf1d6 xantispamtrainingforget 1httpscanitueaacukbphpi32219749me7f62debf1d6cf xantispamtrainingnonspam 2httpscanitueaacukbphpi32219749me7f62debf1d6cn xantispamtrainingspam 3httpscanitueaacukbphpi32219749me7f62debf1d6cs xscannedby canit www roaringpenguin com on 139222131184 phil it is distressing to read that american stinker item but keith does seem to have got himself into mess as i pointed out in emails yamal is insignificant and you say that contrary to what mm say yamal is not used in mbh etc so these facts alone are enough to shoot down mm is few sentences which surely is the only way to go complex and wordy responses will be counter productive but more generally even if it is irrelevant how does keith explain the mcintyre plot that compares yamal12 with yamalall and how does he explain the apparent selection of the less wellreplicated chronology rather that the later better replicated chronology of course i dont know how often yamal12 has really been used in recent post1995 work i suspect from what you say it is much less often that mm say but where did they get their information i presume they went thru papers to see if yamal was cited pretty foolproof method if you ask perhaps these things can be explained clearly and concisely but i am not sure keith is able to do this as he is too close to the issue and probably quite pissed of and the issue of withholding data is still hot potato one that affects both you and keith and mann yes there are reasons but many good scientists appear to be unsympathetic to these the trouble here is that withholding data looks like hiding something and hiding means in some eyes that it is bogus science that is being hidden i think keith needs to be very very careful in how he handles this id be willing to check over anything he puts together tom prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk references 1 httpscanitueaacukbphpi32219749me7f62debf1d6cf 2 httpscanitueaacukbphpi32219749me7f62debf1d6cn 3 httpscanitueaacukbphpi32219749me7f62debf1d6cs
