untitled document supposing every postulate would stick think of that for moment supposing every postulate you made would stick supposing every time you said i wish i was dead there you lay really wouldnt that be wonderful but supposing every time you said i can best serve this situation by being old and feeble and you were and supposing you said oh childhood childhood those were the times dadada so one of the best things this awareness of awareness unit does is hold gun on itself it says well these postulates are not going to stick im going on being joe jones and if i had my way of it i would be joe jones bessie smith pt barnum greyhound dog probably all in the course of half an hour and this would be disconcerting to my friends so i will take mercy on one and all and just be joe jones you could imagine how disconcerting it would be to have friend like that he makes postulate and there he is in full mass that would be upsetting so we do all sorts of devious things to keep from obeying all of our postulates at will because we know we cant trust ourselves of course thats the first thing we have to know and we do all kinds of things to make it automatic so that we will become surprised about it excerpted from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures an independent attitude toward existence an article by l ron hubbard from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures i have had this odd experience i have been on ship which was having very hard time struggling in high seas and high winds which had its engines disabled and i had rescue party drop aboard all the sailors were convinced that the ship was going to pound itself to pieces and go down this was really not justified conclusion it was just that the sea was so violent that it appeared to be likely but they had all come to the conclusion that they were going through their last days right there in those last minutes each minute about twelve years long and the rescue party dropped down on the deck of the ship and didnt share this conclusion and three men in rescue party did work which twentyeight men on the derelict had been unable to accomplish and the three men in the rescue party did it in about ten minutes where the others had failed for almost ten hours different set of conclusions same situation same ship of course you could say well the crew that was already aboard were tired so was the rescue party they had to row across three miles of open sea to get there they were twice as tired as the boys who were still aboard so we conclude there that you must be able to have an independent attitude toward existence regardless of the circumstances of existence it is obviously possible to have an independent attitude toward existence independent of an existing attitude toward existence and it is not necessarily certain that the independent attitude of existence is going to succumb to the general attitude of existence this is not an absolute certainty well we started out talking about postulates person can have an independent attitude toward existence regardless of what is going on and make things better or worse at will to the degree that he retains his confidence and faith in himself and his ability to make postulates he can say he feels this way and he feels this way but he has to be able to trust himself to say that he should be able to say i can persevere i can succeed and then succeed he should also be able to say well i guess ill fail this time and simply fail he would have to be alike unimpressed by winning or losing he would have to be somewhat unimpressed but he would be able to do that he could then take command of the existing situation or better any situation without being tremendously influenced by the circumstances which surround him what do we call this we call this selfdeterminism an individual then is as capable of happiness or livingness i would rather call it livingness he is as capable of living as he is capable of determining the actions of himself and others by simple postulate and an individual who can do this is giant amongst his fellows and an individual who cant has been is and always will be slave l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture component parts of beingness this lecture is available in the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures successes from listening to the congress lectures i had big win on the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures i listened to the first four lectures in one day my health started to improve i started to get more in communication with my body and my skin improved i was also able to rehabilitate perceptic the perceptic of gravity this was small win i was able to stay keyed out of my bank which before i was collapsed into i am functioning so much better without effort after rehabilitating this perceptic thank you to supposing every postulate would stick an independent attitude toward existence anatomy of the spirit of man congress successes from the congress lectures scientologist can make an individual well happy and grant him personal immortality simply by addressing the human spirit it could be said with scientology that we have entered the second age of miracles l ron hubbard culminating five years of steady advance the founding church of scientology had just been established in washington dc summoning scientologists to the first international congress in the nations capital ron opened with the lecture the hope of man and the title was more than apt for what he presented were the results of advancing technologyresults that could only be accurately described with single word miracles physical in naturedeaf children suddenly hearing crippled children shedding crutches and sight restored with eyeglasses discardedand yet all of it accomplished by exclusively addressing the thetan inherent to success was breakthrough explaining the factors of selfdeterminism and the very means to restore it in an individual and the implications of that discovery were fully epic in nature ron not only traces the history of all past religions but he also reveals how every one of their hoped for dreams can now be achieved here then is the congress to be looked back upon as watershed in history the advent of scientology as the worlds first practical religion you get 15 lectures on cd with transcripts glossary and supplement of
