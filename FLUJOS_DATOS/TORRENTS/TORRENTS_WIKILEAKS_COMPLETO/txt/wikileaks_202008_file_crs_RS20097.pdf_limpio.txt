support for ratification by the ited states while the house of representatives d oes not have direct role in treaty ratification the house sometimes expresses its view s on us ratification thus during the 105 congress h res 96 wasth introduced expressing the sense of the house that the senate should approve cedaw16 during womens day commemoration representative edward j markey stated that despite the fact that much of us law is already in compliance with the treaty ratification is proof that us commitmen t to human rights is sound and not limited to just within our borders participation by the untied states w ould lend significant weight to the treatys enforcement the u nited states played major role in drafting the treaty now it should stand by its commitment by ratifying it more recently representativ e17 constance morella expressed support for ratification cedaw will give the force of international law to our efforts on behalf of womens rights and also give us the credibility to be taken seriously on this issue when we advocate with foreign governments on behalf of human rights18 noncongressional supporters have made similar arguments they argue tha t ratification would allow the united states to participate in the committee on th elimination of discrimination against women and thus help to shape the interpretation of and development of practice under the treaty ratification would also strengthe n current us efforts to advance womens status globally domestically both federal and state laws in the united states already provide strong protections for women and ar largely consistent with the provisions of the convention proponents contend tha t ratification would not affect us sovereignty19 arguments against ratification in their minority views in the 19 94 senate foreign relations committee report sen ators brown coverdell gregg helms and kassebaum argued that they were not persuaded t hat the convention was proper or effective means of pursuing its objective they did not accept the premise that the standards set forth by the convention had been widely accepted by ratif ying states they noted that one in three ratifying states had made reserva tions to parts of the convention they also stressed that it is difficult to incorporate international legal codes into diverse cultural religious an d political systems20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20097crs6 for further information on concerns about human rights treaties see crs report 96736 21 human rights treaties some issues for us ratification this part is
