intervention to produce actionable intelligence this activity ranges from data processing to initial data interpretation to data posting for rapid disseminationaccess across the community it supports current intelligence issues and threats warningcombatcrisis operations and cu eing other intelligence collectors td is typically is performed on the operations floor and is singleint however in some cases the summary reporting can be multiint time constrainedcontentcentric exploitation tc3 timely data exploitation combined with more human analysis and interpretation than td to produce actionable intelligence the quality of the observable estimates is more accurate than td reporting tc3 supports combatcrisis operations and strategic policy decisions tc3 may require some specialized physical sciencescentric knowledge of geoin t phenomenology tc3 can be single int multisource andor multiint content dominant exploitation cd comprehensive signature and metric analysis of complex data sets cd supports combatcrisis operations policysystem acquisition decisions and or enhancement of collection sensors and exploitation toolsalgorithms in addi tion to providing content ie analysis of the event or scene it also provides context eg trends or background information and is an input to resear ch and development to create new tools and algorithms cd often requires highly specialized physical sciencescentric knowledge of geoint phenomenology it is almost always multiint product when other data is available unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouoagi is based on analysis of nonliteral images literal you can see the object you can generally study the shape or form and size of objects as means to classify characterize or identify nonliteral you are generally interested in all of the information that comprises pixel you use science and engineering to extract information from single or few pixels
