the text minus figures and links its subject to little revision but let know if there are any factual or emphasis issues that are perhaps misplaced thanks gavin of buckets and blogs this last week has been an interesting one for observers of how climate change is covered in the media and online on wednesday an interesting paper thompson et was published in nature pointing to clear artifact in the sea surface temperatures in 1945 and associating it with the changing mix of fleets and measurement techniques at the end of world war ii the mainstream media by and large got the story right puzzling anomaly tracked down corrections in progress after little scientific detective work consequences minor even though few headline writers got little carried away in equating specific dip in 1945 ocean temperatures with the more gentle 1940s1970s cooling that is seen in the land measurements however some blog commentaries have gone completely overboard on the implications of this study in ways that are very revealing of their underlying biases the best commentary came from john nielsengammons new blog where he described very clearly how the uncertainties in data both the known unknowns and unknown unknowns get handled in practice read this and then come back stoat quite sensibly suggested that its bit early to be expressing an opinion on what it all means but patience is not one of the blogospheres virtues and so there was shortage of people extrapolating wildly to support their pet hobbyhorses this in itself is not so unusual despite much advice to the contrary people the media and bloggers tend to weight individual papers that make the news far more highly than the balance of evidence that really underlies assessments like the ipcc but in this case the addition of little knowledge made the usual extravagances little more scientificlooking and has given it some extra steam like almost all historical climate data shipboard sea surface temperatures sst were not collected with long term climate trends in mind thus practices varied enormously among ships and fleets and over time in the 19th century simple wooden buckets would be thrown over the side to collect the water nontrivial exercise when ship is moving as many novice oceangoing researchers will painfully recall later on special canvas buckets were used and after wwii insulated buckets became more standard though these arent really buckets in the colloquial sense of the word as the photo shows pay attention to this because it comes up later the thermodynamic properties of each of these buckets are different and so when blending data sources together to get an estimate of the true anomaly corrections for these biases are needed for instance the canvas buckets give temperature up to 1c cooler in some circumstances that depend on season and location than the modern insulated buckets insulated buckets have slight cool bias compared to temperature measurements that are taken at the inlet for water in the engine room which is the most used method at present automated buoys which became more common in recent decades tend to be cooler than the engine intake measures as well the recent ipcc report had thorough description of these issues section 3b3 fully acknowledging that these corrections were work in progress and that is indeed the case the collection and digitisation of the ship logbooks is huge undertaking and continues to add significant amounts of 20th century and earlier data to the records this dataset icoads is continually growing and the impacts of the bias adjustments are continually being assessed the biggest transitions in measurements occurred at the beginning of wwii between 1939 and 1941 when the sources of data switched from european fleets to almost exclusively us fleets and who tended to use engine inlet temperatures rather than canvas buckets this offset was large and dramatic and was identified more than ten years ago from comparisons of simultaneous measurements of nighttime marine air temperatures nmat which did not show such shift the experimentally based adjustment to account for the canvas bucket cooling brought the sea surface temperatures much more into line with the nmat series folland and parker 1995 note that this reduced the 20th century trends in sst more recent work for instance at this workshop in 2005 has focussed on refining the estimates and incorporating new sources of data for instance the 1941 shift in the original corrections was reduced and pushed back to 1939 with the addition of substantial and dominant amounts of us merchant marine data which mostly used engine inlets temperatures the version of the data that is currently used in most temperature reconstructions is based on the work of rayner and colleagues reported in 2006 in their discussion of remaining issues they state using metadata in the icoads it is possible to compare the contributions made by different countries to the marine component of the global temperature curve different countries give different advice to their observing fleets concerning how best to measure sst breaking the data up into separate countries contributions shows that the assumption made in deriving the original bucket correctionsthat is that the use of uninsulated buckets ended in january 1942is incorrect in particular data gathered by ships recruited by japan and the netherlands not shown are biased in way that suggests that these nations were still using uninsulated buckets to obtain sst measurements as late as the 1960s by contrast it appears that the united states started the switch to using engine room intake measurements as early as 1920 they go on to mention the modern buoy problems and the continued need to work out bias corrections for changing engine inlet data as well as minor issues related to the modern insulated buckets for example the differences in colocated modern bucket and inlet temperatures are around 01 deg c from john kennedy however it is one thing to suspect that biases might remain in dataset sentiment shared by everyone it is quite another to show that they are really there the thompson et paper does the latter quite effectively by removing variability associated with some known climate modes including enso and seeing the 1945 anomaly pop out clearly in doing this in fact they show that the previous adjustments in the prewar period were probably ok though there is substantial additional evidence of that in any case see the references in rayner et 2006 the thompson anomaly seems to coincide strongly with the postwar shift back to mix of us uk and dutch ships implying that postwar bias corrections are indeed required and significant this conclusion is not much of surprise to any of the people working on this since they have been saying it in publications and meetings for years the issue is of course quantifying and validating the corrections for which the thompson analysis might prove useful the use of canvas buckets by the dutch japanese and some uk ships is most likely to blame and given the mix of national fleets shown above this will make noticeable difference in 1945 up to the early 1960s maybe the details will depend on the seasonal and areal coverage of those sources compared to the dominant us information the schematic in the independent is probably good first guess at what the change will look like remember that the ocean changes are constrained by the nmat record shown above so far so good the fun for the blogwatchers is what happened next what could one do to get the story all wrong first you could incorrectly assume that scientists working on this must somehow be unaware of the problems that is belied by the frequent mention of post wwii issues in workshops and papers since at least 2005 but never mind next you could conflate the buckets used in recent decades as seen in the graphs in kent et 2007s discussion of the icoads metadata with the buckets in the prewar period see photo above if you do make that mistake however you can extrapolate to get some rather dramatic if erroneous conclusions for instance that the effect of the corrections would be to halve the sst trend from the 1970s gosh the mismatch this would create with the independent nmat data series should not be mentioned but there is more you could take the incorrect prescription based on the bucket confusion apply it to the full global temperatures land included hmm and think that this merits discussion on whether the whole ipcc edifice had been completely undermined answer and it goes on the bucket confusion was pointed out but the complaint switches to the scandal that it wasnt properly explained all this shows is wishful thinking overcoming logic however many times there is similar rush to judgment that is subsequently showed to be based on nothing it still adds to the vast array of similar evidence that keeps getting trotted out by by the illinformed the excuse that these are just exploratory exercises in whatif thinking wears little thin when the what if always leads to the same desired conclusion this weeks playbyplay was quite revealing on that score gavin schmidt nasagoddard institute for space studies 2880 broadway tel 212 678 5627 new york ny 10025 gschmidtgissnasagov httpwwwgissnasagovgavin
