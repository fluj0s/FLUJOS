analyst in emergency management policy government and finance division the national response framework overview and possible issues for congress summary in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress and the president moved to consolidate numerous federal emergency plans into single unified national response plan the end product of these efforts was the national response plan nrp which established broad lines of authority for agencies responding to emergencies and major disasters perceived problems with the implementation of the nrp during hurricane katrina led congress to enact the postkatrina management reform act pl 109 295 to integrate preparedness and response authorities the legislation directed dhs to issue successor plan to the nrp entitled the national response framework nrf implemented in march 2008 the nrf establishes new approach to coordinating federal and nonfederal resources and entities the department of homeland security maintains that the nrf is an improvement over the nrp some however assert that the nrf is not an improvement because it does not fully address the problems and challenges associated with the nrp in the 110th congress members of congress focused in part on policy options that addressed issues concerning the nrf as well as attempts to coordinate federal state and local preparedness and response efforts more fully some examples of federal laws enacted in the 110th congress that have affected the nrf include implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 and the national defense

response framework overview and possible issues for congress in recent years congress and the president have devoted considerable attention to how the nation can best prevent prepare for respond to and recover from natural and humancaused disasters events such as the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and hurricane katrina of august 2005 have prompted congress and the president to require the development of plan for how government at all levels and also the nongovernmental sector should respond to all types of emergencies and disasters pursuant to statutory requirements and presidential directives the federal emergency management agency fema an agency located within the department of homeland security dhs issued such plan in march 2008 with publication of the national response framework nrf1 the nrf is the end product of long history prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the structure for responding to emergencies and disasters resided in at least 5 separate plans2 with the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 and sections 15 and 16 of the homeland security presidential directive 5 hereafter hspd5 congress and the president directed dhs to consolidate these plans into single integrated and coordinated national response plan and to develop national incident management system nims3 these efforts culminated in the initial national response plan nrp on october 10 2003 followed by the release of nims on march 1 2004 in august 2005 hurricane katrina made landfall followed shortly by hurricanes rita and wilma number of studies on the

homeland security and governmental continued crs2 the decision to revise the nrp partially based on these reports the revision of the nrp was also due to mandates in the postkatrina emergency management reform act of 2006 pl 109295 hereafter the postkatrina act in january 2008 dhs issued the nrf which took effect in march 2008 since that time the nrf has been the nations core response document providing structure for the response to such disasters as the 2008 midwest floods and california wildfires as well as hurricanes gustav and ike this report reviews selected statutory provisions related to the nrf and provides an overview of the document it discusses some of the reasons the bush administration revised the nrp as well as some controversial aspects of the review process the report also summarizes selected pending legislation concerning national response planning and concludes with discussion of issues over which congress might consider exercising oversight authorities establishing and influencing the nrf authority for the creation of the nrf emanates from numerous sources fema has described the nrf as being guided by 15 principal emergency authorities 48 other statutory authorities and regulations 17 executive orders and 20 presidential directives5 this report does not offer an exhaustive overview of these authorities rather this section discusses some of the major authorities establishing the nrf legislation that shaped the nrfs development and legislation tied to congressional oversight prehurricane katrina the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act hereafter the stafford act establishes the programs and processes by which the federal government provides emergency and major disaster assistance to states and localities individuals and qualified private nonprofit organizations section 611 of the stafford act authorizes the director of fema6 to prepare federal response plans and programs and to coordinate

officials after the terrorist attacks of september 11 congress passed the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 subsection 5026 required the consolidation of existing federal government emergency response plans into single coordinated national response plan8 the homeland security act also created dhs consolidating over 20 agencies including fema into single department under dhs fema retained both its authority to administer the provisions of the stafford act and its designation as the lead agency for the nations response plan on february 28 2003 president bush issued hspd5 section 16 of hspd5 directed the secretary to develop and submit for review to the homeland security council national response plan section 16 also mandated that the plan use an all discipline and allhazards approach in preparing for responding to and recovering from domestic incidents9 in december 2004 through the primary guidance and authorization of the stafford act the homeland security act and hspd5 dhs issued successor to the federal response plan which was entitled the national response plan nrp10 posthurricane katrina the nrp was in place and implemented for the hurricane katrina response in august 2005 the problems that arose from hurricane katrina prompted numerous studies some of these studies attributed the poor response in part to the implementation of the nrp concerned by perceived deficiencies in the nrp congress sought remedy through legislation in the post katrina act the postkatrina act provides the most comprehensive legislation concerning the nrp or any subsequent plans by mandating numerous adjustments to the nrp as well as mechanisms for oversight section 642 amended the stafford act and the homeland security act to mandate that the president develop national preparedness system11 section 643 further establishes that the president shall through the administrator of fema complete revise and update as necessary national preparedness goal to ensure the nations ability to prevent respond to recover from and mitigate against natural disasters acts of terrorism and other man made disasters12 it further states that the national preparedness goal to the extent possible should be consistent with nims and the nrp section 649b of the postkatrina act requires that the national preparedness goal nims and the nrp be subjected to clear and quantifiable

manmade disasters in support of the national response plan to ensure coordinated federal response16 in response to the postkatrina legislation and perceived problems with the implementation of the nrp dhs revised the plan and issued the nrf the following section describes the various components of the document overview of the nrf general approach the nrf is part of national strategy for homeland security it provides the doctrine and guiding principles for unified response from all levels of government and all sectors of communities to all types of hazards regardless of their origin17 although the primary focus of the nrf is on response and shortterm recovery the document also defines the roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved in all phases of emergency management18 the nrf is not an operational plan that dictates stepbystep process for responding to hazards rather the nrf appears to be an attempt to build flexibility into response efforts by setting up framework that dhs believes is necessary for responding to hazards within this framework the nrf gives users degree of discretion as to how they choose to respond to the incident components of the nrf document the nrf is organized into five parts the introductory chapter presents an overview of the entire document and explains the evolution of the nrf and identifies the various actors involved in emergency and disaster response the chapter also discusses the concepts undergirding emergency 13 6 usc 749 120 stat 1428 14 6 usc 749 120 stat 1429 15 6 usc 752 120 stat 1430 16 6 usc 753 sec 653a4 120 stat 1431 17 us department of homeland security national response framework released press release january 22 2008 httpwwwdhsgovxnewsreleasespr_1201030569827shtm 18 these phases are mitigation prevention response and recovery crs5 preparedness and response by providing list of what dhs describes as the five key principles of response doctrine19 the first chapter of the nrf entitled roles and responsibilities provides an overview of the roles and responsibilities of federal state and local governments the nonprofit and private sectors and individuals and households the first chapter also discusses the roles and responsibilities of those who hold various positions within these entities the second chapter entitled response actions describes and outlines key tasks as they pertain to what dhs calls the three phases of effective response these phases include prepare respond and recover preparing includes planning organizing equipping training exercising and conducting evaluations activities related to responding include gaining and maintaining situational awareness20 activating and deploying resources and capabilities coordinating response actions and demobilizing recover activities are broken down into two broad categories these are shortterm and longterm recovery the third chapter of the nrf entitled response organization discusses the organizational structure and staffing used to implement response actions all of which are based on nims and ics21 the nrf describes the organization and staffing structure of every entity responsible for preparedness and response in detail 19 these are 1 engaged partnership the nrf advocates for open lines of communication among various emergency management entities and for support partnerships during preparedness activities so that when incidents take place these various entities are able to work together 2 tiered response responses to incidents begin at the local level when local capacity is overwhelmed state authorities assist the locality likewise should the state be overwhelmed assistance from the federal government is requested 3 scalable flexible and adaptable operational capabilities as incidents change in size scope and complexity there needs to be corresponding change in the response apparatus 4 unity of effort through unified command clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each entity is necessary for effective response moreover effective response requires unit of effort within the emergency management chain of command 5 readiness to act all emergency management agencies to the extent possible should anticipate incidents and make preparations to respond swiftly to them 20 situational awareness refers to monitoring information regarding actual and developing incidents 21 ics establishes management system that helps agencies responding to an incident work together in coordinated and systematic approach crs6 the fourth chapter entitled planning describes the process of planning as it pertains to national preparedness and summarizes planning structures relative to the nrf the chapter describes the criteria for successful planning and offers example scenarios for planning the fifth and final chapter of the nrf entitled additional resources describes the 15 emergency support function esf annexes to the nrf eight support annexes and seven incident annexes22 these annexes are listed in tables 1 and 2 of this report the final chapter also explains that the nrf and its annexes are posted online through the nrf resource center which allows for ongoing revisions to the document23 reasons for replacing the nrp as mentioned earlier in the report several studies attributed the problematic response to hurricane katrina partly to the implementation of the nrp although the nrp was used for smaller emergencies and disasters prior to hurricane katrina the hurricane marked the first time the nrp was used for catastrophic incident the section that follows discusses how some of the changes in the nrf have addressed these criticisms difficulty in understanding the nrp the nrp was widely criticized as complicated and overly bureaucratic some said it was long and weighed down with technical language additionally users of the nrp reported that the document failed to clarify roles and responsibilities and that the federal chain of command was confusing24 it was further pointed out that the name national response plan was misnomer and hence misleading because it was not true operational plan in the sense that it did not provide stepbystep process for responding to an incident the nrf uses less technical language than the nrp and attempts to make the roles and responsibilities more transparent the nrf is also shorter whereas the nrp contained over 400 pages the nrf is roughly 80 pages still some have contested the clarity of the nrf this will be discussed in greater detail later in the report national versus federal focus despite efforts to make the nrp nationwide response plan the nrp was widely seen as not sufficiently national in its focus because it emphasized federal preparedness and response some have further 22 esfs provide the structure for coordinating federal interagency support for responses involving multiple federal agencies support annexes describe how federal state tribal and local entities as well as nongovernmental organizations ngos and the private sector coordinate and execute the common functional processes and administrative requirements for incident management incident annexes are specific hazard scenarios that require specialized and specific response efforts 23 nrf resource center httpwwwfemagovemergencynrf 24 thomas birkland and sarah waterman is federalism the reason for policy failure in hurricane katrina publius vol 38 4 fall 2008 p 706 crs7 argued that the process of creating the plan excluded nonfederal stakeholders such as states and localities25 according to dhs the nrf more clearly articulates the roles and responsibilities of nonfederal entities26 additionally when drafting the nrf dhs held outreach sessions to solicit the feedback of nonfederal partners27 the extent of nonfederal participation in the creation of the nrf has been questioned and is discussed later in this report confusion concerning the fco and the pfo one frequent criticism of the nrp was the ambiguity surrounding the relationship and role of the federal coordinating officer fco and the principle federal officer pfo the fco determines the types of relief most urgently needed establishes field offices and coordinates relief efforts28 the fco position is authorized by the stafford act immediately upon declaring major disaster section 302a of the stafford act requires the president to appoint an fco29 the pfo on the other hand is not legislatively authorized position rather the pfo position was created by dhs in the nrp the pfo is designated by the secretary of dhs and represents the secretary as the leading federal official and serves as the primary point of contact for state and local officials in hurricane katrina michael brown who was serving as the director of fema was additionally designated as the pfo william lokey served as the fco for louisiana to some observers such as the inspector general for dhs these roles created great deal of confusion during hurricane katrina because it appeared that two people were in charge of the relief operations30 congress focused on the confusion involving the pfo in the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110181 section 526 of the act states that none of the funds provided by this or previous appropriations acts shall be used to fund any position designated as principal federal official for any robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act declared disasters or emergencies 25 based on discussion with james kish senior director exercises and

implementation of the nrf the pfo position has not been used some have indicated that the position may be in the process of being phased out31 however dhs secretary chertoff designated pfos before the start of the 2008 hurricane season the move was viewed as controversial by some house transportation and infrastructure committee chairman james oberstar reportedly focused on the fact that congress had effectively eliminated the position and that designating pfos violated the consolidated appropriations act32 as previously pointed out the pfo position has not been used since the nrf was implemented reports on progress made since hurricane katrina several emergencies and disasters have taken place since implementation of the nrf in general responses to the nrf have been mixed some have indicated that its implementation has been successful33 one observer stated that coordination among federal state and local governments has improved34 in the case of hurricanes gustav and ike officials in texas related that the federal response to the hurricanes was good35 other officials have been ambivalent regarding the nrfs implementation noting that the scale of recent disasters has not warranted enough federal involvement to understand how well the nrf works36 review of various reports may hint at some problems however for instance during hurricanes gustav and ike state officials in texas said it was the local governments responsibility to set up distribution points for supplies however the local government claimed it was unaware of this responsibility37 such confusion may indicate that the nrf still does not clearly articulate the roles and responsibilities of state and local governments during emergencies and disasters other more serious criticisms of the nrf have surfaced since its implementation the following section discusses these in greater depth and highlights issues congress might examine or policy options it might consider 31 based on

comprehensive operational plans in the nrf homeland security presidential directive 8 hereafter hspd8 annex 1 issued in december of 2003 by president george w bush requires dhs to establish standardized federal planning process that integrates plans among all levels of government to date this standardized planning process has not been released the absence of standardized planning process was discussed in government accountability office gao tesitmony on preparedness for catastrophic disasters38 in the testimony gao pointed out that two supplements to the nrf are not completed these are federal partner response guides and the integrated planning system the partner guides are intended to provide ready reference of key roles and actions for federal state and local governments as well as nongovernmental and privatesector response partners the planning system is intended to assist all levels of government in working together collaboratively to create plans for various types of incidents39 similar concern over lack of operational plans was voiced by representative bennie thompson chairman of the house committee on homeland security in letter to the secretary of dhs representative thompson expressed concern that the incident annexes lack operational plans that detail how the federal government will respond to natural and humancaused disasters40 the catastrophic incident cyber incident and terrorism incident law enforcement and investigation annexes have yet to be updated41 some would argue that using these annexes which were developed for the nrp may create problems if they are invoked under the nrf for example the catastrophic incident annex discusses how catastrophic event may be designated as an incident of national significance ins an ins was intended as triggering mechanism for certain types of response strategies however the ins term has been eliminated from the nrfs lexicon some could argue that lack of operational plans in the nrf may warrant congressional oversight should dhs fail to release the federal partner response guides and the integrated planning system or update the remaining incident annexes in timely fashion congress might elect to consider the matter integrating nonfederal stakeholders in national planning criticism of the nrp was that input from nonfederal stakeholders such as state and local governments nonprofit groups and the private sector was poorly integrated 38 us government accountability office observations on dhss preparedness for catastrophic disasters gaogao08868t june 11 2008 39 ibid pp 1112 40 letter from rep bennie thompson chairman us house of representatives committee on homeland security to michael chertoff secretary of us department of homeland security october 9 2008 41 the catastrophic incident annex was not updated when this report was released since then new catastrophic incident annex has been issued this report will be updated at later date to reflect this change crs10 into the document congress addressed this issue in section 653 of the postkatrina act where congress required dhs and fema to develop operational plans with state local and tribal government officials42 according to gao report dhs initially included nonfederal stakeholder input in the creation of the nrf but later deviated from the process43 rather than disseminating the first draft of the nrf to stakeholders dhs conducted an internal review of the document gao found that the issuance of later draft to nonfederal stakeholders was delayed reducing the amount of time for the stakeholders to respond with comments on the draft additionally gao reported that dhs failed to establish femas national advisory council nac by the december 2006 deadline that was set forth in section 508 of the postkatrina act according to the act the nac is responsible for incorporating the input of state local and tribal governments and the private sector in the development and revision of the nrf44 the importance of meeting the congressional mandate has been addressed by one analyst donald kettl public policy professor at the university of pennsylvania has emphasized the importance of including local officials in the planning process according to kettl amount of national planning can sidestep the fact that the first indicator that something bad is happening is report from the frontlines45 in consideration of these conclusions some may argue that failing to integrate feedback from local emergency officials could 1 omit hazards that are known at the local level but not recognized by federal officials 2 miss an opportunity to integrate the lessons learned from local responders who have firsthand experience with emergencies and disasters and 3 fail to establish buyin to the plan at the state and local level thereby creating possible reluctance to execute the plan faithfully if the issue of nonfederal stakeholder input were of concern to congress it might move to conduct oversight on the extent to which dhs and fema are utilizing the nac and incorporating nonfederal stakeholders in all aspects of national emergency planning and revision children and disasters

gap in the level of emergency readiness between adult and pediatric care47 he noted that children are more vulnerable to hazardous materials than adults have unique treatment needs and require care from providers who have been specifically trained to meet these needs the witness stated however that federal state and local efforts in disaster planning have generally overlooked the unique needs of children separately mark shriver vice president and managing director of save the childrens us programs has stated that children are vulnerable during emergencies and evacuations according to shriver the needs of children are commonly overlooked before during and after disaster shelters for example often have unsanitary conditions and many communities lack sufficient stockpiles of diapers formula pediatric medications and childsize respirators48 in various legislative provisions congress has focused on the needs of children during disasters for example the postkatrina act contains provision to reunite children with their families by establishing within the national center for missing and exploited children new national emergency child locator center49 congress addressed the subject again in the consolidated appropriations act 2008 division g section 603 of the act establishes the national commission on children and disasters the purpose of the commission is to conduct comprehensive study to examine and assess the needs of children during disasters and submit report to the president and congress50 under the nrf the needs of children are addressed in esf 6 and 1351 the support of childrens needs in esf 6 is delegated to several nonprofit organizations including catholic charities feed the children save the children and the united methodist committee on relief umcor one of the functions of esf 13 is to protect children under the annex the national center for missing and exploited 46 steven krug is the head of the division of pediatric emergency medicine at childrens

organization is responsible for preventing child abduction and sexual exploitation and helping locate missing children congress might consider how well the issue of child protection in disasters is addressed in the nrfs annexes several observations about the nrfs current coverage include the following first there are primary agencies designated as responsible for addressing childrens needs only supporting agencies have this designation second some may argue that the annexes are flawed because the public health and medical services annex esf 8 and search and rescue annex esf 9 do not explicitly mention children in their various functions third some may argue that having multiple annexes focused on the needs of children may create service gaps and that when several organizations are assigned with responsibility it becomes unclear what agency will take the lead and what functions these agencies are carrying out in addition they may argue that having multiple organizations creates unnecessary duplication the nrf as living document having the nrf available online appears to have some benefits emergencies and disasters are fluid events and having document capable of adapting to the needs created by unique emergencies and disasters would seem to add to the nrfs flexibility it also gives users easy access to the document however it is unclear what mechanisms are in place to ensure users know the document has been changed is it possible that state or locality may use protocols that have been removed or revised the nrf is always in effect whereas the nrp had to be invoked when an emergency or disaster struck according to dhs this has the benefit of speeding response time because it eliminates the need to wait for some form of announcement that the plan is in effect some may argue that plan that is always in effect lacks triggering mechanism to alert responders and create situational awareness does the nrf benefit response activities by always being in effect reporting requirements and metrics the postkatrina act requires the administrator of fema to submit to congress annual reports that identify the resources needed to enhance regional offices and undertake planning training surge capacity and logistics reporting must also include information about state compliance with the nrf and the extent to which the use of federal assistance during the preceding fiscal year achieved preparedness priorities52 additionally homeland security grants require broad state compliance with national preparedness policy some may argue that emergency management practices are strengthened when states and localities adopt federal standards for emergency preparedness and response others may argue that mandating compliance has at least two negative consequences first not all states have the same set of hazards onesizefitsall approach may not be the best method of addressing hazards because states and localities are better positioned to make decisions about how to conduct emergency 52 pl 109295 sec 652a2ad 120 stat 1429 sec 652c2ac 120 stat 1430 crs13 planning and response53 second requiring compliance and creating standards increases federal involvement in emergency policy again some may argue this is beneficial because it can help save lives and reduce property loss but others might argue that the requirements infringe on state sovereignty emphasis on terrorism all of the nrfs incident annexes are oriented toward terrorism since hurricane katrina some have argued that there has been an emphasis on planning for highimpact lowprobability incidents at the expense of lowimpact highprobability incidents additionally it is possible that planning for terrorism underemphasizes preparedness for natural disasters for example in testimony before the house natural resources committee david applegate pointed out that earthquakes are among the most expensive of natural disasters in terms of destruction according to applegate this underscores the importance of preparedness and mitigation however there is incident annex addressing earthquakes54 the president of the international association of emergency managers iaem and director of emergency management hillsborough county florida also addressed the terrorism emphasis director larry gispert responded favorably to presidentelect obamas plan to support firstresponders prepare effective emergency response plans improve interoperable communications systems and work with state and local governments and the private sector and allocate funds based on risk gispert objected to plans that focus on terrorism because state and local emergency managers primarily deal with natural disasters according to gispert the plan would have the benefit of allowing state and local governments to prepare for both types of incidents rather than predominantly terrorism55 on the other hand others would argue that planning for terrorism is of the utmost importance and that terrorist attack would have the same consequences as natural disaster56 they may conclude that planning and preparedness for terrorism can be applied toward natural disasters and therefore fits the allhazards model of emergency management 53 samuel clovis promises unfulfilled the suboptimization of homeland security national preparedness homeland security affairs vol 4 3 october 2008

about the possibility that preparedness for natural disasters is being hampered by overemphasizing terrorism in emergency plans or that resources for natural disaster preparedness are being diverted to prepare for terrorist events congress may elect to have fema develop natural disaster annexes or incorporate more natural disaster planning in existing incident annexes selected enacted and pending legislation in the 110th congress the 110th congress enacted legislation addressing issues related to the nrf other matters however have been left unresolved the following section gives some examples of enacted legislation that affected the nrf it also identifies legislation that members of the 111th congress may decide to reconsider selected enacted legislation57 several laws enacted in the 110th congress have affected the nrf pl 11053 implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 was signed into law august 3 2007 section 408 amends 510 of the homeland security act of 2002 by requiring the administrator of fema to create standards for credentialing and classifying58 incident management personnel for federal state local and tribal government agencies that have responsibilities under the nrf section 510 of the homeland security act as amended requires that later than six months after receiving the standards each federal agency with responsibilities under the nrf must ensure that incident management personnel emergency response providers and other personnel including temporary personnel as well as resources likely needed to respond to disaster be credentialed and typed in accordance with those standards59 section 1407 of pl 11053 requires that security exercises for public transportation agencies be consistent with the nrf60 pl 110181 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 was signed into law january 28 2008 section 351f requires the national guard to submit an annual report containing an assessment of the guards readiness to perform tasks that support civil authorities under the nrf the act also requires that should the report reveal relevant information concerning national guard of particular state that information will be made available to the governor of that state61 57 based on search on the crs legislative information system lis using the terms national response plan and national response framework 58 the act uses the term typing rather than classifying 59 sec 408c 60 title xiv public transportation security sec 14071f 61 sec 3512 crs15 pending legislation62 the following is list of selected legislation pending at the end of the 110th congress that if acted upon in later congress might have implications for the nrf s 3260 the financial services and general government appropriations act 2009 was introduced july 14 2008 section 516 of the bill would have authorized the general services administration gsa to allow volunteer and other nongovernmental organizations supporting the nrf to have access to gsa sources of supply the intent of the bill was to improve logistics in response efforts some may contend that the confusion during hurricanes gustav and ike concerning distribution points for supplies may have been lessened through access to gsa supply schedules s 3260 was placed on the senate legislative calendar under general orders calendar 877 hr 1333 the civil air patrol homeland security support act of 2007 introduced in the house on march 6 2007 would have directed the secretary of dhs to enter into memoranda of understanding or other agreements with the secretary of defense to use civil air patrol personnel and resources to support homeland security missions the secretary of dhs would have been authorized to consider the civil air patrol an available resource for purposes of national preparedness and response planning activities including the national response plan meaning the nrf hr 1333 passed the house and was referred to the senate hr 6147 the federal emergency management advancement act of 2008 was introduced may 22 2008 the intent was to establish fema as an independent agency if enacted section 1046 would have required the director of fema to consolidate existing federal government emergency response plans into single coordinated national response plan hr 6147 was referred to the house subcommittee on emergency communications preparedness and response june 2 2008 concluding observations in response to directives from congress and the president the bush administration issued the nrf to establish new approach to coordinate federal and nonfederal entities in times of emergencies and major disasters the nrf does appear to respond to some of the challenges identified by congress and others the document is more concise has less jargon and has made an attempt to clarify roles and responsibilities on the other hand parts of the nrf may have retained some of the problems associated with the nrp the nrf still contains the pfo arrangement nonfederal stakeholder input appears to be lacking and the incident annexes have yet to be fully updated some observers might say that not enough emergencies and disasters have occurred since the nrf has been issued to form clear picture of its effectiveness also they may contend that insufficient implementation studies have been conducted 62 based on search on the legislative information service lis using the terms national response plan and national response framework crs16 on the nrf to assess its efficacy as some observers point out the only way to find out whether the nrf is an improvement over the nrp may be to subject it to major catastrophe comparable to hurricane katrina crs17 appendix annexes to the national response framework table 1 list
