february 2005 when ttu staff member 1 handed him sealed brown envelope the envelope was addressed to the repres entative of travel agency 4 and ttu staff member 1 wanted him to deliver it to the repr esentative of travel agency 4 as the noted staff member was traveling to accra in two da ys time ttu staff member 2 asked ttu staff member 1 to give him the letter on the da he was actually leaving but ttu staff member 1 refused to take it back the letter was subsequently left on desk in the ttu on the day of his departure for accra ttu st aff member 2 called ttu staff member 1 intending to pick up the envelope howev er ttu staff member 1 was unable to find it and both then realized that the envelope had disappeared ttu staff member 2 said he was surprised to learn from ttu staff membe r 1 that the envelope contained us280000 for the purchase of personal airline ckets for two unmil staff members ttu staff member 2 advised idoios that if he had k nown that the sealed envelope contained money he would not have agreed to delive r the envelope for ttu staff member 1 the incident was brought to the attention of gs s officer and the unmil special investigations unit siu after completion of thei r investigation the siu found both staff members to be negligent and requested reimbursement of the missing funds in equal portions ttu staff member 2 when interviewed adv ised idoios he refused to make any reimbursement stating that even prior to this incident ttu staff member 1 made practice of collecting cash from staff members for payment to travel agency 4 for personal airline tickets and had advised him to sto p the practice as it was improper he also commented that the representative of travel ag ency 4 often telephoned ttu staff member 1 in the office but because they always spo ke in another language he was unable to ascertain what was being discussed 16 during the course of the investigation idoios also found affixed to the door of the ttu copy of travel agency 4 advertisement depi cting economy fares for certain routes originating out of accra although the ttu staff all agreed that it was improper for such an advertisement to be displayed within their premises each of them also denied having placed it on the door 17 as result of the information gained idoios requested the finance officer to produce the financial vouchers indicating payments affected to the various travel agencies utilized by unmil the payments made are summarized as follows travel agency total payment period travel agency 7 us 2830300 12 nov 03 26 march 03 travel agency

agency 1 us 32 612 00 23 feb 0530 march 05 6 18 separate issue that arose during the course f the investigation was the non adherence to the financial regulations and rules f rr by ttu staff members idoios established that initially ttu did not request m inimum of three quotations from the various travel agencies as required by the organiza tion before the authorization of an official trip instead quotations were mostly requ ested from one travel agency travel agency 4 and after august 2004 from travel agenc 10 one staff member said that he was not well acquainted with the frrs and procureme nt procedures in relation to purchasing of official travel air tickets for staff members but was well aware that minimum of three quotations had to be obtained befo re confirming any ticket purchase he also advised that he had yet to receive any trainin g on the frrs andor procurement regulations 19 when questioned as to why quotes were initially only requested from travel agency 4 ttu staff member 3 advised idoios that ttu staff m ember 1 had introduced him to the idea of obtaining travel quotes from travel age ncy 4 at the time there was officially appointed travel agency for unmil ttu staff member 3 also acknowledged that minimum of three quotations was supposed to be obtained before confirming ticket purchase but advised it was not always possible to adhere to this rule for operational reasons such as responses from travel agencies wer lacking and often extremely slow due to the fact that most travel agencies were unwillin g or reluctant to issue tickets to unmil on credit 20 in relation to the quotation requirements ttu staff member 1 also stated that travel agencies were extremely slow to respond due to the fact that most travel agencies were reluctant to issue tickets to unmil on credit he added that the threequotation requirement was only carried out from may 2004 and prior to that most of the official air tickets were purchased from travel agency 4 he not ed that travel agency 4 would always respond quickly to unmil requests and they t herefore preferred to use their services he further explained that when booking was placed first by one travel agent it would then prevent the other agents from entering t heir bookings into the system thus for conveniences sake they would usually confirm the b ooking with travel agency 4 especially where official tickets were needed on an urgent basis he also noted that when unmil commenced operations the ttu offices were si tuated at hotel the same location in which travel agency 4 was based and as such they always received notification of required bookings 21 ttu officer was appointed to the ttu in 2004 he confirmed that there was official appointed travel agency when he assumed th position he added that at that time the ttu was obtaining travel tickets from travel ag ency 4 after obtaining two other quotations because travel agency 4s response was faster they were able to secure the ticket deal ttu officer said that the ttu was give n list of travel agencies in november or december 2004 by procurement indicating that th ttu could explore the services of these other agencies for official travel upon rec eipt of this information the ttu began to use travel agency 10 as their response to ttus req uests for quotations was also fast 7 vi evidence and findings of fact offer of kickback to influence travel contract 22 idoios obtained testimonial evidence indicatin g that the supervisor of travel agency 2 offered two unmil staff members kickback howe ver there is evidence to indicate that either staff member accepted the offer the pervisor of travel agency 2 denied the accusation stating that he had instead offered t wo percent commission to unmil as an organization idoios is inclined to believe the vidence of the two staff members who appeared to be very credible and clear about the fa ct that the supervisor of travel agency 2 had offered them kickback if the travel managemen t service contract was awarded to travel agency 2 leak of confidential information 23 idoios confirmed that when the unmil staff mem bers visited the travel agencies in accra between 18 and 20 july 2004 the bidding proc ess for the provision of tms services had yet to commence despite this the representat ive of travel agency 4 was privy to confidential information as to unmil plans to appoi nt an official travel agency 24 the association between the representative of t ravel agency 4 and members of the ttu in particular ttu staff member 1 is of signif icant concern the financial payment sheets confirm that travel agency 4 was the travel agency most utilized by unmil up to april 2005 having received approximately us54000 0 in fees ttu staff member 1 also seemed to have established system with travel age ncy 4 for direct payment of cash for unmil staff members personal airline tickets his meal engagements with the representative of travel agency 4 and overnight sta in guesthouse owned by director of travel agency 4 upon the invitation of the repr esentative of travel agency 4 provides evidence to suggest something more than mere busi ness relationship although ttu staff member 1 did produce receipt of payment for his vernight stay in the guesthouse it is not known however why his accommodations cost s than that of another former ttu staff member 1 the travel agency 4 advertisement f ound affixed to the door of the ttu also demonstrates degree of bias by the ttu but does not adduce evidence of corruption despite the fact that some staff members feel ttu s taff member 1 might be behind the leak of information to the representative of travel agency 4 idoios is cautious to draw this conclusion as the evidence to date is circums tantial and inconclusive association with vendors 25 ttu staff member 1 informed idoios that his st ay at the guesthouse and his personal relationship with the representative of tr avel agency 4 did not influence the manner in which he dealt with travel agency 4 howe ver in accordance with regulation 421 1 of the procurement manual ttu staff memb er 1 should have been cognisant of the impression that his actions create on others w hen two witnesses were asked whom they thought leaked the confidential bidding inform ation they both speculated that it might be ttu staff member 1 with one adding that he had seen ttu staff member 1 dining out with the representative of travel agency 4 and that the representative of travel agency 4 once sat in the ttu in front of computer allegedl on visit to ttu staff member 1 8 these associations which are not prohibited as lon g as in good faith combined with the fact that ttu staff member 1 stayed at the guesthou create an impression that ttu staff member 1 may have favoured travel agency 4 w hich is supported by the fact that travel agency 4 has been engaged the most of all th travel agencies working with unmil process of award of travel management service cont ract 26 idoios found evidence indicating that the p rocurement process leading to the award of the tms contract to travel agency 1 was fair or not transparent however idoios is concerned that travel agency 2 was invit ed to bid in the procurement process despite the fact that the procurement office had kn owledge that the supervisor of the company had offered bribe to unmil staff members in july 2004 nonobservance of financial regulations rules in the travel unit 27 one of the principles under frr 512 requires that staff members concerned with procurement functions do so with due consideration for best value for money this provision was not always adhered to when ttu staff member 1 failed to request minimum of three quotes as required idoios also obtained evidence demonstrating that not all staff members were well acquainted with the financial rules due to lack of appropriate training vii conclusions 28 the conduct of the supervisor of travel agency 2 in offering staff members percentage in order for them to influence the award of the tms contract amounts to bribe within the purview of regulation 425 of the procu rement manual there is however evidence of acceptance of the bribe by the unmil st aff members 29 regulation 706 of the procurement manual and s taff regulation 12 i was not adhered to as material and confidential information was disclosed by an unknown perpetrators prior to the opening of bids for the tms contract 30 the concept of impartiality and fairness cannot be upheld as envisaged by staff regulation 12 g when an advertisement for one pa rticular travel agency was placed on the ttu door or by having staff members engage in dubious private transactions on behalf of vendors viii recommendations 31 given the
