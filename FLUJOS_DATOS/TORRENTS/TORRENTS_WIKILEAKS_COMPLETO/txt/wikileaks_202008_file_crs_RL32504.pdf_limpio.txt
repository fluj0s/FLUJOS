appropriations committees have consistently reiterated that the secretary should use the authority to transfer ccc funds and usda has continued its past practice of using the funds analysis of ccc transfers for plant and animal health emergencies from fy1998 to fy2005 leads to several observations first the number and value of ccc transfers rose substantially from fy1998 to fy2003 second several eradication programs were shortterm and funded only by ccc transfers while other programs consistently have received ccc transfers in addition to appropriations finally some programs receive large initial ccc transfers followed by progressively smaller transfers as appropriations gradually take their place examples of pest and disease programs receiving ccc transfers in recent years

animal health emergencies transfers from the commodity credit corporation summary the secretary of agriculture has the authority to transfer funds from the commodity credit corporation ccc to the animal and plant health inspection service aphis for emergency control programs the secretarys use of this authority has increased in recent years and has become an issue within government concerning the method for funding plant and animal health programs the authority to transfer money for plant and animal health emergencies is found both in annual appr opriations acts and in authorizin g statutes discretion rests with the secretary of agriculture who is subject to limited review when making transfers the definition and use of the word emer gency have caused particular concern some parties interpret emergency to include only the initial occurrence of an outbreak others interpret emergency to include any outbreak that threatens agricultural production for which offici als deem appropriations insufficient ccc transfers represent significant source of funding for aphis activities nearly all ccc to aphis transfers go to the pest and disease management function such ccc transfers rose from 31 million in fy1998 to high of 378 million in fy2003 an increase of 1100 in six year s before declining to 168 million in fy2005 from fy1998 to fy2005 ccc transfers averaged 211

protecting us agriculture from foreign pests and diseases responding to domestic animal and plant health problems and facilitating agricultural trade through science based standards1 aphis receives an annual appropriation from congress for pest and disease management including many llocations for specific outbreaks2 this annual appropriation is granted by congress as ne w budget authority typically as part of usdas regular appropriation measure for any given fiscal year but in emergencies such as unforseen disease outbreaks or when resources for existing eradication programs are deemed not to be sufficient the secretary of agriculture may transfer funds from the ccc or other usda accounts to supplement these annually appropriated funds the ccc is wholly owned government corporation with the authority to have up to 30 billion in outstanding debt to the us treasury3 these borrowed funds are used widely throughout usda to fi nance farm commodity programs various conservation and trade

animal pest and diseas eradication programs by transferring money from other usda accounts from fy1990 to fy1998 ccc transfers to aphis averaged 22 million annually and addresse d one or two emergencies per year4 from fy1998 to fy2005 ccc transfers averaged 211 million annually almost 10 times as much and have addressed as many as 11 emergencies per year specifically ccc transfers rose

unding for aphis activities especially compared to annua lly appropriated funds nearly all ccc transfers go to the pest and disease management function since those programs address eradication and c ontrol issues directly the ccc account is considered for cong ressional scorekeeping purposes to be mandatory entitlement spe nding this is in contrast to aphiss annual appropriation for salaries and expenses which is c onsidered for scorekeeping purposes to be discretionary spending the appropriations committees write the spending levels for discretionary progra ms which in the case of aphis comes annually as part of the regular fiscal ear appropriation bill for usda mandatory spending levels are generally determined by multiyear authorizing laws which generally are handled by the authorizing committees including the house and senate agriculture committees to the extent that funds for an activity can be drawn from an account like the ccc on the mandatory side of the federal budget the money wont have to be taken from the discre tionary side of the budget ie annual appropriations authority for ccc transfers the authority to transfer money for plant and animal health

announced 282 milli on transfer on march 23 2004 but administrative issues with omb were cleared only on may 28 20045 debate between congress and the administration the definition and use of the word emer gency have caused particular concern especially given the words use in both st atute and appropriations acts to authorize such transfers some parties interpret the term to include only the initial occurrence of an outbreak others read the aut horization more generally interpreting an emergency to mean any outbr eak that threatens agricu ltural production for which officials deem current appropriations are insufficient for eradication and control appropriations committee position in report language congressional appropriations committees have consistently reiterated that the secretary should use the authority to transfer ccc funds for animal and plant health emergencies the reports repeatedly reject attempts by the administration to change the authority or ongoing process for funding emergency eradication efforts for the fy2002 appr opriation the house report contained more extensive comments than usual for the justification to transfer ccc funds typically such report language is limited to the first sentence below the committee expects the secretary of agriculture to continue to use the authority provided in this bill to tr ansfer funds from the commodity credit corporation for the arrest and eradicati on of animal and plant pests and diseases that threaten american agriculture by providing funds in this account the committee is enhancing the work that has begun to combat emergency outbreaks the committee notes that funds appropriated in this bill are subject to obligation within the fiscal year for which they are appropriated while funds transferred from the ccc are ava ilable until expended for example according to usdas fiscal year 2002 budget justifications there is about 65000000 in ccc fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32504crs7 that was transferred in fiscal year 2000 that was still available for obligation as of april 9 2001 if those funds had been appropriated they would not have been available in fiscal year 2001 the use of the secretarys emergency authority places the department in better position to respond to emergencies more so than the annual budget and appropriations cycle that takes about 18 months to complete hrept 107116 to accompany hr 2330 more recently both the house and nate reports accompanying the fy2006 usda appropriation hr 2744 again express similar views on use of the ccc as follows the committee expects the secretary of agriculture to continue to use the authority provided in this bill to tr ansfer funds from the commodity credit corporation for the arrest and eradicati on of animal and plant pests and diseases that threaten american agriculture by providing funds in this account the committee is enhancing but not replacing the use of commodity credit corporation funding for emerge ncy outbreaks hrept 109102 the committee encourages the secretary to continue use of contingency funding from commodity credit corporation monies as in past fiscal years to cover needs as identified in the presidents budget and any additional emergencies as the secretary determines necessary srept 10992 administration positions in past years omb has expressed concer n about the continuing and growing use of ccc funds for the eradication of plant and animal pests and diseases which omb has said should be funded th rough regular appropriations after the initial outbreak the fy2004 budget requested full funding for number of important pest eradication programs such as the asia n longhorned beetle citrus canker and tropical bont tick because the committees failure to provide the requested funding will result in need to transf er mandatory funding from the commodity credit corporation the administration s included these additional costs in its scoring of the committee bill omb statement of administrative policy on s 1427 november 5 2003 omb has called the use of ccc funds for anything but unforeseen emergencies and especially ongoing eradication prog rams beyond the first or second year backdoor financing that avoids th discipline of the budget process the fy2002 budget proposed that ongoing projects to combat plant pest and disease infestations be funded throug h the normal discretionary appropriations process the committee chose not to accept this approach and instead recommended that the majority of the fundi ng be provided through transfer from the commodity credit corporation ccc authority to transfer funding from ccc is intended for use in emergency situations using this emergency authority for eradication efforts which can be predicted planned for and will continue for several years is inconsistent with the clear intent of the provision authorizing these transfers therefore using emerge ncy funding for anything other than truly unforeseen crises can be viewed as back door financing that avoids the discipline of the discretionary budget caps omb statement of administrative policy on s 1191 october 25 2001 and hr 2330 june 27

had for many years and that congress continues to provide via annual appropriations the contingency fund is used for initial surveys or administrative work on new outbreaks and is not large enough or

request pp 1537 as of this writing hr 2744 was awaiting housesenate conferencein the past few years usda itself s taken several positions in its fy2002 budget request usda proposed creating rge appropriated emergency fund for ongoing plant and animal health emerge ncies the request included 196 million in appropriations for ongoing emergencies that were previously funded by ccc transfers6 the request was not funded by congress since the 2002 budget usda has not propos ed such large emergency fund although it has proposed more modest increas in appropriations for several pest and disease programs purportedly to reduce ccc transfers with current budgetary pressures omb has signaled in recent comments about the fy2005 budget that it may be less interested in large contingency fund for plant and animal health consistent with the need for responsible spending restraint the administration urges the congress to fully fund unavoidab obligations and not to include any emergency funding including continge nt emergencies omb statement of administrative policy on hr 4766 july 13 2004 other administration efforts to change the policy for ccc transfers were attempted in fy2003 and fy2004 for fy2003 the administration proposed deleting the authority in appropriations language for emergency transfers and putting new criteria into the agricultural risk protection act7 although appropriators rejected that proposal us da again proposed appropriations language for fy2004 that did not include the usual author ity for making emergency transfers8 again congress rejected the proposal in the fy2005 budget reque st usda proposed addressing the definition of emergency by deleting in emergencies nd replacing it with for sudden urgent and unforeseen circumstances9 the final version of the fy2005 agriculture appropriations bill pl 108447 does not adopt this newer language the fy2006 budget request proposed the same language change10 as before neither the house nor senatepassed version of the fy2006 usda appropriations bill hr 2744 contains the proposal despite these past administration positions to reduce ccc transfers usda has continued to use its authority and has even drawn more heavily upon the ccc thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32504crs9 might suggest in part that even within the administration usda and omb can have conflicting positions on the delivery of programs even when the administrations official budgetary and legi slative requests appear more unified it also likely reflects the f act that congress through annual appropria tions and its instructions in accompanying report langua ge ultimately controls federal spending as already noted congressional appropriations committees have consistently reiterated that the secretary should use the authority to transfer ccc funds and the secretary has done so ccc transfers since 1998 table 2 presents all ccc transfers for plant and animal health emergencies from fy1998 to fy2005 the table includes any eradication effort having ccc transfer during the period and is thus subset of all aphis pest and disease management programs to help compar the importance of ccc activity for particular eradication program the ta ble includes the budget request and the congressionally appropriate d amount for fy2006 only the table shows the administration request and respectively the amounts in the housesenatepassed bills table 2 reveals several examples that relate to congressional and administration positions these are summarized below and then discussed in detail the number and value of ccc transfers had risen substantially since 1998 through 2003 each year significant amount of the total transferred goes to just one or two emergencies eg bse in 2004 exotic newcastle in 2003 avian influenza in 2002 several control programs were shortterm and funded only by ccc transfers eg belgian sheep tse exotic new castle hog cholera mormon cricket some programs consistently have received ccc transfers eg asian longhorned beetle citr us canker fruit fly some programs receive large ccc tr ansfers followed by progressively smaller transfers as ppropriators have time to respond through the budget cycle and formal budget requests co from the administration eg pierces disease asian longhorned bee tle and citrus ca nker and possibly sudden oak death and emerald ash borer growth in size and number as mentioned above ccc transfers to aphis grew from 31 million in fy1998 to 378 million in fy2003 in the eight fiscal years from october 1 1998 to september 30 2005 ccc transfers exceeded 16 billion this is 100 of the cumulative aphis appropriation for pe st and disease management see table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32504crs10 the number of transfers and programs has grown also in 1998 ccc transfers assisted with two eradication programs in fy2003 ccc transfers supplemented 11 programs see end of table 2 programs to compensate producers for plants and animals that are destroyed are one reason that ccc transfers are particularly large in certain years compensation programs quickly amount to tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars each year the majority of the ccc transfers go to just few emergency programs in fy2005 the largest transfers were for citrus canker and for bse in fy2004 the largest transfers were for bse nd the associated animal id issue in fy2003 it was for exotic newcastle diseas in fy2002 for avian influenza in fy2000fy2001 for citrus canker onetime crises some eradication efforts have receive d ccc funding for onetime crises and do not have ongoing appropr iations or budget requests eg belgian sheep tse exotic newcastle disease hog cholera and mormon cricket ongoing programs few ongoing eradication programs s uch as asian longhor ned beetle citrus canker and fruit fly have consistently received ccc transfers annually with appropriated funds these longerterm pr ograms are some examples of the omb criticism of bac kdoor financing relation to budget requ ests and appropriations continuing the example usda budget request s for asian longhorned bee tle and citrus canker have exceeded congressional appropriations but ccc transfers have mo re than made up the difference although some may conc lude that congressi onal underfunding has precipitated the need for ccc transfers this is not necessarily the case the time line of budget requests for futu re fiscal year eg request for fy2005 that is placed in february 2004 may occur before ccc transfers are initiated for the current fiscal year eg marchseptember 2004 thus an apparent underfunding in fy2005 appropriations may have been due to reasonable adjustments made during the appropriations process after ccc transfers occurred consequently the reality of the length budget process may be used in support of the timeliness argument that congress has made for ccc transfers especially during rapidly evolving outbreaks howe ver for outbreaks that are known and not evolving in size and control methods continuing ccc transfers could indicate that requests or appropriations were not forecast adequately as noted earlier to the extent that funds are taken from mandatory spending account like the ccc the money wont have to be taken from the discretionary side of the budget this could be viewed as effectively freeing up discretionary funds that could be used by appropriators for other purposes so have contendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32504crs11 another longstanding appropr iations issue is congresss use of earmarks for example aphis requests and receives in its annual appropr iation money for program called emerging plant pests pp congress provided 101 million for this program in fy2005 and similar level is in both the pending house and senate passed appropriations for fy2006 hr 2744 usdaaphis requested nearly 127 million for the program in fy2006 the accompanying house and senate reports each stipulate how much aphis s hould devote from this program to several specific pests such as the asian long horned beetle sudden oak death the glassy winged sharpshooter and emerald ash borer aphis likely would be spending and in fact has proposed such money on eradication and control of mo st if not all of these pe sts even if congress had not required it nonetheless the earmarks which consume the lions share of the total emerging plant pests program level in effect can limit the agencys future discretion in how to allocate the epp appropriation indeed the committees have addressed the need for any additional pest or disease f unding by expressly asking the secretary to use the ccc account see pp 67 transfers that decline over time some eradication programs receive large ccc transfers in the early years with smaller transfers in subsequent years for example initial control activity for pierces disease aka glassywinged sharpshootergwss was funded with large ccc transfers in fy2000 followed by small and growing appropria tions and subsequently rger budget requests after fy2002 half of the total ccc transfers occurred in the first year with subsequent ccc transfers being much smaller and more activity being supported by appropriations even progra ms with large and ongoing transfers such as asian longhorned beetle and citrus canker have seen transfers decline similar examples may include sudden oa k death and emerald ash borer usda did not make specific budget reque st for sudden oak death until fy2005 even though congress appropriate d funds in both fy2003 and fy2004 following rapid geographic spread of sudden oak death in the spring of 2004 the secretary transferred large amount from ccc in fy2004 without needing to wait for the appropriations process with emerald ash borer ccc transfers occurred for two years before the administr ation included request in conclusion depending on which eradi cation programs are chosen examples of ccc transfers for plant and animal health emergencies may be used in support of opposing opinions about the efficacy of transf ers certainly the total number and value of ccc transfers has risen substan tially since 19 98 alt hough most of the amount transferred each year goes to just one or two emergencies ccc transfers have been particularly effective for several onetime shortterm emergency responses that have been funded with only ccc transfers before appropriations could ve been enacted however some longerterm eradication programs continue to receive ongoing ccc transfers raising the issue of budget requests and appropria tions finally some progra ms receive large initial ccc transfers followed by progressi vely smaller transfers as appropriations gradually take their place more likely outcome as response needs evolve and become
