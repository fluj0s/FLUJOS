the even start program is part of the elementary and secondary education act esea the esea was reauthorized thr ough the child left behind act of 2001 nclba the nclba was signed into law on january 8 2002 and will expire with fy2007 fy2008 with the automatic general education provisions act one year extension it is expected that the 110th congress will be considering legislation to extend the authorization of th esea as amended by the nclba the even start program provides educa tion and related services jointly to disadvantaged parents and their young ch ildren the purpose of the program is to integrate early childhood education adu lt basic education and parenting skills education into unified family literacy program even start program services must include adult literacy instruction early childhood education instruction to help parents support their childs education par ticipant recruitment sc reening of parents staff training and hom ebased instruction the even start program first authorized in 1989 grew rapidly in its first years but has been subject to increasing criticis m in recent years and has seen its funding decline in every year since fy2003 fo r fy2009 the fifth year in row the administration has requested funding fo r the program the program received 66454 million in funding for fy2008 fy2007 funding was 82283 million in the fy2009 budget justification the administr ation argued that the program has not demonstrated that it has been effectiv in improving child and adult learning outcomes through the integration of the f our core services of adult education parenting education parent child activities and early childhood education the administration argues that these conclu sions are supported by data from three national evaluations of even start advocates of the even start program argue that the goal of providing integrated family literacy services to an extremely disadvantaged population is so important that the program should not be eliminated or have its funding cut furthermore th ey argue that thorough study of the impact of legislatively mandated quality improvements to even start is needed as well as concerted effort to improve the pr ogram through impleme ntation of model programs and technical assistance the third national even start evaluation has suggested several areas in which the even start program could be enhanced to improve participant outcomes first it noted that the quality and content of language instruction provided in even start programs should be made the most important priority for programs and that language instruction must be improve d based on recent scientific research second it found that families did not participate long enoug h or receive instruction of sufficient intensity to achieve program goals finally it recommended that future research focus on identifying effective family literacy practices and instructional services to serve as models for improving even star t projects this

third national even start evaluation hereafter the evaluation relied on two data sources an experimental design study eds that tracked 18 projects that agreed to randomly assign new families to even start or control group and the even start performance information reporting system which tracks annual data from the uni verse of even start projects although families particip ating in the eds were randomly assi gned to either control or an even start group the 18 projects participatin g were not randomly selected the eds families were more likely than even start families as whole to be hispanic

changes the national evaluation collected data on 41 different outcome measures for the families participating in the eds study5 the results indicated that the even start children and their parents did not perform better than the control group children and their parents even start children and their parents made gains in literacy and other measures but so did control group parents and children the data show that children and parents in the control group made the same kinds of gains on literacy assessments on parent reports of child literacy on parentchild reading on literacy resources at home on family economic self sufficiency and so on that were seen for even start families6 the only area in which even start children did significantly better than control group children was in

start titled state administration of the even start family literacy program structure process and practices found very little consistency among states in the pe rformance indicators submitted to ed or in the performance st andards or s ubgroups evaluate d by these measures according to this study implementation of these standards was just beginning at the time of this evaluation nd most states did not begin collection of these data until 20027 should the even start program be eliminated the administration argues that data from the three national evaluations of even start justify the elimination of the even start program in its fy2009 budget justification it argued that the program has not demonstrated that it has been effective in improving child and adult learning out comes through the integration of the four core services of adult ducation parenting education parentchild activities and early childhood education the key premise underlying the even start program is that the integration of the four core instructional components of adult education parenting education parentchild activities and early childhood education adds value to the individual components this premise while appealing remains unproven the extent to which family literacy programs can enhance parent literacy and parenting skills is unknown8 advocates of the even start program contend that the goal of providing integrated family literacy services to an extremely disadvantaged population is so important that the program should not be eliminated or have its funding cut furthermore they argue that thorough st udy of the impact of legislatively mandated quality improvements to even start is needed as well as concerted effort to improve the program through implementa tion of model programs and technical assistance data employed in the evaluation were based on the program before full implementation of legislative changes passed in the lift act and incorporated in the child left behind act nclba the most significant of these changes to the even start program included new requirements that the services provided build on existing high quality community services the program use its

evaluation data for program improve ment and provide information on how their plan provide s for rigorous and objective evaluation of progress toward meeting the programs stated objectives9 states were also required to submit pl an for performance indicators of program quality for even start programs within the state by june 2001 to ed in order to be eligible for continued funding under the pr ogram most states had not yet begun collection of performance indicator data at the time data were collected for the third national evaluation of even start and the state administration of the even start family literacy program stru cture process and practices these indicators must include measures of adult achievement in the following areas reading writing problem solving numeracy english langua ge acquisition high school graduation or ged college entrance and employment adva ncement for even start children these indicators must include measures of achie vement in reading readiness and ability to read at grade level school attendance and grade retention and promotion these indicators could provide information on the programs performance following the changes implemented in the lift and nclb acts and might be used in guiding further program changes ed is currently conducting peer review of state even start indicators and is providing technical assistance to states to strengthen performance indicators and their use by states in addition ed has beg an evaluation of new model interventions emphasizing high quality early literacy instruction in even start programs the even start classroom literacy interventions and outcomes study clio examines the efficacy of four enhanced early childhood and parenting education models in even start programs and compares the outcomes from these models to those of even start programs without these enhancements ll of the model progra ms include enhanced early literacy instruction with the following com ponents oral language phonological processing print awareness and letter knowledge in addition two of the model programs also include an enhanced paren ting education component that is linked to the early childhood education component conceptually and in instructional approach if model interv entions prove successful they have the potential if widely adopted by local programs to improve ev start participant outcomes however interim results from these model interventions will not be available until sometime in 200810 program improvement the evaluation has suggested several areas in which the even start program could be enhanced to improve participant outcomes first it noted that the quality and content of language in struction provided in even start programs should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33071crs6 11 third national even start evaluation p 8 12 ibid p 12 13 diane weirauch even start revisited counter to the third national even start evaluation program impacts and imp lications for improvement 2003 the goodling institute for research in family literacy college of educati on penn state university 2005 p 5improved second it found that families did not participat long enough or receive instruction of sufficient intensity to achieve program goals both are critical for improved program outcomes according to the evaluation if we expect children to learn more in ev start than they would otherwise learn by participating in control group then the overall quality of even start early childhood education and especially the emphasis on language acquisition and reasoning will have to be better than not the same as the instruction offered by competing programs currently this does not appear to be the case11 looking at early childhood education prog rams that have achieved large short term effects on iq tests such as the abecedarian and infant health and development programs the evaluations authors concluded that even start families were not receiving sufficient early childhood education to meet their goals in 2000 2001 even start children between the ages of 05 received an average of 220 hours of instruction 2025 of the amount of instruction received by recipients in the abecedarian and infant health and development program the evaluation concludes that the implication is clear the early childhood programs that have produced the largest effects on child development are t hose that are able to engage children in fulltime year round centerbased instructional services using single curriculum given the great needs of even start families the best possible family literacy program would be able to engage families intensively for very substantial period of time12 however succeeding in achieving greater intensity and duration of even start services will not be easy to accomplish gi ven the economic and social constraints experienced by even start families in 20002001 although an average of only 220 hours of instruction were received by child ren aged 05 an average of 591 hours was offered by even start programs and alt hough even start programs strive to provide multiyear services to participants the average tenure of an even start family is only 10 months barriers to participation are great for even start families these barriers are myriad from dispositional fear of schooling lack of selfconfidence institutional location of services or schedule and situational lack of child care transportation13 according to the evaluation to be more successful even start must make the quality of instruction provided by programs its primary focus because even start programs are legislatively mandated to build on existing resources some even start programs may be negatively impacted by the quality of services provided by their collaborators the legislation requires that programs must work to ensure that existing resources are used only if they are of high quality and instructional qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33071crs7 14 third national even start evaluation p 17may be enhanced by more targeting to families and children with similar needs because of the complicated array of serv ices that must be coordinated andor provided by even start programs they ma be spreading themselves too thin by providing such varied services to parent s and children of such different ages and divergent needs and finally according to the evaluation even start projects would benefit from more research on effective family literacy practices and instructional services and on how best to meet the need s of diverse participants including the growing segment of even start participants with limited english skills14
