role and promised to support holbrookes efforts publicly to alleviate negative media speculation about the special representatives mandate gave his assessment that the intentions and capabilities of the pakistan army were the key determinants of pakistans internal situation and the cause of friction between india and pakistan said that india wishes to collaborate closely with the us on afghanistan and offered support for us views on the suitability of an august 20 election date suggested that after consulting internally he may travel to washington to provide goi input into the us

explained his responsibilities as special representative and emphasized the importance of indian views in the formulation of the new administrations afghanistan and pakistan policy he also provided menon with brief readout of his trip to pakistan and afghanistan 3 c menon cited the numerous times he had worked both publicly and privately with holbrooke in the past and said he was very happy to see holbrooke in his new incarnation the indian government too was pleased with holbrookes appointment he stated adding we have huge stake in your success in this role he agreed with holbrookes assessment that in regard to the problems in afghanistan and pakistan you cant solve one without the other 4 c the indian government was aware of the suspicions the media had created about special representative holbrookes mandate ie that it included kashmir menon said while the media would always speculate menon promised that the goi would publicly support holbrookes efforts adding that it would repeat the message india has huge stake in your success in its public comments 5 c turning to pakistan menon observed that the mood there had deteriorated over the past year saying it had gone from euphoria after the return of civilian government to worries over security and the economy the us has influence however where it matters most menon said referring to the pakistan army arguing that most of the problems in pakistan can be traced to the capacity and intentions of pakistans military not only must pakistans army shift its attention from east to west menon asserted but it must also cut its links to jihadi organizations who have gone global over the past five years supporting pakistans army is not the answer he said suggesting that changing its operating assumptions would be more effective menon noted that the indians had felt last weeks meeting at the munich security conference between national security advisor mk narayanan and general petraeus had been especially productive 6 c menon pointed out that in the wake of the mumbai terrorist attacks india had consciously not attempted to take any measures to destabilize pakistans civilian government and had made every effort to continue trade and travel relations however pakistans army continued to make things difficult for india through ceasefire violations infiltrations and continued support for terrorist groups new delhi 00000288 002 of 002 menon noted that india in the wake of the mumbai attacks had consciously not built up troops on the border with pakistan as it had following the 2001 attack on its parliament 7 c turning to afghanistan holbrooke noted that the focus now was on the elections he lauded india for the effective contribution it had made to afghanistan reconstruction which menon said is now up to 15 billion menon acknowledged pakistani suspicions about indias intentions in afghanistan and explained that india has made numerous efforts over the past few years to try to allay pakistans concerns only to be rebuffed menon said that he as high commissioner had offered to president musharraf to sit down and explain exactly what india was doing in afghanistan without even asking for reciprocal explanation from pakistan but that pakistan officials not just musharraf have avoided it in every way 8 c india has interest in any specific candidate in afghan elections menon stated but believes the upcoming election process should not add to instability equally important is that the election process is credible therefore making afghanistans democracy credible menon noted that afghan lower house speaker mohammad yunis qanuni was currently in delhi and said india supported the election commissions proposal for august 20 polling menon stated that the goi was also planning to tell qanuni that controversy over the exact date of the election should not be allowed to bring the house down adding that to do so would only be in the talibans interest holbrooke urged menon to tell qanuni to accept the august 20 election date note menon offered to brief post on the qunani meeting and post will report septel on any readout provided end note 9 c responding to holbrookes brief of the afghanistan policy review currently underway in the usg menon said he would consult with his government on what would be the best way for india to provide input he suggested that after consultations he would like to travel to washington for high level talks with the new team menon assured holbrooke that on the issue of indian cooperation with the us on afghanistan we could be assured that india wished to work closely with us 10 c menon asked if the us was considering including iran in core group on afghanistan holbrooke referred to his interview with tolo tv where he emphasized the need for all of afghanistans neighbors to be part of the solution but said policy decisions had been made menon said he believed contact group did not have to be formally set up yet but rather if we let it cook it would form itself menon noted the interest china has had in such group for the past two years and added that iran has been signaling to india for the last four months that it was interested 11 c menon offered an initial goi assessment of the pakistani response to indias dossier on the mumbai terror attacks saying that it was remarkable that we got this far menon thanked the us for its role in pressing pakistan to act still menon maintained pakistan has further to go to bring justice to the perpetrators of the attack and it is not clear whether pakistan will continue on this positive track or citing the daniel pearl case recede when public pressure wanes menon also speculated that many of the 30 questions submitted by pakistan were added after the investigation by politicians in response to domestic pressures we havent reached the point of return yet for pakistans government to positively conclude the investigation menon stated menon also offered that he did not believe the mumbai attacks themselves would play major role in indias upcoming elections because efforts to capitalize politically on such heinous event would likely backfire on any political party 12 sbu ambassador holbrooke has cleared this message mulford
