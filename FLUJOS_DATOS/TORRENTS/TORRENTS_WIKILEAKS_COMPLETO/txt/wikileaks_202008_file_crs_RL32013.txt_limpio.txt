the judiciary 1917present updated october 22 2003 mitchel sollenberger analyst in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress the history of the blue slip in the senate committee on the judiciary 1917present summary the blueslip process had its genesis in the senate tradition of senatorial courtesy under this informal custom the senate would refuse to confirm nomination unless the nominee had been approved by the homestate senators of the presidents party the senate committee on the judiciary created the blue slip so called because of its color out of this practice in the early 1900s initially the blue slip permitted senators regardless of party affiliation to voice their opinion on presidents nomination to district court in their state or to circuit court judgeship traditionally appointed from their home state over the years the blue slip has evolved into tool used by senators to delay and often times prevent the confirmation of nominees they find objectionable the following six periods highlight the major changes that various chairmen of the judiciary committee undertook in their blueslip policy from 1917 through 1955 the blueslip policy allowed homestate senators to state their objections but committee action to move forward on nomination if senator objected to hisher homestate nominee the committee would report the nominee adversely to the senate where the contesting senator would have the option of stating hisher objections to the nominee before the senate would vote on confirmation from 1956 through 1978 single homestate senator could stop all committee action on judicial nominee by either returning negative blue slip or failing to return blue slip to the committee from 1979 to mid1989 homestate senators failure to return blue slip would not necessarily prevent committee action on nominee from mid1989 through june 5 2001 in public letter 1989 on the committees blueslip policy the chairman wrote that one negative blue slip would be significant factor to be weighed but would not preclude consideration of nominee unless the administration has not consulted with both home state senators the committee would take action regardless of presidential consultation if both homestate senators returned negative blue slips from june 6 2001 to 2003 the chairmans blueslip policy allowed movement on judicial nominee only if both homestate senators returned positive blue slips to the committee if one homestate senator returned negative blue slip further action would be taken on the nominee 2003 return of negative blue slip by one or both homestate senators does not prevent the committee from moving forward with the nomination provided that the administration has engaged in prenomination consultation with both of the homestate senators the blueslip process has been the subject of growing scholarly and legal debate selected list of reading material is included

the judiciary 1917present introduction the judiciary committees blueslip policy has been central component in its confirmation of judicial nominations for large portion of its history the blue slip gave senators the ability to determine the fate of their homestate judicial nominations if homestate senator had objection to nominee blue slip would be returned to the chairman with positive response if however the senator had some objection to the nominee and wanted to prevent confirmation heshe could decide not to return the blue slip or return it with negative response over the years the blueslip policy has been modified to prevent single senator from having such absolute power over the fate of homestate judicial nominees today blue slip can stop judicial nomination only if both homestate senators return negative blue slip and then only if the president has failed to consult with the homestate senators this report provides history of the judiciary committee blueslip custom practice which emanated from the chambers tradition of senatorial courtesy it first defines senatorial courtesy and how the practice is related to the judiciary committees use of the blue slip next this report describes the creation of the blue slip procedure and the modifications to it eight sections profile the committees blueslip policies during the last 43 congresses these profiles provide sense of the stated and practiced blueslip policy at any given time and place that policy in the context of the history of the blueslip system case studies are provided to show how particular congress applied the blueslip policy to given circumstance finally frequently asked questions section and concluding analysis on the blueslip process are included it should be noted that there are currently two kinds of blue slips used by congress the senate version of the blue slip1 is committee practice employed solely by the senate judiciary committee for use in the confirmation of federal judges and other positions in the house of representatives the blue slip is an enforcement tool for the origination clause of the us constitution2 crs report 1 for further discussion of blue slips see two articles by brannon p denning the blue slip enforcing the norms of the judicial confirmation process william mary bill of rights journal vol 10 dec 2001 pp 75101 and the judicial confirmation process and the blue slip judicature vol 85 mayapr 2002 pp 218226 2 article i section 7 clause 1 of the us constitution states all bills for raising revenue continued crs2 rs21236 blueslipping the origination clause in the house of representatives by james v saturno discusses the use of the house version of the blue slip3 senatorial courtesy the blue slip is manifestation of senatorial courtesy laymans definition of senatorial courtesy would be the deference with which one senator treats another in the context of the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent the term and practice are more expansive the american congressional dictionary defines senatorial courtesy as the senates practice of declining to confirm presidential nominee for an office in the state of senator of the presidents party unless that senator approves sometimes called the courtesy of the senate the practice is customary one and not always adhered to senator sometimes invokes the custom by declaring that the nominee is personally obnoxious or personally objectionable to him the senate also usually complies with senators request for temporary delay in considering nomination request that is referred to as hold4 the concept of senatorial courtesy goes beyond the confines of the senate and at times represents the courtesy president extends or arguably should extend to senators political scientist harold chase describes the political ramifications of this senate tradition senators whether chosen by state legislatures as they were at an earlier time or by the voters of the state must continuously nurture their political support back home that is if they hope for additional terms in office and it is rare senator who does not in this connection senators from the first congress on have recognized that one or two senators have much greater stake in particular appointment than others it is of course exceedingly helpful to senator to be able to reward supporters with good posts in the federal government conversely it is enormously damaging to senators prestige if president of his own party ignores him when it comes to making an appointment from or to the senators own state what is even more damaging to senators prestige and political power is for the president to appoint to high federal office someone who is known back home as political opponent to the senator it was easy for senators to see that if they joined together against the president to protect their individual interests in appointments they could to large degree assure that the 2 continued shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills 3 see also crs report rl31197 revenue measures in congress procedural considerations by james v saturno

washington cq press 2001 p 231 see also p 116 for definition of hold crs3 president could only make such appointments as would be palatable to them as individuals out of such considerations grew the custom of senatorial courtesy5 although the custom of using the personally obnoxious or personally objectionable declaration has fallen out of use in recent years various chairmen of the senate judiciary committee have used the blueslip practice as means of providing senators with the opportunity to make objections to nominations formally known within the committee methodology in preparing the history of the blue slip the following account of the history of the blue slip reflects research in the national archives and records administration nara in washington dc6 the primary records researched were the executive nominations files from the 56th through the 83rd congresses 18991953 and the correspondence and communications files of the senate judiciary committee during the same congresses7 scholarly studies as well as newspaper accounts of the origination of the blue slip process were also used most accounts placed the creation of blue slips as having occurred during the eisenhower administration the 83rd through the 87th congresses 195319618 therefore the research began in that time period and then worked back through the congresses until blue slips were found collection of archival records and data focused on locating blue slips for each congress and any personal correspondence between or among senators relating to their use the correspondence files contained information on blue slips blue slips were however found for every congress starting with the 65th 19171918 through the 83rd 19531954 although there were blue slips for the 64th congress 19151916 research was conducted as far back as the 56th congress 18991900 during this 15year time period mention or evidence of blue slips 5 harold w chase federal judges the appointing process

the blue slip has been in use for over 25 years see memorandum to senator edward m kennedy from judiciary committee staff regarding senatorial courtesy jan 22 1979 cited in us congress senate

legal scholar asserted the blue slip was invented in the eisenhower era cited in michael d schattman picking federal judges mysterious alchemy michigan law review vol 96 pp 15781597 crs4 was discovered the information collected permits more accurate history of the blue slip in the judiciary committee correcting the widespread belief that the blue slip process originated in the 1950s origin of the blue slip process although not mentioned in the judiciary committee rules blue slips are an informal practice unique to the committee which has historically used blue slips on all us attorney us marshal us district court and us court of appeals nominations blue slips have been employed to block nominations in one of two ways depending on the preferences of the judiciary chairman judicial nominations have been blocked by senator either returning negative blue slip or failing to return blue slip altogether over the years there have been various modifications to these basic practices in the case of us district court nominations9 once nomination is referred to the judiciary committee the counsel for the committee will send blue slip so called because of its color to each senator of the nominees home state regardless of party affiliation the senator may then return the blue slip to the judiciary committee with comments on the particular nominee in question in most cases the blue slip is considered to be pro forma gesture and will be given positive review by the senator however in select number of cases negative review may occur for us circuit court nominations the process is similar the judiciary committee will give blue slips only to the senators of the retiring judges home state this tradition comes from the practice of reserving circuit court positions for each state to ensure proportional or equal state representation for each circuit10 the president is often effectively required by this tradition to select circuit court nominee from the state of the retiring judge if negative blue slip is received the chairman may take the following actions on the nominee 1 stop all committee proceedings 2 move forward but give added weight to the unfavorable review or 3 proceed without notice of the negative review since the late 1970s the committee has generally used the latter two actions when dealing with negative blue slip 9 research has yielded evidence of blue slip usage in at least the last 50 years for any nomination to district court in us territories or the district of columbia or to the district of columbia court of appeals neither the territories nor the district of columbia have representation in the senate hence there was blue slip given to homestate senators in the cases of dc circuit nominees miguel estrada and john g roberts jr in the 108th congress 10 for example sheldon goldman wrote at the circuit court level party leaders and senators expect that their state will be represented on the bench by citizen of that state larger states feel entitled to more than one seat on their circuit smaller states in circuits in which there are not enough seats to go around expect that they will have turn at representation see sheldon goldman picking federal judges lower court selection from roosevelt through reagan new haven yale university press 1997 p 136 crs5 the precise date on which the judiciary committee first used the blueslip procedure is not known the committee has not made the blue slip part of its official rules for more than 30 years11 and this is still the case in the 108th congress12 from research conducted at the national archives evidence suggests that the blueslip procedure began sometime in the mid to late 1910s under the chairmanship of senator charles culberson of texas13 this impression is based on the appearance of the first known blue slip in the th 65 congress 19171918 at the time senator culberson was chairman of the judiciary committee capacity he served in from the 63rd through the 66th congresses 19131919 the documentary evidence of this time period suggests that senator culberson may have created the blue slip from the 65th congress onward almost every judicial nominees file includes blue slip prior to this time 56th64th congresses the files of judicial nominees reveal evidence of blue slips judiciary committee materials at the national archives do not provide specific explanation for the creation of the blue slip however they may help illuminate its early history for instance although the white house and the senate were controlled by the democratic party there was periodic tension between the two branches and this condition may have been factor in the blue slips creation14 of particular interest is the creation of blue slips at the same time as the adoption of senate rule xxii in 1917 which permits senators to end filibuster by invoking cloture15 despite this apparent coincidence direct link between the creation of the blue slip and the cloture rule can be dispelled because senate rule xxii did not apply to judicial nominations until 1949 in that year sres 15 modified senate rule xxii from to bring to close the debate upon any pending measure is presented to the senate to the following to bring to close the debate upon any measure motion or other matter pending before the senate16 11 in 1979 memorandum the judiciary committee staff stated at least for decade there has been rule of the committee on the subject see memorandum to senator edward m kennedy jan 22 1979 cited in us congress senate committee on the judiciary the selection and confirmation of federal judges pp 118119 12 the blue slip procedure was not mentioned in the rules posted on the website for the judiciary committee

senate cloture rule limitation of debate in the congress of the united states 99th cong 1st sess committee print sprt 9995 washington gpo 1985 part 2 legislative history of continued crs6 therefore the judiciary committee did not need to create blueslip policy as result of the 1917 senate rule because cloture at that time did not apply to filibusters on judicial nominations structure of the blue slip 19172003 the basic structure of the blue slip has not changed substantially in the 86 years since its creation for the first 27 years 19171944 the blue slip was actually handed to senators as folded blue slip of paper the blue slip form printed on judiciary committee letterhead would contain the date the identity of the nomination and the name of the senator at the top the blue slip stated sir will you kindly give for the use of the committee your opinion and information concerning the nomination of it was signed by the committee chairman at the bottom of the page lines were left for the senator to reply and provide comments concerning the nomination this structure did not change until the 67th congress when in 1922 chairman knute nelson r of minnesota placed below the introductory text the following statement under rule of the committee unless reply is received from you within week from this date it will be assumed that you have objection to this nomination17 before this time the judiciary committee did not have stated time limit for senator to return blue slip after that change the next major modification to the blueslip policy came during the chairmanship of senator strom thurmond when the senator removed from the blue slip the clause under rule of the committee and left the remainder unless reply is received from you within week from this date it will be assumed that you have objection to this nomination chairman thurmond also added at the bottom of the blue slip before the comments section two boxes for checking one titled i approve and the other i oppose in 1998 chairman orrin g hatch replaced the traditional unless reply is received from you within week from this date it will be assumed that you have objection to this nomination with the following text please return this form as soon as possible to the nominations office in dirksen g66 further proceedings on this nominee will be scheduled until both slips have been

judiciary committee before leahys modification the text of the initial introduction had never been changed the current blue slip form has retained senator leahys phrasing and form except room number designation changes first example of senator using the blue slip the first example found of senator using blue slip to oppose judicial nomination was in the spring of 1917 65th congress president woodrow wilson had recently nominated u v whipple to the southern district of georgia senator thomas w hardwick returned negative blue slip on april 9 1917 in his blue slip reply senator hardwick wrote i object to this appointment the same is personally offensive and objectionable to and i can not consent to the confirmation of the nominee20 at that time blue slip did not necessarily prevent committee action on nomination as such whipples nomination was reported albeit adversely to the senate where he was rejected without recorded vote on april 23 191721 the blueslip policy 65th108th

committee policies on the blue slip for each of the last 48 congresses 19172003 each section will highlight the chairmans stated blueslip policy and show when necessary instances where the policy differed in practice from the stated blueslip policy in addition the table at the end of this report provides information on the senate judiciary committees blue slip policy for each of the last 21 congresses dating back to 1956 the table begins in 1956 because it was then that the judiciary committee began to permit senators to use the blue slip as way to block judicial nominations the table is arranged chronologically by the date in which change occurred in the blueslip policy of the senate judiciary committee working from left to right column one consists of the name of the judiciary committee chairman columns two and three list the years and congresses that particular blueslip policy was in use finally column four describes the judiciary committees blueslip policy for those years and congresses 65th84th congresses chairman culbersons written blueslip policy was to merely ask the opinion of the homestate senators on particular judicial nomination specified rule limiting the amount of time to return blue slip did not become part of the judiciary committees stated policy until 1922 when chairman knute nelson placed it on the blueslip form in the 67th congress reason was given for that modification nor does the historical record point to any event that would have given cause for this change from the 65th through the 84th congresses chair of the judiciary committee allowed any negative blue slips to automatically veto nomination for example despite the blueslipping of u v whipple by senator hardwick of georgia the chairman still moved ahead with hearing and even committee vote blue slip apparently did not give senator an absolute right to block judicial nomination and prevent committee action this norm can be seen in the statements made by individual senators who asked if they could appear before the judiciary committee to express their objections to the particular nominee that they were blueslipping for example in 1936 senator theodore g bilbo returned negative blue slip on edwin r holmes who had been nominated to be us circuit court judge for the fifth circuit on his blue slip senator bilbo stated i positively object to holmes22 although senator bilbo stated his objection to the nominee he did not call for the committee to stop all proceedings on the nomination but instead stated that he would be pleased to make known my objection to this subcommittee when hearing is ordered23 22 national archives and records administration record group 46 records of the us senate 74th cong records of executive proceedings nomination files judiciary committee edwin r holmes blue slip 1936 23 ibid crs9 fourteen years later 1950 senator bourke b hickenlooper after noting on his blue slip that he vigorously objected to the nomination of carroll switzer to be us district court judge for the southern district of iowa wrote i shall be glad to appear before your committee on this matter24 likewise in the same year senator richard russell asked the judiciary committee chairman patrick mccarran if he could appear before the committee and present some of the circumstances relating to this nomination before the committee reports it to the senate as i am opposed to his confirmation25 in each case the objecting senator asked to appear before the judiciary committee to state his case against the individual being nominated what these examples appear to show is that the judiciary committee policy during this time was that negative blue slip was not intended to prevent committee action instead senators negative assessment of nominee was meant to express to the committee his views on the nominee so that the chairman would be better prepared to deal with the review of the nomination the end result was that judiciary committee chairmen did not traditionally view negative blue slip as sign to stop all action on judicial nominations this is important to note because of the modification to this policy norm during the 84th congress 84th95th congresses from 1956 through 1978 senator james eastland chaired the judiciary committee and brought about the first fundamental change to the way the committee used blue slips during his tenure it appears that blue slips were handled as absolute vetoes by senators26 the policy was that if senator either returned negative blue slip or failed to return one at all the committee would stop all action on nominee27 evidence for this policy is suggested by the fact that judicial nomination on which there was negative blue slip was rejected by the committee and then subsequently reported to the senate during this time period28 in previous 24 national archives and records administration record group 46 records of the us senate 81st cong records of executive

tenure during the 95th congress the nomination of robert f collins to be us district court continued crs10 congresses the judiciary committee would report most nominations with negative blue slip to the senate with adverse recommendations with the decrease in observance of the personally obnoxious standard however senate rejection was longer certain therefore the committee changed its traditional blueslip policy and proceeded to stop all action on judicial nomination when homestate senator returned negative blue slip or failed to return one29 96th congress senator edward m kennedy chaired the judiciary committee during the 96th congress although he led the committee for only one congress 19791981 he ushered in number of significant changes to the way judicial nominations were handled30 in relation to the committees blueslip policy chairman kennedy informed his colleagues that when senator failed to return blue slip he would let the full committee vote on whether to proceed31 in 1979 judiciary committee hearing chairman kennedy stated that he had instructed the committee staff to send to both senators from nominees state blue slip requesting the senators opinion and information concerning the nominee if the blue slip is not returned within reasonable time rather than letting the nomination die i will place before the committee motion to determine whether it wishes to proceed to hearing on the nomination 28 continued judge for eastern louisiana was first denied approval by the judiciary committee on split vote of 55 on april 14 1978 however subsequent motion to report favorably was approved by 131 vote on may 16 1978 this case is distinguishable from other committee rejections concerning blue slips on two grounds first the committee vote was not an outright rejection but instead split vote resulting in jure rejection second unlike previous cases during the 65th through the 84th congresses collins did not represent direct connection with the blue slip policy in particular the opposition to collins came from sen dennis deconcini collins was in fact supported by his homestate senator for example during the committees second vote on collins sen russell b long came before the committee and asked the members to measure up to the challenge and consider this man the way you would any other nominee see senate committee clears 2 blacks as federal

work its will32 besides chairman kennedys modification to the stated blueslip policy there appeared to have been another change as well homestate senators objection to nominee in practice did not have the same power to automatically stop committee action as before this unstated change can be seen in the confirmation proceedings over virginia judgeship during the 96th congress against the wishes of virginia senator harry f byrd jr president jimmy carter nominated james sheffield to the us district court for eastern virginia in committee the nomination was opposed by senator byrd who sent negative blue slip to chairman kennedy senator byrd reportedly did not object to holding hearing for sheffield33 on august 26 1980 the judiciary committee held hearing on sheffield despite the blue slip objection this marked the first reported instance since 1951 in which the judiciary committee moved forward on blueslipped nomination34 the committee took further action and the senate eventually returned the sheffield nomination on december 16 1980 chairman kennedy established the first posteastland changes to the blueslip system the stated modification placed the decision to move forward on nomination that had not received homestate senators blue slip with the committee the facto alteration permitted the chairman to use his discretion to determine if the committee would act on blueslipped nominee chairman kennedy said that his purpose in modifying the blueslip policy was to allow the federal courts to become more representative of the people of this nation35 he added we face the question of what to do about the longstanding practice of the one member veto or the blueslip process i will not unilaterally table 32 us congress senate committee on the judiciary selection

however discard cavalierly the tradition of senatorial courtesy exceptionriddled and outdated as it may be36 97th99th congresses although it was reported that senator strom thurmond was going to change the blueslip policy in use under senator eastland37 at january 19 1981 judiciary committee organization meeting chairman thurmond stated that he would follow the same procedure enacted under senator kennedy this meant that if the committee does not hear of senator objecting if he just does not send in his blue slip and if we do not hear within the seven days we assume as senator kennedy did there is objection chairman thurmond did make point of stating that if either senator objects to nomination we should not go forward with it38 therefore under chairman thurmonds blueslip policy homestate senator could stop all committee action on judicial nominee by returning negative blue slip however the committee would not stop action on nominee if the homestate senator failed to return it as such chairman thurmond was following senator kennedys modification to the blueslip policy but also stating that single home state senator still had the power to stop committee action on nominee like that of his predecessor however chairman thurmonds blueslip policy was not always consistent as shown by president reagans district court nominations in 1983 and 1985 in 1983 reportedly at the suggestion of retiring senator samuel hayakawa of california president reagan selected john p vukasin jr to be us district judge for northern california39 however vukasin was opposed by senator alan cranston of california who returned negative blue slip to the committee40 despite senator cranstons objection chairman thurmond went ahead with vukasins nomination and on july 21 1983 the nomination

senators daniel inouye and spark matsunaga opposed the nomination and sent back negative blue slips to the committee43 although tradition dictated that negative blue slips from both home state senators would prevent committee action chairman thurmond decided to move forward on november 22 1985 the committee held hearing on the moon nomination this marked the first reported instance in which the judiciary committee acted on nomination despite the presence of two negative blue slips after the hearing the committee took further action and the senate eventually returned the moon nomination on december 20 1985 like senator kennedy in the 96th congress chairman thurmond did not allow the failure of homestate senator to return blue slip to stop committee action furthermore the presence of one or even two negative blue slips was longer enough to prevent committee action the end result was that chairman thurmond substantially changed how the blueslip policy operated yet it should be noted that the moon nomination was the only known example during this time period of chairman moving forward on nomination despite the presence of two negative blue slips this is important because since the blue slip is not committee rule the chairman has the discretion to change the policy when deemed necessary therefore as the vukasin and moon cases show the stated and practiced blueslip policies can at times be confusing if not contradictory to one another 100th103rd congresses under the chairmanship of joseph r biden jr the judiciary committee continued to follow the blueslip modifications put in place by senators kennedy and thurmond however chairman biden also made changes to the blueslip policy during the 101st congress chairman biden issued public statement of the committees blueslip policy shortly after the inauguration of george h w bush in 1989 chairman biden sent letter to the president stating the committees blue slip policy the return of negative blue

bidens letter represented the first formal written statement by judiciary committee chairman regarding the blueslip procedure in that letter chairman biden expressed in what had only been practiced and not stated by chairman before that the committee would longer treat negative blue slip as an absolute means of stopping committee action presidential consultation with both homestate senators might be enough to move the nomination through committee even with the presence of negative blue slip this was important event in terms of outlining clear picture of the standards to be used in the blueslip process in particular chairman bidens letter underscored that prior consultation would be primary factor in evaluating negative blue slip the 1989 nomination of vaughn r walker to be us district judge for northern california marked the first time that senator bidens policy was put to the test walker was originally recommended to the president by senator pete wilson of california californias senior senator alan cranston opposed the nominee in committee senator cranston returned negative blue slip to chairman biden who stated that cranstons opposition would affect walker negatively45 however chairman bidens statement evidently meant that only delay in the committees proceedings would occur and not an outright blocking of the nomination after committee investigation chairman biden moved ahead with the nomination and eventually walker was reported out of the committee by 11 to 2 vote46 soon afterward walker was confirmed by voice vote on november 22 1989 chairman biden made public the standards that the judiciary committee would use in considering negative blue slips the committee had previously worked under the policy that negative blue slip would not necessarily prevent committee action however the previous two chairmen had never publicly stated that modification to the blueslip policy moreover presidents tended to consult with homestate senators before this time but by making the requirements public chairman biden placed the prenomination selection process in the forefront of the confirmation process therefore the letter in stating this expectation helped to address the question of the blue slips place in the appointment process 104th congress to june 5 2001 of the 107th congress after the republican party gained control of the

consideration of nominee unless the administration has not consulted with both home state senators two years later in 1997 press release chairman hatch articulated more detailed account of his blueslip policy this message was response to his colleagues frustrations over not receiving the level of consultation that they have expected chairman hatch began by quoting majority leader george mitchell d on the requirements of executive and legislative consultations on nominations one way to avoid such confrontations between the senate and the white house in the future is for the president to engage in meaningful consultation with the senate before making significant nominations countless historical examples justify consultations the public supports it and common sense counsels it in an era of divided government the choice the two branches face with respect to nominations is the choice we face with respect to all other matters cooperation or confrontation we are confident that meaningful consultation can occur without reducing the role prerogatives of either branch of government and in way which more fully informs the president of other points of view prior to rather than after nomination is made48 chairman hatch went on to state that he had sent letter to the white house counsel which clearly explains this policy49 in that letter he laid out five circumstances that would prompt the judiciary committee to delay or hold up nomination 1 failure to give serious consideration to individuals proposed by home state senators as possible nominees 2 failure to identify to home state senators and the judiciary committee an individual the president is considering nominating with enough time to allow the senator to provide meaningful feedback before any formal clearance ie by the aba or fbi on the prospective nominee is initiated 3 after having identified the name of an individual the president is considering nominating failure to seek home state senators feedback including any objections the senator may have to the prospective nominee at least two weeks before any formal clearances are initiated and b give that feedback serious consideration 47 sen orrin g

general and theodore b olson to be solicitor general of the united states after the question and answer period in response to question concerning the selection process by senator charles schumer chairman hatch stated what his blueslip policy would be under president bush52 chairman hatch began by stating that he would institute the same policy that i had asked the clinton administration to follow53 which was based on the 1989 biden letter to president bush and his own 1995 letter to white house counsel abner mikva chairman hatch went on to describe and quote these letters in detail senator bidens letter explained the return of negative blue slip ordinarily does not preclude consideration of judicial nominee but is given substantial weight by the committee in its evaluation of the nominee senator biden also emphasized the importance of prenomination consultation by the administration with home state senators stressing his belief that quote the nomination process will function more effectively if consultation is taken seriously unquote thus as senator biden also wrote quote if such goodfaith consultation has not taken place the judiciary committee will treat the

and went on to note the senate expects genuine good faith consultation by the administration with home state senators before judicial nomination is made and the administrations failure to consult in genuine good faith with both home state senators itself is grounds for senators return of negative blue slip thus where the administration has failed to provide good faith prenomination consultation negative blue slip is treated as dispositive and precludes committee consideration of judicial nominee55 chairman hatch warned that if any of our colleagues here want to veto the presidents constitutional prerogative to make his appointments with the advice and consent of the senate that is different matter and one which i think diverges from the policy of this committee since as far back as i can remember and that is 25 years since senator kennedy was chairman of this committee56 senator richard j durbin questioned the policy laid out by chairman hatch senator durbin began by stating that the practice that has been followed in the 4 years that i have been in the senate is different than what you have just described in that time one senator could stop nominee from state moreover he added that there have also been times when members of the senate judiciary committee not even from the same state as the nominee could stop nomination57 chairman hatch responded to senator durbins concerns the discussion did not however settle the questions over the committees blueslip policy the exchange ended with the understanding that the blueslip policy would be discussed by the entire judiciary committee later that month the subsequent meeting held in executive session on april 24 2001 reportedly focused on the concerns senator durbin and other democratic senators had relating to the judiciary committees blueslip policy however neither side was able to come to an agreement on what the committees blueslip policy had been or what blueslip policy would be followed in the 107th congress reportedly during this meeting chairman hatch asserted that his policy has always been that negative blue slip from single senator should be given great weight but should not automatically block nomination58 54 ibid p 138 55 ibid p 139 56 ibid p 139 57 ibid p 139 58 heather m rothman committee members still deadlocked on blue slip issue cq daily monitor april 27 2001 p 10 crs18 democratic senators were reportedly alarmed stating that it was an unfair change in the blue slip policy59 part of the problem in reaching compromise was that democratic senators claimed that chairman hatch had allowed individual senators to use blue slip to prevent nominees from being confirmed during the clinton administration for example the cq daily monitor reported that jesse helms rnc used the blue slip to block clintons nominees to the bench in his state even when they had the approval of democrat john edwards60 chairman hatch scheduled another committee meeting on may 3 2001 however news reports stated that the democratic members of the judiciary committee walked out of the meeting because they were being shut out of the judicial nominations process61 both parties held news conferences shortly after to state their position on the matter of blue slips at the democratic news conference senator leahy said that chairman hatch had changed the blueslip policy in place during the clinton administration62 senator leahy read an old version of chairman hatchs blue slip further proceedings on this nominee will be scheduled until both blue slips have been returned by the nominees homestate senators63 senator leahy went on to assert this was the republican policy when there was democratic president it should be the same policy with republican president64 chairman hatch at the republican news conference held the same day answered the democratic senators assertions by stating as i confirmed in two letters to the white house in 1995 and 1997 during my tenure as chairman i continued as matter of practice and policy to follow the committees blue slip policy of my predecessor joe biden65 that policy chairman hatch stated was continuation of senator kennedys blueslip policy which was withholding of blue slip or denial of blue slip or negative blue slip will have great weight but it will not be dispositive66 chairman hatch continued by stating that the change in blueslip policy occurred in 1998 59 elizabeth palmer for bushs judicial nominees tough tribunal awaits cq weekly april 28 2001 p 898 60 amy fagan and elizabeth palmer agreement reached on

through the blue slip policy and changed it to the point and by the way in 1998 we were getting zero zero consultations with the clinton white house i sent them letter saying this is serious problem and i made it very clear that we couldnt put up with it and because of the conflict with the two republican senators we changed the policy to the consent of to require the blue slips from both but mainly because of the lack of consultation 67 chairman hatch defended the 1998 change in the blueslip policy by stating i agreed to follow the policy of biden up till that point 1998 and i still followed it after that point except for those where there was consultation and even then would not allow just one senator to stop nominee68 finally chairman hatch answered the criticisms by democratic senators that there were instances during the clinton administration in which an individual senator could block nomination he asserted there again i followed the biden policy if i did honor negative blue slip as dispositive in and of itself it was because the white house had clearly failed to engage in any meaningful consultation with home state senators69 as the statements by chairman hatch and senator leahy illustrate there was an ongoing factual dispute over the blueslip policy followed by the committee during the clinton presidency both sides made arguments supporting their cause however this was the last substantive debate on the blueslip policy before senator james jeffords of vermont left the republican party to become an independent which led to the change in party control of the senate it should be noted that the may 3 2001 meeting and the news conferences occurred after it was known that the party balance would shift and that senator leahy would become chairman june 6 2001 to the end of the 107th congress on june 6 2001 senator leahy took over as judiciary chairman shortly before the jeffords party switch senator leahy and the other democratic members of the judiciary committee stated in an april 27 2001 letter to white house counsel alberto gonzales how the senate should be consulted by the president in terms of prenomination review this letter sent to gonzales over month before senator leahy became chair of the committee endorsed the 1997 blueslip policy statement made by chairman hatch as the letter notes the administration should undertake to incorporate the following consultative procedures into its selection vetting and nominating processes 1 the administration shall give serious consideration to individuals proposed by home state senators as possible nominees 2 the administration shall consult with home state senators and the judiciary committee both majority and minority regarding individuals the 67 ibid 68 ibid 69 ibid crs20 president is considering nominating with enough time to allow senators to consider the potential nominee and provide meaningful response to the administration before any formal clearance ie by the fbi on the prospective nominee is initiated 3 should the administration choose to begin formal clearance process of nominee despite home state senators objection the administration shall notify the home state senators and the judiciary committee that this is the case before the clearance process starts 4 when the president has made the final decision to nominate an individual home state senators and the judiciary committee shall be given at least one weeks notice before the formal nomination is made 5 when nominee is sent to the senate supporting documentation for the nomination shall be simultaneously sent to the senate in order to expedite the senates evaluation of the nominee 6 the nominee shall be directed by the administration to cooperate fully with senators who seek information regarding that nomination70 although senator leahys statement was further refinement of senator hatchs policy regarding blue slips in terms of consultation it was reported that senator leahy would follow different policy than senator hatchs for example the cq daily monitor reported that chairman leahy indicated he probably will return to the practice of moving ahead with nomination only with approving blue slips from both senators representing the nominees home state71 this report was supported later on june 6 2001 when cq weekly reported that in an interview chairman leahy identified his blueslip policy unless he is satisfied that both senators from the home state of nominee have been consulted by the bush administration nomination will not move72 news reports claim that chairman leahy not only adhered to the policy stated on june 6 2001 but went further73 these reports indicated that chairman leahy permitted michigan democratic senators carl levin and debbie stabenow to not only block nominations of fellow michiganders to the sixth circuit court of appeals but all nominations to that circuit74 the legal times cited an august 6 70 democratic senators committee on the judiciary us senate letter to counsel to the president alberto r gonzales the white house april 27 2001 authors files 71 elizabeth palmer and amy fagan power shift at judiciary could be problem for

senators can only blue slip circuit court nominees which the president has continued crs21 2001 letter written to chairman leahy by senators levin and stabenow asking the chairman to halt all movement on any nominations to the 6th circuit75 reportedly senators levin and stabenow used their blue slips to block confirmation of two sixth circuit nominations jeffrey sutton of ohio and deborah cook of ohio during the 107th congress76 also during the 107th congress chairman leahy along with ranking member hatch agreed to fundamental change to the blueslip system under their agreement the blue slips would be treated as public information77 the two senators stated we both believe that such openness in the confirmation process will benefit the judiciary committee and the senate as whole in order to confirm continuance of this new reform both senators also agreed that this policy of openness with regard to blue slips and the blue slip process will continue in the future regardless of who is chairman or which party is in the majority in the senate78 this agreement was adhered to and continues with blue slips publicly available on the office of legal policy website79 108th congress with senator hatch once again chairing the judiciary committee it was reported that he would reinstate his previous blueslip policy where single negative blue slip from nominees home state wont be enough to block confirmation hearing80 chairman hatch told reporters ill give great weight to negative blue slips but you cant have one senator holding up for instance circuit nominees81 thus the blueslip policy in the 108th congress is that only one of the homestate senators must return positive blue slip before the judiciary committee will move forward with nomination provided that the administration engages in pre nomination consultation with both homestate senators the stated policy was followed when on april 1 2003 chairman hatch granted hearing for carolyn kuhl of california to be us circuit court judge for the ninth 74 continued selected from their homestate thus any attempt to prevent every nomination from the same circuit from being confirmed is unusual 75 inadmissible the legal times

the hearing marked the first time in the 108th congress that the judiciary committee moved forward with nomination without the support of both homestate senators83 senator dianne feinstein of california had returned blue slip to the committee84 the kuhl nomination appears to represent significant change in the blue slip policies between chairman leahy in the 107th congress and chairman hatch in the 108th congress during the 107th congress chairman leahy required both blue slips to be returned which meant that action was taken on kuhls nomination without the return of california senator barbara boxers d blue slip senator leahy had declined to advance the kuhl nomination in the 107th congress however in the 108th congress even without senator boxer returning her blue slip chairman hatch held hearing also in the 108th congress shortly before the 2003 august recess chairman hatch held hearing for henry saad of michigan to be us circuit court judge for the sixth circuit chairman hatch moved forward with the saad nomination despite the objection of michigan senators carl levin and debbie stabenow this marked the first reported instance that nomination with two negative blue slips has had any committee action since 1985 and only the second known case in committee history senators levin and stabenow had returned negative blue slips on march 19 200385 frequently asked questions as this report indicates there are varying nuances to the judiciary committees blueslip policy during the tenure of different chairmen negative blue slip may or may not have permitted homestate senator from stopping all committee action on nomination even the failure to return blue slip has called into question the ability of chairman to move forward on nomination there is also the question of consultation and the degree to which president must consult with both home state senators in the selection of nomination finally even if one understands the blueslip policy and the requirements it places on president particular chairmans own policy may be different in practice than what is stated the following questions attempt to address some of these problems and concerns 82 this was resubmission of carolyn kuhl in the 107th congress she was nominated twice june 22 and sept 4 2001 by president george w bush 83 jennifer dlouhy appeals court nominee kuhl apologizes for stance on bob jones university cq today april 2 2003 p 3 84 senator feinstein returned her blue slip on mar 11 2003 with reserved judgement note on it which meant that the senator had not yet made determination on the nomination although the blue slip was not positive endorsement of the candidate functionally it permitted the chairman to move forward with the nomination because the blue slip was returned without negative statement see office of legal policy website at httpwwwusdojgovolpblueslips1htm 85 see httpwwwusdojgovolpblueslips1htm visited october 21 2003 crs23 what is blue slip blue slip is senate judiciary committee custom in which the chairman seeks either approval or disapproval from both homestate senators in practice the chairman will send blue colored form which is called blue slip to the senators of the state where the president has nominated either us circuit or district court nominee depending on the chairmans policy at the time return of one or two negative blue slips by the homestate senators could stop further action on the nominee and thus prevent confirmation what are the justifications for blueslip policy the practice of using blue slip can be seen as way for senators to have role in the selection of an individual who may have some impact on hisher state thus when president submits to the senate individuals who will either fill federal position in senators state or will represent the state in some capacity the chairman will give blue slip to homestate senators so that they may express an opinion on the nomination how many committees have blueslip policy the senate committee on the judiciary is the only committee in either the senate or the house of representatives that currently employs the blue slip yet many committees that have review function on executive nominations continue to practice to varying degrees the custom of senatorial courtesy that the blue slip represents who sets the blueslip policy the blueslip policy is set by the chairman of the judiciary committee at the outset of every congress in recent years the chairman has sent letter to the president stating committee policy on blue slips and expectations the committee has of the president with regard to prenomination consultation with homestate senators each chairman also has the ability to make changes to the blue slip policy whenever he or she deems it appropriate why does the blueslip policy change each chairman has the prerogative to set blueslip policy it generally changes when there is change in the party majority what is the blueslip policy in the 108th congress the blueslip policy in the current congress is that negative blue slip is given due consideration by the chairman but will not prevent future action by the committee unless the president has not consulted with both homestate senators crs24 what are the key benchmark dates for blue slips the following are some of the more important dates of note for blue slips 1917 first appearance of blue slip 1917 first appearance of negative blue slip 1922 time limit placed on the return of blue slips 1956 first formal change in blueslip policy since its creation 1979 second alteration in blueslip policy 1989 first public statement of the blueslip policy 1998 time limit removed on the return of blue slips 2001 first time blue slips made public when does blue slip postpone nomination indefinitely depending on the chairmans policy during given congress the postponement of nominee would either take return of negative blue slip or the failure of senator to return blue slip see table on the blueslip policy of the last six chairmen are blue slips public information yes as part of the june 2001 reorganization agreement blue slips were made public for the first time starting in the 107th congress the status of every blue slip for the 108th congress can be found on the office of legal policy website page86 conclusion the blue slip represents an aspect of senatorial courtesy blueslip policy has undergone various changes in its 86year history the blue slip started out as way for the judiciary committee chairman to gain information on judicial nomination from 1917 to 1956 the blue slip provided homestate senators with means of notifying the chairman if the president selected an individual who was personally objectionable to them negative blue slip did not stop committee action until the mid1950s other senators would reject nomination on the senate floor if the home state senator would stand and state that the nominee was personally obnoxious eventually the blue slip evolved from an informal committee device once used to gain information on nominee to an important device for checking the executive branch in the appointment process since 1979 the impact of negative blue slips has varied as leadership in the senate committee on the judiciary has changed some chairmen have permitted committee action on nomination only when both homestate senators return positive blue slips however other chairmen have proceeded to consider nomination with receipt of only one positive blue slip even though recent chairmen 86 see httpwwwusdojgovolpblueslips1htm crs25 have implemented different blueslip policies each has communicated to the president the importance of prenomination consultation with both homestate senators prenomination consultation has been key expectation of recent chairmen in the evaluation of negative blue slips the president is now expected to consult and involve each homestate senator in the prenomination phase of the selection process without consultation by the white house chairmen appear to accord greater value to negative blue slip submitted by nonconsulted homestate senator while the judiciary chairman controls the impact of negative blue slip individual senators can still determine the fate of judicial nomination after it is reported to the senate floor senator or group of senators may choose to either place hold on or filibuster nomination in each instance at least theoretically vote can be delayed indefinitely thus preventing confirmation of the presidents nominee negative blue slip therefore is not the only means available to prevent the confirmation of judicial nomination by homestate senator this report will be updated to reflect policy changes relating to
