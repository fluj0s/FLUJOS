trafficking in computer access 18 usc 1030a6 paragraph 1030a6 outlaws misconduct similar to the access device proscriptions of section 1029 although limited it provides several distinct dvantages first it covers passwords to government computers more clearly than does section 1029 second as something of lesser included offense to section 1029 it affords the government plea bargain room in case that it might otherw ise be forced to bring under section 1029 or abandon third it contributes means of cutting off the practice of publicly posting access to confidential computer systems w ithout imposing severe penalties unless the misconduct persists fourth it supplies basis for private forcement through the civil liability provisions of subsec tion 1030g of misconduct that may be more appropriately addressed by the courts as private wrong the elements of the crime are knowingly and with an intent to defraud trafficking in ie to transfer or ot herwise dispose of to another or obtain control of with intent to transfer or dispose of 18 usc 1029e5 computer password or similar computer key either of federal computer or in manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce penalties

applicable provisions dealing with attempt conspiracy and complicity will apply with equal force in cas involving paragraph 1030a6 paragraph 1030a6 appears to have few counterparts in federal law other than the prohibition against trafficking in access devices cre dit card fraud under 18 usc 1029a2 and the wire fraud provisions of 18 usc 1343 nevertheless either of these may provide the foundation for rico 18 usc 1962 or money laundering 18 usc 1956 1957 prosecution so that should conduct in violati on of paragraph 1030a6 also offend either the mail fraud or credit card fraud prohibitions criminal breach of rico or the money laundering provisions ma also have occurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20830crs6 computer espionage 18 usc 1030a1 paragraph 1030a1 essentia lly tracks existing federal espionage laws 18 usc 793 794 and 798 that ban disclosure of in formation potentially detrimental to our national defense and well being or more simply laws that outlaw spying the distinctive feature of paragraph 1030a1 is its merger of elements of pionage and computer abuse broken down into simplified version of its constituent elements it bars anyone from either willfully disclosing willfully attempting to disclose or willfully failing to return classified information concerning nati onal defense foreign relations or atomic energy with reason to believe that the information either could to used to injury the united states or could be used to the advantage of the foreign nation when the information was acquired by unauthorized computer access penalties not more than 10 years not more than 20 years for repeat offenders andor fine under title 18 18 usc 1030c1 other crimes espionage prosecutions are not comm on the attempt conspiracy and complicity observations continue to apply and the rico 18 usc 1962 and money laundering 18 usc 1956 1957 may be implicat ed through the application of sections 793 794 or 798 to conduct that offends paragraph 1030a1
