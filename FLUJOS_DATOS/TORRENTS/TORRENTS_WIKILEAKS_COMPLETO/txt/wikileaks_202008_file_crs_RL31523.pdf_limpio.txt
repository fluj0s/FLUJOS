amendment right to counsel suspended sentence suspended sentence that may result in imprisonment may not be imposed on an indigent defendant unless he was offe red the assistance of counsel during his trial the court held in argersinger v hamlin 1972 that defense counsel must be appointed in any prosecution that actually results in imprisonment the same rule should prevent activation of susp ended sentence of imprisonment after an unrepresented defendant has violated the terms of probati on it makes little sense therefore to allow the initial imposition of the suspended sentence at trial the probation revocation hearing in alabama in which the sole issue is whether the defendant violated the rms of probation cannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel because it does not even address the key sixth amendment inquiry whether the adjudication of guilt is sufficiently reliable to permit incarceration the right to appointed counsel ar ises at the critical stage when guilt or innocence is decided and vulnerability to imprisonment is determined the rule conditioning imposition of suspended sentence on provision of appointed couns would not substantially limit the states ability to impose probation most states already provide counsel to misdemeanor defendants nd the option of pretrial probation is available to those states that cannot b ear the costs of providing counsel on routine basis 54 opinion of court by ginsburg join ed by stevens oconnor souter and breyer dissenting opinion by scalia joined by rehnquist kennedy and thomas ashcroft v aclu 122 s ct 1700

does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad under the first amendment the fact that web publishers lack any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular web users and that copa may therefore subject web publishers to the standards of the most puritanical community does not without reference to copas other provisions require holding that

pornography prevention act of 1996 cppa that extend the federal prohibition against child pornography to sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors but that were produced without us ing any real children violate the first amendment these provisions cover any visual image that appears to be of minor engaging in sexually explic it conduct and any image promoted or presented in way that conveys th impression that it depicts minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the first prohibition thus can extend to computergenerated virt ual images to movies in which younglooking adult actor appears to be minor engaging in sexual activity and even to renaissance painting depicting scene from classical mythology neither obscenity nor child pornography is protected by the first amendment but the cppa extends beyond both categories work is obscene as defined by miller v california 1973 only if the government pr oves that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest is patently offensive and lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value th cppa which would punish possession of material due to the presence of single explicit scene regardless of the works overall value fails to satisfy the miller test the court in new york v ferber 1982 justified the first amendment exception for child pornography on the basis of the government s interest in protecting the children who are exploited and abused in the production process the cppa however prohibits speech containing images whic h do not involve let alone harm any children in the production process th governments rationales for the cppa that pedophiles might use the material s to encourage children to participate in sexual activity and might whet their own sexual appetites with it thereby increasing the sexual abuse and ex ploitation of actual children are inadequate government may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed at some indefinite future time the government also argued that the existence of virtual child pornography can make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors because as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that picture was produced using actual childre n this rationale turns the first amendment upside down the government may not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech the government does not offer serious defense of the cppas ban on pandering the prohibition on conveying the impression that materials depict minor 72 youthfuladult porn

retarded individual constitu tes cruel and unusual punish ment prohibited by the eighth amendment the eighth amendment prohibits excessive punishments and reflects the principle that punishment should be graduated and proportioned to the offense what is excessive or cruel and unusual is measured by todays standards the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of maturing society proportionality review should be informedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31523crs3 by objective standards the clearest and most reliable of which is the legislation enacted by the states and by congress the courts own judgment is also brought to bear much has changed since the court concluded in penry v lynaugh 1989 that execution of the mentally retarded was not unconstitutional there was nationa l consensus in 1989 when only two states and the federal government llowed executions but prohibited execution of the mentally retarded and fourteen other states prohibited capital punishment altogether since then an additional 16 states have prohibited execution of the mentally retarded nd states have enacted legislation reinstating the power it is not so much the number of these states that is significant but the consistency of the direction of change in addition so few mentally retarded offenders have been executed in those stat that have continued to allow it that the practice can be said to be truly unusua l it is fair to say that national consensus has developed against executi on of the mentally retarded the courts independent evalua tion of the issue reveals reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have created this national consensus there is reason to question whether either justification that has been recognized as basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders penalty appr opriate to effect retribu tion necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender and mental retardation diminishes culpability deterrence the other justification fo r capital punishment can work only if potential offenders can evaluate the poten tial consequences of their actions and adjust behavior accordingly yet the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpable also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as penalty and as result control their conduct based on that information finally mentally retarded offenders are more likely to make false confessions and less likely to be able to present their best case for mitigation 63 opinion of

punitive damages unlike compensatory damages and injunctive relief are generally not available for breach of contract anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31523crs4 implied right to punitive damages cannot r easonably be found in title vi the conclusion is consistent with the wellsettled rule that court may resort to any available remedy when legal rights have been invaded in the context of violation of spending clau legislation the legal wr ong is failure to fulfill contractual obligation and that wrong is remedied when the recipient compensates the government or th irdparty beneficiary for the loss

coal co 122 s ct 941 70 uslw 4127 21902 coal industry retiree health benefits the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 does not authorize th commissioner of social security to assign responsibility for retired miners to the successors in interest of outof business operator companies that were signatories to bituminous coal wage agreement the act is clear and unamb iguous on this point if signatory company is longer in business the act assigns liability for covered retirees to defined group of related persons there are three categories of related persons as well as an additional category of successor in interest of any person described in those three categories because signatory company itself is not described in any of the three categories of related persons successor in interest of the signatory does not fa ll within the additional category under the circumstances successor liability shoul d not be inferred other sections of the act provide clearly and explicitly fo r successor liability nd it is generally assumed that congress acts intentiona lly and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion of explicit langua ge legislative history in the form of floor statements by the bills s ponsors cannot overcome the clear and unambiguous statutory language the c ounterintuitive result that direct successor in interest of signatory may not be made responsible for signatorys former employees while succe ssors to corporate affiliates of the signatory may be is not an absu rd result that requires different interpretation the court will not sec

disability as including an inability to work for 12month period is lawful and entitled to deference under principles set forth in chevron v nrdc 1984 the social security act defines disability as an inability to engage in gainful employment due to an impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for continuous period of not less than 12 months in interpreting the term inability to include 12month requirement the ssa reads expected to last as applicable only prospectively when the inability to work has not yet lasted 12 months under the ssas interpretati on claimant who has returned to work within the 12month period is barred fro m benefits whether or not his impairment had been expected to last longer than 12 m onths the statute does not unambiguously forbid the regulation although the 12month phrase modi fies only the wordhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31523crs5 impairment the statute is silent as to any durational requirement for inability to work the agencys construction is permissible the basic objectives of the statute require that some duration requirement be recognized and the agencys choice of 12 months is reasonable one that reconciles the impairment and inability language the agencys regulations although only recently promulgated by noticeandcomment rulemaking reflect longstanding inte rpretation that congress has not changed in spite of frequently amending or reen acting the relevant provisions the fact that the act authorizes trial work period prior to the expiration of 12 months for persons entitled to disability benefits does not preclude the ssas use of hindsight to make the disability dete rmination here again the statute is ambiguous and the agencys interpretati on is reasonable it not being evident why claimant who returns to work early should qualify only if that return was kind of medical surprise 90 opinion of court by br eyer unanimous in part and joined in separate part by rehnquist stevens oconnor kenne dy

52802 habeas corpus claim of ineffective assistance of counsel claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of capital murder trial should have been analyzed under principles announced in strickland v washington 1984 not under united states v cronic 1984 in addition the strickland inquiry is constrained by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 which allows habeas relief only if the state courts decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law strickland which requires that courts review of an attorneys representation be highly deferential established twopart test did counsels performance fall below an objec tive standard of reasonableness and is there reasonable probability that the result would have been different buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31523crs6 for counsels errors cronic recognized that there are some circumstances so likely to prejudice the accused that act ual proof of prejudice is unnecessary as for example when counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecutions case to meaningful adversarial testing in this case counsel failed to adduce mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase and waived closing argument at sentencing although the state had pr esented evidence of four aggravating circumstances that require d imposition of the death pe nalty if established and not outweighed by mitigating evidence counsel did not entirely fail to present mitigating evidence but merely did so at specific points in the process so therefore cronic is inapplicable because strickland applies there is merit to the claim that the state court decision was contrary to clearly established law nor was ther unreasonable application of strickland during the guilt phase of the trial counsel had attempted to tablish an insanity defense and had presented evidence of vietnam veterans syndrome counsel could reasonably have concluded that the substance of this testimony was still fresh to the jury at the senten cing phase counsels decision to waive final argument at sentencing was not unreasonable given that the junior prosecutor had presented lowkey closing and closing argument by defense counsel would have allowed the very persuasive lead prosecutor to offer rebuttal 81 opinion of court by rehnquist jo ined by oconnor scalia kennedy souter

is constitutional the policy reasonably serves the school distri cts important inte rest in detecting and preventing drug use among its stude nts the principles announced in vernonia school district v acton 1995 upholding drug testing of student athletes govern the somewhat different facts of this case students privacy interest is limited in pub lic school environment th fact that athletes are subject to regular physicals and community undress was not ssential to the decision in vernonia that decision depended primarily upon the schools custodial responsibility and authority wh ich is equally app licable to athletic and to nonathletic extracurricular activ ities the character of the privacy invasion is minimally intrusive the policy provides that the faculty monitors who collect urine samples are to wait outside closed restroom stall while the student produces the sample and test results are kept in confidential files finally the nature and immediacy of the governments concerns in protecting the health and safety of its students nd preventing drug use are important and the testing program is reasonably effective means of addressing these concerns although there was some evid ence of drug use at tecumseh schools drug testing program need not always be justified by demonstrated problem of drug abuse and there is thres hold level of drug use that need be satisfied

as special in practice as its terminology might suggest an original petition in higher court serves the same purpose that an appeal serves in other states californias system functions in way sufficiently like other state systems of collateral review to bring intervals between lower court decision and filing of new petition in higher court within the scope of the word pending this ruling

authority that is not related to the safety violations at issue general marine safety regulations governing such things as fire extinguishers and life preservers do not address the occupational safety

individual whose perfo rmance of the job would endanger his own health because of his disability is permissible regulation under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada the statute allows employers to impose jobrelated qualification st andards and provides that these may include requirement that an individual shall not pose direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace the eeoc regulation carries the defense one step further by allowing an employer to screen out potential employee on the basis of direct threat to the employee himself the statutory language does not create ne gative inference that disallows the regulation the interpretive canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius is inapplicable the statutory text itself with the expansive phrasing of may include points directly away from the expressionexclusion rule also the statute contains series of terms from which an omission bespeaks negative implication finally there is apparent stopping point to the argument that congress intended to limit protection to those in the wor kplace the specified interest in protecting others in the workplace could not have been intended to require the hiring of someone whose disability would endanger those outside the workplace although the eeocs regula tions implementing the rehabilitation act of 1973 had explicit thr eattoself language regu lations of certain other agencies did not and congresss omission of any such language in the ada created negative implication the eeocs ada regulation is reasonable means of resolving

by chapter 35 of the internal revenue code th relevant language in 25 usc 2719di provides that the provisi ons of the internal revenue code including sections 1441 3402q 6041 and 60501 and chapter 35 of such code concerning the reporting and withhol ding of taxes with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering opera tions shall apply to indian gaming operations in the same manner as such provisions apply to state gaming and wagering operations the issue arises because the referenced chapter 35 simply imposes taxes and has nothing to do with the reporting or withholding of taxes the language outside the pa renthetical concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes is unambiguous and contro ls the references within use of the parentheses i ndicates that congress inte nded the references to be simply illustrative hence redundant the reference to chapter 35 is simply bad example drafting mistake resulting from the failure to delete an inappropriate crossreference th legislative history supports this interpretation the original senate bill app lied both to taxation and to reporting and withholding but the reference to taxation was deleted in committee without explanation it is difficult to believe that the committee substituted confusiongenerating numerical crossreference for preexisting language that was unambiguous the easier ex planation is that the committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31523crs9 unintentionally failed to remove what had become superfluous cross reference canons of interpreta tion some of whic h support contrary conclusion are not mandatory rules but are guides that need not be conclusive moreover the canon that ll words of statute are to be given effect is offset by the canon that permits court to reject words as surplusage if they were inadvertently inserted or repug nant to the rest of the statute and the canon that ambiguous statutes are to be interpreted to benefit indian tribes is offset in this case by the canon requi

deceiving her in concealing information about her husband foreign dissident being detained and tortured in his own country by persons paid by the cia failed to state an actionable claim the point of recognizing an access claim is to provide some effective vindication for separate and distinct right to seek judicial relief for some wrong the access right is ancillary to the underlying claim complaint that alleges denial of access therefore must describe the underlying cause of action in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure 8a and when the claim looks backward as this one does must identify remedy that has been foreclosed the need to identify viable claim is especially important in cases challenging the conduct of foreign rela tions where issues of separation of powers may implicate the doctrine of constitutional avoidance the complaint in this case did not even come close to stating constitutional claim for denial of access upon which relief could be grante d the complaint identified neither the underlying cause of action nor any reme dy that was independent of relief that might be available on one or more of the 24 other counts set forth in the complaint even though cause of ac tion intentional infliction of emotional distress was identified during oral argument in the appeals court there was identification of remedy that coul d not be obtained on an

adequacy of notice whether the notice was reasonably calculated under all the circumst ances to apprise the prisoner of the pendency of the forfeiture proceeding to satisfy this standard the government need not provide actual notice but must make efforts to provide actual notice those efforts need not be heroic but merely reasonably calculated to notify the targeted party the fact that

agency state sovereign immunity bars the federal maritime commission from adjudicating complaints filed by private party against nonconsenting state the fact that the commission does not exercise the judicial power of the united states does not resolve the case the eleventh amendment which provides that the judicial power shall not extend to suits against state by citizens of another state does not define the scope of the states s overeign immunity but rather is but one particular exemplification of that immunity state sovereign immunity is protected by the presumption that the constitution does not raise up any proceedings against the states that we re anomalous and unheard of when the constitution was adopted commission pr oceedings before administrative law judges aljs are the type of proceedings from which the framers would have thought the states possessed immunity wh they agreed to enter the union the similarities between commission proceedings and civil litigation targeted by the eleventh amendment are overwhelming administrative law judges and trial judges are functionally comparable and the proceedings themselves share numerous common features the preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is to accord states the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities the affront to st ates dignity is the same whether an adjudication takes place in an article iii court or in an administrative tri bunal two arguments raised by the united states are unavailing the fact that the commission cannot enforce its own orders but must seek enforcement in federal district court is distinction without significant differen ce states are still in effect coerced into defending them selves before the commission because they may not challenge the merits of co mmission order when defending against an enforcement action in district court the argument that commission proceedings do not present the same threat to the financ ial integrity of states as would private lawsuits commission reparati ons orders must be enfor ced by the private party receiving the award and in such actions the state can use sovereign immunity to bar recovery misses the point that the sovereign immunity doctrines central purpose is to accord the states respe ct state sovereign immunity does not yield to the constitutional necessity of uniformity in the regulation of

sevenyear mandatory minimum sentence applicable if the firearm is brandished during the offense is therefore sentencing factor and not an element of separate offense nd the finding of brandishing may constitutionally be made by the judge the structure of the statutory provision suggests that brandishing is senten cing factor the provision follows the customary federal pattern of listing offense

section specifies an increased mandatory minimum sentence as offense elements on the contrary the sentencing guidelines treat brandishing and discharging as sentencing factors for numerous offenses moreover the effect on the defendants sentence is c onsistent with trad itional understandings about how sentencing factors operate the section specifies maximum sentence and the judge may impose sentence of seven years or more with or without finding that the defendant br andished firearm the constitutional issue is controlled by mcmillan v pennsylvania 1986 upholding an increase in the

service does not change the character of the attaching entity and it is the attaching entity not the nature of service that determines jurisdiction under the act the fact that the act contains specific authority for two types of rates one for attachments by cable companies solely to provide cable service the other for attachments by telecommunications companies does not mean that these are the exclusive rates allowed or that attachments not corre sponding to either rate category are disallowed if the attachments at issue do not fall into either rate category this would simply mean that the fcc must prescribe just and reasonable rates for them the attachment of equipment of wireless telecomm unications providers is also subject to regulation under the act pole attach ments are

the assignment as taking the test itself and the act does not prohibit such educational technique s other sections of the act support this interpretation the school must m aintain record of those who have requested access to st udents education records and this requirement would become weighty administrative burden on teachers if it were applied in the peer grading context the fact that this

penalty for noncompliance the regulation provides that if an employ ee takes medical leave and the employer does not designate the leave as fmla leave and so notify the employee the leave taken does not count against the employees fmla entitlement in this case the employer granted the employee 30 weeks of leave rather than the total of 12 required by the fmla but did not notify the employee that her leave counted as fmla leave the regulati on would have penalized the employer by requiring that it grant an additional 12 weeks of leave even if the regulations additional notice requirement is valid the categorical penalty for its breach is contrary to the acts remedial desig n the fmla authorizes damages and equitable relief only if an employee blishes that she has been prejudiced by

exception the period of time during which the property was subject to the moratoria may not be severed from the remainder of fee simple property estate in order to invoke the lucas exception the appropriate focus is on the parcel as whole both temporal and spatial dime nsions must be considered if property interest is to be viewed in its entirety because the property will recover value as soon as the prohibition is lifted fee simple estate is not rendered valueless by temporary prohibition on economic use the courts decision in first english 1987 is not controlling there the court

categorical rule for moratoria an extreme rule that would require compensation for any depriva tion of all economic use matter how brief would render routine government processes prohibitively expensive or encourage hasty decisionmaking narrower rule excluding normal delays associated with the processing of permits or applicable only if delays exceed one year would still impose serious

tax is imposed on wages paid by an employer and the term wages is defined to include tips received by an employee in the course of his employment the respondents linguistic argument makes too much out of too little the fact that the definitional language speaks in the singul ar is overborne by the fact that the operational sections speak in the pl ural the fact th at other statutory provisions authorize the irs to use estimation for other purposes does not create negative implication that the irs may not do so in calculating the tips component of wages the fact that the aggregate estima will sometimes be inaccurate does not mean that its use is unreasonable taxpayer remains free to show that the method likely produced an inaccurate result in his case moreover the respondent did not establish that individualized assessments would inevitably produce more reasonable result than the estimates an alleged fairness problem created by an irs regulation that directs the employer to calculate fica taxes on the basis of tips reported by empl oyees is alleviated by the fact that penalties do not attach until after the employer refuses an irs demand for payment based on estimated tips not reported the abuse of power argument also fails use of aggregate estimates is not prohibited by the statutes that protect restaurants from onerous monitoring requirements 63 opinion of court

those rights therefore was not unconstitutional the right to receive exculpatory impeachment information from prosecutors before trial is part of the sixth amendments basic fair trial guarantee by pleading guilty however defendant forgoes the right to fair trial and other accompanying constitutional guarantees disclosure of impeachment information is an important aspect of the fairness of trial

substantial competitive capital spending by entrants has occurred under telric telric ppears to be reasonable policy for now and that is all that counts the rule of constitutional avoidance is
