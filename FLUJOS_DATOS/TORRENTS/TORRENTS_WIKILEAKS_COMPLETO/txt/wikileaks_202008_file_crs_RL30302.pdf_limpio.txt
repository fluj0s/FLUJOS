federal excise tax on tires where the rubber meets the road updated april 4 2006 pamela j jackson analyst in public sector economics government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30302federal excise tax on tires where the rubber meets the road summary the excise tax on tires was first levied in 1918 mainly because of revenue needs brought about by world war i the tax wa s reduced after the war and then repealed in 1926 the levy was reintroduced durin g the great depression at time when federal individual income ta x revenues were plummeting and was increased to help finance world war ii general reduction in rates was in the offing just before the outbreak of the korean conflict but reve nue needs brought about by that war prevented the lowering of rates more recent history shows that in 1956 the rate of the tax was raised in response to legislati on enacted to build the interstate highway system and to create the highway trust fund scheduled reductions did not occur after the construction of the interstate hi ghway system had been extended goal of the surface transportation assistance act of 1982 was to redistribute highway costs between car and truck users at that time the tax structure was changed so that the tax was imposed only on heavy tires with tax rates that are graduated and increased along with the tires weight the taxpayer relief act of 1997 repealed the exclusion of the value of the tires from the 12 retail excise tax on heavy highway trucks trailers and tractors but provided credit offset to the retail tax for the tire tax paid under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the tax based on tire weight was replaced with rates based on the load capacity of the tire the federal excise tax imposed on tires is now schedul ed to expire on october 1 2011 today the premise for the excise tax on tires is that heavier vehicles cause greater damage to both roadways and bridges and that the excise tax on tires resembles pricing mechanism that is proxy for highway wearandtear charges this premise still holds true as load capacity must exceed 3500 pounds before the tax is imposed thus exempting tires on lighter vehicles tire excise taxes still produce revenues for the highway trust fund and repeal of the existing tax would require additional taxes to be imposed on other sources so as to provide an equivalent amount of revenues to build and maintain roadways this excise tax is said to be easy to administer with minimal federal collection costs several arguments are advanced against the imposition of the tire tax first some view this selective excise tax as discriminating against the tire and related industries whose products are taxed and so the trucking industry which depends on the product the commercial truck tran sportation industry pays this tax while competitors such as railroads and waterw ays have corresponding excise tax thus creating an intermodal equity issue second to the extent that the excise tax on tires is passed forward into the cost of goods sold it places burden on lower income individuals since individuals with lower incomes relative to those with higher incomes tend to spend larger portion of their income for the same consumption amount thus to the extent that the tax is passed forward to consumers the tax is regressive this report will not be

excise tax on tires where the rubber meets the road legislative history and rationale history of the federal excise tax on tires shows that initial adoption occurred as result of the revenue needs of world war i with the inclusion of the tax in the revenue act of 19181 this act imposed the tax on both tires and tubes at the rate of 5 of the retail price at the conclusi on of the war certain fiscal problems of the united states remained and because of re venue needs the excise tax was extended at the same rate by the revenue act of 19212 as the financial condition of the country improved the tax was first reduced from 5 to 2½ by the revenue act of 19243 before being repealed by the revenue act of 19264 todays excise tax derives from the reinstitution of the tax at 2¼ cents per pound on tires and 4 cents per pound on inner tubes by the re venue act of 19325 the 1932 act changed the structure of the ta x from tax on price to tax on weight the first revenue act of 19406 raised the tax rates to 2½ cents and 4½ cents per pound respectively the reintroduction of th excise tax and increase in rate was primarily brought about to make up for the reduction in revenues from income taxes caused by the great depression at that time the excise tax on tires and tubes was not viewed as hardship on business the revenue act of 19417 increased the tax rates from 4 cents to 9 cents on tubes and from 2¼ cents to 5 cents on tires various excise tax rates were increased as part of general increase in taxes during the world war ii period there were rate changes in 1943 howe ver the revenue act of 19438 redefined rubber to include synthetic and substitute rubber and later the rates we re codified in the internal revenue code of 19549httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30302crs2 10 highway revenue act of

provided for significant expansion of the federalaid highway program and authorized federal funding over longer period of time so as to permit longrange pl anning it was considered necessary to authorize the entire interstate highway program to assure orderly planning and completion of this network of highways throughout the united states as efficiently and as economically as possible in the case of tire taxes the act raised certain rates and expanded the rate structure by prescrib ing different rates fo r different tire types tires for highway vehicles we re taxed at 8 cents per pound other tires at 5 cents per pound inner tubes at 9 cents per pound and tread rubber at 3 cents per pound from that time forward proceeds from tire excise taxes have been transferred to the highway trust fund established by that act the act provided for rate reduction in 1972 which was rescheduled because the in terstate highway sy stem was still under construction in 1960 an act called excise tax laminated tires11 provided lower tax rate of 1 cent per pound for laminated tires whic h consist wholly of scrap rubber and not of the type used on highway vehicles congress recognized that the very heavy weight of laminated tires disadvantaged this new small industry since the tax represented nearly 20 of the retail cost of the tire the excise tax rates on tires were once again changed in 196112 this time the federalaid highway act of 196113 provided excise tax rate increases to 10 cents per pound for highway vehicle tires up 2 cen ts per pound 10 cents per pound for inner tubes up 1 cent per pound and 5 cents pe r pound of tread rubber up 2 cents per pound rates of 5 cents per pound for other than laminated and 1 cent for laminated tires were left intact without change again rate reductions were scheduled for 1972 three subsequent public laws p l 91605 pl 94280 and pl 9559914 postponed the scheduled ra reductions first from 1972 to 1977 then from 1977 to 1979 and finally from 1979 to 1984 thus as the highwa trust fund was extended so too were the excise taxes th at financed the national highway system reduction in the rate of the tire ex cise tax of 25 was part of the determination of second er taxes enacted in 198015 the provision reduced the tax rate applicable to new highway tires to 975 cents per pound and for nonhighway tires to 4875 cents per pound the law

weight instead of sales price making these changes was to simplify co llection procedures without significantly affecting overall tax receipts in an effort to stimulate job cr eation the congress passed the surface transportation assistance act of 198216 one of its goals besides increased revenues for construction and maintena nce of the nations highways was redistribution of highway costs between car and truck users accordingly the act changed several of the excise taxes that fund the highway trust fund for example the excise taxes on tread rubber and inner t ubes were repealed as were the taxes on nonhighway and laminated tires new tax st ructure for heavy tires with graduated excise tax rates dependent on tire weight was established tires which weigh less than 40 pounds were exempted from excise ta x so that tires for most passenger cars are longer taxable the excise tax rates on heavy tires ranged from 15 to 90 cents pound according to the weight of the tire these rates are shown in the following table table 1 excise tax rates on tires under the surface transportation assistance act of 1982 weight of tire tax 0 40 lbs tax 40 70 lbs 15 cents per lb over 40 lbs70 90

and tread rubber floor stock these provisions adjusted for taxes previously paid on dealer stock that had not yet b een sold from 1982 through the end of 2004 excise tax rates were not changed but various tax acts which have extended the interstate highway system have also extended the tire excise taxes an indirect change occurred to the fe deral tire excise tax under the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the modification made by the act was in response to disputes occurring during tax audits the tire excise tax is based on weight rather than as tax on the retail selling price18 in addition to the federal tax on tires there is federal retail excise tax 12 imposed on heavy high way trucks trailers and tractors since the tires were taxed separately the tires retail sales value was not being included in determining the federal retail excise tax on heavy vehicles under the act the value of tires was to be included in determining the federal retail sales tax however

taxes pa id was allowed agains t the retail sales tax on heavy highway vehicles the change was effective as of january 1 1998 the joint tax committee estimated that this change would increase federal revenues by 452 million during the fy1997fy2002 period and 979 million during the fy1997fy2007 period19 the excise tax on tires was last extended under the surface transportation revenue act of 199820 the american jobs creation act of 200421 changed the method of taxing tires from the graduated weight structure of prior law to tax based on the load capacity of the tire22 the tax is set at the rate of 945 cents for each 10 pounds of tire load capacity in excess of 3500 pounds in the case of super single or bias ply tires the tax rate is set at 4725 cents for each 10 pounds tire load capacity in excess of 3500 pounds this change has been scored by the joint committee on taxation as having negligible impact on federal revenues it was argued th at the lower rate on super single or bias ply tires is justified since bi as ply tires do not last as long and therefore must be replaced more frequently than radial tires we are unaware of any studies which support or rebut this ssertion however it is repor ted that bias ply tires are used to greater extent on construction and farm equipment vehicles thus while tires on these vehicles may carry the same heavy loads as radial tires they often travel less frequently and fo r shorter distances on highways and thoroughfares which are supported by the tire tax the ameri can jobs creation act of 2004 also provided that tires sold for the exclusive use of th department of defense or the coast guard would be exempt from the tax former exemption for tires with an internal wire fastening agent was repealed from the law23 provision included in the energy ta x incentives act of 2005 clarifies the definition of super single tires super sing tires are those with width greater than 13 inches they are designed to replace two tires in dual fitment and are subject to lower tax rate of 4725 cents for each 10 pounds load capacity exceeding 3500 pounds under the clarification super si ngle tire does not include tires designed to serve as steering tires since steering axles are not equipped with dual fitment the clarification was made effective as if included in the american jobs creation act of 2004 the revenue effect was scored as being negligible also included in this legislation is requirement that the internal revenue service collect revenue data for each class of taxable tire beginning january 1 2006 this report is to

from the tire taxes prior to the change in taxing load capacity the report is scheduled to be submitted to congress by july 1 2007 the tire excise tax is currently sc heduled to expire on october 1 2011 however if one uses the past as guide it appears likely that the tax will see further extension recent developments congress continues to consider highwa reauthorization proposals in the 109th congress while the highway public trans it and road safety pr ojects funding levels expire on may 31 2005 the federal excise tax on tires does not expire until september 30 2005 the house of repr esentatives approved 2839 billion bill entitled the transportation equity act legacy for users hr 3 in 417 to 9 vote on march 10 2005 that legislation in cludes an extension of the tire tax through september 30 2011 likewise the senate has passed its version of the bill entitled the safe accountable flexible efficient trans portation equity bill of 2005 safetea in vote of 89 to 11 on may 17 2005 the nates version of the bill adds 112 billion in additional revenues all of which is fully offset it is argued that this additional revenue is needed so that all states will receive as much in federal highway aid as they pay in federal gasoline excise taxes like the house of representatives the senates proposal would extend the tire tax through september 30 2011 the white house remains committed to the funding level proposed by the president in his fy2005 budget the presid ents senior adviso rs have recommended that he veto the legislati on if his net funding author ization level 2839 billion over six years is not met24 why is the tax based on weight or load capacity rather than sales price there are two main reasons why the tax is imposed upon the weight or load capacity rather than the sales price of tires at the time of world war ii there simply were substitutes for rubber and domes tic rubber supply since rubber was necessary commodity for the war effort the imposition of this excise tax was used as means to discourage domestic consum ption as such the person using more rubber and heavier tires would shoul der heavier tax burden than those persons conserving the valuable commodity in this manner two objectives were accomplished first the purchaser would purchase tires with less rubber content and manufacturers were provided with anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30302crs6 incentive to find alternate means of making tires with less rubber or with other substitutes synthetic tires were brought on the market shortly after this time ironically an excise tax was placed upon these synthetic tires because the revenue needs of the country were still the primary motive for the excise tax on tires and tubes the second reason for basing the tax on weig ht or load capacity is that it is manufacturers excise tax that is assumed to be passed forward to the eventual consumer administratively the tax is much easier to collect from few manufacturers than from the many dealers that sell tires if sales price were used then collection would have to be assigned at the point the consumer actually takes possession of the tire because of sales tradeins etc the tax would be more difficult to monitor and the number of fi rms collecting and t hus remitting revenues to the internal revenue service irs would be much greater resulting in greater administrative collection expense for irs the proposed change from weight base d tax to tax based on load capacity does not change the collection point of this manufacturers tax as such it should not affect the number of collection points t hus it is generally be lieved that it should not greatly affect the collection process assessment because it funds highway c onstruction the excise tax on truck tires is often referred to as user tax it is generally held that heavier vehicles such as trucks cause greater damage to both roadways and bridges thus the tax on heavy tires for trucks resembles pricing mechanism with the tax viewed as proxy for highway wearandtear charges while these taxes now apply only to heavy tires they still produce substantial amounts of needed ta x revenues for the highway trust fund the repeal of tire excise taxes would requi re additional taxes to be imposed on other sources in order to provide equivalent amounts of income for the highway trust fund in its current form this excise tax is easy to administer and therefore collection costs are kept to minimum for the irs several arguments have b een advanced against the continued imposition of this excise tax first excise taxes have traditionally been associated with luxury items early in this century those owning au tomobiles and thus needing tires were generally wealthy individuals in contrast in the modern economy tires play vital and necessary role in the overall transpor tation system and are longer thought of as luxuries second selective excise ta xes discriminate agai nst indus tries whose products are taxed in this case the commercial trucking i ndustry must pay this excise tax while the chief competitors of truck transportation namely the railroads and waterways have corresponding excise tax thus question of intermodal equity arises finally as noted earlier excise taxes have their greatest impact on lower income individuals and are not based on the abilitytopay principal to the extent that the excise tax on truck tires is passed forward in the cost of goods sold it places the greatest burden on lower income individuals because individuals withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30302crs7 lower incomes tend to spend larger po rtion of their income on these goods in contrast to individuals with higher incomes revenues as noted revenues collected from the federal excise tax on tires are dedicated to the highway trust fund the table appearing on the following page provides an historical review of those revenue collections early years include tax receipts collected from the excise tax on inner tube s and tread rubber as well as the tax on tires today revenues from the excise ta x on tires provide less than 2 of the highway trust fund receiptshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30302crs8 table 2 excise tax collections on tires tubes and tread rubber in nominal dollars fiscal yearcollections in thousands of dollarsfiscal yearcollections in
