proposals carol pettit legislative attorney american law division summary the 2008 farm b ill contained two taxrelated pr oposals for the conservation reserve program one of these proposals which excludes the payments from self employment tax was included in the fina l bill that became pl 110246 the other which would have allowed par ticipants in the program to choose to receive tax credit in lieu of the contracted annual payments was deleted in the conference committee background the conservation reserve pr ogram began in 1985 as program designed to remove highly erodible croplands from current crop production it was established by the food security act of 19851 and has been expanded and exte nded by subsequent legislation2 the program provides for annua l rental payments to land owners or operators who agree to enroll their qualifying land in the program enrollment requires them to remove land from production and genera lly refrain from using the land commercially they must also follow an approved conservation pla n in return they receive annual payments these payments are referred to as rent in the statute regulations and contracts however from the beginning the internal revenue service irs has treated this income as selfemployment income for those who tinued to farm other land connected to the crp land although the irs initially treated th payments as rental income for those not otherwise engaged in farming and therefore not subject to selfemployment tax thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22910crs2 3 see crs report rl34457 for more information about the irss

rate that was lower for others it could be higher expenses to offset income would lower the taxes paid other income would affect the extent to which the income was taxed at the marginal rate phaseouts of itemized deductions and exemption amounts can result in more tax being paid because more is subject to higher marginal rates 8 see eg hr 4073 hr 5169 s 665 s 1316 108th congress hr 923 hr 2347 s

and 566 of the total received if the crp payments are subject to selfemployment tax7 congressional response several bills have been introduced in recent congresses to exclude crp payments from selfemployment income8 most were referred to committee and hearings were held9 during the first session of the 110th congress two similar bills hr 2659 and s 1155 were introduced again they were referred to committee however in s 2242 the heartland habitat harves t and horticulture act of 2007 the issue was approached in different manner this approach was adopted in the senate amendments to hr 241910 the final provisions of the 2008 fa rm bill came from the conference committee rather than exempting all crp payments from selfemployment tax while still including them for income tax congress c onsidered two different approaches to crp payments each of these approaches would have provided some relie f to some taxpayers one became law the other remains possible policy option for future congresses the approach that was enacted explicitly exempts crp payments from selfemployment tax for certain taxpayers the other approach offered an optional tax credit in lieu of

those receiving regular retirement benefits from social security as well as those receiving social security disability benefits12 it is silent as to the treatment of crp payments received by all others given the current position of the irs it seems likely that this silence would result in these payments being considered selfemployment income for all others13 t h committee report for the heartland habitat rvest and horticulture act of 2007 in addressing that acts identi cal provision stated the trea tment of conservation reserve program payments received by other entities is not

than receiving the annual rental payments16 this credit would have been subject to neither income nor selfemployment tax17 those who did not elect to receive the credit would continue to receive the annual rental payments the amount of the credit would have been the same as the amount of the annual rental payment each electing participant would otherwise have received18 as proposed the credit

contract generally involves repayment of all payments received from the program since the beginning of the contract22 the proposed credit would have been treated differently it would have been recaptured only on prorated basis for the fiscal year in which the contract was terminated and the credit allowed23 analysis of the taxrelated crp proposals in the farm bill exclusion from selfemploymen t tax for certain individuals unlike earlier proposed legislation that would ve excluded all crp payments from self employment income the farm bills provision explicitly excludes only those payments received by retirees and the disabled even these would be limited to those individuals who were receiving benefits from either regular retirement24 or disability25 under the social security act26 both regular retirement benefits and disability be nefits received from social security have links to other earned income27 received in the case of regular retirement benefits received prior to reaching full retirement age the benefits are reduced by 1 for every 2 by which the recipients earned income exceeds statutory annual limit28 receipt of disability benefits from social security is predicated on disability that prevents the recipient from any work that would result in earned income29 some might argue that excluding crp payments from the definition of income subject to selfemployment tax for those receiving regular social security retirement benefits will provide r ecipients with double benefit they will not be require d to pay self employment tax on the income and the income will not reduce their social security benefits further argument might be made that those recei ving social security disability benefits will also be r eceiving double benefit they will not be required to pay self employment tax on the income and the inco probably cannot be considered evidence of an ability to engage in substantial gain ful activity in each case where income from the crp is concerned social security bene ficiaries will be exempt from funding the program under which they receive benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22910crs5 30 plr 8822064 mar 7 1988 you are retired from farming acco rdingly the payments you receive pursuant to your participation in the crp are not includible in computing net earnings from selfemployment 31 see irs notice 2006108 200551 irb 1118

been allowed as duction on the state income tax return and thus lowering net federal income tax would increase state taxable income 36 at least one other credit the foreign tax credit can also be carried forward if not allowed in full in the current yearothers may argue that excluding crp payments from selfemployment income for social security beneficiaries complies with the rationale behind the irss position in an early private letter ruling30 those who are retired are not in the trade or business of farming simply by virtue of having land enro lled in the crp it is possible however that the new provision may be broader than that early position there appears to be limitation on the exclusion from selfemployment income therefore someone who has retired and is receiving social security retirement benefits might return to being actively engaged in farming and be able to exclude the crp payments from farm income at the same time the farm bill exclusion may be narrower than the irss earlier position because those who are retired under state military or some federal retirement systems and do not receive social security benefits do not enjoy the explicit exclusion if the irs moves forward with its stated intention to treat all crp payments as selfemployment income31 all retirees who do not receive social s ecurity benefits will be required to pay selfemployment tax on their crp payments the committee reports do not explain the considerations behind the exclusion provided in the farm bill the senate re port on the identical provision in s 2242 says that the committee believes that the correct measurement of income for self employment tax purposes in the cases of re tired or disabled individuals does not include conservation reserve program payments32 the report does not discuss why the payments are specifically excluded only for retirees and the disabled or why they are specifically excluded only for those receiving benefits from social security the conference report accompanying hr 241933 does not provide information about the reasoning for including this provision in the bill34 tax credit tax credit reduces taxes dollarfo rdollar most tax credits are not refundable and current tax credit is subject to federal income ta x or selfemployment tax35 in this regard the proposed credit was different it was different than most credits however because it could be carried forward to subsequent tax year if not used in full in the current one36 those opposing the proposed credit might argue th at it is regressive in nature in that it would provide the most benef it to those whose income is highest this benefit could occur in two different ways since the cred it would not be subject to either income orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22910crs6 37 if the crp payments are subject to income ta x someone whose marginal tax rate is 35 would only net 65 of the crp payments after federal income tax but before either selfemployment or state income taxes on the other hand an individual whose marginal rate is 10 would net 90 of the crp payments after federal income tax the first persons benefit from non taxability would be 35 of the crp payments whereas the seconds benefit would be only 10 38 taxpayers crp tax credit could be as high as 50000 hr 2419 eas 12201 adding 26 usc 30dc2b 39 this assumes that the crp annual payment woul d be subject to both federal income and self employment taxes but not state taxes 40 srept 110206 at 8 41 see crs report rs21613 conservation reserve program status and current issues 42 id see also otto doering overview

programpdfselfemployment taxes those in the higher tax brackets would receive greater tax benefit from nontaxability than would those in lower tax brackets37 additionally those with higher income would likely have tax liab ilities that equal or exceed the credit amount38 because of the time value of money those ab to fully use the credit would receive greater value than those who must carry part of the credit forward those in favor of the credit might point out that one would be forced to take the credit and one would be prevented from doi ng so this would allow all parties to examine their own situations and determine whether the credit is more beneficial to them than is the direct annual payment arguab ly even those who could not use the credit in full in the first year might still derive more net benefit from the credit than they would from the direct payment since they would have to pay income tax on that direct payment and in many cases would also have to pay lfemployment tax thus even those in the 10 marginal tax bracket could realize greater benefit from the credit than direct payment if they were able to use at least 75 of the credit in the initial year39 other arguments in favor of the credit might come from those who believe that the irss treatment of crp payments as selfemployment income is wrong or has been expanded too far they might argue that the credit provides an incentive needed to encourage enrollment in the crp the committee report indicated that the reason for this provision was to provide add itional incentives to encourage eligible producers to establish longterm resource conser ving covers on ligible farmland40 on the other hand the effect on the credit if contract is terminated early is rather mild when compared to the total repayment requirement for regular crp payments so it is arguable that the credit might encourage people to enroll but might not encourage them to remain enrolled long term some may argue that there is need for further incentives since there has been competitive bidding process under which appli cants have tried to assure acceptance of their bids by offering their land in return for annual payments below the allowed rental values41 however rising commodity prices may reduce interest in participating in the crp42
