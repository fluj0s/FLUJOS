and appropriations for fy2005 updated december 20 2004 david m bearden analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appropriations for fy2005 summary the department of defense dod administers five environmental programs environmental cleanup compliance pollution prevention environmental technology and conservation the department of energy doe manages defense nuclear waste and cleans up contaminated nuclear weapons sites in the second session of the 108th congress the most controversial issues regarding these activities were whether to provide further exemptions for military readiness activities from certain air quality and hazardous waste cleanup requirements and whether to provide doe with the authority to classify certain radioactive tank wastes at nuclear weapons sites in idaho south carolina and washington in manner that would permit these wastes to be permanently disposed of onsite in those states the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 hr 4200 authorizes 135 billion for cleanup at active military installations and formerly used defense sites fuds 40 million more than requested the increase is for cleanup at fuds sites the law authorizes the administrations request of 246 million in new funds for environmental cleanup at base closure sites total funding for cleanup at these sites would be 322 million including the use of unobligated balances and proceeds from land sales and leases from base closures funding for dods other environmental activities is authorized under several larger accounts the law also authorizes 696 billion for does cleanup of nuclear weapons sites slightly more than requested and provides targeted authority for permanent onsite disposal of radioactive tank wastes in idaho and south carolina the law does not include the environmental exemptions from air quality and hazardous waste cleanup requirements that dod requested in addition to defense authorization legislation the 108th congress completed action on the two fy2005 appropriations bills that fund cleanup and other environmental activities administered by dod the department of defense appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108287 hr 4613 provides 136 billion for cleanup at active military installations and fuds sites 10 million more than authorized and 50 million more than requested the increase is devoted to cleanup at fuds sites as in authorization legislation funding for dods other environmental activities is not specified but is provided under several larger accounts the military construction appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108324 hr 4837 provides 246 million in new funds for cleanup at base closure sites the same as authorized and requested action was also completed on fy2005 appropriations for does cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 hr 4818 provides 703 billion for this activity subject to an acrosstheboard rescission of 08 an increase relative to fy2004 and the administrations request of this amount 292 million is allocated to the disposal of radioactive tank wastes this report will be updated to reflect dod allocations of fy2005 funding for environmental activities for

programs authorization and appropriations for fy2005 introduction in response to requirements under federal environmental laws the department of defense dod administers five programs to address cleanup and other environmental needs on over 30 million acres of land located on active military installations and on former military properties in addition to dods environmental programs the department of energy doe is responsible for managing defense nuclear waste and cleaning up contamination at former nuclear weapons sites see figure 1 for history of funding for these activities the environmental protection agency epa and the states are responsible for providing oversight and enforcing applicable laws and regulations congress authorizes defenserelated environmental programs in the annual authorization bill for national defense but it funds these programs under three appropriations bills environmental cleanup at active and former military installations environmental compliance pollution prevention environmental technology and conservation primarily receive funding in the annual appropriations bill for the department of defense environmental cleanup at bases that have been designated for closure since 1988 is funded in the annual appropriations bill for military construction does management of defense nuclear waste and cleanup of contamination at former nuclear weapons sites is funded in the annual appropriations bill for energy and water development the second session of the 108th congress completed action on defense authorization legislation for fy2005 the two fy2005 appropriations bills that fund dod and an fy2005 consolidated appropriations bill that includes funding for does cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites among the prominent issues in the debate of authorization legislation and appropriations for fy2005 were 1 the adequacy cost and pace of environmental cleanup 2 whether additional environmental exemptions are needed to preserve military training capabilities and 3 whether to provide doe with the authority to classify radioactive tank wastes in idaho south carolina and washington in manner that would permit these wastes to be permanently disposed of onsite in those states rather than in centralized geologic repository such as yucca mountain in nevada this report provides background information on each

include lineitem accounts for few environmental activities other than cleanup they do specify the total amount of funding for all of dods other environmental programs including environmental compliance conservation pollution prevention and environmental technology dod will allocate funding for these activities from the operation and maintenance procurement and research and development accounts this table will be updated to indicate final fy2005 funding levels when these allocations are announced in dods operation and maintenance overview for fy2006 crs3 environmental activities on military lands dod administers five environmental programs to comply with federal environmental laws on lands within its jurisdiction in terms of funding the two largest programs focus on cleaning up past contamination and on complying with pollution control laws and regulations that apply to daytoday operations at military installations three other programs have smaller budgets they focus on pollution prevention environmental technology and conservation of natural and cultural resources1 while there are lineitem accounts in defense authorization legislation and appropriations bills for environmental cleanup there are lineitem accounts for dods other environmental activities instead they are funded out of appropriations for the following accounts operation and maintenance procurement military construction and research and development dod allocates funding out of these accounts based on the availability of annual appropriations and the competing needs of national security activities dod proposed total of 382 billion in funding for all of the above environmental activities for fy2005 17 million more overall than the amount of 380 billion in fy2004 among the individual programs dod proposed an increase in funding for compliance conservation and pollution prevention and decrease for cleanup and environmental technology background information on each of these programs key funding issues and the administrations fy2005 request are discussed below relevant provisions in defense authorization legislation and appropriations for fy2005 are discussed later in this report environmental cleanup dod administers defense environmental restoration program to investigate and clean up hazardous waste sites at active and closed military installations and other former military properties located in the united states this program is divided into two subcomponents the military munitions response program addresses the removal of unexploded ordnance uxo and other munitions on former training ranges and the cleanup of munitionsrelated contamination the installation restoration program addresses the cleanup of non munitions contamination at all other areas on military sites epa and the states are responsible for overseeing the cleanup of these lands to ensure that dod complies with applicable requirements2 the defense environmental restoration program does not address cleanup at overseas military installations rather the commanding 1 for additional information on each program refer to the defense environmental network and information exchange denix website at httpwwwdenixosdmil 2 dod is subject to the requirements of two federal statutes in conducting its cleanup activities the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra cercla addresses the release or threatened release of hazardous substances in the united states and requires contamination to be cleaned up to level that is protective of human health and the environment 42 usc 9601 et seq rcra specifies requirements for storing and disposing of solid and hazardous waste and requires corrective action to clean up environmental contamination that occurs as result of storage and disposal practices 42 usc 6901 et seq with authorities provided by these statutes dod is also subject to state cleanup requirements crs4 officer of each overseas installation is responsible for administering the cleanup of contamination on these properties in accordance with applicable requirements of the host nation3 active installations and former military properties funding for cleanup at active and former military installations is authorized under five defense environmental restoration accounts in the annual authorization bill for national defense and is appropriated to these accounts in the annual appropriations bill for the department of defense three of these accounts reserve funding for the army navy and air force one devotes funding to more general category of defense wide sites and another is dedicated to cleaning up formerly used defense sites fuds4 for the past several years annual appropriations for these five accounts combined has been around 130 billion fluctuating somewhat from year to year for fy2005 the administration requested 131 billion for the above accounts 34 million less overall than the fy2004 appropriation of 134 billion among the individual accounts cleanup funding for army navy and air force sites would increase by varying amounts whereas the fuds account would decrease by nearly 68 million the adequacy of funding for cleanup at fuds sites has been contentious issue as some of these properties are now being used for civilian purposes that may present pathway of human exposure to contamination some fuds sites also were the location of former training ranges where unexploded ordnance and other munitions hazards may be present as of the end of fy2003 dod estimated that 2990 billion would be needed to complete cleanup at active military installations and fuds sites5 of this amount 1630 billion would be for the removal of unexploded ordnance and cleanup of munitionsrelated contamination dod has not completed its investigation of former training ranges under the military munitions response program estimates of cleanup funding needs may increase in future years as the extent of safety hazards and munitionrelated contamination is determined and additional sites with unexploded ordnance are identified military base closures cleanup at base closure sites is authorized separately under the base realignment and closure brac account in the annual authorization bill for national defense base closure sites are separate from fuds sites which were decommissioned prior to 1988 appropriations for base closure activities including cleanup are provided under the brac account in the annual appropriations bill for military construction congress authorized four rounds of 3 the cleanup of contamination at overseas military installations is subject to requirements specified in the status of forces agreement with each host nation these requirements are generally not as strict as cercla and rcra and their stringency varies widely from country to country 4 fuds sites are properties that dod owned or leased in the past and are now devoted to civilian uses many of the fuds sites were used during world war ii and prior years 5 department of defense defense environmental restoration program annual report to congress for fy2003 april 2004 appendix b p b61 p b101 and appendix c p c61 p c91 crs5 base closures in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 and established separate brac account for each round these accounts have now been consolidated into one account the closure and realignment of military bases designated under these four rounds was complete in fy2001 since that time brac funds have only been used to pay environmental cleanup expenses in addition to appropriations to the brac accounts proceeds from the sale or lease of property on closed bases support cleanup of contamination on these lands total cleanup funding for base closure sites has declined in recent years from 830 million in fy1998 to 344 million in fy2004 although funding has declined over the past several years dod continues to estimate substantial funding needs for cleanup as of the end of fy2003 dod estimated that 332 billion in additional funding would be necessary to complete all planned cleanup actions at base closure sites6 funding needs for cleanup at base closure sites may rise in future years if additional military bases are selected for closure the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 authorized new round of base closings in 20057 the expense of closing and realigning additional bases and the costs of cleaning up these bases for other land uses would cause funding needs for the brac account to rise the amount of funding that would be necessary to clean up additional base closure sites would depend on the type and extent of contamination and the actions that would be necessary to protect human health and the environment the degree of cleanup that is required depends on the intended land use of the property after it is transferred cleanup at active military installations is typically based on industrial land use which allows the least stringent cleanup standards to be applied the cleanup required at such installations could become more stringent if they were closed and transferred for other land uses that would present higher possibility of human exposure to contamination such as residential development the adequacy of funding to meet cleanup needs at base closure sites has been contentious issue due to potential risks to human health and the environment and the publics desire to redevelop these properties for civilian uses the completion of cleanup is key to redevelopment because the land cannot be used for its intended purpose until it is cleaned up to the extent that it would be safe for that purpose in march 2004 the general accounting office gao now renamed the government accountability office reported that 44 of the land on closed military bases had not been transferred for redevelopment as of the end of fy2003 gao stated that environmental cleanup has long been key factor in slowing the transfer process8 the administration proposed to continue the downward trend in cleanup funding for base closure sites in fy2005 the presidents fy2005 budget included 6 ibid appendix b p b101 and appendix c p c91 7 for further information see crs report rs21822 military base closures dods 2005 internal selection process by daniel else and david lockwood 8 general accounting office military base closures observations on preparations for the upcoming base realignment and closure round gao04558t march 25 2004 pp 9 10 crs6 246 million for the brac account this amount is 124 million less than the fy2004 appropriation of 370 million dod proposed to allocate 322 million for cleanup at base closure sites in fy2005 using the funds that it has requested for the brac account along with unobligated funds from prior year appropriations and proceeds from the sale and lease of base closure properties this funding level is 22 million less than dods allocation of 344 million for fy2004 environmental compliance in general dod and all other federal agencies are required to comply with federal laws and regulations to control pollution to the same extent as any other entity however numerous federal pollution control statutes include exemptions for purposes of national security or for activities that are in the paramount interest of the united states9 epa and the states are authorized to take enforcement action against dod including the assessment of fines and penalties if the department does not comply with applicable requirements for which an exemption has not been granted the granting of such exemptions has been extremely rare resulting in dod being subject to pollution control requirements for most all of its routine operations10 the federal pollution control statutes that most commonly apply to routine military operations include the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act rcra and safe drinking water act common types of environmental compliance projects at military installations include 1 storing and disposing of solid and hazardous waste 2 replacing and upgrading wastewater treatment plants 3 monitoring the effectiveness of wastewater treatment systems and 4 testing and replacing underground storage tanks dod did not begin to track the amount of funding spent on environmental compliance activities until fy1990 dod allocates funding for compliance from several accounts including operation and maintenance military construction and procurement dods budget for environmental compliance peaked at 223 billion in fy1996 and there has been an overall downward trend in compliance costs since that time dod attributes this decline to the success of its pollution prevention efforts to reduce the generation of waste lessening the need for treatment and disposal and other compliance actions however dod estimates that it will need to 9 the authority for exemptions from pollution control requirements for federal facilities are included in the clean air act 42 usc 7418b clean water act 33 usc 1323a resource conservation and recovery act 42 usc 6961a and safe drinking water act 42 usc 300j6 exemption authority is also provided in the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act 42 usc 9620j endangered species act 16 usc 1536j marine mammal protection act 16 usc 1371f and noise control act 42 usc 4903 for additional information see crs report rs21217 exemptions for military activities in federal environmental laws by robert meltz 10 for example presidential exemption from solid and hazardous waste requirements under rcra has been granted on an annual basis for the air forces groom lake facility in nevada president bush granted the most recent exemption for this facility in september 2003 68 federal register 60277 the exemption was scheduled to expire in september 2004 based on past precedent it likely will continue to be renewed on annual basis as long as classified activities continue at this facility groom lake is the only military installation in the united states that receives an annual exemption from an environmental requirement crs7 allocate more funding for compliance in fy2005 to meet wastewater and underground storage tank requirements and various requirements applicable to navy training ranges as well as the need for greater funding to pay increased manpower costs for fy2005 dod estimated that it will need to allocate total of 167 billion to comply with applicable pollution control requirements at its installations 104 million more than in fy200411 pollution prevention the purpose of the pollution prevention program is to reduce or eliminate waste and pollution as means to lower the costs of environmental compliance and to prevent future cleanup liabilities as noted above dod attributes the overall downward trend in environmental compliance costs to the success of its pollution prevention efforts this program seeks to reduce 1 the use of hazardous materials 2 the production of solid waste and 3 the release of toxic substances air emissions and water pollution through this program dod also funds the implementation of executive orders on waste prevention recycling and procurement of environmentally preferable products the pollution prevention budget has ranged from 340 million in fy1994 to 165 million in fy2004 dod allocates funding for this program from the accounts for operation and maintenance military construction and procurement for fy2005 dod planned to allocate 171 million nearly 6 million more than in fy200412 the increase would support navy programs to reduce water pollution from vessels environmental technology the environmental technology program supports the research and development of more efficient and less costly methods to manage solid and hazardous waste these efforts are aimed at helping dod to comply more easily with pollution control laws and regulations the program also supports the research and development of more effective and less costly methods to clean up contamination in soil surface water and groundwater integral to the cleanup of former training ranges the program supports the research and development of advanced technologies to detect unexploded ordnance some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities have advocated higher funding for the development of detection technologies that would help to improve the accuracy and pace of identifying safety hazards for removal the environmental technology budget has ranged from 430 million in fy1993 to around 210 million in fy1997 and fy1998 dod allocates funding for environmental technology out of its research development test and evaluation accounts dod planned to allocate 186 million for fy2005 64 million less than in fy200413 the proposed decrease was due to the completion of several projects administered by the army to research new cleanup and pollution prevention technologies conservation the conservation program aims to protect the natural historical and cultural resources of over 30 million acres of public land that dod administers activities funded under this program are necessary to comply with 11 department of defense operation and maintenance overview fy2005 budget estimates february 2004 p 112 12 ibid 13 ibid p 113 crs8 federal laws that protect such resources including the endangered species act and the national historic preservation act the conservation budget has ranged from 180 million in fy2001 to 90 million in fy1997 dod allocates funding for conservation from the accounts for operation and maintenance military construction and procurement dod estimated that it will need to allocate 169 million in fy2005 to comply with resource protection requirements and to support related activities nearly 28 million more than in fy200414 the increase in funding would be for the purchase of conservation easements on lands adjacent to military installations these lands would serve as buffers to ease the burden of habitat management on military installations as means of preventing encroachment on lands needed for training congress provided the authority for this practice in the national defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107314 for further discussion see crs report rl31456 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appropriations for fy2003 by david m bearden military readiness issues prominent issue has been the extent to which requirements to clean up contamination control pollution and protect natural resources restrict the use of military lands for training central to this issue is whether environmental exemption authority should be expanded to preserve training capabilities congress included exemptions in several statutes to ensure that military training needs would not be restricted to the extent that national security would be compromised these exemptions provide the president with the authority to suspend compliance requirements for actions at federal facilities on casebycase basis such exemptions may be granted if doing so would be either in the paramount interest of the united states or in the interest of national security most of these exemptions are limited to one year but can be renewed15 dod argues that existing exemptions are too onerous and timeconsuming to obtain on casebycase basis due to the vast number of training exercises that it conducts on hundreds of military installations across the country dod also argues that the time limitations placed upon most exemptions are not compatible with many training activities due to their ongoing or recurring nature instead dod favors modifications to numerous environmental statutes that would provide greater flexibility for conducting combat training and other readiness activities without restriction or delay however some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities have opposed such modifications pointing to the lack of data to demonstrate the extent to which environmental requirements have restricted training exercises and compromised readiness overall they argue that expanding exemption authority without justification for its need would unnecessarily weaken environmental protection 14 ibid 15 the safe drinking water act does not impose time limit on exemptions from compliance under the endangered species act special committee shall grant an exemption if the secretary of defense finds it necessary for national security this committee may place time limit on an exemption but it is not required to do so crs9 the cumulative effect of environmental requirements on military readiness capabilities is difficult to determine due to the lack of system to comprehensively track individual cases in which training has been restricted or compromised in 2002 gao found that dods readiness reports do not indicate the extent to which environmental requirements restrict combat training activities and that such reports indicate high level of readiness overall16 however gao noted individual instances of environmental restrictions at numerous military installations and in light of this fact recommended that dods reporting system be improved to more accurately identify problems for training that might be attributed to restrictions imposed by environmental requirements more recent gao report found that environmental restrictions are only one of several factors including urban growth that affect dods ability to carry out training activities and that dod continues to be unable to measure the impact of encroachment on readiness17 congressional action on environmental exemptions as part of its defense authorization proposals for fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 dod submitted readiness and range preservation initiative rrpi to congress requesting targeted exemptions for military readiness activities18 dod proposed this initiative in response to its stated concern that environmental requirements have increasingly imposed restrictions on combat training exercises key component of military readiness the initiative originally proposed targeted exemptions for military readiness activities from certain requirements under six environmental laws clean air act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla endangered species act marine mammal protection act migratory bird treaty act and resource conservation and recovery act rcra thus far congress has provided modified versions of dods proposed exemptions from wildlife protection requirements under three of the above statutes these exemptions were contentious and there was considerable debate prior to their enactment the national defense authorization act for fy2003 provided broad exemption for military readiness activities from the migratory bird treaty act19 see crs report rl31456 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appropriations for fy2003 the national defense authorization act for fy2004 provided an exemption from the designation of critical habitat under the endangered species act on military lands if certain conditions are met20 other provisions of that act provided broad exemption from the marine mammal 16 general accounting office military training dod needs comprehensive plan to manage encroachment on training ranges gao02727t may 2002 17 general accounting office military training dod approach to managing encroachment on training ranges still evolving gao03621t april 2003 18 dods legislative proposal for fy2005 and its justification are available at dods website at httpswwwdenixosdmildenixpubliclibrarysustainrrpirrpihtml 19 pl 107314 section 315 20 pl 108136 section 318 crs10 protection act for national defense21 the act also modified the definition of harassment of marine mammals as it applies to military readiness activities and required the consideration of impacts on military readiness in the issuance of permits for incidental takings see crs report rl32183 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and appropriations for fy2004 in defense authorization legislation and appropriations for fy2003 and fy2004 congress did not provide the exemptions from the clean air act rcra and cercla which dod had requested none of the defense authorization and appropriations bills for fy2005 include exemptions from these three statutes either as discussed later in this report while the exemptions that congress has granted were contentious to those concerned about the weakening of wildlife protections there has been broader opposition to exemptions from the clean air act rcra and cercla due to concern about risks to human health from the potential exposure to air pollution and hazardous substances as proposed by dod the clean air act language would have exempted emissions generated by military readiness activities from requirements to conform to state implementation plans sips for achieving federal air quality standards under current law activities of federal agencies which would increase emissions beyond limitations established in states sip are prohibited unless offsetting reductions from other sources are made dod argued that this exemption would provide greater flexibility for transferring training operations to areas with poor air quality without the possibility of restrictions on these operations due to the emissions that they would produce dod stated that the impact on air quality would be minimal claiming that its emission are relatively minor compared to other sources states environmental organizations and public health advocates argued that the impacts on air quality could be greater and present risk to human health especially if localized hot spots of pollution were to develop in communities adjacent to military installations where emissions were not controlled dods proposed exemptions from rcra and cercla would have defined solid waste and release in federal statute as not including military munitions on operational ranges whether environmental cleanup requirements under these two statutes apply depends on whether substance is solid waste or whether there has been release of hazardous substance in effect the proposed exemption would have allowed munitions and munitionsrelated contamination to remain on training range indefinitely as long as the range remained operational dod stated that this exemption would codify existing federal regulations under the military munitions rule and argued that it would not present greater risks to human health and the environment some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities countered that the proposed language was broader than current regulation and that the definition of operational range would allow dod to designate practically any lands on military installation as such thereby exempting munitions and related contamination from environmental cleanup 21 pl 108136 section 319 crs11 the above and other issues were addressed in hearing held jointly by the subcommittee on energy and air quality and the subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials of the house energy and commerce committee on april 21 2004 some members stated their support for greater environmental compliance flexibility for military readiness purposes other members highlighted the lack of data to determine the extent to which such flexibility was needed and expressed concern that the impacts of the proposed exemptions on human health and the environment would be greater than dod had characterized issues were also raised in association with this hearing as to whether the house energy and commerce committee or the house armed services committee had jurisdiction over dods proposal subsequent to the contentious hearing debate exemptions from the clean air act rcra or cercla were not included in fy2005 defense authorization legislation and appropriations bills cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites at the end of the cold war in the late 1980s the united states ceased its production of nuclear weapons however radioactive and other hazardous wastes generated from the production of nuclear weapons continue to pose risk to human health and the environment since the beginning of the us atomic energy program the department of energy doe and its predecessor agencies have been responsible for managing the production of nuclear weapons and related waste in later years doe expanded its efforts to include the environmental restoration of radioactive sites and those with other hazardous contamination in 1989 the bush administration established an environmental management program within doe to consolidate the departments efforts to clean up contamination from defense nuclear waste as well as waste from civilian nuclear energy research22 applicable requirements in carrying out the environmental management program doe is subject to requirements of the atomic energy act of 1954 cercla and rcra doe is not subject to external agency oversight of its compliance with the atomic energy act however epa and the states play significant oversight role in does compliance with cercla and rcra doe has signed numerous legally binding compliance agreements with epa and the states to perform cleanup activities and dispose of wastes according to specific deadlines which would fulfill the requirements of these two latter statutes cleanup status and costs much attention has focused on the amount of time and money needed to treat manage and dispose of defense nuclear waste and to clean up related contamination the waste management and cleanup challenges are substantial doe reports that there are 114 large sites in 31 states and one us territory where the production of nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy research and development activities resulted in radioactive and other hazardous contamination together these sites occupy approximately 2 million acres which is equivalent to the land area of rhode island and delaware combined 22 for additional information on the environmental management program refer to does website at httpwwwemdoegov crs12 according to doe all response actions were complete at 76 of these sites as of the end of fy2003 at cost of approximately 70 billion however most of the sites that have been cleaned up thus far are relatively small and are among the least hazardous the sites where cleanup remains underway contain some of the most severely contaminated areas doe estimates that cleanup at the remaining sites will not be complete until 2035 at cost of 142 billion the greatest outstanding cleanup liabilities are at defense sites that were involved in the production of nuclear weapons appropriations accounts two appropriations accounts fund cleanup at defense nuclear waste sites the defense site acceleration completion account provides funding for activities that are directly involved in the cleanup of contaminated sites and the acceleration of site completion the defense environmental services account funds activities that indirectly support the mission of accelerated cleanup and closure such as policy development and coordination and the integration of mission activities across the complex of sites congress authorizes funding for these accounts in the annual authorization bill for national defense and appropriates funding for these activities in the annual appropriations bill for energy and water development administrations cleanup reform initiative at the administrations request congress established these two accounts in fy2004 to focus funding on does cleanup reform initiative to lower costs and speed the pace of cleanup23 doe launched its cleanup reform initiative in fy2003 while there has been broad support for accelerating cleanup and reducing costs questions have been raised as to how these goals could be achieved without weakening environmental protection does initiative is based on assessing the risk of exposure to determine which cleanup remedies are selected risk is currently one of many factors that doe uses to select cleanup remedies altering the current process to use risk as the primary factor could result in decisions to contain waste on site as means of preventing exposure rather than removing it while containment can often be accomplished more quickly and at less cost the possibility of future exposure remains if the method of containment fails over time some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities have expressed concern about this approach doe proposed to continue its cleanup reforms in fy2005 and requested total of 695 billion for the two above accounts of this amount 597 billion would have been allocated to the defense site acceleration completion account and 982 million would have been allocated to the defense environmental services account the total request for both accounts was approximately 350 million more than the fy2004 appropriation of 660 billion 23 congress previously authorized and appropriated funding for the cleanup of defense nuclear wastes sites under three accounts defense environmental restoration and waste management account defense facilities closure projects account and defense environmental management privatization account prior to these accounts congress set aside funding for cleanup of these sites under the atomic energy defense activities account which was centralized account that funded multiple purposes crs13 highlevel waste proposal as part of the administrations cleanup reform initiative the requested 350 million increase was for highlevel waste proposal to speed the closure of tanks storing highlevel radioactive and other chemical wastes at the hanford site in washington the savannah river site in south carolina and at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory ineel the volume of these wastes is substantial for example doe reports that at the hanford site there are over 50 million gallons of highlevel radioactive and chemical wastes stored beneath the surface in 177 tanks the tank wastes at hanford and the other two sites that are classified as highlevel radioactive wastes must be removed and safely stored in centralized geologic repository as required by the nuclear waste policy act nwpa for more information see crs report rl32163 radioactive waste streams an overview of waste classification for disposal by anthony andrews doe has proposed to speed the closure of the tanks at these three sites by classifying some of the waste as incidental to reprocessing and to dispose of it as lowlevel waste by mixing and immobilizing it with cement grout inside the tank doe issued this proposal under an internal agency order order 435124 some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities opposed does proposal arguing that none of the tank wastes should be allowed to remain in place because of the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughly with the waste to contain it safely and prevent leaks however others asserted that methods to remove all of the tank residues would generate new hazardous waste stream that would need to be managed properly to prevent exposure there also could be significant risks of exposure to workers who would remove the residues thus far doe has grouted highlevel radioactive wastes in two tanks at the savannah river site the natural resources defense council nrdc legally challenged does authority to dispose of these wastes in this manner in 2003 the us district court for idaho ruled that doe does not have the authority to classify the tank wastes at the savannah river site or any other site as anything other than highlevel radioactive waste25 consequently these wastes would have to be removed and disposed of in centralized geologic repository as required by the nwpa doe appealed the 2003 ruling and on november 5 2004 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the above district court opinion ruling that the challenge to order 4351 was not ripe for review26 the court found that the district court decision predated doe application of order 4351 to particular situation and thus there was present conflict with the nwpa27 the court determined that while it was possible that doe might violate the nwpa at some 24 department of energy doe order 4351 radioactive waste management 25 nrdc v abraham 271 f supp 2d 1260 d id 2003 26 natural resources defense council v abraham 0335711 2004 wl 2480949 nov 5 2004 27 natural resources defense council slip op at 3 crs14 point it might just as likely comply with all applicable law28 thus under the terms of the circuit court opinion doe may engage in activities pursuant to order 4351 and nrdc or others then would be free to bring suit if they believe those activities violate the law prior to the appeals court ruling the secretary of energy asked congress to enact legislation that would provide doe with statutory authority to classify some of the tank wastes as incidental to reprocessing at hanford savannah river and the ineel thereby exempting them from disposal requirements for highlevel radioactive waste in the nwpa whether the wastes could be left in the tanks and grouted in place would ultimately depend on the concurrence of state regulatory agencies who issue the permits for tank closures congress included authority in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 for doe to grout some of the tank wastes at savannah river and the ineel discussed later in this report however the authority was not extended to hanford where most of the leaking tanks are located as noted above doe still may pursue the grouting of tanks at hanford under order 4351 but could be subject to legal challenge at that site cleanup of other radioactive contamination in addition to former nuclear weapons production sites smaller sites were contaminated with lowlevel radiation from the processing and storage of uranium and thorium ores during the early years of the us nuclear weapons program the majority of these sites were owned and operated by private contractors from the 1940s to the 1960s cleanup at these sites is performed under the formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap currently administered by the army corps of engineers does predecessor agency the atomic energy commission established this program in 1974 under authorities provided in the atomic energy act in response to concerns about the pace and cost of cleanup under does management congress included provisions in the energy and water development appropriations act for fy1998 pl 10562 to transfer the fusrap program to the army corps of engineers the corps reports that total of 49 sites with radioactive contamination have been identified since 1974 and that cleanup is complete at 28 of these sites as of april 2004 the corps reported that cleanup was ongoing or planned at the remaining 21 sites29 prior to fy1998 cleanup at these sites was funded out of available funds allocated to does former defense environmental restoration and waste management account and to the prior atomic energy defense activities account since the creation of dedicated account for fusrap and transfer of the program to the corps congress has provided approximately 140 million in annual funding the administration requested this amount again for fy2005 28 id at 4 29 us army corps of engineers formerly utilized sites remedial action program update april 2004 p 3 for further

conference agreement on the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 hr 4200 hrept 108 767 on october 9 2004 the president signed the bill into law pl 108375 on october 28 2004 the law authorizes funding for national defense programs including defenserelated environmental activities administered by dod and doe as in past years the law specifies funding for environmental cleanup on current and former military lands and at former nuclear weapons sites it does not specify funding for dods other environmental activities including environmental compliance conservation pollution prevention and environmental technology funding for these activities is authorized as part of the accounts for operation and maintenance military construction procurement and research and development the law also includes provisions that address various environmental issues related to defense activities among the most controversial are provisions that in effect amend the nuclear waste policy act to provide targeted authority in south carolina and idaho for doe to classify certain radioactive wastes in manner that would allow these wastes to be permanently disposed of onsite neither the law nor the original house and senate bills included environmental exemptions from the clean air act cercla or rcra which dod requested funding authorized by the law for environmental cleanup and selected provisions relevant to cleanup are discussed below for discussion of the law as whole see crs report rl32305 authorization and appropriations for fy2005 defense by stephen daggett and amy belasco cleanup of current and former military lands the law authorizes total of 135 billion in fy2005 for the five defense environmental restoration accounts that fund the cleanup of past contamination at active military installations and at formerly used defense sites fuds that are now being used for civilian purposes the authorization is 40 million more than the administrations request of 131 billion the increase is devoted to cleanup at fuds sites for which 257 million is authorized out of the total 135 billion however the fy2005 authorization for fuds sites is 28 million less than the fy2004 appropriation of 285 million the law authorizes an additional 246 million for the base realignment and closure account brac the same as requested as discussed earlier dod had proposed total of 322 million for cleanup at base closure sites in fy2005 using funds from the brac account unobligated funds from prior year appropriations and proceeds from the sale and lease of base closure properties the law also addresses the cleanup of groundwater contamination which is common at many military installations groundwater contamination often requires more time and money to remediate than soil or surface water contamination especially if the groundwater must be pumped and treated the law requires gao to conduct study of alternative technologies for the cleanup of groundwater contamination and to submit the study to congress by april 1 2005 the senate bill had included similar provision in conducting the study gao is to identify current technologies used or field tested by dod to remediate groundwater contamination crs16 potential costeffective technologies that could be used by dod which are being researched or are under development by commercial vendors or are already commercially available but not being used on military lands and potential barriers to the application of these technologies from the standpoint of cost capability or legal restrictions on their use the law also directs gao to conduct separate sitespecific study of drinking water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina and of the effects of this contamination on human health related to groundwater contamination the law includes sense of congress provision that addresses the cleanup of perchlorate substance commonly used in munitions propellants this substance has been found in groundwater at numerous military installations across the country and has been detected in many public water supplies and private drinking water wells30 consequently there has been significant public concern about the potential risks of perchlorate to human health there currently is not an enforceable federal or state drinking water standard for this substance that could be applied to cleaning it up the national academy of sciences nas is studying the health effects of perchlorate to assist epa in developing federal drinking water standard the state of california is in the process of developing standard as well and is awaiting the results of the nas study in the absence of generally applicable cleanup standard epa has applied state public health goals to the cleanup of perchlorate at certain sites31 for further discussion of perchlorate see crs report rs21961 perchlorate contamination of drinking water regulatory issues and legislative actions by mary tiemann the sense of congress provision in the law states that dod should develop plan to remediate perchlorate contamination to ensure that the department can respond quickly and appropriately once drinking water standard is established it also states that dod should continue remediation that is underway in the absence of drinking water standard develop plan for remediation at sites where perchlorate is present in groundwater or surface water at levels that the secretary of defense determines pose hazard to human health and continue evaluating and prioritizing sites for cleanup without waiting for the establishment of federal standard the senate bill included similar provision but did not identify who would determine whether contamination levels pose hazard to human health for the purposes of developing an interim plan for remediation until drinking water 30 for list of military installations in the united states where perchlorate contamination has been found in groundwater refer to epas website at httpwwwepagovfedfacpdfreleases_04_29_04withdatesdbpdf 31 for list of examples refer to epas website at httpwwwepagovfedfacdocumentsperchlorate_site_summarieshtm crs17 standard is established the senate bill also had specified that the plan to be developed to remediate perchlorate once drinking water standard is established was to be national in scope whereas the final bill does not indicate the scope sense of the house senate or congress expresses the opinion of that respective chamber on the matter at hand and is not legally binding32 consequently dod is not required to comply with the direction provided in the sense of congress provision in the law whether dod could take the above actions would depend on various factors including the availability of appropriations cleanup provision relevant to base closure sites was not adopted in the conference agreement on hr 4200 the senate bill would have authorized dod to reimburse private owners of former military property for cleanup actions taken after the transfer of the land cercla generally requires dod to clean up contamination on base closure sites prior to transfer of the land and dod is retroactively liable for any cleanup actions that are needed after the transfer to remediate contamination that was not originally addressed33 the pace at which dod performs posttransfer cleanup on former military properties has been an issue among private owners of these lands who must wait for the completion of the cleanup before the property can be used for its intended purpose the authority that would have been provided in the senate bill would have allowed dod to reimburse private owners who wish to pay for the cleanup themselves in order to speed the pace of remediation cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites the law authorizes 696 billion for the two accounts that fund does cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites slightly more than the administrations request of 695 billion of the authorization for fy2005 597 billion is allocated to the defense site acceleration completion account and 986 million is allocated to the defense environmental services account the total authorization is 354 million more than the fy2004 appropriation of 660 billion most of the increase 286 million is authorized for activities to prepare for the permanent onsite disposal of certain radioactive wastes that are stored in underground tanks in the states of idaho and south carolina wastes left in these tanks would be sealed in place with cement grout subject to state approval monitoring by the nuclear regulator commission and subsequent appropriations by congress discussion of appropriations for fy2005 is provided later in this report wastes removed from the tanks that are classified as highlevel radioactive wastes would be treated and stored for future disposal in centralized geologic repository such as yucca mountain in nevada as required by the nuclear waste policy act pl 108375 does not provide the authority to grout tank wastes in washington state as the administration had proposed 32 for further discussion of this type of provision see crs report 98825 sense of resolutions and provisions by paul s rundquist 33 42 usc 9620h crs18 as discussed earlier the administrations request for the legal authority to leave some of the radioactive wastes in the tanks and seal them in place has been controversial the administration and some members of congress argue that providing authority for the grouting of radioactive tank wastes would save costs and speed the closure of the tanks while sufficiently protecting the environment by immobilizing the waste to prevent it from seeping into soil or groundwater other members states and environmental organizations have expressed concerns about longterm risks to the human health and the environment if the tank grouting did not mix thoroughly with the waste to contain it safely and prevent leaks concerns about environmental risks have been strongest in the state of washington as over onethird of the underground storage tanks are known or suspected to have leaked radioactive wastes into groundwater at the hanford site which is located adjacent to the columbia river as noted above the tank waste disposal authority provided in pl 108375 excludes the state of washington and hanford in response to concerns about longterm environmental risks pl 108375 also directs doe to arrange for the national academy of sciences nas to study the radioactive and other hazardous characteristics of wastes stored in underground tanks in washington idaho and south carolina does current plans to dispose of and monitor these wastes and alternatives for disposal the nas is required to submit final report to congress and doe on the findings and recommendations of this study within one year of entering this arrangement the law authorizes 15 million out of does defense environmental management funds for the nas to conduct the study the house and senate bills included similar provisions to require this study but the senate bill would have authorized lower amount of 750000 for it for further discussion see crs report rs21988 radioactive tank wastes disposal authority in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 coordinated by david m bearden appropriations for fy2005 in addition to defense authorization legislation the second session of the 108th congress completed action on the two fy2005 appropriations bills that fund cleanup and other environmental activities administered by dod the department of defense appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108287 provides more funding than in fy2004 for cleanup at active military installations but decreases funding for cleanup at fuds sites the military construction appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108324 provides less funding for the cleanup of base closure sites than in fy2004 neither law includes the exemptions from the clean air act cercla or rcra which dod requested the second session of the 108th congress also completed action on fy2005 appropriations for does cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 hr 4818 provides funding for numerous federal agencies including doe the law provides more funding for the cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites than was appropriated for fy2004 including funding for the disposal of radioactive tank wastes further discussion of each law is provided below crs19 department of defense the house and senate passed the conference agreement on the department of defense appropriations act for fy2005 hr 4613 hrept 108622 on july 22 2004 the president signed the bill into law pl 108287 on august 5 2004 the law appropriates specific funding levels for environmental cleanup activities but as in defense authorization legislation there are comprehensive lineitem accounts for dods other environmental activities including environmental compliance conservation pollution prevention and environmental technology as in past years dod will allocate funding for these activities from funds appropriated by the law to the accounts for operation and maintenance procurement and research and development as indicated in the table below the law provides 136 billion for the five defense environmental restoration accounts that fund the cleanup of past contamination at active military installations and fuds sites about 10 million more than authorized for fy2005 the administration had requested 131 billion the increase in funding is devoted to cleanup at fuds sites however relative to fy2004 funding for cleanup at fuds sites declines the law increases funding for cleanup at active army navy and air force installations as the administration requested in addition to these funds the law provides 10 million for the mitigation of environmental impacts resulting from military activities on indian lands

the total funding obligated for environmental cleanup projects in fy2004 under this type of contract funds are awarded for an indefinite number of services for an indefinite period of time they are generally more suitable for complex cleanup projects addressing extensive contamination that may present unforseen needs and require more time to complete than originally estimated there have been ongoing concerns in congress that the cost and scope of these contracts have become so large that they are difficult to manage in recent years congress has included provisions in dods appropriations bill to limit their use as the administration requested the law does not provide any funding for payment to the kahoolawe island conveyance remediation and environmental restoration trust fund the navy has completed its planned cleanup actions on kahoolawe island and transferred access authority back to the state of hawaii in crs20 november 2003 the navy ceased its use of the island as training range in 1995 and began the cleanup of the former range according to standards for the removal of munitions specified in memorandum of agreement with the state of hawaii signed in may 199434 there has been some disagreement as to whether the navy has cleaned up the island according to these standards whether additional funding may be necessary for further cleanup of the island is uncertain for

and fy2004 appropriations bills this provision limits the cost of maintaining and repairing general and flag officer quarters unless congress is notified 30 days in advance that costs will exceed 35000 however if the costs above this amount are solely for environmental cleanup activities that could not be reasonably anticipated at the time of the budget submission the law authorizes dod to notify congress of the higher costs afterthefact providing an exception from early notification requirements for unforseen environmental costs could help to ensure that cost limitations do not prevent

from the appropriation for the defense site acceleration completion account pl 108447 provides 292 million of the 350 million that the administration requested for its highlevel waste proposal prior to the acrosstheboard rescission under this proposal doe would classify some of the radioactive tank wastes in idaho south carolina and washington as incidental to reprocessing and permanently dispose of these wastes by grouting them in place onsite in each state as discussed earlier the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 provides targeted authority for grouting some of the radioactive tank wastes in idaho and south carolina if certain criteria are met subject to appropriations by congress of the amount for the highlevel waste proposal 163 million is allocated to the savannah river site in south carolina for projects to prepare for the grouting of tank wastes and 97 million is allocated to the ineel in idaho for such projects the remaining appropriation of 32 million is allocated to hanford in washington state however it appears questionable whether this appropriation for hanford would be sufficient legal authority to permit the grouting of tank wastes at that site as the waste disposal authority in pl 108375 does not include washington state there are differing court rulings regarding whether an appropriation of funding by congress for specific activity alone provides sufficient authority for an agency to carry out that activity absent authority provided in other statutes or in apparent contradiction of preexisting authority in short congress can validate otherwise unauthorized or unlawful action in an appropriations act by clearly indicating that it crs22 intends to alter or repeal preexisting law in addition to funding an activity whether an appropriation for specific activity constitutes an authorization may be subject to some argument and possible legal challenge unless congress explicitly addresses the authority in question35 the conference report language allocating an appropriation of 32 million for waste incidental to reprocessing activities at the hanford site in fy2005 does not expressly mention the grouting of tank wastes raising the question of the authority for the use of this disposal method at that site there also has been ongoing concern in congress about the feasibility of does overall plans to accelerate cleanup and lower costs at the 114 sites across the country that make up the former defense nuclear weapons complex prior to the conference agreement on hr 4818 the house appropriations committee noted in its report on hr 4614 hrept 108554 that recent delays in cleanup schedules and cost overruns of certain projects raise questions regarding does ability to accelerate cleanup the committee also raised concerns regarding does delay in submitting report to congress on statutory changes that may be necessary to allow accelerated cleanup to proceed and the need for agreements with the states on all elements of the performance management plans for each site these plans outline how accelerated cleanup would be accomplished the conference report on hr 4818 also includes 78 million for does office of legacy management subject to the 08 acrosstheboard rescission the administration requested 66 million the same as the fy2004 appropriation of the amount in the conference report 47 million is allocated to defense sites and the remaining 31 million to nondefense sites congress provided the funding for doe to establish this office in the energy and water development appropriations act for fy2004 pl 108137 the primary function of the office is to assess longterm stewardship needs once cleanup is complete to ensure that does planned cleanup remedies continue to be effective in the future these planning assumptions are based on time frame of 150 years doe previously administered these responsibilities under its environmental management program in addition to funding for doe pl 108447 provides 165 million for the formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap also subject to the 08 acrosstheboard rescission the fusrap program is administered by the army corps of engineers as part of its civil works budget the amount for fy2005 is more than the fy2004 appropriation of 141 million and the administrations request of 140 million as discussed earlier the fusrap program addresses radioactive contamination at sites where uranium and thorium ores were stored and processed during the early years of the us nuclear weapons program in its report on hr 4818 the conferees indicated that the increase in funding is for expediting the completion of ongoing cleanup projects and funding new projects that are eligible for inclusion in
