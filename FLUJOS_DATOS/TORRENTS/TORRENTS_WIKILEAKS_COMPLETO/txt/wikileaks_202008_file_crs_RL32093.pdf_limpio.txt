httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32093iraq agriculture and food supply background and issues summary iraqs agricultural sector represents small but vital component of iraqs economy over the past several decades agricultures role in the economy has been heavily influenced by iraqs involvement in military conflicts particularly the 1980 88 iraniraq war the 1991 gulf war and the 2003 iraq war and by varying degrees of government effort to promote andor control agricultural production rapid populati on growth coupled with limited arable land and general stagnation in agricultural productivity s steadily increased dependence on imports to meet domestic food needs since the mid 1960s prior to the 1991 gulf war iraq was major trading partner with the us iraq benefitted from substantial usda agricultural export credit during the 1980s to purchase large quan tities of us agricultural commodities by the mid1980s iraq was the major destination for us rice exports iraq was also an important purchaser of us wheat corn soymeal and cotton after the 1991 gulf war us agri cultural export credit to iraq was ended and usda was left with 2 billion in unpaid cr edit us agricultural trade with iraq remained negligible through 2002 presentday iraqi agriculture and trade have been heavily shaped by the 1990 sanctions and the iraqi government s response to them from 1991 to 1996 prior to the startup of the uns oil forfood program offp iraqs agricultural imports averaged 958 million or less than lf of the prewar level under the offp the value of iraqs agricultura l imports rebounded to average 15 billion during the 19972002 period in early 2003 just prior to the us ir aq war the countrys agricultural sector remained beset by the legacy of past management unresolve d disputes over land and water rights and the lingering ffects of severe drought during 19992001 clearly iraq will be depe ndent on imports for fully meeting domestic food demand for several years to come in the near

ministry of irrigation in 1975 report stated that nearly 73 of iraqs nd is potentially viable for grazing although other studies suggest that potential grazing land is substantially less with significant seasonal variation6 the primary limiting factors for land use in agriculture are high summertime temperatures water availability in the form of either rainfall or river flow and the problem of salinity control in the alluvial plains of the euphrates and tigris rivers there is some disagreement among experts as to iraqs true agricultural potential since much of the countrys soil is cultivable weather and water permitting and technical procedures exist for recla iming prime farmland lost to salinization kamil mahdi an expert who has research ed and published extensively on iraqs agriculture characterizes iraqs agricultura l land base as follows it would be true to say that cultivable land in iraq is bundant but that land of good quality is very limited much land could be reclaimed and improved but at too high cost in relation to the yields that might be expected from prevailing agricultural practices7 land use patterns iraq has total surface area of 437 million hectares about the size of wyoming and sout h dakota combined of which 340 million 777 percent is not viable for ag ricultural use under current conditions8 less than 04 percent is in forest and

accounted for 73 of all planted area with respect to crop production iraqs agricultural sector can be divided into two distinct regions the predominantly rainfed north and the pre dominantly irrigated centersouth figures 1 and 2 agricultural production is generally characterized by smallholding although the rainfed farms of the north tend to be larger averaging 10 to 30 hectares than the irrigated farms of the centersouth veraging 1 to 25 hectares14 rainfed agriculture about onethird of iraqs cereal production predominantly winter wheat and barley is produced under rainfed conditions in the northern foothills rainfed agriculture is practiced in the governorates of ninevah erbil dohuk and laimaniya figure 3 the variegated topography of the region includes various microclimatic zones but basically the region can be divided into three rainfall regimes hi gh 7001100 mm medium 400700 mm and low under 400 mm15 vegetable production and fruit orchards predominate in the highrainfall zone in the north wheat occupi most of the mediumrainfall zone and barley is the main crop in the lowrainfall zone winter wheat and barley are planted in the fall octobernovember and harvested in the late spring apriljune in accordance with the rainfall pattern figure 4 yields on the rainfed crops are genera lly poor and vary significantly with rainfall amounts traditionally biennial fallow system was used in rainfed areas to regenerate depleted soils and provide protection agains t pests and diseases under this system winter crop of wheat or barley was grown once every two years and alternate halves of field were left idle in successive years apart from crop rotation very little inputs fertilizers pe sticides or herbicides are used in rainfed conditions and generally poor crop mana gement practices prevail16 since the early 1990s farmers have been rotating previously monocropped cereals with leguminous forage crops such as alfalfa this was done to pa rtially offset the sharp decline in imported feed grains and to break slump in productivity due to d eclining soil fertility irrigated agriculture iraqs irrigated production zone runs along and between the tigris and euphrates rivers extending from the countrys central region southeastward to the marshlands of the griseuphrates delta very little rain falls in the centersouth zone of iraq and agri cultural in this region is dependent on irrigation about twothirds of iraqs cereal produc tion occurs within the irrigated zone irrigated agriculture includes both winter wheat and barley production and summer rice and corn crops the other main i rrigated summer crops include cotton and vegetables traditionally the biennial fallow system was also practiced in the irrigated zone the fallow period would permit the water table to drop sufficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32093crs10 17 agence france presse february 11 2003 copyright 2003 18 ipr strategic business information database september 18 2000 figure 4 iraqs

government policies in the 1990s encouraging more intensive land cultivation and land tenure system th at encourages shortterm exploitation over longterm investment in the soil in recent decades

irrigation potential surface water resources and irrigation iraq has more water than most middle eastern nations due to the tigris and euphrates river systems both rivers are fed by snowpack and rainfall in eastern turkey while tigris tributaries are also fed by water sources in northwest iran iraq s irrigation development depends to large extent on the volume of water from the gris and euphrates rivers released by upstream countries syria and turkey both the tigris and euphrates originate in turkey the more southerly euphrates tr avels through syria before entering iraq from the west with an averag annual flow estimated at 30 km319 t h m r northerly tigris briefly runs along syria s most northeastern border before entering iraq from the north the tigris has smaller flow capacity estimated at slightly over 21 km3 however numerous rivers and stream s running out of iraqs northern foothills feed into the tigris as result the tigris is less dependent on foreign sourcing about 50 of the tigris wate r comes from outside the country compared with 90 for the euphrates both the tigris and the euphrates expe rience significant water flow variation over the course of year the euphrat flow shows the greatest variation fluctuating annually between 10 and 40 km3 water discharges are highest for both rivers in april and may coinciding with the winter crop harvest when irrigation requirements are very low nd potential flood losses very high the tigris generally floods earlier and more violently than the euphrates and tends to carry more silt from the denuded hillsides of northern iraq flood water levels decline rapidly and water supplies remain at low level from july through november given the high rate of evaporation and tr anspiration summer crops are heavily restricted while winter cultivation is also restricted by extremely low river discharge levels at the beginning of the winter crop seas on in october and early november20 the sourcing of water flow and interna tional agreements governing the control of that flow are critical because water demand is expected to continue to grow for all three countries within the tigriseuphrates watershed iraq syria and turkey in 1980 iraq and turkey created joint technical committee on regional waters to oversee the control and manage ment of the euphrates and tigris although syria joined this committee later more important agreement between syria and iraq was established in 1990 under the 1990 syriair aq agreement the two countries agreed to share the euphrates waters at rate of 58 iraq and 42 syria based on the flow received by syria at its border with turkey21 turkey has unilaterally promisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32093crs12 22 ibid 23 ibidto secure minimum flow of 158 km3 per year at its border with syria this implies facto minimum flow of 92 km3 per year for iraq the realization of iraqs irrigation potential will depend on the development of planned upstream irrigation and water ma nagement projects the southeast anatolian gap project in turkey and various irrigation projects in syria will likely reduce iraqs overall irrigation potential within iraq early attempts at constructing barrages that channeled river water into natural depressions to control fl ood waters proved ine ffective in supporting irrigated agriculture the combination of high evaporation from the reservoirs and the absorption of salt residues in the depr essions often made th water too brackish for agricultural use however system of onriver water storage facilities such as barrages or dam reser voirs at samarra dukan da rband khan mosul and hadithah on the tigris habbaniyah on the euphrates and the bakhma on the upper zab were successfully deve loped to help regulate th flow of both

million hectares 63 in the tigris basin 35 in the euphrates basin and 2 in the shatt alarab basin22 however only 35 million hectares were estimate d to be fully or partially equipped for control irrigation that same year of this total much smaller area was actually irrigated since substantial area has been abandoned due to poor irrigation system maintenance leading to waterloggi ng and salinity in 1993 only 1936 million hectares were estimated to be actually irrigated23 problems related to poor irrigation syst em management and low usage rates include the growing salinity problem for which effective nationalscale desalinization program has ev er been developed problem s related to the evolution of land and water rights difficulties experienced with silt and weed clearance from canal beds and silting up of floodirrigate d land and labor s hortages resulting from ruralurban migration and the expansion in cultivation of highvalue laborintensive crops further problem relates to th growing importance of pumpirrigated systems that have replaced previous flowirrigated ie gravity driven systems pump irrigation can be more effective and reliable at delivering water to fields but it is vulnerable to the availability of timely and inexpensive fuel and machine parts salinity has been persistent problem another important issue for iraqs irrigation potential is water quality particularly as measured by the waters salinity or salt content high water salinity can produce salinization of the soil if not managed properly salinization is th process by which watersoluble salts accumulate in the soil excess salts hinder the growth of crops by limiting their ability to take up water increasing salinization eventually renders the land sterile the water table of southern iraq is saline and so near the surface that it only takes bit of injudicious overirrigation to bring it up to root level and destroy the crop httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32093crs13 24 mahdi 2000 p16 25 okin undated httpwww evscvirginiaedudesertthroughout history the irrigated agricu lture of iraqs centersouth region has been menaced by salinization iraqs historical records include accounts of salinization caused by canal irrigation between 2400 and 1700 bc and the problem has recurred at intervals through the presen t in 1973 it was estimated that at least 25 million hectares of iraqs irrigated cropland had become uncultivable due to excessive salinity and that every year another 6000 to 12000 hectares were lost to salinization24 as result salinization represents both an immediate and longterm threat to iraqs land resources and agricultural productive capacity reducing the severity and ex tent of soil salinity is primarily problem of water management the usual treatment for salinization is to flush the soil with lots of water as result good water fl ow and effective drainage are cr itical to salinity control irrigation diminishes water flow and increases the level of salinity particularly during the dry season in add ition proper drainage is not easily achieved because iraqs terrain is very flat in the irrigated zone of the centersouth baghdad for example although 550 kilometers from the persian gulf is only 34 meters above sea level this slight gradient makes th plains susceptible to flooding and although it facilitates irrigation it also hampers drainage technically salinity is not an insurmount able problem but would require heavy investment in an effective drainage system as well as rebuilding and maintenance of existing canals in addition to increased water flow and an effective drainage system the degree of salinity can be improved by plant selection tillage practices and soil management25 ground water resources and irrigation according to fao good quality subterranean water exists in the f oothills of northeastern mountains and along the right bank of the euphrates however both aquifers become increasingly saline towards lower

in 1958 ended the monarchy and established iraq as republicstructural evolution of iraqs agricultural sector introduction over the past 150 years iraqs agricultural sector has undergone numerous structural transformations each marked by the degree and nature of state interference throughout this period iraq s system of land tenure inefficient government implementation of land reform and interventionist agricultural policies have had profound impact upon agricu ltural relations and upon production employment and investment decisions the net effect has been perpetuation of low productivity of farmers slow growth of the agricultural sector and an everincreasing dependence on imports to meet domestic food needs the first major transformation in iraqs agricultural sector came in the late nineteenth century involving the break up of tribal landholdings and the creation of large privatelyheld estates this was followed in 1958 by the rise to dominance of the central state during this period which extended into the late 1970s the agricultural sector underwent radical nd redistribution involving the breakup of the large landholdings and the creation of stateenforced cooperatives and even some collectivization in 1979 saddam hussein assumed pow er and immediately set out to recreate the state under his control under hussein agricultures role in the economy has been heavily influenced by iraqs involvement in military conflicts particularly the 198088 iraniraq war the 1991 gulf war and the 2003 iraq war and by varying degrees of government effo rt to promote andor control agricultural production the early periods are discussed in the following two sections followed by two sections that present in some detail the development of iraqs agricultural sector under saddam hussein early structure of the agricultural sector pre1958 although urban settlements and irrigated agricu lture have existed within ir aq for thousands of years the traditional agriculture practiced throughout most of modern iraq until late in the nineteenth century consisted of pastoral agriculture within nomadic tribal setting the initial modernization of iraqs agricu ltural sector involve d the transformation from traditional practices of livestock gr azing and crop production to mechanization and consolidation of land holdings into va st estates during the hundred years or so preceding 1958 while part of the ottoman empire sy stem of tribal tenure through which the state retained ownership of the land although tribes used it predominated in iraq 26 during this period accumulating pressu re from urbanbased capital emerging international trade linkages and the growing power of central government placed substantial pressure on th traditional tribalbased agrarian system around 1870 large agricultural land holdings began to come under private individual title frequently by former tribal shaikhs chiefs at rapid pace this transformation facilitated agricultural expansion and the settlement of what had formerly been grazing land but it also played signif icant role in the tenure conditions thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32093crs15 organization of farm activities the pattern of land use and the associated agricultural production relations that emerged under this informal system of tribal tenure land titles were insecure by the 1930s large landowners had accu mulated considerable po litical clout and began to lobby for greater security over their landholdings in response the government passed law in 1932 empowering it to settle title to land nd to speed up registration of titles under the law number of tribal leaders and village headmen were granted title to the land that had been worked by their communities even though agriculture was commercialized and farm surpluses could be directed to satisfying growing urban demand important elements of trib organization remained for example traditional share tenancy involving the rota tion of plots to be cultivated and the strips to be assigned to tenants was often based on cu stomary rights of tribesmen who tended to have share of the land rather than rights to specific plot as result factor markets for nd and labor were severely re stricted wage labor and cash rents were almost nonexistent the number of sharecroppers and tenants increased over time under this system this relationship was form alized in favor of landowners by 1933 law which provided th at sharecropper could not leave the land if he were indebted to the landowner because landow ners were usually the sole source of credit and almost sharecroppe r was free of debt the law effectively bound many tenants to the land large landowners who were reliant on cheap labor and traditional social organization had incentive to carry out investments in new technology or production practices that might have had unfa vorable consequences for factor pricing and social organization as result th intensity of cultiva tion and land productivity was very low and the entire growth in output was due to rapid expansion in cultivated area emphasis was placed on re source development that reinforced the existing agrarian system and served the interests of the landlords the limits to area expansion that were reached were due to salinization and seasonal water constraints in the irrigation zone and to expansion in to marginal lands in the rainfed zone in the southcentral irrigated zone investment in wate rstorage and flood control projects along with adoption of irrigation pumps served to expand cultivated area rather than to increase productivity the tribalbased share tenancy system contributed to the poor upkeep of th irrigation system irrigation and drainage networks were not main tained and salinity spread over large areas in the northern rainfed zone the rrival of tractors quickly pushed area expansion onto marginal grazing nd such cultivation was ecologically unsustainable problems associated with geographic isolation were also compounded by the landtenure system and reinforced the low productivity low investment nature of production over time many landowners sought the amenities of urban life and absentee landlords whose incentive was to maximize shortterm profits contributed to the failure to adopt better but highercost land manageme nt and production practices this agrarian system reinfo rced the practice of cereal monoculture to the detriment of varied and mixed farming that encompassed highervalued activities such as vegetable and

farmers and the inequalities of the countryside juxtaposed against the wealth and political influence of the landlords placed agrarian reform high on the agenda of the new government land reform was initiated in october 1958 and resulted in the breakup of large estates whose owners were compelled to forfeit their excess land to the government which would then redistribute th land to new peasant owners29 this land was to be redistributed to individuals in parcels of between 7 and 15 hectares recipients would repay the government over 20year period under the law the government was to pay for expropriated land but by 1968 the government had absolved itself of all responsibility to r ecompense landowners30 the government also began promoting the growth of cooperatives and collective farms in 1967 farmers receiving expropr iated lands were required to join cooperative the government provided heavily subsidized farm equipment to farmers through farmers cooperatives during this period most government subsidies were directed to these statesanc tioned enterprises however this approach of heavy state control proved inefficient nd unproductive first the government was slow to redistribute the expropriated nd by 1968 17 million hectares of farmland had been expropriated but less than third of it had been redistributed as result the government continued to hold larg proportion of arable land which because it was not distribute d often lay fallow31 second the previous system of input supply covering credit seeds pumps and marketing services that had been performed by the landlords was not being fully undertaken by the state due to lack of personnel funds and expertise agri cultural production stagnated nd ruraltourban migration increased in 1970 the government

protected by the ration system from falling below the point where mass starvation could have occurred66 the value of food basket was calculate d on the basis of an adult ration valued at the average monthly market price of each commodity as result its price varied with market conditions which in turn were highly depende nt on domestic food production in august 1991 shortly after th startup of the

heavily depe ndent on foreign workers nd expertise and suffered from their departure following the impositi on of sanctions and the subsequent 1991 gulf war68 in addition palm tree populations were significantly damaged by warrelated activity69 however anecdotal evidence suggests that the eventual economic downturn and widespread loss of jobs that occurred in the decade following the 1991 gulf war coupled with escalating food costs particul arly in urban centers led to some urban torural migration and rebound in the rural labor force available for agricultural production iraqs date industry

dramatic rise in production for the date industry while most other agricultural sectors were in decline suggests that market incentives for date production remained strong relative to other agricultural activities the sharp drop off in iraqs sugar imports particularly on per capita basis likely enhanced the value of dates as sugar substitute in domestic markets and made them an attractive cash crop for producers refer to sugar availability and importation data in tables 13 and 16 however the international embargo had essentially cut off iraqs official exports of dates

charged for the food ration that developed through the mid 1990s the government kept the rate of growth of procurement prices substantially below the growth of market prices this implicit tax on agricultural producers was estimated to range between 20 to 35 of the value of production for various commodities in 199672 the implicit tax provided strong incentive for farmers to underreport cropped area to minimize this problem the government linked its supply of subsidized agricultural inputs to reported cropped area as result iraqs agricultural sector faced highly distorted system of incentives that included subsidized agri cultural inputs mandatory production quotas and an implicit tax on the sa of that production th net subsidytax balance appears to have become increasingly negative over time the balance was finally tipped against agricultural productivity in the mid1990s due to increasing shortages of agricultural inputs agricultural input availability plummets iraqs

however as with other war damage concerns little documentation is available to support claims or provide evidence at any rate given the importance of the countrys irrigation infrastruct ure to the agricultural sector and national food security it is likely that the government engaged in rebuilding the damaged canals deemed most essential to agricultural production in the absence of oil revenues s ubsidies for irrigation water and canal maintenance were becoming serious drai n on the government budget in 1995 the government raised water charges on irri gated land and shifted the burden of canal maintenance to growers who were obligated to maintain their onfarm drainage networks if the farmer failed to do s the government would undertake the work at the farmers expense74 however this system does not appear to have been effective the encroaching drought of 19992001 s ee section middle east drought of 19992001 meant reduced waterflows through the canal system and made cleaning and

productivity was becoming severely hampered by th overexploitation of resources and the decline of essential inputs continuous cr opping rather than the routine cerealfallow rotation resulted in rapidly depleting so il fertility in addition government input subsidies were gradually reduced under severe macro economic pressures including budgetary shortfalls rampant inflation and rapidly depreciating currency by 1998 government distribution of highyielding seeds and subsidized credit had ended and the staterun veterinary clinic had closed strict price controls in an environment of both rapi d inflation and rapidly depreciating currency resulted in declining terms of trade for agriculture although the official purchase prices for most commodities were continually being raised they did not rise as fast as the currency the iraqi dinar depreciated in international exchange markets this meant that the value of imported inputs such as pesticides and farm machinery was rising faster than the value of the crop being produced as result any reliance upon imported inputs pur chased at black ma rket unofficial prices meant that producer returns were being squeezed in the end producers were discouraged from using the expensive im ported inputs and pr oductivity declined the problem was compounded by the inability to import most chemicals used for production of fertilizers

land was reportedly under cultivation in northern iraq in 1992 whereas the total cultivated area of iraq as whole had expanded sharply in that year102 land conflicts also emerged as major impediment to increased agricultural production as refugees and formerly deported peasants returned to an independent northern iraq many farmer s found that their villages and land had been seized by neighboring tribes or local landowners that had remained loyal to the central government in most cases th landowners many with tribal backing emerged victorious in addition the prevalence of larg escale mechanized commercial farming in the north strength ened the position of the landowning elite the regional government was too weak to implement new ndredistribution law instead rival kurdish parties sought lliances with the influential landowners thereby giving the landowners opportunities to assert greater control over their land holdings despite facto independence from the central government the kurdish controlled regions food produc tion and supply remained strongly influenced by conditions in the centersout h particularly sancti ons and the cutoff of oil revenues and critical imports

increasing number of reports emerged of predatory acts against infrastructure materials and other staterelated resources and against the civilian population106 these predatory acts appeared to intensify following the security breakdown that occurred in 1994 when the two principal kurdish factions engaged in armed combat favorite items for predation included electricity cables agricultural and irrigation machinery and cars some groups closely following events in kurdish iraq expressed fears that the predatory economy would become institutionalized by small groups of individuals backed

agricultural production and trade growing importance of food imports food imports under the offp made iraqs trade dependence nearly comple for many basic foodstuffs according to the wfp by early 2003 nearly 60 pe rcent of iraqs population was totally dependent on food rations sustai ned in large part by offp imports for cereals the major staple nearly 80 of all consumption during the 200002 period came from imported grain table 9 furthermore the countrys longrun f ood deficit still confronts the perennial problem of population growth rate th at has continued to exceed growth in agricultural productivity iraq s populati on growth rate has showed some signs of slowing107 it grew at an annual rate of about 23 from 1995 to 2000 down dramatically from the pre1990 rate of 33 table 1 but domestic cereal production actually declined during the 1990s despite its recent poor performance iraq s agricultural production potential has likely been clouded by several factors that occurred in the period leading up to the iraq war of 2003 together these fact ors have tended to understate iraqs agricultural potential first iraq was only beginning to emerge from threeyear drought that devastated agricultural produc tion in much of the middle east during 19992001 second growing dependence since early 1997 on the offp for basic foodstuffs exaggerated iraqs dependence on food imports and understated its ability to feed itself third the low agricultural productivity of the previous two decades was exacerbated by the central governments focusing of resources and productive capacity on its military sector agricultural productivity suffered from limited investment and resources shortages of inputs deteriorating irrigation infrastructure and increasing soil salinity fourth for most of the previous 30 years production and investment decisions in iraqs agricultural sector were subject to maze of often contradictory policy signals incl uding explicit input subsidies and implicit output taxes that likely resulted in significantly less than optimal cropping patterns and levels of investment fifth serious land ownership and wa ter rights issues contributed to the degradation of iraqs agricultural resource base widespread control of land and wa ter based on cronyism nd tribal connections are reported to have encouraged overexploitation of land and

renovation of iraqs irrigation infra structure developmen t of coordinated national program of salinization as well as the rebuilding of infrastructure for handling storing and distributing agri

is uncertain but has likely become dysfunctiona l due to lack of government support and the cutoff from international technology unde r the sanctions reestablishment of national capacity for providing agricu ltural research exte nsion and veterinary services will be important for improving longterm agricultural productivity for both crops and livestock in the past such ex tension and veterinary networks served as the principal conduit for information on improved crop and animal husbandry practices as well as for distributing crop nd livestock inputs such as improved seeds and veterinary medicines full integration into the international agricultural research network of the consultative group on international agricu ltural research cgiar and possibly collaborative research with usda andor other institutions could foster gains in productivity through access to improved s eed and production technology modern agricultural research has much to offer iraqs agricultural sector for example improved plant genetics selective breeding to local conditions and identification of improved production practices in add ition if acceptable to the iraqi populace modern agricultural biotechnology might br ing additional benefits including reduced use of agricultural inputs often higher yi elds and the addition of specific nutrients trade dependence likely to continue such developments would likely result in significant improvement in iraqs agricultural productivity however iraqs large population relative to its arab land base ensures that agricultural imports will remain vital co mponent of the countrys ability to meet all of its food needs for the foreseeable future iraqs historical trade and food consumption patterns suggest that food grains such as wheat and rice as well as vegetable oil sugar meat dairy products and feedstuffs including corn barley and protein meals are all likely to be important imports into iraq table 11 in the near term while

poultry sector was booming the ited states was the principal supplier of coarse grains principally corn to iraq table 14 iraqi coarse grain imports will likely resume stepforstep with growth in its
