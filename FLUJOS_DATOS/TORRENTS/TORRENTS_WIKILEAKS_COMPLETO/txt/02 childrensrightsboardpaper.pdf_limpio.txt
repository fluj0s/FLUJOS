agenda item 10 bd051002 children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 05 october 2006 childrens rights policy 1 aim and purpose 11 the draft childrens rights policy was consulted on between november 2005 and february 2006 and reflects recent policy and practice developments in cafcass the policy is now submitted to the board for approval 12 endorsement by the board is an important step towards mainstreaming childrens rights at all levels of the organisation particularly in frontline practice 2 action for the board 21 to play their part in the mainstreaming push 22 to endorse the shared values framework as being consistent with the good governance of cafcass 23 to note the commitment to specific united nation convention articles set out in the policy 3 recommendation 31 the board is asked to fully endorse the childrens rights policy as set out 4 diversity 41 the current policy is fully diversity compliant 5 training 51 all training modules have been reevaluated to ensure this policy can be fully implemented and to ensure its impact is more visible and tangible to children and young people and supports improvements in direct work with them 1 6 legal 61 domestic legislation and guidance remain the primary basis for promoting children and young peoples welfare in england work ing within the spirit of the united nations convention on the rights of the child uncrc will be further assurance for children that their contribution to iss ues that affect their lives will always be respected 62 the uncrc is nonenforceable and cannot be effectively challenged directly under any of its articles it is not incorporated into uk law and external court is empowered to pass judgement on it it is merely cited by different courts domestically and internationally as an indication of the aspirations of most countries in the world towards children the uk had reservations when ratifying the uncrc the reservations related to the care of young offenders immigration and employment regulations regarding over 16 year olds and childrens hearings in scotland the latter two reservations have since been removed 63 it is an existing policy position that cafcass practitioners will promote the principles of the uncrc service principles and standards 2003 and that the organisation will seek to promote the rights of children set out in the uncrc corporate plan 20036 this remains an organisational signal that we put children first 7 the approach of other organisations 71 the commission of social care inspection csci is guided by the treaty to strengthen domestic legislation and national inspection standards they take the view that the convention articles are principles for decisions and as yardstick for auditing child focus 72 the csci recognises that the uk ex pressed reservations when ratifying the uncrc the cscis current position is that they adopt the convention with specific position on the same reservations expressed by the uk government if reservation arose it would be considered on casebycase basis 73 the childrens commissioners office has due regard for the uncrc and it underpins their work 8 key strategic issues for the board to consider 81 endorsement of the policy will mean that cafcass will continue to actively consult all children and young people whose lives are directly affected by our service and provide the opportunity to be heard should they so wish 82 compliance with the policy will be achieved through the existing performance management framework 83 degree of culture change will be crucial to the full and successful implementation of the policy the timescale is the same as that for the entire practice development programme march 2009 is the final date for all necessary practice developments and improvements to have taken place in every local service area 29 financial implications 91 these changes will be managed within existing resources there are specific costs incurred for writing and disseminating the policy as the costs are met by existing staff knowledge learning and dev elopment costs are already funded within existing allocations 10 risks 101 full implementation of the policy across the organisation needs to be phased to ensure that practitioners can be fully trained to work within this framework this will be addressed over realistic timescales 102 it is existing cafcass policy to promote the principles of the uncrc some of those principles are not to be found in dom estic law however there is nothing wrong legally in cafcass giving commitment to promote such principles and the risks of policy or legal challenge are minimal as long as any specific recommendation about child is made in good faith with an evidencebase and having taken their needs wishes and feelings into account 103 public awareness of our more explicit focus on childrens rights may lead to greater expectation of their views being heard in family court proceedings if this is not demonstrated there will be greater risk of cr iticism similarly pressure groups representing other interests in the family justice arena may suggest their own rights are being undermined by the stronger focus on childrens rights however group is likely to disagree with the principles set out in this policy merely its application in individual cases in this sense the most important aspect of the policy is how it will be reflected in everyday practice christine smart childrens rights director september 2006 3
