implementation status introduction this report provides review of th 911 commission recommendations and the status of their implementation at the end of the 109th congress it is intended to provide structured road map to this nd the discussions herein are organized on the basis of policy themes that are at the core of the 911 commissions recommendations rather than review of every numbered item set out in the commissions final report the analysis was produced by large team of crs specialists analysts and attorneys who are responsible for the wide variety of policy areas covered by the 911 commission in its work the authors of the varied segments of this report are identified in footnotes each section of the report summarizes the pertinent elements of the 911 commissions recommendations relevant to that sections policy theme th review is made of responses made by the congress to implement in whole or in part the given recommendation where appropriate notice is taken of executive branch actions regarding the policy matter detailed table of contents provides the reader with guide to each of the policy themes discussed footnotes in each section of the report provide references to more detailed information on particular topics related to each policy theme strengthening the intelligence function1 commission concerns and recommendations the 911 commission concluded that the organization of the us intelligence community had contributed to failure to develop management strategy to counter islamic terrorism the commission recommended major reordering of the intelligence community to enable single official to manage the entire national intelligence effort and oversee the agencies that contribute to it the commission also recommended the establishment of national intelligence centers including national counterterrorism center nctc to correlate and analyze information from all sources on particular topics principal recommendation of the commission was the creation of the position of director of national intelligence dni separate from the director of the central intelligence agency cia who would have major statutory authorities over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs2 intelligence communitys 16 agencies includi ng the preparation of budgets systems acquisition and the setting of personnel policies and sta ndards for information use throughout the intelligence community the dni would also be the principal intelligence advisor to the president and would prepare national intelligence estimates congressional responses congress responded to many of the recommendations of the 911 commission by passing the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108 458 hailed by some as the most important intelligence gislation since the national security act of 1947 the act established dni along with separate director of the cia and provided him with additiona l authorities beyond those that the former director of central intelligence dci had over all intelligence agencies the dni possesses substantial author ities to prepare the nationa l intelligence budget and the expenditure of funds appropr iated for the national intelligence effort the dni also is charged with establishing priorities for collection and analysis and managing intelligence centers composed of analysts from various intelligence and law enforcement agencies questions i nvolvi ng the dcis budgetary authorities were debated at length during consideration of the legislation the management and oversight authorities proposed by the 911 commission and reflect ed in some versions of intelligence reform legislation appeared to some members as complicating undermining or replacing the authorities of the secretary of defense over intelligence agencies in the defense department in pa rticular the national security agency national reconnaissance office and national geospatial intelligence agency that are also integral components of dods warfightin g capabilities the agreement reflected in the final legislation provides the dni with authority to develop and determine an annual consolidated national intelligence program budg et along with authorities to manage appropriations transfer or reprogra m funds within strict limitations transfer limited number of personnel annually and blish common information technology standards at the same time the ac t called for the president to issue guidelines to ensure that the authorities granted to the dni are implemented in manner that respects and does not abrogate the statutory res ponsibilities of other departments including dod so observers have suggested that the legislation has not definitively resolved the question of the dnis responsibilities for the defense agencies in particular and have argued that further legislative changes may be required andor that an effective solution will depend on the ability of the dni and the secretary of defense to work in close coordination to large extent pl 108458 adopt ed the recommendations of the 911 commission regarding the organization of the intelligence community but it did not centralize management of the intelligence community to the extent that at least some on the 911 commission would have preferred as result there remains potential that the national intelligence agencies within the department of defense may be subject to conflicting guidance from the secretary of defense and the dni thus far however there has been little public contr oversy regarding the budgets of intelligence agencies since the enactment of pl 108458httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs3 2 prepared by walter j oleszek senior specialist in the legislative process government and finance divisionintelligence oversight congressional options2 commission concerns and recommendations the 911 commission stated that congressional oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism is dysfunctional commission members suggested two basic alternatives for strengthening and improvi ng congresss oversight of these policy domains the two recommendations were 1 to create either joint committee on intelligence modeled after the former joint committee on atomic energy or 2 establish committee in each chamber that has the authority to both authorize and appropriate for intelligence agencies and activities in addition the commission suggested that an intelligence committee should have subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight the panel should have subpoena authority majority party representation on the panel should exceed the minority by only one member member from each of these panels armed services judiciary foreign affairs and the defense appropriations subco mmittee should serve on an intelligence committee members who serve on an in telligence committee should not be subject to term limits the staff of an intelligen ce committee should be nonpartisan and serve the entire committee and the size of an intelligence committee should range from seven to nine members congressional responses the house and senate did not create joint intelligence committee nor did either chamber consolidate authorizin g and appropriating responsibility for the intelligence community in single committee on the other hand the two chambers followed some but not all of th commissions other recommendations in the house the permanent select intelligence committee for the 109th congress has an oversight subcommittee subpoena authority and members who serve also on the defense appropriations subcommittee and the armed services judiciary and international relations committees the house panels ratio of majority to minority party members does not however track the commissions recommendation the house permanent select intelligence committees size is larger than nine its members are subject to tenure limitations with exceptions for the chair and ranking minority member and it has partisan staff model in october 2004 the senate adopted sres 445 which made number of changes affecting oversight of the intelligence community some of the recommendations in sres 445 parallel the commissions ideas while others are new proposals agreed to by the senate the ideas in sres 445 that affect the select intelligence committee and which genera lly emulate the commissions proposals are these an oversight subcommittee subpoe na authority oneseat margin for the majority party twoseat representati on on the panel from each of these committees appropriations armed services foreig n relations and judiciary moreoverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs4 3 for further information generally see crs report rs21955 sres 445 senate committee reorganization for homeland security and intelligence matters by paul continuedintelligence members are not subject to rm limits on the other hand the select intelligence committee employs partisan staff model and its size is larger than nine members sres 445 made number of other chan ges affecting the select intelligence committee these include granting the majority leader formal authority to name the chairman and the minority leader the vice chairman of the panel authorizing the chair and vice chair of the intelligence panel to name respectively the chair and vice chair of any subcommittee assigning to the panel jurisdiction over civilian nominations to adviceandconsent positions within the intelligence community permitting each intelligence member to appoi nt staff aide to the committee subject to appropriate security clearances allocating committee staff resources between the parties on 6040 ratio excluding staff desi gnees appointed by individual senators expanding current requirements that the intelligence committee report periodically to the senate on its findings and to requi re such reports quarterly elevating the select intelligence committee to category assignment status obligating the panel to consult with the majority leader and minority leader about the disclosure of classified information given to the committee by the executive branch and reducing what are called on demand sequential referrals from 30 days to 10 days sres 445 recommended that the committee on appropriations shall reorganize into 13 subcommittees as soon as possible after the convening of the 109th congress the senate committee on appropriations did not establish its customary 13 subcommittees bicameral discussions at the start of the 109th congress involving among others the majority pa rty leaders and the respective house and senate appropriations chairs led to downsizing and re shuffling of appropriations subcommittees and jurisdictions in midfebruary 2005 the house panel established 10 subcommittees eliminating three district of columbia legislative branch and vahud few weeks later the senate appropriations committee created 12 subcommittees the panel retained its district of columbia and legislative branch subcommittees but like the house it eliminated its vahud subcommittee and transferred its jurisdiction to other appropriations subcommittees one goal of revamping the organizational structure of the two ppropriations committees is to minimize the need for endofyear appropriations measures the recommendation in sres 445 fo r an appropriations subcommittee on intelligence was not acted upon by the committee on appropriations during the 109th congress the resolution stated that the proposed intelligence subcommittee shall have jurisdiction over funding for intelligen ce matters as deter mined by the senate committee on appropriations senate ppropriations member indicated that it would be difficult to create subcommitt ee with classified budget the 911 commission recommended public disclosure of the nations budget for intelligence which has not been agreed to by the congress3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs5 3 continued rundquist and christopher davis for historical background on the public disclosure issue

911 commission report p 198 7 911 commission report p 422improving transitions between administrations4 commission concerns and recommendations the 911 commission report5 included general recommendation that appointments to key national security positions at the time of presidential transitions occur more quickly the goal of th 911 commissions recommended changes was to minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking and maintain national security continuity when new president comes into office the recommendation addresse d the commissions concern about the length of time new administration takes to install key national security personnel the commission noted in particular the abbreviated transition period resulting from the delayed resolution of the 2000 presidential race the report stated given that presidential election in the united states br ings wholesale change in personnel this loss of time hampered the new administration in identifying recruiting clearing and obtaining senate confir mation of key appointees6 as result the commission reported the new administration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001 and the critical sub cabinet officials were not confirmed until the summer if then in other words the new administration like others before it did not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office7 in line with its overall recommenda tion the commission called for seven specific changes six of which are re lated to presidentia l appointments and transitions two of these proposed changes are related to the national security clearance process during transitions firs t the commission recommended starting the security clearance process for prospectiv appointees to national security positions immediately after the presidential election it also proposed that prior to the election each presidential ca ndidate provide to the fbi the names of selected members of his or her prospective tran sition team to facilitate quicker security clearances following the election three additional recommendations woul d modify the nomination and senate consideration processes for certain national security positions first the reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs6 8 the phrase national security team was not defined in the report 9 911 commission report p 422 10 pl 108458 118 stat 3638 11 pl 108458 sec 7601aproposed that all nominations to positi ons on the national security team8 be submitted to the senate by the presidentelect later than the date of his or her inauguration furthermore the commission called for the senate to adopt special rules requiring hearings and votes to c onfirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission the final recommended change to the appointment process would be the elimina tion of advice and c onsent requirements for any national security team members below level iii of the executive schedule the commission also suggested that beginning immediately after the election the transition include prompt and thorough written national security information exchange between the outgoing and incoming administrations in addition to these six changes the commission called for centralization of the security clearance process in one agency including providing and maintaining security clearances and ensuring uniform standards9 congressional responses enacted provisions the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 hereafter the intelligence reform act10 included several provisions that responded to commission concerns and reco mmendations the gislation amended the presidential transition act of 1963 to 1 recommend submission by the presidentelect to the agency with nationa l security clearance functions of the names of candidates for high vel national security positi ons through the level of undersecretary of agencies and depar tments as soon as possible after the presidential election 2 require the res ponsible agency or agencies to carry out background investigations of these candi dates for highlevel national security positions as expeditiously as possible be fore the date of the inauguration and 3 authorize relevant outgoing executive br anch officials to prepare detailed classified compartmented summary of specific operational threats to national security major military or covert operations and pending decisions on possible uses of military force which would be provided to the presidentelect and vice presidentelect as soon as possi ble after the general election11 just as the intelligence reform act seeks to facilitate more rapid security clearances for top national security position candidates it also does so for transition team members it allows each major party pr esidential candidate to submit before the general election security clearance re quests for prospective transition team members who will have need for access to cl assified information in the course of their work the law directs that resulting investigations and eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs7 12 pl 108458 sec

personnel management which now handles about 90 of all federal background investigationsdeterminations be completed as much as possible by the day after the general election12 the intelligence reform act also expresse s the sense of the senate about timetable for submission and consideration of highlevel national security nominations during transitions under this timetable nominations to such positions should be submitted by the pr esidentelect to the senate by inauguration day and senate consideration of all such nominations should be completed within 30 days of submission13 because most presidential appoint ees are subject to limited vetting process and not fullscale security clear ance investigation and adjudication these changes may have significant impact on the duration and difficulty of the confirmation process pe rsonnel security clearance inve stigation for instance is normally more exhaustive and longer than the usual vetting process for potential nominees background investigation for access to the highest clearance level top secret with access to sensitive compar tmented information may take year that is because the process requires fu ll field investigation including interviews with former colleagues and employers neighbors friends nd acquaintances along with checks of databases from law enfor cement entities financ ial services and to degree medical services the intelligence reform act also made governmentwide changes to the national security clearance process that are designed to consolidate and streamline this function concerns have long existe d over the substantial backlog delays and time consumed in initial background investig ations and subseque nt reinvestigations associated with gaining access to classifi ed national security information these problems have been exacerbated by the increased number of personnel requiring access to classified information and the growth of materials being classified or being classified at higher levels both of these ch anges in turn have been driven by the expanding programs in national and homela nd security other reasons for seeking improvements in the clearance process esp ecially the background investigations are 1 the lack of reciprocity among agencies so that one federal agency may not accept the findings of investigations previously conducted for another federal agency and 2 questions about the capacity of existing agencies to handle th increased workload or overload in light of its size and recent growth14 the intelligence reform act required the president to designate single executive entity to oversee and develop uni form standards and policies for access to classified information and to designate ot her investigative agen cies if appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs8 15 pl 108458 title iii sec 3001c 16 executive order 13381 strengthening processe s relating to determ ining eligibility for access to classified national

were generally not identical to the commissions recommended actions for example whereas the commission recommended that the senate should not require confirmati on of national security executive

concerns for the 110th t h presidential transition process change s called for by the 911 commission and provided for in the intelligence reform act are arguably more critical to national security

changes are designed to modernize the national security clearance process by adding new formal requirements eg for reciprocity among agencies and by consolidating the process under single entity the office of personnel management with guidance and supervision under th deputy director of the office of management and budget the implementa tion of these and other new developments might become the subjects of congressiona l oversight to determine whether the changes are proceeding as expected whether their goals are being met whether legislative intent is being followed what the implementation costs are and what other modifications might be necessary several provisions of the law reflect ongoing concern among some members of congress about the length and complexity of the presidential appointment process the last several congresses ve seen efforts to develop consensus inter alia on streamlining executive branch financial disclosure requirements reducing the number of positions requiring senate confirmation for appointment and simplifying conflict of interest laws and decriminalizing conflict of interest with the submission of reports to congress concerning these topics required by the intelligence reform act discussions regarding possible changes may be renewed during the 110th congress congress might elect to revisit provisions contained in earlier versions of the intelligence legislation that were not included in the enacted law these include proposed changes to provisions of the fe deral vacancies reform act of 1998 that would make it easier for the president

views comm only found in these countries the 911 commission reports recommendations on tempering extremism in the middle east and elsewhere echoed these sentiments according to the report comprehensive us strategy to counter terrorism shoul d include economic polic ies that encourage development more open soci eties and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future the 911 commission report also stressed that while us public diplomacy trade and cultural exchange and international assistance programs are necessary ultimately it is our policies in the region that fuel anger and resentment according to the report right or wrong it is simply fact that american policy regarding the israelipalestinian conflict and american actions in iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the arab and mu slim world increasingly public debate over how best to win the struggle of ideasin the arab and

continues to place its strategic regional interests above t hose of human rights and democracy by insufficiently protesting alleged abuses committed by friendly regional governments under the guise of

recommendations92 the 911 commission expressed concerns over air cargo security the security of general aviation aircraft screening of airline pa ssengers and baggage and access controls at airports the 911 commission made seve ral specific recommendations to address these concerns the 911 commission recommended that improved passenger prescreening not be further delayed by the longrunning ar gument about successor to the existing computer assisted passenger prescreening capps program run by the airlines93 the 911 commission recommended that the transportation security administrationtsa take over the function of prescreenin g passenger names using the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal gove rnment and that the airlines should be compelled to provide the data needed to test and implement this new prescreening system the 911 commission also recommended th at the tsa and the congress give priority attention to impr oving checkpoint screening fo r detecting explosives on passengers it recommended that the ts also conduct human factors study to examine screener performance and establis h objectives for screeners and screening checkpoints the commission expressed continued cerns over the screening of checked baggage and cargo it indicated that th tsa should expedite the installation of advanced inline baggage screening systems that are integrated with airport baggage processing systems the commission noted that because the aviation industry will derive substantial benefits from this deployment it shoul d pay fair share of the associated costs although the commissi on did not provide specifics regarding recommended allocation of contributions to pay for inline explosive detection systems integrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs39 the commission recommended that the tsa intensify efforts to identify track and screen potentially dangerous cargo in aviation as well as in maritime operations additionally the commission specifically r ecommended the deployment of at least one hardened cargo container on every passenger aircraft that also hauls cargo to carry any suspicious shipments in addition to these recommendations directly addressing aviation security the 911 commission also urged establishing riskbased priorities for protecting transportation assets in all modes it recommended that the tsa select the most practical and cost effective approaches for defending trans portation assets and formalize plan for implementing budge ting and funding this effort the 911 commission noted that the plan should assi gn roles to federal state and local authorities as well as to private stakeholders congressional response the 108th congress passed two major pieces of legislation containing numerous provisions pertaining to aviation security vision 100 century of aviation r eauthorization act pl 108176 and the intelligence reform and terrorism preven tion act of 2004 pl 108458 vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act before the 911 commission had completed its report several aviation securityrelated provisions were included in vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108 176 which was enacted on december 12 2003 vision 100 established redress process for p ilots mechanics or other licensed aviation professionals whose certif ication is denied suspended or revoked on the grounds that they pose risk to aviation security vision 100 also requires the fede ral aviation administration to provide justification to congress when establishing an air defense identification zone adiz around cities where pilots are required to use special communications and operating procedures to enable air traffic controllers to identify potential security threats modified existing requirements for security training of airline flight and cabin crew members under these provisions the airlines are responsible for providing mandatory basic training in security for crews while the tsa was to velop and provide voluntary advanced selfdefense training program for crew members required the department of homeland security to study and report to congress on the effectiveness of the aviation security system including the air marshal program hardening of cockpit doors and security screening of passengers checked baggage and cargo the report was to include recommenda tions including legislative recommendations for improving the effectiveness of aviation security created the aviation security cap ital fund the act authorizes up to 500 million per year through fy 2007 to be appropr iated to this fund and requires that the first 250 million in aviation security feehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs40 collections be deposited in this fund each year through fy2007 the act also provided the under secret ary for border and transportation security with the authority to issu grants to airports for projects to integrate baggage explosive detection systems with baggage conveyer systems reconfigure ter minal baggage areas as needed to install explosive detection system s deploy explosive detection systems behind the ticket counter in baggage sorting areas or in line with baggage handling systems and for other aviation security related capital improvement proj ects vision 100 set the federal share of costs for such projects at 90 for large and medium hub airports and at 95 for all other ai rports and set guidelines for the allocation of aviation security capital fund monies for these projects however appropriations language see for example pl 109295 has limited the fe deral share to 75 for large and medium hubs and 90 for all other airports required the implementation of security programs for air charter operators who use aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds maximum takeoff weight required the government accountability office gao to review the proposed capps ii passenger prescreening system and prevented the tsa from fully implementing this program until the

system in the event of terrorist attack requires the tsa to issue guidance for the use of biometrics in airport access control systems and establish biometric credential and authentication procedures to id entify law enforcement officers authorized to carry firearms aboard passenger aircraft the act authorizes 20 million in addition to any other authorized amounts for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security the act also authorizes 1 million to establish center of excellence in biomet ric technologies required the tsa to begin system testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system by january 1 2005 although the act does not provide deadline for the completion of testing the prescreening system it requires the tsa to begin to assume the role of passenger prescreening and checking passenger names against watch lists later than 180 days after completing that testing the act requires the tsa to establish redress and remedy procedures for passengers who are delayed or denied boarding because of being falsely identified or targeted by the system and requires the tsa to ensure that the number of such false positives is minimized the act also requires the tsa to establish an oversight board and implement safeguards to ensure the security and integrity of the system and address and resolve any privacy cerns the act also requires that

of defense and the f aa to report on the threats posed by international cargo shipments bound for the united states and provide an analysis of the potential for establishing secure facilities along established international aviation routes for the purposes of diverting and securing aircraft belie ved to pose security threat in addition to the aircargo security provisions in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 the department of homeland security appropriations act 2005 pl 108334 sec 513 directs the dhs to research develop and procure certified systems to inspect nd screen air cargo on passenger aircraft at the earliest date possible and am end security directives and procedures to at minimum triple the percentage of cargo inspected on passenger aircraft policy concerns not addressed in enacted legislation since several major provisions pertaining to aviati on security were enacted during the 108th congress many directly reflecting the concerns and recommendations of the 911 commission there are few policy concerns that have not been addressed to some degree during the 109th congress aviation security gislation direc tly addressing 911 commission findings and recommendations were not taken up however two areas where some may consider that po licy concerns have not been adequately addressed through legi slation include general aviation security and air cargo security procedures and oversight the 911 commission made brief referen ce to concerns over the security of general aviation operations however it did not make any formal recommendations to address this concern during the 108th congress legislation on the security of general aviation operations focused on ai rport and airspace restrictions and examining ways to alleviate what some believed to be unnecessary constraints on certain operations for example pr ovision in vision 100 required the dhs to develop and implement security plan allowing general aviation flights to resume at ronald reagan washington national airport but set timetable for carrying out this provision the tsa has now implement ed regulations allowing certain general aviation flights adhering to extensive ope rational requirements to operate to and from ronald reagan washington national ai rport in appr opriations language however temporary flight re strictions over stadiums nd other venues during major outdoor sports events were kept in full force and made permanent arguably the legislation pertaining to gene ral aviation security enacted to date has been viewed by many as not being as cohesive and compre hensive as legislation addressing other aviation security concerns some may also argue that comprehensive legislation pertaining to air cargo security operations and

addressing these issues th is was presumably done because the tsas regulatory propos als largely reflected the intent of the proposed legislation however because congress did not formally enact several of these specific provisions pertaining to air cargo s ecurity operations and oversight the 110th congress may be particularly interested in oversight of the tsas implementation of its air cargo security rules and its air cargo strategic plan to ensure that they meet desired objectives port and maritime security95 commission concerns and recommendations the 911 commission was not as specific in making r ecommendations for nonaviation modes of transportation as it was for aviation96 however one conclusion of the 911 commission is that transportation security resources are not being allocated to the greatest risks in cost effective way opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in maritime or surface tr ansportation than in aviation97 the 911 commission also reported that deployment of scanning technologies designed to screen containers that can be transported by plane ship truck or rail is still years away98 under strategies for aviation and transportation security the 911 commission recommended that the federal government identify and evaluate the transportation assets that need to be protected set riskbased priorities for defending them select the most practical and costeff ective ways of doing so and then develop plan budget and funding to implement the effort the commission recommended that the plan assign roles and missions to the relevant authorities federal state regional and local and to private stak eholders the commission further noted that perfection is unattainable but that terrorists should perceive that potential targets are defended in order to deter them it so recommended that congress set specific dates for the completion of these plans congressional response since september 11 2001 congress has enacted two major port

resources may not be allocated to the greatest risks in costeffective way they noted the government did not have strategic plan that analyzed assets risks and costs and benefits of security measures for the entire transportation system nor was there specific security plan for each transportation mode the commission recommended that such strategic plan be prepared to identify the assets that need

and missions to federal state regional and local government s and private stakeholders status of implementati on of the recommendations the 108th congress passed the intelligence reform nd terrorism

concerns and recommendations the 911 commission expressed its cerns and recommendations regarding critical infrastructure security in three primary areas transportation security allocation of assistance to states and localities and the adequacy of the governments plans in general to protect the nati ons critical infrastructure the commission devoted most of its attention to the trans portation infrastructure and in particular aviation security making relatively specific recommendations in specific areas eg explosive detection it also recommended that date specific be set for the department of homeland security to complete its security plans for all transportation modes as called for in the aviation and transportation security act pl 10771 in regard to the alloca tion of federal assi stance the commission recommended that the allocation to states and localities be based on an assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs49 of risks and vulnerabilities and longer remain program for general revenue sharing while much of the federal assistance to states and localities supports response capabilities some is also devoted to the protection of cr itical infrastructure in the background discussion for its fi nal recommendation the commission stated that the department of ho meland security dhs should identify those elements of the nations critical infrastructure beyond ju st the transportation sector that need protection and to develop plans to protect them it recommended that the department and its oversight committees should regularly assess the types of threats facing the nations critical infrastructure to determine the adequacy of the governments plans to protect and respond to terrorist attack on critical infrastruct ure across all relevant sectors the rest of this discussi on focuses on this last recommendation discussion of the first two areas can be found elsewhere in this report under border and transportation security and emergenc response and preparedness also more detailed discussion of the commissions recommendations related to critical infrastructure protection and the subs equent congressional response in the intelligence reform and

critical infrastructure and on the adequacy of the governments plans to protect that infrastructure and the readiness of the g overnment to respond to threats this reporting is to be done in conjunction with the repor ting requirements of the homeland security financ ial accountability act pl 108330 the homeland security financial accountability act requires the department to submit performance and accountability report for each fiscal year it also amended the requirements for the future years homela nd security program ie five year program and planning docum ent required by the homeland security act which is to be submitted to congress w ith or about the same time as the departments annual budget request vulnerability and risk assessments of critical infrastructures began shortly after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 these were pr imarily conducted by ownersoperators of the infrastructure themselves to varying degrees sometimes with the assistance of federal agencies and using variety of techniques and assumptions shortly after the department of homeland security was established the department began identifying on its own certain critical infrastructure

however that liability and indemnification concerns impeded some of the response at the pentagon and exist throughout the nation also of note the less disastrous results of the pentagon attack can be explained to large extent by target and population differencesthe jet that struck the pe ntagon occurred in relatively isolated area and directly affected just one building wher eas the jets that destroyed the world trade center towers destroyed significant part of major metropolitan area these differences alone meant that the emergency responders in new york city faced more complex task than

programs support other goals and objectives associated with preparedness and anticipating future threats numerous bills have been introduced that address infrastructure security within specific sectors some have made it into public law howeve r none address the coordination of national effort across all sectors that characterize the commissions recommendation emergency preparedness and response and the 911 commission112 commission concerns and recommendations the 911 commission report presented distin ct descriptions of the emergency response actions taken in new york city nd at the pentagon after the attacks the report described opera tional complications in manhattan that did not occur in virginia the commission found that defici encies in planning and communications around the world trade center towers contri buted to the deaths of police and fire officials as well as civilians by comparison the commission concluded that emergency response at the pentagon was gen erally effective largely because the responding agencies used standard fo rmalized incident command system and coordinated communications networks to marshal and coordinate multiple agencies113 the primary emergency preparedness and response concerns identified by the commission focused on three general deficiencies the lack of standard command procedures the lack of standard comm unications protocol and standards and insufficient emergency preparedness steps taken by the private sector according to the commission report the adoption of st andardized response procedures public safety communications standa rds and other warning system enhancements as well as increased emergency preparedness activity in the private sector would resolve these problems accordingly the co mmission recommended that congress thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33742crs52 114 four years after the attacks some of the concerns raised by the commission in the final report appeared to remain unresolved probl

facilitating the development of open architecture and voluntary sta ndards for interope rable public safety communications and warning systems 2 the resolution of liability concerns to expedite mutual aid efforts among the states 3 adoption of formalized and intergovernmental incident response comma nd system and 4 the consideration of private sector emergency preparedness standards in assessments of insurability and creditworthiness steps to be taken to resolve these gaps rested largely with administrative entities the commission also recommended cong ressional action in two resource allocation areas 1 the distribution of federal funding for fi rst responders based on risks and vulnerabilities115 and 2 the reallocation of electromagnetic radio spectrum for public safety communications purposes congressional responses the 108th congress acted upon some of the concerns and recommendations of the commission through enactment of the intelligence reform and terrorism

of which spectrum allocation was addressed by the 109th congress enactments the commissions call for the development of standards resulted in the inclusion of several provisions in the intelligence reform act first the statute addressed concerns about mutual aid agreements by authorizing federal state and local officials in the national capitol region to enter into mutual aid agreements for emergency response116 specifically the act authorizes district of columbia officials to purchase liability and indemnification insurance or self insure against claims provides that the laws of the
