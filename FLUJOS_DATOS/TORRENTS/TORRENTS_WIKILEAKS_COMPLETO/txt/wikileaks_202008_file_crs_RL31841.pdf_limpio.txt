science and industry divisionagricultural trade issues in the 108th congress introduction and overview the increasing globalization of markets including in agriculture has brought not only opportunity but also uncertainty to us farmers and ranchers rural communities and the businesses that sell to them and market their products up until 30 or 40 years ago clearer distinctions c ould be made between domestic and foreign markets for the products of agriculture nd early federal farm policy reflected this distinction farm support programs were initially developed primarily to support farm income and commodity prices throug h government spending these programs were often combined with supply mana gement measures that included import restrictions us export competitiveness and impacts on world trade relations and patterns were less impor tant considerations mounting productivity has enabled us agriculture to produce far more than needed simply to meet domestic demand whic h is relatively stable foreign markets once viewed more as an outlet for surp lus production are increasingly becoming the foundation of agricultures prosperity see us agricultural exports below robust world economy and strong demand p articularly in the developing world where consumer incomes and populations are rising suggest strong export prospects and positive farm returns conversely wh exports decline farm income suffers as occurred after 1998 when the asian financ ial crisis signaled the start of wider recession that hurt us agricultural ex ports congress subsequently provided billions of dollars in federal farm aid to bolster farm incomes even when world economic conditions are favorable us agriculture enters the global marketplace facing stiff compe tition from foreign exporting nations like canada australia argentina and brazil where production costs may be competitive with those in the united states and th european union eu and china where strong government support in the form of subsidies andor other aids also play an important and often tradedistorting role according to many analysts furthermore the eu and china along with others lik russia japan and korea have imposed what us interests consider to be unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary sps and technical measures labelin g rules segregation of imported from domestic product etc high tariffs and othe r import barriers that choke acce ss to their markets these countries are and are expected to remai n leading customers for us farm products not only bulk grains but increasingly highervalue products like meats poultry fruits and vegetables and pr ocessed food products furt hermore their views about agricultural markets influence the views of policymakers in developing countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs2 for discussion of trade protection using safeguards and adjustment issues see crs report rl31296 trade remedies and agriculture and crs report rl30610 vital wheat gluten us industry perform ance and foreign trade implica tions of section 201 quotas farm groups and agribusinesses are we ll aware that many world factors influence us agricultural exports th ey count on lawmakers and administration officials to develop and promote us tr ade policies that 1 aggressively reduce foreignimposed barriers including tari ffs nontariff barriers domestic subsidies and export subsidies to us farm produc ts 2 hold other count ries accountable for commitments they have already made in existing trade agreements 3 resolve festering agricultural disputes with major trading partners and 4 fully use usda export and food aid programs some us farm groups point out that by maintaining barriers to us imports and their own high export subsidies and inte rnal farm supports not all countries have fully honored existing trade agreements such concern has on occasion dampened us agricultures enthusiasm for entering into new trade agreements even when the united states wins case in dispute ttlement as it did in 1997 when the world trade organization wto ruled in favor of the united states that the eu cannot ban without scientific justification beef produced w ith hormones country may not comply with the decision in the beef case the united states was authorized to impose retaliatory tariffs but us beef still cannot enter the eu although us officials say more trade disputes are re solved favorably than unfavorably often through negotiation at lower levels rather than formal dispute resolution there is perception among some farmers that established international trading rules have not always worked to their benefit moreover some us producer groups p articularly those representing import sensitive commodities have pressed for continued protection of their own commodities and for more restrictions on foreign farm and food imports into the united states the us average tariff on agricultural imports 12 is much lower than the global average tariff 62 imposed on similar imports however the united states along with other developed countries restricts the entry of import sensitive agricultural products to protect certain domestic producers from foreign competition and the economic adjustments th at such imports might entail us tariffrate quotas allow zero or low duty acce ss for specified amounts of foreign beef sugar peanuts cotton tobacco and dair products imports above the quota may enter but face prohibitively high tariffs this usually makes such imports uncompetitive in the us market safeguar ds involving the temporary use of higher tariffs andor quotas allow producers of an affected commodity or product sector additional time to adjust to increased im port competition such adjustments will be more severe in areas whose production mu st compete with imported products in recent years the united states has imposed safeguards on imports of lamb meat and wheat gluten to allow us producers of those products time to adjust to foreign competition foreign trading partners argue that such efforts are illadvised because free trade must flow in all directions including into the united states in some cases other countries are using trade negotiations nd sometimes dispute settlement procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs3 in the wto to enhance their access to th us market for agricultural products or to reduce competition in thirdcountry mark ets from subsidized us production for example both the lamb and wheat gluten safeguard actions were successfully challenged by other wto member countri in wto dispute settlement and were not renewed by the united states more recently in september 2002 brazil initiated case at the wto against certain aspects of the us cotton program many developing countries are particul arly concerned about what they see as limited access to the us market for the above importsensitive and other commodities such countries also see high domestic farm supports in richer countries like the united states and eu mber states as tradedistorting and are seeking substantial reductions in such support in multilateral negotiations it is within this context of competing us agricultural interests and other countries concerns that agricultural tr ade issues are likely to be taken up in legislation congressionalexecutive branch consultations on trad negotiations or in oversight hearings during the 108th congress among the most prominent are the following which are discussed in more detail later in this report agriculture in bilateral and regional free trade agreements unique to free trade agreements ftas as illustrated by the north american free trade agreement nafta are provisions designed to fully liberalize trade eg reduce and eliminate tariffs and quotas be tween partners within an agreed upon time period provisions affecting agricultu ral trade are found in two bilateral ftas the bush administration concluded w ith chile and singapore late in 2002 agriculture also will likely prove to be contentious issue in negotiating other ftas the administration has initiated including with australia while some agricultural commodity groups and food product manufact urers welcome the market openings these agreements may provide producer s of importsensitive commodities eg sugar dairy products meats will carefu lly monitor and seek to shape those provisions that affect them the administration also has placed high priority on negotiating an agreement to remove all trade barriers within the western hemisphere the free trade area of the americas ftaa is intended to go beyond nafta to encompass all trade and services among all of the regions countries except cuba and eventually supersede both nafta and regional tradin g agreements including the free trade agreement the united states has just negotiated with chile and the fta being negotiated with central america crafting rules for liberalizing agricultural trade and negotiating the fine tails among the regions 34 countries by 2005 will be difficult and contentious agricultural negotiations in the world trade organization t h united states is engaged in new round of mu ltilateral trade negotiations one of whose aims is further liberalization of global agricultural trade according to the declaration agreeing to new trade r ound the objectives for agriculture are to substantially improve market access for agricultural products reduce and phase out export subsidies and substa ntially reduce tradedistor ting domestic support most us agricultural interest groups s upport the inclusion of agriculture in broader multilateral trade round these groups believe that tradeoffs possible in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs4 comprehensive negotiation would result in improved market prospects for us agricultural exports others such as producers of importsensitive crops who feel disadvantaged by previous trade agreements eg nafta or threatened by possible new agreements are not as thusiastic about us partic ipation in new round the agricultural negotiations have important implications for farm bill programs that provide price and income support to farm ers and for export and food aid programs there are also important differences in negotiating positions among wto member countries especially between the united st ates and the european union and between those two wto members and the developing countries biotechnology and agricultural trade differences between the united states and its trading partners over gene tically engineered ge crops and food products that contain or are derived from th em pose potential threat to and in some instances have already disrupted us agricultural trade corn and soybean exports are the most seriously threatened crops underlying the conflicts are pronounced differences reflected in consumer attitudes and regulatory systems between the united states and several im portant trading partners bout ge products and their potential health and nvironmental effects china and us agriculture there is mounting concern from us producer groups administration officials and other tr ading partners that china has been slow to implement only partially implemented or in some instances has failed to comply with agricultural trade commitments made under recent inte rnational trade agreements the speed and manner with which china implements its trade commitments are critical to the development of uschina agricultural trade while us agriculture and trade officials have been working to resolve these differences progress has been slow countryoforigin labeling the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 soon will require many food stores to provide countryoforigin labeling cool on fresh fruits vegetables red meats seafood and peanuts proponents of cool argue that us consumers have right to know the or igin of their food pa rticularly during period when food imports are increasing and will continue to increase under both existing and future trade agreements and wh there are concerns about food safety critics of the new law however argue th at such labeling does not increase public health protection by telling consumers which foods are safer than others all food imports already must meet equivalent us food safety standards which are enforced vigorously by us officials at the borde r and overseas scien tific principles not geography must be the arbiter of safety they add some critics are urging the 108th congress to revisit the new labeling law on the grounds that implementation will be extremely costly and hinder rather than help us producers competitive advantage proponents maintain that the expected bene fits to us farmers ranchers and consumers will outweigh implementation and compliance costs agricultural exports to cuba us policy is to exempt commercial sales of agricultural and medical products from us unilateral sanctions imposed on foreign countries subject to specified conditions and prohi bitions debate continues though among policymakers on the scope of restrictions that should apply to agricultural sales to cubahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs5 bilateral trade disputes the united states is engaged in variety of trade disputes involving individu countries the outcome of number of these could prove critical to future application nd recognition of wto farm subsidy rules dispute settlement procedures and other world trade issues of importance to us agriculture among the disputes are wto case instituted in september 2002 by brazil against certain aspects of the us cotton program subsequent consultations between the united states and brazil in december and january failed to resolve the di spute continuation of the wto dispute settlement process could lead to final panel decision for or against the complaining country resolution of the case in brazils favor could result in wto recommendations concerning implementation of us cotton program provisions noncompliance with such provisions on the part of the united states could result in compensation or possible limited trade sanctions us complaint that canadian wheat trading practices particularly the export practices of the canadian wheat board cwb are inconsistent with canadas wto obligations and disadvantage us wheat exporters in canadian and international markets canada maintains that canadian import practices and the cwb wheat export practices comply fully with international trade rules and its wto obligations succe ssful resolution of this dispute in favor of the united states could result in greater competitiveness for us wheat visavis canadian wheat in international markets and in us wheat having improved access to the canadian market import barriers by russia mexic the eu and japan affecting us

declined by 40 to 263 billion by fy1986 decade later exports had recovered and reached new peak of nearly 60 billion fy1996 but then began decline that dipped to 49 billion by fy1999 main reasons for the decline were continuing fina ncial turmoil in east and southeast asian markets and increased competition for corn wheat and soybeans in global markets exports since then have recovered rising to

2002 us agricultural exports to th 14 fta candidate countries including chile and singapore totaled 50 billion nd accounted fo r almost 9 of all us agricultural exports half of these sales we re to the five centra l american countries growing us market combined us agricultural imports from these 14 countries totaled 52 billion and represented over 12 of all agricultural imports imports from the central american ca ndidates totaled 19 billion mor than one third of the import value entering from all fta candidate s the largest single country supplier was australia selling 19 billion in farm goods followed by chile 12 billion chile in the chile fta negotiating the agricultural provisions especially the terms of market access for sensitive farm products and the app lication of some sps rules proved to be among the most conten tious issues these were resolved when top trade officials from both countries became involved in the process to bring the negotiations to conclusion both the ited states and chile agreed to phase out tariffs n the primary means of border protection n on substantial portion of agricultural products traded between them by 2007 but compromised to adopt 12year transition period before each ma rket is fully open to importsensitive products entering from the other country the market access provisions will apply to all traded merchandise n agricultural product is excluded the agreement eliminates the use of export subsidies on agricultural trade between both countries but allows the united states to respond if third countries use subsidies to displace us products in the chilean market it also includes an agricultural safeguard provision sought by the united states to protect agricultural producers from sudden surges in chilean imports both sides also have committed to resolve outstandinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs9 sps issues that have for example limited us sales of meat products and some fruits to chile the us trade representative ustr states the ftas provisions will grant dutyfree status to more than 75 of us agricultural exports valued at 111 million in 2002 to chile within 4 years ch treatment will apply to us pork and products beef and products soybeans and soybean meal durum wheat feed grains potatoes and processed food products ie french fries pa sta distilled spirits and breakfast cereals chilean tariffs on all other products will be phased out within 12 years the agreement requires chile to phase out with respect to imports from the united states its priceband system designed to protect domesticallyproduced wheat wheat flour vegetable oils and sugar chile also committed to recognizing the us meat grading system allowing for the sale of us beef and pork products with the usda prime and choice labe ls in that market chile views improved market access for its agricultural products to the large and growing us market as important to its economic growth because agricultural exports 12 billion in 2002 represent about one third of chiles total exports to the united states its negotiators sought immediate reductions in us tariffs on horticultural and other products as well as changes in how us antidumping and countervailing rules are app lied us producers of apricots mushrooms cling peaches fruit juices and other horticultura l products however asked to be excluded from the ftas coverage or sought long transition periods before tariffs on their products were eliminated according to chiles foreign minister the agreement grants 95 of chiles exports dutyfree status to the us market within four years with wine an important chilean export chile agreed to reduce its tariff on wine imports to the lower us level after which both countries will eliminate tariffs on wine negotiating chiles terms of acce ss for agricultural products viewed as sensitive by some segments of us agriculture reportedly were difficult to conclude details that took time to resolve in creating tariffrate quotas trqs for dairy sugar and horticultura l products were the size of each quota the pace at which the overquota tariff rate is phased out the growth rate for each quota created and whether the withinquota tariff would be low or zero access for sugar reportedly will depend on chile now sugar importe r becoming net exporter ie produces surplus available for export negotiations on sps barriers proceeded along track parallel to the market access talks but the fta agreement appears to leave them unresolved with us exporters having faced sps obstacles in r ecent years in selling pork beef dairy and poultry products and certain fruit to the ch ilean market the united states pressed to resolve outstanding sps issues so that they would not affect us exporters access to the chilean market once the fta takes effect negotiators apparently did not resolve sps issues relating to us beef and pork exports the final text reportedly does not include language sought by the united states that chile would accept the us meat inspection system as equivalent to its own us trade officials indicated last december that the administration will not submit the fta to congress for approval until chile accepts the us position the privatesector agricultural policy advisory committee apac on february 28 20 03 reported to ustr that the fta with chile will improve ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs10 exports of agricultural products by ope ning the chilean market and providing reciprocal access for us pr oducts nd provides sensible timetable for the elimination of agricultural tariffs for im port sensitive products including gradual phase out of tariffs and an import safeguard some of the commodity advisory committees though in their separate reports raised concerns about some provisions of the fta they complained for example that not being provided with the text of the agreement by ustr hampered their ability to assess potential impacts singapore being primarily urba n this city state produces little of its own food reflecting this its tariffs applied on imported agricultural commodities and food products except for beer wine and spirits are currently zero us agricultural and food exports in 2002 totaled 240 million compared to 56 million in similar imports top us agricultural exports were fruit and relate d products vegetables and related products cooking oils snack foods nd poultry meat purchases of cocoa paste and butter snack foods rubbe r and related products and spices from singapore accounted for more than half of agricultural imports because singapore is major shipping hub some us commodity groups sought the inclusion of rules of origin in the fta to prohibit dutyfree treatment of food products transhipped through its t from neighboring agricultural producing countries in southeast as ia the apac reported to ustr on february 26 2003 that the agreements rules of origin will protect us producers from imports of ineligible products from thir d countries through singapore the majority on the sweeteners and related produc ts advisory committee however raised concerns about whether these rules are written in such wa to prevent access to the us market for sugarcontaining products shipped from sing apore apacs re port further stated that this fta achieves us negotiating objectives of eliminating tariffs and securing market opportunities by permanently

the free trade agreement the united states has just negotiated with chile and the fta being negotiated with central america crafting rules for liberalizing agricultural trade and negotiating the fine

centra l america and the carribean were 4457 billion or 84 of us global farm produc t sales in 2002 commodity and food imports from these three regions by contrast accounted for 6814 billion nearly 17

december 2005 they further committed to make the negotiating process more transparent and accessible trade officials reached agreement on the modalities formulas targets or schedules to be followed for making tariff reductions in august 2002 they agreed that all countries except caricom members comprising most caribbean islands belize in central america and guyana and suriname in s outh america could start tariff cuts from current applied rates rather than from the higher bound rates that all wto members adopted in the last mu ltilateral negotiating round ca ricom countries will be allowed to identify those agricultural and other products where the maximum bound rate could be used as the reference point for reducing tariffs the november 1 2002 meeting of trade ministers in ecuador finalized the negotiating pace and process to be followed over the 20032004 period these final stages of the ftaa negotiations are being cochaired by brazil and the ited states all ftaa countries met the february 15 2003 deadline for presenting th eir initial tariff reduction offers each country will respond to these in the form of market access requests due by june 15 2003 revised offers would then fo llow this requestoffer process ustrs ambassador zoellic k on february 11 2003 laid out the scope of the us tariff reduction offer on agricultural nd other products in unveiling this offer he said that the united states is prep ared to grant immediate dutyfree access on 56 of the agricultural products that ter from nonnafta countries once thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs13 agreement takes effect on politicallys ensitive farm products ambassador zoellick stated that the united states proposes to eliminate tariffs with specific timetables that would differ between countries or regional groups transition periods could be 5 or 10 years or even longer depending upon countrys size and its level of economic development and the type of agricultu ral product ambassa dor zoellick indicated all agricultural products are on the ta ble and subject to negotiation ie exclusions and that the united states will move forward with other countries willing to take the same position hemispheric free trade in agriculture by about 2020 is envisi oned if negotiators reach agreement on an ftaa in 2005 th agricultural component of the ftaa negotiating process though could become problematic once negotiators begin to apply negotiating modalities to specifi c commodities and f ood pr oducts that each country historically has pr otected some latin ameri can countries particularly brazil seek increased access to the us market for competitive products such as beef citrus and sugar us commodity groups and agribusiness seek additional openings for their products in the rapidly gr owing latin american market they also seek legal assurances that all countries will abide by sanitary and phytosanitary sps rules with respect to agricultural imports though the united states will emphasize eliminating tariffs and other barriers to agricultural trad brazil and other countries have signaled they want the negotiating agenda to also address the issue of domestic agricultural support ie farm price and income support they have suggested linking reductions in their higher tariffs to concession by the united states on the domestic support issue the united states

november 2001 trade ministers agreed on declaration to begin new round of multilate ral trade negotiations mtns including negotiations on agriculture this new round because of its emphasis on inte

incorporates those negotiations into comprehensive multilateral trade negotiati on and begins second pha of negotiations on agriculture for agriculture the doha ministerial declaration states that building on the work carried out to date in the sectoral negotiations and without prejudging the outcome of the negotiations we commit ourselves to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in ma rket access reductions of with view to phasing out all forms of export subsidie s and substantial reductions in trade distorting domestic support the declaration also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countri shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations the declaration takes note of nontrade concerns reflected in negotiating

colored box categories green box programs are publicly funded programs fi nanced by direct outlays or foregone revenue that do not involve transfer from cons umers or have the effect of providing price support to producers examples of green box programs are research programs decoupled income support such as us direct payments to producer that are not contingent on any production environmental program payments ch as the conservation reserve program or disaster assistance wto disciplines or reductions apply to green box programs blue box program are direct payments made under production limiting program the eu is the primary user of blue box program ma king direct payments to producers for example based on fixed areas or yields or fixed num ber of livestock there are currently us blue box programs blue box programs also are not subject to reduction commitments amber box programs are payments that are contingent on participation in agricultural production ie producing crop or raising livestock qualify farmer for government payments us amber box programs include pr ice supports for dairy sugar and peanuts and loan deficiency payments or marketing loan and loan deficiency payments eu amber box payments include socalled intervention buying of farm products at prices administratively continuedduring 2002 wto member countries di scussed the issues of market access export competition and domestic support the united states the cairns group of agricultural exporting countries the european union eu japan and several developing countries submitte d negotiating proposals during 2002 the dda called for reaching an agreement by ma rch 31 2003 on modalities eg formulas targets timetables for achieving the objectives mandated by the doha declaration but that deadline was missed now negotiations on modalities will continue but probably not be completed until the september wto ministerial conference scheduled for septembe r 2003 in cancun mexico negotiating modalities has not been easy member countries differ sharply in their choice of modalities for example some want to reduce high tariffs more rapidly than lower tariffs while others will want to protect sensitive products by slowing the pace of tariff reduction similarl some want rapid reductions in export or domestic subsidies while others will want longer timetables for reductions once an agreement on modalities is r eached wto member countries would begin to negotiate individual c ountry schedules or lists of commitments the us position first tabled in june 2000 and amplified in july 2002 proposal includes the elimination of agri cultural export subsidies substantial reductions in tariffs with country s individual tariff exceeding 25 20 increases in tariffrate quotas on agricultu ral imports disciplines on state trading enterprises and reductions in amber box spending trade distorting domestic support to more than 5 of the value of each countrys total agricultural production the objective

prices in cont rast to green and blue box programs amber box payments are subject to wto reduction commitments phased in over 5 years ultimately according to the us proposal tariffs and domestic support also would be eliminate d the cairns group proposal which is strongly supportive of the u s positi on also calls fo r deep cuts in tariffs and domestic support and th elimination of export subsidies many in congress have expressed support for the us negotiatin g proposal but have made their support contingent on reduction and harmonization of tariffs and subsidies by other wto members especially the eu in sharp contrast to the us position the eu calls for applying formulas used in uruguay round agriculture negotiations 19861994 as modalities such an approach would yield progressive reduc tions in tariffs and subsidies but not harmonization or elimination the eu also s conditioned its support for export subsidy reduction on negotiating disciplines for export credit pr ograms and food aid programs the eu negotiating proposal along with those of japan and korea place greater emphasis on socalled nontrade concerns like protecting the environment animal welfare and rural development those wto members are seeking exemptions from wto reduction commitments and disciplines for s ubsidies provided to promote such non trade concerns the us position is sile nt on nontrade concerns but us trade negotiators express fears that payments to producers to promote nontrade concerns would be disguised tradedistorting measures some suggest that the success of the agriculture negotiations depends on the pace of agricultural policy reform in the eu and the united states recent agreement between france and germany to maintain eu domestic farm support at current levels and postpone any reductions in support until after 2007 may make it more difficult for the eu to agree to agricultural trade reform s in the current round in the eu efforts to reform its common agricultural polic face considerable opposition from several eu member states these reforms which include substantial decoupling of income support from production and reduc tions in price supports c ould if adopt ed facilitate the eus ability to accept cuts in tradedi storting domestic suppor t or the elimination of export subsidies in the united states the president on may 13 2002 signed into law farm bill pl 107171 to replace the 1996 federal ag ricultural improvement and reform or fair act that many critic s say could raise tradedi storting domestic support above us wto commitments to reduce such spending and also undermine the us position in the new round however the farm bill stipulates that the secretary shall to the maximum extent possible make adjustments in us farm subsidies to ensure that it does not exceed levels allowabl under the wto agreement on agriculture moreover us trade officials insist that the united states has not wavered from its negotiating objective of securing substantial reductions in domestic subsidies including us subsidies that distort trad and that congressional support for the us negotiating proposal remains strong

large and diverse group with many different position on negotiating issues but many pecially those that are exporters of agricultural products have targeted both us and eu subsidies for elimination in the negotiations while devel oping countries are seeking substantial reductions in agricultural tariffs of devel oped countries they are resist ant to the idea of reciprocal tariff reductions preferring instead to be accorded special and differential treatment which would entail maintaining tariffs or phasing them down over lengthy time periods to facilitate the process of reaching agreement on modalities the chairman of the agriculture negotiating group stuart rbinson issued on fe bruary 17 2003 and revised slightly on march 20 2003 draf t paper with various proposals for modalities harbinsons modalities report attempted to steer middle course between the us and eu negotiating positions while according special and differential treatment to veloping countries chairm an harbinsons report dealt with the three socalled pillars of the ag riculture negotiations market access export competition and domestic support on mark et access he proposed that for tariffs greater than 90 ad valorem the simple average would be reduced by 60 subject to minimum cut of 45 per tariff line for agricultural tariffs lower than or equal to 90 but greater than 15 the simple aver age reduction would be 50 subject to minimum cut of 35 per tariff line and for all agricultural tariffs lower than or equal to 15 the simple average reduction woul d be 40 subject to minimum cut of 25 per tariff line on export competition harbinsons m odalities report recomme nds that export subsidies be eliminated over tenyear period export credit and food aid programs would also be covered by new rules repayment terms for export credits would be limited to maximum of six months but veloping countries would be allowed longer repayment periods only gran t food aid would be permitted under the harbinson recommendations however f ood aid provided in kind for development projects could be provided through united nations food agencies or food agency projects operated by nongovern mental or charitable organizations on domestic support the modalities repor t calls for 60 reduction in trade distorting or amber box support the repor t also suggested that tradedistorting support tied to production limits blue box support used primarily by the eu be capped and then reduced by 50 over five years the modalities report also included an option for eliminating the blue box altogether by including it in the amber box category and subjecting it to 60 reduction while us trade negotiators indicated they considered the modalities report as reference point for further negotiations they were highly critical of specific proposals at meeting of wto trade min isters in tokyo february 1416 where draft of the report was cons idered the united states nd the cairns group said the recommendations fell far short of their earlier proposals us criticisms among others were that the market access provisions did not result in harmonization of tariffhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs18 levels and that the application of the harbinson approach would still leave very high tariffs on many products especially meat products while the us trade officials welcomed the elimination of export subsidies they noted that the tenyear phaseout schedule should be considerably shortened according to us participants in the tokyo meeting reduction proposals for am ber box support would enable the eu to maintain tradedistorting blue box payments and to continue to provide considerably more tradedistorting amber box support than could the united states us amber box support is capped at 19 billion annually while the eus is capped at 67 billion under the harbinson proposal us ambe r box support would fall to around 8 billion per year while the eus would be capped at 27 billion per year not only the administration but many in congress reacted negatively to the harbinson proposals for the agriculture trad negotiations par ticular concern was that the harbinson proposal for 60 re duction in tradedistorting or amber box support did not level the playing field between the united states and the eu permitted eu trade distorting subsidies woul d still be more than three times the level of permitted us subsidies also in the 2002 trade act congress had made preserving export credit guarantee programs major negotiating objective the harbinson proposals for tightening export cr edit program disciplines are thus likely to come under intense c ongressional scrutiny the eu also reacted negatively to the rbinson proposals in the eu view they were unbalanced and placed most of the burden of adjustment on the eu the eu was particularly concerned that with the exception of adding animal welfare subsidies to the category of nontrade distorting or green box subsidies the harbinson report ignored nontrade concerns the eu criticiz ed the reports call for the elimination of export subsidies without similarly disciplin ing export credit programs such as us export credit guarantees eu officials argued also that blue box subsidies are less trade distorting than amber box support and should not be subject to the same reduction requirements as amber box support missing the deadline for agreeing to modalities some observers suggest indicates that the agriculture negotiations are stalled with neither side prepared to compromise some even suggest that the inability to agree on way forward for agriculture imperils the entire doha round however both us and eu negotiators are maintaining that an agreement on moda lities can be reached by the time of the cancun ministerial and that the missed d eadline though serious will not forestall concluding the round by january 1 2005 role of congress congress would take up any agreements th at results from the doha

acceptable thus minimizing commercial risks from producing and exporting ge crops us regulations for ge foods have facilitated their in troduction into us agriculture and food processing the pr

encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease critics of the new law however argue th at such labeling does not increase public health protection by telling consumers which foods are sa fer than others all food imports already must meet equivalent us food safety standards which are enforced vigorously by us officials at the borde r and overseas in fact they note several serious outbreaks of food borne illness in recent ears have been linked to contaminants in perishable agricultural commodities produced in the united states including the bacteria coli 0157h7 and salmonella scientific principles not geography must be the arb iter of safety they add so critics are urging the 108th congress to revisit the new labeling law partly on the grounds that implementation will be costly and hinder rather than he lp us producers competitive advantage proponents maintain that the expected bene fits to us farmers ranchers and consumers will outweigh implementation and compliance costs background and

requirements to ground and muscle cuts of beef lamb and pork farmraised and wild seafood pea nuts and fresh and fresh frozen fruits and vegetables which were among the raw agricultural products generally exempt from the existing cool requirements starting september 30 2004 supermarkets and many other food stores must inform consumers of these products country of origin by means of label stamp mark placard or other clear and visible sign on the covered commodity or on the package disp lay holding unit or bin containing the commodity at the final point of sale to consumers the law

agricultural marketing service ams issued guidelines for the prescribed voluntary phase of cool on october 8 2002 rulemaking on the mandatory phase is scheduled to begin in april 2003 the voluntary guidelines have reignited debate over number of policy issues among them will cool provide usraise d products with competitive advantage over foreign products b ecause us consumers can more easily identify and choose fresh foods of domestic origin or will industry including onfarm compliance costs outweigh any potential benefits particularly for beef lamb and pork producers competing with poultry whose products are not subject to cool as the ams voluntary guidelines imply will every person whoprepares stores distributes or supplies the covered commodities for retail sale extending back to the farm or ranch have to maintain detailed records and even track th identity of each animal or plant from birth harvest through retail sale because they might be criminally or at least contractua lly liable for noncompliance or will recordkeeping be far less onerous partly because modern production and marketing methods ready incorporate many aspects of this information is the ams preliminary estimate of recordkeeping costs at 2 billion in the first year evidence of hug burden industry is facing or as some critics suggest an insufficient burden or are the figures grossly exaggerated as cool supporters believe is the new cool law deliberately intended to increase costs for importers thereby undermining u s efforts to break down other countries trade barriers and violating existing us trade obligations or is it simply exte nding to raw products the same us requirements that almost all othe r imported consumer products from automobiles to most other foods ready must meet and that many foreign countries themselves now impose on food and farm products to what extent is cool compar able to eu proposals for mandatory labeling of ge products role of congress some food industry and producer trade associations are calling for re examination of the new cool requirement s and its impacts on industry costs and competitiveness few have suggested that the law should be changed or even repealed as of early march 2003 such legislation had been introduced some observers anticipate that congress will at least be asked to hold hearings on the matter at the same time those who pressed

until political and economic reforms are attained in the compromise adopted by conferees opponents succeeded in inserting the permanent restrictive provisions that apply uniquely to cuba cuban officials initially stated that purchases would be made under tsras conditions however food stock losses due to devastation cau sed by hurricane in late 2001 prompted reversal this development and

the first formal challenge to the protection otherwise afforded domestic commodity support pr ograms under the peace clause provision see below of the wto agreement on agriculture background and analysis brazil argues that the united states is supplying domestic and export subsidies to its cotton sector in excess of its wto commitments that the subsidies provided to us cotton growers have led to signifi cant overproduction and huge increase in us cotton exports and that the larger world cotton supplies have contributed to steep decline in world cotton prices and have caused serious injury to brazilian cotton exporters us trade officials argue that the subsidies provided to us cotton growers have been within the allowable wto limits and are consistent with wto obligations the key to brazils case against us domestic cotton subsidies is its argument that the united states is longer ex empt from wto dispute proceedings under article xiii the socalled p eace clause of the wtos agreement on agriculture article xiiib exempts domestic s upport measures that comply with the agreement on agricultures requirements from being challenged as illegal subsidies through dispute settlement pro ceedings as long as the level of support for commodity remains at or below the benchmark 1992 levels brazil argues that us cotton subsidies were about 2 billion in 1992 other sources suggest figure closer to 19 billion compared with over 4 billion in 2001 brazil also argues that both the step2 provisions of the us cotton program and the favorable terms provi ded under us export credit pr ograms function as export subsidies and are inconsistent with us wto obligations regarding export subsidies step 2 payments are made to us cotton users and exporters when us cotton prices are higher than world prices the united states notifies to the wto any step2 payments as amber box trade distor ting domestic support payments and not ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31841crs33 export subsidies us trade officials also contend that us export credit program operations are consistent with wto obligations us trade officials argue that the immunity granted by the peace clause is important however and that even if count ry is longer in compliance with the peace clause it is still incumbent on the co mplaining party to prove there has been injury brazil claims that injury to

ship much more sugar duty free to the us market than allowed to enter in earlier years these negotiations faltered as us and mexican negotiators disagreed over just how much sugar mexico actually could ship north their disagreement centered on which version of nafta governed this issue us negotiators based their position on the sugar side letter struck in last minute talks between the us trade

concluded in august 1992 and signed by each countrys president that december relatedly the nafta and wto dispute panels issued successive decisions questioning the process mexico followed to impose its hfcs duties and called for changes mexico did not respond until april 2002 when it announced it would replace its antidumping duties with quota on hfcs imports equal in quantity to the us quota for mexican sugar legislation passed by mexicos congre ss on january 1 2002 and still in effect imposed tax on soft drinks containing co rn syrup but not sugar this law has eliminated much of the

mexicos interest in reaching an agreement in the short term has diminished due to the small quantity of mexican sugar available for export this year and the political dynamics associated with upcoming
