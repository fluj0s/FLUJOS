plications for us trade policy summary mercosur is the common market of the south established by brazil argentina uruguay and paraguay in 1991 to prom ote economic integration and political cooperation among the four countries ce then mercosur has struggled to achieve deep economic integration but has maintained coope rative economic and political framework which has also become an influential voice in determining the fate of the hemispheres regional integration initiatives in particular the us vision for hemispheric integration the free trade area of the americas ftaa has stalled largely because of opposition from within rcosur which in turn has focused on its own albeit limited expansion the mercosur pact calls fo r an incremental path to full integration but after 15 years only limited customs union has been achieved from the outset mercosur struggled to reconcile basic inconsistenc in pact of partial economic union how to achieve economic integra tion while also ensuring that the benefits would be balanced among members and that each c ountry would retain some control over its trade production and consumption stru cture this delicate balance faced overcoming serious structural and policy asymmetries that became clear when brazil and argentina experienced financial crises and deep recessions these economic setbacks disrupted trade flows among mbers causing fric tion the doption of protectionist measures and retreat from the commitment to deeper economic integration for now mercosur has turned to expanding rather than deepening the agreement many south american countries have been added as associate members and mercosur has reached out for other southsouth arrangements in africa and asia all limited agreements nd unlikely paths to continental economic integration internal conflic ts have highlighted mercos urs institutional weaknesses and slowed the integration process on july 4 2006 venezuela signed an accession agreement to become its first new full member making mercosur the undisputed economic counterweight to ited states in the region but raising questions about how venezuelas membership may shift regional political and trade dynamics it appears that mercosur has opted to emphasize its expansion both in the region and with other developing countries over agreements with its largest developed country trade partners looking to the world trade organization wto as the preferred alternative for achieving many of its trade policy goals nonetheless us mercosur commercial and economic ties ar expanding and the united states is pursuing deeper bilateral trade relations with uruguay that could provide new ideas for broader integration commitment the alternative may be for mercosur and the united states to expand their mutually exclusive bilateral agreements increasing the potential for overlapping trading systems which few if any view as either economically or administratively

institutional development mercosur evolved from series of 1980s bilateral agreements between brazil and argentina it was conceived as way to foster new levels of political and economic openness and c ooperation following prolonged period of mutual distrust much of it taking place under military dictat orships in both countries in addition as the south american economies moved away from an import substitution model of development to one based increasin gly on trade openness regional trade agreement made sense given the four countries were natural trade partners sharing geographical cultural and economic complementarities4 in fact uruguay and paraguay pressed hard to expand the rrangement to fourcountry common market to improve their trade prospects or at the least ensure that they would not be isolated by bilateral economic pact be tween their two largest neighbors5 mercosur therefore evolved from economic and political circumstances that emphasized the need to preserve and enhance the brazilargentine bilateral relationship while fostering cautious ambitions for subregional economic integration that could also serve as platform for the four countries insertion into the global economy ultimately as one sc holar has observed meeting expectations is critical and mercosurs success rests on the provision of consistent reciprocal market access and framework for coope ration that

free trade agreement fta model that tends to be comprehensive for example mercosur adopted as basic tenets gradualism flexibility and balance and allows for the negotiated accession of other countries8 mercosur followed an incremental path to common market beginning with transition period 199195 in which it operated as an increasingly comprehensive free trade agreement fta based on sche dule of automatic tariff reductions the formal jump to common market was made on january 1 1995 but in reality mercosur became and remains only partial customs union9 it adopted common trade policy and schedule of common exte rnal tariffs cets that applies to 80 of tariff line items but with some very important exceptions for sensitive sectors such as sugar automobiles capital goods computers and other technology products the exceptions were to be phased out by 2006 but many have been extended to 2011 requiring set of co mplex rules of origin10 in addition there are weaknesses with th cet core requirement of true customs union the cet can be levied twice first when good initially enters mercosur country and again if it crosses into another mber country between the double taxation and multiple exceptions probl ems resolving application and uniform enforcement of the cet remains an im portant unaddressed issue the double taxation issue is particular problem for paraguay which will suffer significant revenue losses without some type of comprehensive customs revenue sharing plan because most goods enter the mercosur area through one of the other three countries11 the incompleteness of the customs union fosters asymmetry issues discussed below that are at the root of mercosur discontent and that also suggest that the achievement of full common market remains distant if not illusory goalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33620crs5 12 for details on the legal documents see porratadoria mercosur the common market of the southern cone 13 latin american weekly report

macroeconomic policy coordination and harmonization of policy legi slation at the sectoral level eg energy agriculture industry technology some macroeconomic policies such as exchange rates have been

challenge especially between brazil and argentina as does crossborde r movement of goods both within mercosur and to third country markets all parties were required to accept common set of rights and obligations article 2 with little allowance for special and differential treatment for smaller economies there were many followon prot ocols among the most important was the december 17 1994 protocol of ouro pr eto which formally established the common market and extended the instituti onal framework accordingly mercosur adopted democratic commitme nt clause in 1996 and ther were two protocols that clarified and expanded the dispute settlement process the last being the olivos protocol signed on february 18 2002 and implemented two years later12 dispute settlement however is largely unenforceable and reflects continuing problem of mercosurs institutional effectiveness three more recent developments call into question mercosurs functional institutional capacity first is the expansion of its membership venezuela signed an accession agreement on july 4 2006 dis cussed in detail below but has been reticent to take on all commitments of the customs union especially the cet in december 2006 bolivia also requested to upg rade its status from associate to full member although it is reluctant to re linquish its membership in the andean community of nations comunidad andi na

full member country and has as its primary goal to work toward harmonization of national laws and po licies but it has authority over national government bodies13 already point of contention it has come under criticism for being either too weak to be meaningful or risking unequal national representation relative to the participating countries populati on in either case it is viewed by some as

trade asymmetries within the pact15 intramercosur trade and internal dynamics intramercosur trade relati ons have had an uneven nd at times troubled history combination of internal policy contradictions diminishing expectations and hostile external economic environment in the late 1990s resulte d in uneven trade benefits and recurring recriminations ag ainst the incomplete customs union the return of highly beneficial global economic environment has alleviated some friction but has not eliminated the need to make policy adjustme nts or to address concerns raised by the two smallest members of mercosur these issues again collectively point to consistent criticism of mercosur its weak institutions and incomplete integration t oo frequently decision making is the product of political agreement often on bilateral basis rather than rulesbased blocwide determination this ad hoc approach to process generate s much of the conflict within the customs union raising questions about the level of commitment to completing the quadrilateral economic integration scheme16 intramercosur trade trends as mercosur lowered tariffs intramercosur trade was expected to grow relative to trade with thirdparty countries as seen in figure 2 this was the initial response from 1991 to 1998 with the jump in intrame rcosur exports also due to its growth from an initially small base other economic reforms and the decades lengthy global economic expansion there is however an equally evident sudden collapse of intra mercosur exports which fe ll from 25 of total trade in 1998 to 11 in

while retaining some semb lance of national control over trade production and consumption structure natural or structural asymmetries are at the heart of the problem given the pact integrates four economies with huge disc repancies in size structure resource endowment and level of development in addition to the absolute differences in size relative differences can fluctuate widely over time for example the size of argentinas economy gdp tends to be half that of brazils yet this metric has ranged from high of 60 in 1992 to low of 22 in 2002 because of dramatic shifts in relative economic performance in this case punctuated by the prolonged recession and financ ial crisis in argentina19 these structural differen ces can be compounded by policy asymmetries that arise from incongruities in fiscal monetary industrial exchange rate and other policies either type of asymmetry can dramatically alter commercial flows causing large trade imbalances that can threaten the stability of intramercosur relations as seen in figure 2 when they operate in tandem the mercosur policy adjustment19901991 19921993 19941995 19961997 19981999 20002001 20022003 20042005 20062007510152025 mercosur

be vul nerable particularly at times when the countries face external economic shocks20 such confluence of events occurred in the 1990s following series of global shocks that spilled over into mercosur th july 1997 asian financial crisis was the first shock followed by the russian default in the summer of 1998 these crises directly affected investor confidence in br azil causing extensive capital flight in the fall of 1998 which in turn led to brazils steep currency devaluation in january 1999 and the abandonment of its fixed exchan ge rate stabilization program with argentinas strict dollar convertib ility reg ime still in pl ace at the time the two countries faced significan t exchange rate policy asymmetry that altered trade patterns the sudden trade imbalance wa s compounded by argentinas lengthy recession that also began in 1998 leading to its own far more serious financial crisis argentinas crisis led to the ab andonment of its fixed exchange rate regime in december 2001 and subsequent sovereign debt default mercosurs leaders aware of macroeconomic weaknesses exposed by these crises proposed mercosur relaunch prog ram as early as may 2000 it formally reaffirmed commitment to deeper integr ation but the relaunch enthusiasm soon faded as it proved unable to ove rcome the effects of the financial crises including the spread of recession to uruguay and paraguay and the dramatic fall in trade between argentina and brazil 90 of intr amercosur commercial exchange21 i n t r mercosur relations became increasingly strained with argentina applying temporary restrictions on brazilian imports further reducing trade and diminishing incentives for deeper economic integration by 2002 the mercosur economies had ll hit bottom and began to rebound as reflected in intramercosur trade problems with intrabloc trade imbalances however remained as the data in appendix 2 demonstrate all four countries show linear increase in intra and extramercosur trade and with the exception of paraguay expanding trade surpluses in their extramercosur trade relations core issue remaining is the persistent and grow ing trade deficits that each country runs with brazil related cern involves the accumulating tr ade deficits that paraguay and uruguay have with argentina asymmetries country perspectives the specific asymmetry issues discussed above manifest differently for each country two commonly cited threads are the expanding trade deficit with brazil particularly since the region be gan its economic recovery see appendix 2 and unequal investment and trade in industrial goods brazil is seen as the undisputed winner on both counts and is the most arde nt supporter of mercosur for political as well as economic reasons interestingly it is also the least trade dependent member of mercosur with total merc osur trade amounting to more than 10 of its worldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33620crs9 22 see idb mercosur report 12 p 37 for discussion of the specific rule

intr amercosur trade accounts for 2530 of argentine trade the two smaller countries are even mo re dependent on their larger neighbors markets but mercosur has fallen to only 38 of their total exports down from recent highs of 59 for uruguay and 41 for guay this trend may suggest that both countries are reacting to perceived in equalities and struct ural impediments by diversifying their trad outside of mercosur both paraguay and urugua have made numerous formal proposals to solve the asymmetry issue to date some changes in rules and other t echnical requirements have been made to improve trade opportunities for the small countries22 the most salient development was creation of th structural converg ence fund wh ich has been slow in becoming operational and s only approved its first projects in 2007 so far the asymmetries issue has not been resolved and remains major challenge to the longterm success of mercosur argentina argentina has numerous trade di sputes with brazil heightened since the postcrisis period when it began to run large trade deficits with brazil see data in appendix 2 the structure of these deficits were particular problem because they were weighted toward hi gh valueadded industr ial goods competing directly with argentinas plans to restart its own industrial sector23 the imbalance became increasingly severe argentine ex ports fell from 14 of brazilian imports in 1998 to 9 in 2007 brazilian exports in contrast rose from 22 to 33 of argentine imports the growing imbalance resulted from numerous factors 1 new exchange rate equilibriums that favored br azilian goods in the argentine market over us and european products 2 post recession jump in argentine aggregate demand 3 brazils export promotion po licy emphasizing greater use of domestic inputs and structural factors in the tr ade composition of the mercosur countries24 an analysis of mercosur trade composition suggests that brazils trade surplus is driven considerably by falling import shares of the smalle r mercosur economies presenting two structural problems not eas ily addressed first the export supply produced by the mercosur countries doe s not correspond strongly with brazils import demand second argen tine and uruguayan exports may be less competitive relative to those from countries outside th mercosur bloc they also compete closely with one another in the brazilian market together these trends suggest that natural correction in the mercosur trade flows may not be likely leading to argentinas continued demand for administere d remedies to addre ss certain chronic sectoral trade imbalances eg appliances textiles paper current administered agreements include the use of voluntary export restraints quotas and export taxes25 one important example

shift for mercosur and raises multiple issues first it is bilate ral arrangement established under the aladi system and so not governed by mercosur second import restrictions represent retreat from the stated free trade philos ophy of mercosur third the cam has enforcement mechanism under aladi in short it compounds existing institutional problems and may undermine the mercosur ag reement even as it attempts so far unsuccessfully to restore balance to the largest bilateral relationship within it26 paraguay and uruguay the two smaller mercos ur partners face similar trade asymmetries but also react against the uneven exercise of power linked to mercosur by natural trade relationship both paraguay and uruguay have still had to respond to structural impediments to thei r exports in part trade asymmetry is function of their relatively small economies but the major issue is the disparity between mercosurs stated intent to help all members attain their development goals and the actual functioning of the agr eement itself the treatys incomplete integration can impede paraguays and ur uguays exports does not provide special and differentiated treatment and often allows bilateral diplomacy to circumvent formal decisionmaking mechanisms27 the safeguards mechanism adopted by brazil and argentina is one example which ppears to contradict the principle of reciprocity in rights and obligations ad hoc restrictions on tr ade are another major area of complaint paraguay and uruguay are not in identi cal situations and so each has advocated different remedies histor ically paraguays economy s been the most dependent on mercosur as small agricultura l economy geographically remote and landlocked it depends on its neighbors for export routes to third countries particularly when river access is seasonally limited paraguay is also the poorest and least developed mercosur member and so relies on the mercosurs promises of market access enforceable obligations and integration for its fledgling manufacturing industries paraguays exports have at times been blocked by bureaucratic restrictions in both brazil and argentina and private sector complaints have had little success in

expansion both within and outside of mercosur are greater it too looks to th mercosur agreement to fulfill its promises of market access and enforceable obligations finding balance both within and outside mercosur including exploring deeper bilateral relationships with the eu and the united states is the challenge for uruguay frustrated by past vulnerability to argentinas financial crisis and brazils pe riodic barriers to trade uruguay has opted to diversify its trade with the world wh ere possible but its policy options are hindered because it cannot change or ensure enforcement of the mercosur agreement it cannot leave mercosur nor can it formally nego tiate outside it29 the asymmetry issue suggests certain implicit political hold that brazil has over the mercosur derived from its dispr oportional economic power by presiding over an incomplete customs union it can selectively limit the free movement of imports to suit its sectoral needs at cost to the other countries equal to the high tariff on capital goods or forgone trade for example and can also inhibit movement of goods from the smaller countries bound fo r countries within mercosur or outside it brazils dominant economic and politicalinstitutional control over the mercosur has therefore at times fostered resentme nt among the smaller countries increasing their interest in pursuing thir d country trade arrangements uruguay has responded in part by exploring deeper trade affiliations outside the pact on november 4 2006 following us senate approval bilateral investment treaty bit between the united

deve lop closer us trade ties with its concern over increasing bilateralism between argentina and brazil in december 2006 argentina responded by criticizing urugua for attempting to circumve nt mercosur in its quest to diversify its trade relations again pointing to an internal strife based on trade pact that does not appear to operate as promised30 many in uruguay are not indifferent to

construction of pulp mill opposed bitterly by argentina is another conflict within mercosur c onstructed by finnish firm on the uruguay river the mill represents the largest single foreign investment project in uruguay and is expected to provide significant longterm employment opportunities31 argentina alleges that uruguay is in violation of bilateral environmen tal protocol the two countries signed in 1975 and that th plant presents potentially harmful environmental effects that could negatively affect argentinas national territory including resort area across the river from the construction site world bank review concluded that th plant poses serious environmental problems but did suggest that construc tion and production design changes could reduce the risk of environmental haza rd even further the world banks international finance cor poration provided 100 million to finance the project and the issue continues to spawn protests and diplomatic flar eups periodically argentine protesters continue to block bridges over the uruguay river disrupting trade and tourist traffic between the two countries uruguay has responded at times by closing the border it also turned to the mercosur system for dispute settlement september 2006 ruling by the mercosur adhoc arbitrati on tribunal found that argentina had failed to live up to its commitment to ensure the free movement of people goods and services under the pact but award was made32 argentina also filed petition for arbitration with the international court of justice icj at the hague the icj denied argentinas request for an injunction to terminate construction it also declined to require that argentina take actions to remove protesters uruguay subsequently filed counter claim arguing that argentina has failed to take such action additional media tion efforts in madrid and new york ameliorated the the conflict temporarily but the pulp mill began operations in november 2007 even as the pa rties awaited final ruling from the icj brazil has chosen not to mediate and the ongoing dispute highlights the lack of an effective dispute settlement system within

venezuela as the first additional full member of the pact the accession protoc ol was accelerated in mid2006 at the behest of president hugo chávez who view ed it as supportive of his effort to unify south america and advance his bolivarian agenda that generally stands in opposition to us influence in the region the accession takes full effect only after formal parliamentary approva l by all four mercosur countries to date only argentina and uruguay ve voted to approve38 the early stages of the accession process was expected to be longer and more involved because of two significant hurdl

and current tariff preferen ces that already apply to high proportion of goods expected to benefit from the agreement trade between mercosur and venezuela averages more than 3 of the pacts total world trade with the exception of uruguay where crude oil constitutes 12 of total imports the energy sector promises the greatest benefit through deeper cooperation in energy supply but which could also be achieved without venezuel as full integration into mercosur in addition venezuelas access will complicate trade policy coordination within the expanded bloc both regionally and multilaterally40 the political motivations and ramifica tions for venezuelas accession may be even more of an issue concern has grown for example over certain of president chávezs policies that may be construed as hindering democracy which in turn could be considered direct challenge to mercosurs democratic clause brazilian foreign minister celso amorim has reaffirmed his view that mercosurs primary goal from the start has been to consolidate democracy in south america chávezs decision to close key radio station viewed by some as suppressing freedom of speech and his onetime plan to alter the venezuelan constitution to abolish presidential term limits viewed by some as direct assault on th democratic process raised concern over real and perceived undemocra tic behavior in venezuela this issue has escalated with some members of the brazilian senate continuing to argue for postponement of vote to consider venezuelas accession41 although venezuela remains non voting member until the accession is ratified it does have voice in mercosur affairs increasing its influence on intrapact and external trade negotiations the marginal effect may be to strengthen resolve by some countries to challenge us influen ce in south america although there are also moderating influences in all countries uruguay and paraguay could also view venezuela as having diluting force on brazils political dominance in the pact but opinions seem divided at present in both countries venezuelas accession however may have unintended regi onal consequences should countries outside merc osur be put in position of having to

institutional constraints within mercosur as customs union with supposed common ex ternal trade policy and cet mercosur would theoretically need to approach the doha development round with some common if not identical trade negotiati on objectives or risk differing country policies undermining the inte gration scheme mercosur has responded by creating an ad hoc consultation and coordination group to address the doha negotiations the bloc however does not approach the wto as united voice but doha negotiations are exploring the possibility of more flexible approach to address the interests of the customs union44 brazil has taken the negotiating lead and perhaps has the most to gain from the doha round on both political and economic gr ounds but it is not clear that positions benefitting brazil will always be those s upported by the other mercosur countries45 although there has been broad agreement in the realm of agricultural issues as part of the broader developing country consolidated respons to developed country wto positions there is less agreement in the areas of nonagricultural market access and services the most sensitive areas with respect to maintaining cohesive customs union are in setting tariff vels and determining sens itive product lists that each country may elect to receive special treatment under wt agreement given there will be limits on the number of tariff lines permitted large differences in both these areas among mercosur countri could lead to either breech of the customs union rules or those of the doha agreement balancing these goals in

china importing 197 billion china represented 72 of mercosurs exports and 112 of its imports total tr ade between china and the four mercosur countries ranges from low of 11 of to tal foreign trade for uruguay to 18 for argentina and brazil and high of 28 for paraguay importing mostly computer and other electronic equipment48 mercosurs commodity exports and imports of laborintensive goods explain most of the recent strong growth in this relationship49 such strong trade growth also presents problems for mercosur because manufactured imports displace local products chinas expanding trade surplus would be even bigger were it not for the world prices of agricultural commodities currently driving mercosurs export values suggesting that as china becomes larger trade partner the deficit could widen the prospect for deteriorating bilateral trade balance has led both brazil and argentina to pursue an tidumping cases and resort to use of import licenses voluntary export re straints and

improvements will produce mo re equitable outcomes the result remains an uncomfortable status quo in which form g the new parliame nt often supercedes function eg deeper integration economic integration based on mutual growth in trade and development is at the heart of the mercosur charter but given shortfalls in achieving this goal it is likely that persistent dissatisfaction among the smaller partners may continue particularly given brazils political and economic dominance and mercosurs inability to address institu tional disagreements deep er economic integration promises to resolve some problems but there appears to be little chance for movement in that direction in the near future instead mercosur has opted to pursue new institutional bureaucracies the parliament and outreach to third count ries albeit on very limited basis the parliament is in its infancy and mercosur has not been able to consummate trade agreement with its most important trade partners the united states and the eu southsouth agreements and expansion of associate membership to south american countries has progressed but only as limite d market access arrangements the big but questionable move is the accession inv itation to venezuela which has also had problems venezuela has been given leeway in adopting mercosur commitments which has undermined th pacts cohesiveness51 and could end up shifting the political orientation of mercosur while pr oviding only relatively small trade effects historically the united states s supported mercosur as potential complementary path to meeting its own goal of western hemisphere economic integration but usmercosur trade is small and mercosur has shown little enthusiasm for supporting us initiatives for hemisphericwide trade agreement the addition of venezuela would likely solidify this position although mercosur has resisted the ftaa as envisioned by the united states venezuela is the only country in latin america to reject the idea unequivocally it appears that mercosur has opted to emphasize its expansion both in the region and with other developing countries over agreements with its largest developed country trade partners looking to the world trade organization wto as the preferred alternative for achieving many of its trade policy goals nonetheless us mercosur commercial and economic ties are expanding and the united states is pursuing deeper bilateral trade relations with uruguay that could provide new ideas for broader integration commitment the alternative may be for mercosur and the united states to expand their mutually exclusive bilateral agreements increasing the potential for overlapping trading systems which few if any view as either economically or administratively
