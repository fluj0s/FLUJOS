program for fy1995 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years 2 the authorizing legislation specified that priority be given to applications that offer broad selection of services which address the needs of the community it encouraged public schools that establish these centers to collaborate with other public and nonprofit agencies and organizations local businesses educational entities such as vocational and adult education programs schooltowork programs community colleges and universities recreational cultural and other community and human service entities for the purpose of meeting the needs of and expanding the opportunities available to the residents of the communities served by such schools 3 1 section 422 of the general education

across the nation and among the states and among rural and urban areas within states the 21st cclc projects had to include at least four of the following activities 1 literacy education programs 2 senior citizen programs 3 childrens day care services 4 integrated education health social service recreational or cultural programs 5 summer and weekend school programs in conjunction with recreation

education programs 10 support and training for child day care providers 11 employment counseling training and placement 12 services for individuals who leave school before graduating from secondary school regardless of the age of such individual and 13 services for individuals with disabilities5 the 21st cclc program grew dramatically as evidenced by the programs funding trajectory from 750000 in fy1995 to 845614000 in fy2001 see table 16 ed received approximately 2253 applications for fy2000 21st cclc grants ed says that fy2000 21st cclc funds served approximately 615000 children and 215000 adults the program shifted in emphasis as the amount appropriated for the program increased the original authorizing language included an absolute priority for those 21st cclc projects that offer broad selection of services which address the needs of the community7 beginning with the programs significant expansion in fy1998 an additional absolute priority was added for activities that offer expanded learning 4 20 usc 8244 5 20 usc 8245 6 the amounts provided by the second 2000 conference were reduced from 453710000 per recission of fy2000 discretionary budget authority required by

that award additional points to potential grantees applications crs3 opportunities for children and youth in the community and that contribute to reduced drug use and violence8 funding history the 21st cclc received 750000 in appropriations in fy1995 its first year of operation this amount was considerably less than the 20000000 that had been authorized for the program only six grants were funded in fy1995 in fy1996 continuation funding was provided for these grants through an appropriation of 750000 see table 1 in its fy1996 budget submission for ed the clinton administration requested funds for the program in fy1996 and rescission of the entire 750000 for fy1995 again in its fy1997 budget request the clinton administration requested funding for the 21st cclc it argued that separate funding for this activity was not needed because the elementary and secondary education act as amended authorizes local education agencies individual schools or consortia of schools to use up to 5 of the funds they receive under esea to establish and implement coordinated services projects that provide elementary and secondary school students and their families better access to social health and education services9 table 1 21st century learning centers funding history presidents budget fy request in appropriation in 1995 0 750000 1996 0 750000 1997 0 1000000 1998 50000000 40000000 1999

requested significantly increased funding for the program and shifted the focus of the program to emphasize extended learning opportunities for children and youth it argued that the 21st cclc program could play an important role in addressing the need for after school supervision for children and youth providing academic help to atrisk students and providing forum for conveying an antidrug and antiviolence message in 1995 there were 235 million schoolaged children with parents in the workforce but as recently as the 19931994 school year 70 percent of all public elementary middle and combined schools did not have before or afterschool program in rural areas 82 percent of public schools did not have such programs in addition the majority of extendedday programs are aimed at kindergarten and early elementary school students and focus on supervised care rather than academic instruction this program would bring muchneeded attention to the provision of supplementary learning activities and on activities addressing the needs of adolescents and the problems of drug use gang involvement and violence10 the clinton administration pursued the expansion of the 21st cclc program with an emphasis on expanded learning opportunities for children with several goals in mind reducing social promotion by providing additional time for mentoring and after school hours learning reducing juvenile crime by providing structured learning activities providing drug counseling to students and providing positive environment for children who otherwise would be without adult supervision these goals derived from perceived need of families with working parents for after school supervision for their children and from the belief that children with adult supervision are less likely to use drugs engage in or be the victim of violence and are more likely to do well in school11 in addition to providing adult supervision after school hours with the goal of reducing highrisk behaviors the 21st cclc program strove to provide additional academic help to raise the performance of atrisk students with respect to state and local standards in core academic subjects by making use of already existing school facilities after school programs which generally involve fewer children could utilize resources that might be scarce during the regular school day eg computers and could provide more oneonone attention to students the fy1998 budget request was for 50 million to expand the program to support grants for 200 to 300 new 21st cclc by fy1999 200 million was appropriated for the program and 845614 million was appropriated for the program for fy2001 this is considerably more than fy2000 funding but is less than the clinton administrations request for 1 billion for fy2001 demand for grants has continued to outstrip supply indicating strong interest in communities for this program and for greater funding of the 21st cclc according to the clinton administration 10 fy1998 budget justification p v88 11 us department of education and us department of justice safe and smart making after school hours work for kids p 1 httpwwwedgovpubssafeandsmarttitlehtml crs5 as the program grew in scope and its focus shifted the administration of the program shifted within ed during its first 3 years of funding fy1995fy1997 it was administered by the early childhood institute in fy1998 and fy1999 it was administered by the office of reform assistance and dissemination of the office of educational research and improvement since fy2000 administration of the program has been located in the office of elementary and secondary education competitive priorities for grant applicants ed ranked applications for grants under the 21st cclc program using five core criteria worth maximum of 100 points12 in addition the secretary of the department of education had the discretion to include additional competitive priorities from fy1998 through fy2001 the secretary included one or more competitive priorities as part of each years grant competition competitive priority adds five additional points to potential grantees application score fy1998 competitive priorities were granted to projects that 1 would help students meet or exceed state and local standards in core academic subjects such as reading math or science and 2 would target middle school students competitive priority 1 was also awarded to projects considered for funding in fy1999 fy2000 and fy2001 each years grant competition also included an additional competitive priority awarded to projects that addressed significant problems in an empowerment or enterprise zone this competitive priority served as tie breaker additional points were awarded to applications that met this priority reauthorization issues during consideration of reauthorization of the 21st cclc in the 107th congress concern was expressed regarding the rapid growth of the program and whether it was meeting the authorizing legislations stated goals of providing educational recreational cultural health and social services to all community members in rural and inner city communities some of the goals encompassed by the program as it was implemented eg reducing drugs and violence and targeting empowerment and enterprise zones were not explicitly addressed in the original authorizing legislation and some argued might have been beyond its intent second concern was whether the 21st cclc program was duplicative of existing federal programs and hence might not have been the most efficient use of federal resources program areas most often mentioned in this context authorizing after school programs included esea section 14206b authority which permits up to 5 of awarded funds to be used for coordinated services projects esea title iv 12 these five criteria and their maximum point values for total of 100 were 1 need for project 30 points 2 quality of project design 30 points 3 adequacy of resources 15 points 4 quality of the management plan 15 points and 5 quality of project evaluation 10 points 21st century community learning centers program application for grants crs6 safe and drug free schools sections 4114c6 and 4116b8 esea title vii part bilingual education act section 71171 esea title ix part b native hawaiian education section 9210b2 and some individuals with disabilities education act programs that are provided outside of the standard school day or year in addition some childcare bills fund similar programs see crs report rl30944 child care issues in the 107th congress third concern was whether the federal government served as the best arbiter of funding decisions under the program some argued that the 21st cclc program would have been able to better serve communities in providing the broad scope of activities envisioned in the authorizing legislation if greater share of control rested with communities themselves rather than with the federal government which had narrowed the programs focus by emphasizing extended learning opportunities for children and youth fourth concern was whether program as large as the 21st cclc could be fairly handled through nationwide competitive grant process some argued that with funding at 200 million in fy1999 and 845614 million in fy2001 formula grant structure was needed in order to help ensure equitable distribution of grants on the other hand some argued that without increased funding formula allocation could dilute individual grant size fifth concern was whether there were sufficient safeguards in place to ensure program accountability and sustainability particularly given the tremendous growth in the program what were good measures of program success and to what extent were good measures currently being employed in evaluating 21st cclc programs in addition how would communities find funding to sustain their programs after the 3 years of federal funding was exhausted the house committee on appropriations raised concerns about the programs accountability in its report accompanying the departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies fy1999 appropriation bill the committee remains concerned that the department has not identified specific measurable standards consistent with the requirements of the government performance and results act for the 21st century community learning centers it is essential for the department to develop specific measurable standards relating to the core services listed in the authorizing legislation and particularly focusing on academic and social preparation for school such data should include baseline data on the academic improvements and transfer of programmatic innovations and specific measurable changes that are expected to occur as result of proposed increased funding13 13 us congress house departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies appropriation bill 1999 hrept 105635 105th congress 2d sess washington us govt print off 1998 p 199 crs7 ed submitted fy2000 strategic plan for the 21st cclc that included standards of performance for 21st cclc grantees14 ed also made available to applicants its continuous improvement management guide for the 21st cclc resource on how to effectively plan and monitor 21st cclc and ed contracted with mathematica policy research to conduct 4year external evaluation of the program however because the program is still relatively new there were not any thorough empirical evaluations of its performance in addition the wide variety and scope of program activities funded under the 21st cclc program made the creation and execution of programwide standards of performance and evaluation challenging legislation in the 107th congress on december 13 and 18 2001 respectively the house and senate adopted the conference version of hr 1 the child left behind act hr 1pl 107110 was signed into law by president bush on january 8 2002 hr 1 the child left behind act was passed by the full house on may 23 2001 this bill would have reauthorized the 21st cclc as formula grant program as part of new title v safe schools for the 21st century onehalf of the amount awarded to states would have been allocated in proportion to their school aged population and onehalf would have been awarded in proportion to their share of grants received in the preceding fiscal year under subpart2 parta of the esea states receiving grants would have awarded competitive grants to eligible entities local educational agency communitybased organization and other public entity or private organization or consortium of two or more of such groups the house committee on education and the workforce amended hr 1 to retain separate funding stream 900 million in fy2002 and such sums as may be necessary for the succeeding 4 fiscal years for the 21st cclc program authorized activities would have included before and after school activities to advance student achievement sixty million dollars would have been authorized for fy2002 for national programs to evaluate the effectiveness of all title v programs including the 21st cclc program the senates version of hr 1 the better education for students and teachers best act bill to reauthorize and revise the esea was passed on june 14 2001 the best act would have reauthorized the 21st cclc program as new part f of title i under the best act the list of potential 21st cclc grantees would have been expanded to include general purpose units of local government counties cities etc and communitybased organizations as well as local educational agencies the best act would have reauthorized the 21st cclc program as formula grant to states and as competitive grant from the states to eligible local grantees the act 14 an example is related to program outcomes beginning in 2000 centers will report that more than 75 of students participating in the program for at least 2 years show improvements on measures such as grades attendance taking of advanced or challenging courses such as algebra honors courses and ap courses and decreased disciplinary actions see httpwwwedgovpubsplanrptshtml us department of education fy2000 annual plan p 22 crs8 would have allocated grants to states after reservations in proportion to their share of grants received in the preceding fiscal year under subpart2 part of the esea like the child left behind act the best act would have focused the 21st cclc program on before and afterschool activities intended to advance student achievement in addition the best act would have authorized the 21st cclc program to offer families of participating students opportunities for lifelong learning and literacy development the act would have authorized 15 billion for the program in fy2002 and such sums as might be necessary for each of the 6 succeeding years s 156 boxer introduced on january 23 2001 would have reauthorized the 21st cclc as separate program would have extended the maximum grant duration to 5 years and would have implemented matching requirements hr 340 miller introduced on january 31 2001 would have reauthorized the 21st cclc as separate program and would have changed the program to operate as formula grant program to states and then as competitive grant program from states to leas hr 345s 303 roemerlieberman introduced on january 31 2001 would have incorporated the 21st cclc program into broader title vi titled high performance and quality education initiatives but would have retained priority within title vi for extended learning time services legislation in the 106th congress the clinton administrations esea reauthorization proposal the educational excellence for all children act of 1999 would have changed the 21st cclc in some significant ways the proposal would have extended grants for up to 5 years from the present 3 years it would have added local matching requirement for grantees and it would have allowed up to 10 of grants to be awarded directly to community based organizations with the agreement of the school district in addition the proposal would have added provision stating that grants would be awarded on behalf of schools in inner cities small cities and rural areas that serve communities with substantial need for expanded learning opportunities because they have high proportion of lowachieving students b they lack resources to establish or expand afterschool centers that benefit the educational health social service cultural and recreational needs of the community or c they have other needs consistent with the purposes of this part the clinton administration argued that these new requirements would strengthen local communities ability to operate successful afterschool programs would extend benefits of the program to more individuals and would increase the likelihood that program will be continued after the federal grant expires the clinton administrations esea authorization proposal was introduced in the house as hr 1960 clay and in the senate as s 1180 kennedy on may 26 1999 and may 27 1999 respectively these bills contained the same 21st cclc provisions as those contained in the administrations proposal although essentially the same in other respects as well these bills were not identical in every respect to the administrations esea authorization proposal for more information on these crs9 differences see crs issue brief ib98047 elementary and secondary education

house committee on education and the workforce on april 13 2000 hr 4141 would have incorporated the 21st cclc program along with drug and violence prevention programs into new title supporting drug and violence prevention and education for students and communities act of 2000 hr 4141 would have replaced the existing competitive 21st cclc grant program with program awarded principally on formula grant basis four of the 13 activities authorized by the original 21st cclc legislation pl 103382 would have been eliminated the eliminated activities would have been integrated health and social service programs nutrition and health programs support and training for child day care providers and employment counseling training and placement many new activities not included in the original 21st cclc program related to the prevention of drug use and violence would have been added hr 4141 would have permitted title ii funds to be transferred to other activities authorized by the legislation s 2 the educational opportunities act was reported by the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on april 12 2000 this legislation would have reauthorized the 21st cclc program without significant changes for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30306
