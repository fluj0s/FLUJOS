specialist in public finance government and finance division state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax summary the alternative minimum tax amt is parallel tax to the regular individual income tax and is intended to help ensure that highincome individuals bear at least some tax liability the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts however lowered the average tax liability under the regular income tax such that many taxpayers could have been captured by the amt which is not indexed for inflation the amt for individuals will capture significantly more taxpayers beginning in the 2008 tax year if congress does not act to modify or repeal the tax this report describes the potential impact on taxpayers and state and local governments if the amt reverts to pre2001 rules or is repealed both taxpayers and state and local governments are potentially affected because state and local taxes are deducted for purposes of the regular income tax but are not deducted when calculating amt liability the impact on state and local governments arises because the tax price of public goods is reduced through federal deductibility each tax dollar taxpayer who itemizes pays to state or local government reduces the taxpayers federal tax liability by an amount equal to his marginal tax rate multiplied by the taxes paid theoretically state and local governments can levy higher taxes and provide more public goods than they would be able to absent federal deductibility through deductibility state and local governments are also able to export part of their tax burden to all federal taxpayers hightax states more than others repeal of the amt would expand the tax benefit generating more tax exportation amt reversion to pre2001 rules would reduce the tax benefit and reduce tax exportation the variation of tax structures among states will lead to significant differential impact by state and by individual generally repeal of the amt would reduce taxes for highincome taxpayers and reversion would increase taxes for highincome taxpayers most of the highestincome taxpayers adjusted gross income over 500000 however would not be affected because their regular income tax liability exceeds amt liability generally hightax highincome states would fare relatively better under amt repeal and relatively worse under reversion to pre2001 amt rules this report includes statebystate breakdown of the average taxespaid deduction and the percentage of amt filers and itemizers this information is provided to help policymakers evaluate the effect of possible reforms of the amt on constituent governments this report analyzes the broad impact of the amt and options for its modification for information on congressional action with respect to the amt see crs report

highincome individuals bear at least some tax liability1 the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts however lowered the average tax liability under the regular income tax such that many taxpayers could have been captured by the amt which is not indexed for inflation the amt exemption amounts have been increased several times beginning in 2001 congress temporarily adjusted the amt exemption amounts in 2001 through the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra and 2003 through the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra congress extended the temporary exemption amount increases in 2004 through the working families tax relief act wftra and again in 2006 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 tipra2 the tax increase prevention act of 2007 tipa increased the exemption levels and extended the allowance of personal credits against the amt for the 2007 tax year by increasing the amt exemption amount the threshold where regular income tax liability falls below amt liability is relatively higher temporarily reducing the number of taxpayers subject to the amt in addition some personal credits that were previously not allowed to offset amt liability can now be used to offset the amt potential changes to the amt would have significant effect on the taxes levied on individuals and on the tax structure of state and local governments specifically the distribution of the federal tax burden on individuals would change if either extreme reversion to pre2001 rules or repeal of the amt is implemented state and local governments would either see the tax price for public goods increase reversion or decrease repeal the report includes statebystate breakdown of the average taxes paid deduction and the percentage of amt filers and itemizers this information is provided to help policymakers evaluate the effect of possible reforms on constituent governments the report concludes with discussion of how congressional action on the amt could affect state and local governments and taxpayers if congress takes action dealing with the amt in 2008 1 for more on the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals by steven maguire 2 the wftra amt extension is through the 2005 tax year the tipra extension is through the 2006 tax year crs2 effect of the amt on individuals the potential distributional effects of amt reform or repeal on individuals is the focus of this section there are two primary avenues through which the tax burden would be shifted through the treatment of state and local taxes paid and through the distributional burden of the amt generally secondary effect would arise as states and individuals respond to any new treatment of state and local taxes under the amt or without an amt how the burden is currently distributed will help frame how burden would change under proposals to repeal or reform the amt table 1 provides distribution of taxpayers based on the utilization of

filers for these income groups there are 19604 amt filers not accounted for in the agi groups listed here they are likely concentrated in the 500000 to 1 million cohort crs3 generally as adjusted gross income increases so to does the prevalence of returns with itemized deductions taxes paid deduction and amt liability note that the vast majority of taxpayers with agi greater than 75000 itemize and claim deduction for state and local taxes paid income distribution of the state and local taxes paid deduction under the regular income tax individuals who itemize deductions may deduct state and local taxes paid taxpayers must choose to deduct either income or sales taxes not both3 in the 2003 tax year before the sales tax deduction option was available 431 million returns deducted 3109 billion in taxes paid4 in the 2004 tax year the first year for the sales tax deduction option 460 million returns deducted 3626 billion5 in the 2005 tax year 474 million returns deducted 4004 billion6 and in 2006 487 million deducted 4328 billion7 the increase in number of returns claiming the taxes paid deduction and in the amount deducted is likely due in part to the sales tax deduction option in contrast to the regular income tax treatment under the alternative minimum tax amt state and local taxes paid are considered preference item and are included in the base of the tax according to the joint committee on taxation jct approximately 4 million taxpayers added back approximately 909 billion in state and local taxes paid for purposes of calculating amt liability in 20068 the taxes paid deduction is most common for returns in the higher income brackets out of the 273 million total returns with reported agi of over 75000 228 million itemized deductions see table 1 itemized returns with agi over 75000 represented 464 of itemized returns and claimed 757 of the total taxes paid deduction see table 2 itemized returns with agi over 100000 represented 295 of itemized returns yet accounted for 628 of the taxes paid deduction as is often the case with federal tax policy different parts of the tax code contradict one another the treatment of state and local taxes is one example the policy objective behind the tax preference for state and local taxes paid under the regular income tax has been supported with the claim that to disallow the deduction 3 under current law the option to deduct sales taxes in lieu of income tax expired at the end of 2007 4 internal revenue service irs statistics of income individual complete report 2003 publication 1304 oct 2005 the sales

present law and background relating to the alternative minimum tax jcx3807 june 25 2007 crs4 would amount to tax on tax9 proponents of the deduction suggest that taxes paid to state and local governments are not available to pay federal income taxes and thus should not be included in taxable income in short proponents of deductibility claim that taxing tax is inequitable if the amt were to revert to the pre2001 rules this tax preference would be reduced contravening the original intent of the tax deduction under the regular income tax in recent analysis if not for the patch the amt would have reduced the value of the taxes paid deduction by over one quarter10 the analysis also estimated the lower tax rates enacted in 2001 and 2003 further diminished the value of the deduction by

metcalf assessing the federal deduction for state and local tax payments national bureau of economic research working paper 14023 may 2008 crs5 in contrast if the taxes paid to state and local governments are viewed as payments for services eg education services and garbage collection some assert that deduction for these taxes would not be justified reversion to pre2001 amt rules would be more consistent with this view the characteristics of the goods and services provided by jurisdictions in this view determine the theoretical appropriateness of the deduction for the taxes used to pay for them for example consider jurisdiction that provides foreign language classes and government operated fitness center and jurisdiction b which does not offer either if funds these services with local property taxes taxpayers who itemize are allowed to deduct the cost of these services through the federal deduction for state and local taxes paid alternatively taxpayers in jurisdiction b who purchase similar services albeit from private providers cannot deduct the expenditure from distributional perspective jurisdictions that provide more services jurisdiction in our example likely wealthier jurisdictions are able to export some of the burden to all federal taxpayers including to those in poorer jurisdictions generally the greater the likelihood of private provider of good or service the less appropriate some argue is the federal deduction for the taxes used to fund those services the previous discussion touches on another justification for the deduction for state and local taxes the indirect subsidy to state and local governments the lower tax price theoretically allows the local government to impose tax rate that is higher than would be the case without deductibility11 for example if taxpayer is allowed to deduct property taxes it is likely the case that these taxpayers would be more willing to accept marginally higher property tax rate for each dollar of property tax paid the federal tax burden is reduced by the taxpayers marginal tax rate taxpayer in the 28 tax bracket would have federal tax liability reduced by 28 cents for each dollar paid in property taxes economic theory predicts that more public services would be provided than would otherwise be the case without deductibility12 the taxpayer has more disposable income lower federal taxes and thus would demand more public services and the relative price of government provided goods would decline increasing the quantity of public goods demanded13 from state distributional perspective hightax highincome states would benefit the most under expanded deductibility of state and local taxes eg amt repeal this report provides more detailed discussion of the effect on state and 11 douglas holtzeakin and harvey rosen federal deductibility and local property tax rates journal of urban economics vol 27 1990 pp 269284 12 an alternative view of the property tax is that the tax acts as tax on capital the higher capital taxes would in turn discourage business capital investment in theory business capital would flee the high tax jurisdictions ultimately lowering tax receipts thus it is argued local governments may rely less on the property tax and actually invest less in public goods and services to avoid business flight to other jurisdictions total local government investments in public goods and services in turn is lower than it otherwise would be absent the property tax 13 economists refer to these effects as the income and substitution effects respectively crs6 local governments of the taxes paid deduction under amt reform and repeal proposals in later section income distribution of amt liability the amt affects considerably fewer taxpayers than the itemized deduction for taxes paid 40 million and 491 million respectively in 2006 the distribution of those affected by the amt however is more concentrated than the taxes paid deduction the aggregated data produced by the internal revenue service irs and summarized in table 3 and table 4 clearly exhibit the concentrated and progressive nature of amt liability roughly 841 of amt returns

september 2006 crs7 because regular income tax liability increases as income increases eventually surpassing amt tax rates the share of taxpayers with agi greater than 500000 subject to the amt would not change significantly if the amt reverts to pre2001 rules in contrast the share of taxpayers subject to the amt in the 50000 to 100000 cohort and the 100000 to 200000 cohort would rise dramatically for these cohorts the amt rates are higher than the regular income tax rates taxpayers in the over 500000 cohort encounter higher tax rates under the regular income tax than under the amt and thus

complete report 2006 publication 1304 july 2008 estimates of the anticipated amt liability distribution if the current laws governing the amt are not changed is principal concern of many observers and policymakers according to analysis from the joint committee on taxation jct under current law taxpayers with agi under 200000 will pay almost 48 of amt liability in 2010 compared to less than 13 that the group paid in 200614 in addition the same analysis estimates that the number of amt taxpayers will increase 14 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the alternative minimum tax jcx3807 june 25 2007 since this jct publication actual data for 2006 have been released and these data are used instead of the jct estimates crs8 to 309 million in 2010 from 40 million in 2006 although the amt would still be relatively progressive in 2010 the increased burden on less wealthy taxpayers and the greater absolute number of taxpayers subject to the amt would diminish the overall progressivity of the federal tax system effect of the amt on state and local governments this section describes and analyzes how possible congressional action on the amt may affect state and local governments generally under the amt state and local taxes paid do not receive federal tax preference in contrast the repeal of the amt combined with the scheduled repeal of the regular income itemized deduction phaseout would significantly increase the tax benefit conferred on states through deductibility15 for these reasons state and local governments are actively following congressional action on the amt state and local government representatives generally support the deductibility of state and local taxes under the regular income tax because of the indirect subsidy to subnational governments delivered through lower federal tax burden generally state and local governments are able to export part of their tax burden to all federal taxpayers some states more than others exporting the state and local tax burden can be measured by the amount of tax revenue that is deductible the greater the amount of deductible taxes the greater the exportation tax cut legislation the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca 2004 pl 108357 expanded the deductibility of the state and local taxes to include an option to deduct sales taxes in lieu of income taxes for taxpayers that itemize16 taxpayers choose the greater of sales taxes or income taxes when itemizing deductions the new provision primarily benefits taxpayers in states that do not levy an income tax the provision expired after 2007 variety of methods can be used to compare the relative tax burden of state and local taxes for this report state and local taxes that could have been deductible under ajca 2004 rules were chosen as the instrument of comparison the greater of sales taxes or income taxes was added to property taxes for each state this amount was then divided by the number of 2006 tax returns filed in each state to produce an average amount for each state the third column of table 5 presents these estimates of the average deductible taxes per return by state note that because businesses pay large portion of sales and property taxes the averages overstate the burden on individual returns yet the estimates are useful for comparative purposes 15 under current law through 2009 certain highincome taxpayers are required to reduce itemized deductions limited to up to 80 of allowable deductions this itemized deduction reduction is phased out beginning in the 2006 tax year until completely repealed beginning in 2009 16 for more see crs report rl32781 federal deductibility of state and local taxes by steven maguire crs9 potentially deductible taxes under the ajca rules would have been 8372 on average for returns filed in new york state 2844 in alabama see table 5 the us average was 4606 per return17 recall that state and local governments that rely more on deductible taxes pay relatively lower tax price for public goods jurisdictions in new york state for example pay lower tax price and export more of their tax burden to federal taxpayers than do jurisdictions in

presents data on the percentage of amt filers by state and the average state and local taxes paid deduction by state in 2006 the states are ordered by the amount of potentially deductible taxes note that taxpayers in states that do not levy an income tax will have greater incentive to itemize and claim the deduction for taxes paid18 the average taxes paid deduction will almost certainly rise in these states as existing itemizers simply add the sales tax paid to other itemized deductions the irs reported that in 2006 112 million taxpayers took advantage of the sales tax deduction option deducting 189 billion there are likely many taxpayers in these states who did not itemize before ajca was enacted but were relatively close to the threshold where itemized deductions could exceed the standard deduction according to the tables in irs the state sales tax deduction for family of four in knoxville tennessee with income between 100000 and 120000 would have been 1696 in 200719 in addition this family could deduct another 545 in 2007 for local sales taxes paid further if this family had purchased 20000 car or boat they could deduct another 1850 in sum this tennessee family could 18 see crs report rl32781 federal deductibility of state and local taxes by steven maguire 19 the state sales tax rate in tennessee is 7 and the local rate for knoxville is an additional 225 for combined sales tax rate of 925 crs11 have deducted an additional 4091 under the sales tax deduction option with the standard deduction for joint filers at 10700 in 2007 it seems reasonable to assume that the additional sales tax deduction would have induced itemizing for many taxpayers in similar situation the data from the us census bureau in the third column of table 4 include the property tax and either the sales tax or income tax the tax which generates the most revenue either income or sales was added to the property tax to simulate states reliance on deductible taxes comparing states based on what current law would allow seems to be reasonable proposition potential issues for congress congress might ultimately choose one of three basic approaches to address the amt the first is to allow the amt to revert to the pre2001 rules if further action is taken on the amt in 2008 the reversion would occur beginning with the 2008 tax year the second approach is continued modification of the amt to capture roughly the same number of taxpayers every year this would require annual adjustment of the higher amt exemption amounts through indexation or similar process and could include changing the deductions allowed against amt liability thirdly the amt could be repealed outright if the amt is repealed federal revenue could decline considerably current budget forecasts predict repeal would generate an 872 billion revenue loss over the 20072017 budget window assuming the egtrra and jgtrra tax cuts are not extended20 if the other regular income tax cuts are extended and the amt is repealed the federal revenue loss over the same budget window would be approximately 116 trillion21 the second option extension of the amt exemption and indexation would essentially maintain the status quo and would not significantly shift the burden of federal taxation among the states but because current law does not index the amt the cost of indexation under this option beginning with the higher amt exemption amounts would be approximately 500 billion over the 20092017 budget window assuming the regular income tax cuts are not extended beyond 201022 if the tax cuts are extended the cost of this proposal would rise significantly in contrast to indexation the two extremes reversion and repeal would likely have significant impact on state and local governments and would significantly alter the burden of federal taxation 20 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the alternative minimum tax jcx3807 june 25 2007 21 us department of treasury fact sheet tale of two taxes regular income tax and the amt march 2 2005 22 congressional budget office budget options feb 2007 revenue option 5 p 264 crs12 amt reversion to pre2001 rules if the amt is allowed to revert to the structure in place before 2001 and the regular income tax cuts egtrra and jgtrra are made permanent then the role of state and local taxes in determining federal tax liability would change significantly under this scenario the amt would capture many more taxpayers as regular income tax liability falls below the floor established by the amt state and local taxes paid as noted earlier would become taxable reducing the implicit federal transfer to state and local governments because the deduction for state and local taxes paid varies by state so too would the impact of amt adjustments for example the average taxes paid itemized deduction for filers residing in new york was 17589 in 2006 whereas in tennessee the average taxes paid itemized deduction was 4504 see table 5 the reason for the disparity arises from the following two factors the level of state and local taxes and the average income in the state generally higher state and local taxes and higher income would both contribute to higher likelihood of itemizing and claiming deduction for state and local taxes paid states with the highest average amount of state and local taxes deducted new york california connecticut new jersey district of columbia massachusetts and maryland are the top seven would be the most negatively affected if the amt were to be allowed to revert to pre2001 rules in contrast states with relatively low taxes paid deductions would be the least negatively affected note that states with the relatively small taxes paid deduction are typically states without broadbased income taxes if the ajca 2004 sales tax deduction option were extended beyond 2007 reversion to pre2001 amt rules would have greater negative impact on these states the burden of federal taxes would shift from the low tax states to the high tax states if the amt reverts unchanged to pre2001 rules note that reversion to pre 2001 rules would result in significant increase in the number of amt filers in all states regardless of state and local taxes repeal of the amt in contrast to allowing the amt to revert to pre2001 rules congress could repeal the amt and state and local governments would continue to receive an indirect benefit through deductibility of state and local taxes the elimination of the phaseout of itemized deductions under the regular income tax in 2009 would also enhance the taxpayer benefit derived from deducting state and local taxes if the amt is repealed the loss in revenue would necessarily result in one or more of the following greater federal debt an increase in other federal taxes andor reduced federal spending if federal debt is increased the cost of borrowing for both the government and the private sector would also increase state and local governments which typically rely on debt to fund public infrastructure such as schools roads and bridges would likely face higher interest costs as the supply of all types of government bonds expands the longrun drag on the economy generated by government dissaving however could be partially offset by the short term stimulative effect of lower taxes crs13 the impact of increasing other federal taxes to replace the lost amt revenue depends on the tax raised and how the tax is increased if the base of the regular federal income tax personal or corporate is expanded eg the elimination of special deductions or exclusions many states could receive slight windfall windfall arises because most states use the base of the federal income tax both individual and corporate as the starting point for state income taxes for this reason if state and local tax rates remain constant the expanded federal base would increase state and local tax revenue alternatively an increase in federal rates or the elimination of lower tax brackets would have little effect on most state income tax revenue other federal tax changes such as changes in excise taxes would likely have little direct effect on the state and local government finances spending cuts would likely include some reduction in grantsinaid to state and local governments these grants comprised approximately 132 3586 billion of total federal government current expenditures in 200623 in addition cuts in federal spending other than direct grants may also adversely affect states if states must increase spending to provide what was once provided by the federal government many observers agree that the amt issue will need to be addressed again in 2008 in addition proposals addressing fundamental tax reform could include reform of the amt the direction of any congressional choice would have significant and varied impact on taxpayers and on state and local governments 23 economic report of the president feb 2008 table
