signif icantly from the plan president bush proposed in midoctober for allocatin g the second 20 billion portion the legislation roughly doubles the request fo r bioterrorism law enforcement and

final compromise to increase homeland security and new york aid and decrease defense resources partially accomm odated the position of those who sought more spending for the domestic programs but

table 2 and figures 3 and 4 below provide estimates of how the administrations planned and pr oposed allo cations of the 40 b illion were distributed across ten general categories and how these amounts compared to congressional changes3 under the presidents plan defense activities outlined in more detail below would have accounted for over lf of the 40 billion supplemental while recovery activities would have received roughly 62 b illion or 155 of the total with the enactment of hr 3338 total am ounts for both of these categories fell in order to make room within the 40 billion for increases elsewhere defense funds dropped to 173 billion or 434 of the total while recovery resources declined to 6 billion or 151 share of the total although all other activities represent fa r smaller shares of the supplemental package funding for several rose sharply as result of congressional decisions in hr 3338 for combating bioterrorism the white house had proposed 18 billion while final amounts total 3 billion or 76 of the total aviation and infrastructure security would have received 41 b illion under the presidents pr oposal but with enactment of hr 3338 these activities received 57 billion or 143 of the 40 billion package direct aid to victims of the attacks had totaled 33 billion under the presidents plan growing slightly to 35 billion or 88 of the total under the final allocation resources for investigation and law enfo rcement activities would have received 15 billion allocation an amount th at grew following enactment of hr 3338 to 26 billion or 65 of the total details of congre ssional debate on hr 3338 are discussed below despite congress cut of 35 billion in the 73 billion dod request for the emergency supplemental the presidents ge neral priorities

the homeland security and new york funds were added to other nonemergency funding in the bill this pushed the to tal amount appropriate d over the allowable allocation for hr 3338 and made th entire senate committee recommendation subject to point of order subsequently the senate adopted compromise amendment offered by senators byrd stevens and inouye that reduced th emergency antiterrorism spending to 20 billion but retained many of the program spending priorities identified in the committee recommendation although at lower am ounts as adopted by the senate hr 3338 included sharp differences with levels proposed by the president and approved by the house among the most significant disparities were the resource shares recommended for defense recovery efforts in new york and elsewhere and security of facilities and the border the house measure like the presidents request allocated 37 to defense while the senate bill provi ded 10 of the 20 billion appropriation debris removal construction and ot her recovery activities received 23 under the house version of the supplem ental total while the senate proposed 32 share security of infrastructure nuclear facilities airports and us borders accounted for roughly 10 of the house passed bill while the senate allocated nearly 16 other specific recommendations made by the senate that differ from the president and the house include bioterrorism 3 billion nearly twice the amount recommended by the white house and 41 more than approved in the house new york recovery 582 billion in fema disaster relief aid compared with 49 billion request ed and 435 billion passed by the house senate and house bills included 2 billion and 1825 billion respectively for hud community development block grants the white house had not proposed additional funds border security 842 million for the immigration and naturalization service and for customs to enhance security especially along the norther border the house approved 811 million and the president had proposed 507 million aviation security senate and house bills provided roughly the same amount for aviation security about 500 million but the senate measure allocated half to upgrade aircraft cockpit security while the house bill emphasized resources for sky marshals and security equipment for baggage and passenger screening the president had proposed 415 million for airline security mostly to upgrade cockpit doors investigation and law enforcement 24 billion about double what was requested and passed by the house the senate measure added over 100 million for fbi inves tigative activities and included 220 million for justice department law enforcement aid to new jersey northern virginia and ma ryland both house and senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31187crs16

of defense invoked its authority to use the food and forage act on september 16 2001 but obligations have been incurred by the services dod can also transfer funds using reprogramming authority bills included 400 million in counter terrorism assistance to state and local governments that was not requested by the white house in order to provide these additional resources without exceeding the 20 billion total the senate bill reduced dod funding fro m 73 billion to 2 billion see below senate consideration of the defense request under the byrd stevens inouye amendment that was adopted on the senate floor the department of defense would have received 2 billion of the 20 billion included in the senate bill reduction of 53 billion from the funding included in the house bill and from the administrations request of that 2 billion 475 million was designated as military construction funding to be used for r econstruction and renova tion of the pentagon the bill did not specify where the remaining 153 billion would be spent among the categories developed by the administra tion to describe dod spending those categories range from funding for the af ghan conflict to increased funding of intelligence and surveillance activities see table 3 below under the presidents proposed allocations the defense department would have received total of 211 billion the largest sh are of both the total funding available under the supplemental 53 and of the 20 b illion supplemental request considered by congress 37 under the senate bill however dods share of the 40 billion was to total 157 billion or 39 of to tal supplemental funding smaller than proposed by the house or the administration of that 157 billion 137 billion was already available to defense from the first 20 billion allocated by the president the remaining 2 billion was in the senate bill9 secretary of defense rumsfeld calle d on congress to give dod the entire 73 billion requested by the president in order to maintain the presidents priorities for fighting this war in afghanistan and to ensure that dod would not need to curtail training and operations10 in floor debate senator stevens suggested that the department of defense had already r eceived large increase of over 42 billion compared to the previous year and th at under the emergency supplemental the president could submit requests for add itional supplementals for any further requirements to combat terrorism senator stevens also mentioned that the department of defense d authority under the food and forage act section 3732 or title 41 usc section 11 to obligate monies in advance of appropriations for emergency expenses11 dod also had already been allotted 36 billion for expenses associated with the conflict in afghanis tan from the first 20 billion distributed by the president see table 3 belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31187crs17 12 in the enacted version of the bill funds in the defense emergency response fund can be transferred to the services for expenses incurred by other appropriations for the purposes of the emergency terrorism response supplemen tal including emergency costs incurred between september 11 and september 30 2001 under the food and forage act 13 dod would need to get approval from omb for such transferstable 3 shows the allocation of funds usin g the categories developed by the administration for the defense requests ranging from support for the conflict in afghanistan to repair nd renovation of the pentagon and compares the amounts provided by the house senate and the enacted bill with the administrations request unlike submissions by other ag encies and normal budget proposals the funding for dod was appropriated to central fund the defense emergency response fund rather than to individua l appropriation accounts in order to give dod additional flexibility and to ensure separate tracking of these emergency funds12 if necessary dod could for exampl transfer additional funds from one category to worldwide military posture the category that provides monies for the conflict in afghanistan or for additional training see table 3 below13 conference committee considerat ion and enactment of the 20 billion emergency supplemental on december 20 2001 congress cleared for the white house hr 3338 including 20 billion in emergency supplemental spending for homeland security increased fense needs and other efforts to combat terrorism the president signed the legislation on january 10 2002 pl 107117 the enacted package however differs significantly from what had been proposed in midoctober for allocating the second 20 billion the legislation roughly doubles the request for bioterrorism law enforcement and infrastructure security activities while reducing by more than half the 73 billion proposed for defense the final compromise to increase homeland security and new york aid and decrease defense resources partially accomm odates the position of those who sought more spending for domestic programs but w ithout exceeding 20 billion see table 2 and figure 6 above conference agreement for nondefense funds pl 107117 follows much of the framework proposed by the sena transfer of defense resources to fund homeland security and recovery needs major nondefense elements of the conference agreement include bioterrorism 284 billion nearly double the administrations 159 billion request the conference agreement includes 593 million for the national pharmaceu tical stockpile and 512 million for smallpox vaccine both as re quested but adds 865 million for the center for disease control cdc to help state and local jurisdictions upgrade their capacity the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases also receives 155 llion for

amount proposed by the president buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31187crs18 programmed in way that more di rectly targets new york hr 3338 as enacted includes 2 billion in community development block grants funds that were not requested to aid in new york city economic recovery fema receives 436 billion for various reconstruction repair and clean up activities somewhat less than the 49 billion

classified as i ncreased worldwide posture that funding covered the cost of higher operating tempo for forces that are deployed the cost of airlifting supplies and setting up operations and additional pay for activating reservists and for active duty forces eg hazardous duty pay according to dod that 65 billion request represented rough estimate of the additional funding that might be necessary to conduct ope rations in afghanistan for six months or until midmarch 2002 since these funds are not specifically tagged for afghanistan the administration can also use them for other operations such as the deployment of us troops to the philippi nes the request was designed to ensure that funding for operations in afghanista n was covered until bout midmarch after the convening of the next session of cong ress with rapid and unpredictable changes in the situation in afghanistan any estimate of costs is uncertain the second largest category of funding 6 billion for increased situational
