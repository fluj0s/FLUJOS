air piracy cases in the early 1970s the us supreme court held unconstitutional the imposition of capital punishment under the procedures th employed by the federal government and most of the states1 in 1974 congress establishe d revised procedure for imposition of the death penalty in certain air piracy cases2 in 1994 when congress made the procedural adjustments necessa ry to revive the death penalty as sentencing option for other federal capital offenses it replaced the air piracy procedures with those of the new regime3 at least one court however held that the new procedures could not be applied retroactively to air piracy cases occurring after the 1974 fix but before the 1994 legislation in the absence of an explicit statutory provision4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33395crs2 5 an individual convicted of violating section 46502 of title 49 united states code or its predecessor may be sentenced to death in accordance with the procedures established in chapter 228 of title 18 united states code if for any offense committed before the enactment of the violent crime control nd law enforcement act of 1994 public law 103322 but after the enactment of the antih ijacking act of 1974 public law 93366 it is determined by the finder of fact before c onsideration of the factors set forth in sections 3591a2 and 3592a and c of title 18 united states code that one or more of the factors set forth in former section 46503c 2 of title 49 united states code or its predecessor has been proven by the govern ment to exist beyond reasonable doubt and that none of the factors set forth in form er section 46503c1 of title 49 united states code or its predecessor has been proven by the defendant to exist by preponderance of the information the meaning of the term especi ally heinous cruel or depraved as used in the factor set forth in former section 46503c2biv of title 49 united states code or its predecessor shall be narrowed by addi ng the limiting language in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse to the victim and shall be construed as when that term is used in section 3592c6 of title 18 united states code 211a pl 109177 120 stat 230 2006 adding subs

hijacking offenses resulting in death that also occurred before the effective date of the sentencing guidelines on november 1 1987 th maximum penalty available would be life imprisonment under the presentencing guide lines structure even prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment were eligible for parole hearing after serving only ten years while there is split in the circuit courts of appeals as to whether sentencing judge can impose sentence that could avert the 10year paro hearing requirement the current position of the bureau of prisons is that prisoner is elig ible for parole hearing after serving ten years of life sentence even if parole is denied on that first occasion such prisoners are eligible to have regularly scheduled parole hearings every two years thereafter moreover in addition to parole eligibility after ten years th old sentencing and parole laws incorporatedthe reauthorization act adds an ex plicit provision to the end of the 1994 legislation5 the amendment provides for the pplication of the existing federal capital punishment procedures 18 usc ch228 after consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors in pl ace in capital air piracy cases prior to the 1994 revival6 it also provides for severance should any of the pre1994 factors be found constitutionally invalid and include s limiting definition of the especially heinous cruel or depraved aggravatin g factor in section 46503 to avoid the vagueness problems that might otherwise attend the use of such an aggravating factor7 the conference report on the reauthorization act notes that the changes apply to relative small group of individuals responsible for murders committed during the course of hijackings in the mid 1980s w ho would otherwise be eligible for parole within 10 years of sentencing and could not be effectively sentenced to more than 30 years in prison8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33395crs3 presumption that even persons sentenced to life imprisonment would be released after more than 30 years in the context of the i ndividuals responsible for the hijacking incidents described above most of the perpetrators we re older than in their twenties when they committed their crimes the imposition of preguidelines sentence of life imprisonment for these defendants means that many if not all of them could be expect to be released from prison well within their lifetime given the gravity of these offenses coupled with the longstanding congressional intent to have d eath penalty available for the offense of air piracy resulting in death such result would be at odds with the clear directive of congress 9 28 usc ch 154 10 28 usc 2266b 11 28 usc 2266c 12 calderon v ashmus 523 us 740 743 1998 13 at least for short period of time arizona was qualified to opt in cf

this by empowering the chief prosecutor in the united states the attorney general to make these decisions giving federal prosecutors control over even part of the federal judiciarys docket and

the appropriateness of c onfining relief to those who can establish their innocence27 critics claimed the amendment was unnece ssary and that great care should be taken before closing the doors of the federa l courts to claims that state criminal court has convicted an accused and imposed the death penalty in an unconstitutional manner28 some observers might have suggest that the participation of victims in the habeas process is more likely to prolong it than to streamline it capital procedures in drug cases prior to the reauthorization act federa l law provided two ts of death penalty procedures for capital drug cases the pro cedures applicable in federal capital cases generally29 and the procedures specifically applicable in federal capital drug cases30 the two procedures were virtually identical and either might be employed in capitaldrug case 31 the reauthorization act eliminates the specific drug case procedures so that only the general procedures apply in such cases according to the conference report this eliminates duplicative deat h procedures under title 21 of the united states code and consolidates procedur governing all federal death penalty prosecutions in

sixth amendment directs that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the ri ght to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed42 the supreme court in united states v cabrales held that in light of these provisions the crime of mone laundering committed in flor ida could not be tried in missouri where the laundered funds had been criminally generated absent other circumstances43 shortly thereafter the court held in united states v rodriguez moreno that the crime of using firearm during and in relation to the crime of kidnaping could be tried in new jersey into which the victim had been carried notwithstanding the fact that the firearm was acquired and used in maryland after the victim had been moved there from new jersey the court reasoned 1 that crime may be tried wherever one of its conduct elements occu rs 2 that the kidnaping constituted conduct element of the offense of using firearm during and in relation to the crime of kidnaping 3 that the kidnaping was form of continuous conduct beginning where the victim was seized in texas and continuing to new jersey and then into maryland until he was released or escaped 4 that the kidnaping could be tried in new jersey and 5 consequently the firearm use charge could be tried in new jersey44 it is not clear how the proposal would have fared in light of cabrales and rodriguezmoreno it says the trial for any offense punishable by death shall be held in the district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began

conduct affecting inters tate or foreign commerce occurs even if the offense itself is committed entirely in another district the cabrales money generating drug trafficking in missouri would seem to qua lify as conduct related to the laundering in florida for purposes of the proposal and yet in cabrales that was not enough nor would the proposal always appear to meet rodriguezmoreno s conduct
