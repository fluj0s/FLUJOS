that char acterized conflict in world war ii korea and operations desert storm and iraqi freedom in th middle east have become the exceptions in american warfare since the american revoluti on the army has conducted stability operations which have included counterinsurgency operations over the past halfcentury alone the army gained considerable experience in fighting insu rgents in southeast asia vietnam laos philip pines latin america colombia peru salvad or guatemala nicaragua africa somalia southwest asia afghanistan and now the middl east iraq dealing with counterinsurgency since the vietnam war has fallen largely on sof however conventional forces have frequently come into contact with insurgent forces that seek to neutralize the inherent advantages of size weaponry and conventional force ttp insurgents use combination of actions that include ter ror assassination kidnapping murder guerrilla tactics such as ambushes booby traps and im provised explosive devices aimed at us and multin ational forces the host countrys leaders and ordinary citizens the stunning victory over saddam husseins army in 2003 validated us conventional force ttp but the ensuing aftermath of instability has caused review of lessons from the armys historical experience and those of the other services and multinational partners one of the key recurring lessons is that the united states cannot win ot her countries wars for them but can certainly help legitimate foreign governme nts overcome attempts to overth row them us forces can assist country confronted by an insurgency by provid ing safe and secure environment at the local level and continuously building on the incremental success the impetus for this fmi came from the iraq insurgency and the realization that engagements in the global war on terrorism gwot would likely use counterinsurgency ttps conse quently this fmi reviews what we know about counterinsurgency and explains the fundamen tals of military operations in counterinsurgency environment counterinsurgency description counterinsurgency is those military param ilitary political economic psychological and civic actions taken by government to defeat insurgency jp 102 it is an offensive approach involv ing all elements of national power it can take place across the range of operations and spectrum of conflict it supports and influences an hns idad program it includes strategic and opera tional planning intelligence development and anal ysis training materiel technical and organ izational assistance advice infrastructure develo pment tacticallevel operations and many ele ments of psyop generally the preferred meth ods of support are through assistance and development programs leaders must consider the roles of military intelligence diplomatic law enforcement information finance and economic elements midlife in counterinsurgency vi introduction types of support indirect support emphasizes the principles of hn selfsufficiency and builds strong national in frastructures through economic and military capab ilities it includes security assistance joint and multinational exercises and exchange programs direct support not involving combat operations involves the use of us forces providing direct assistance to the hn civilian populace or militar these are jointor servicefunded do not usu ally involve the transfer of arms and equipment and do not usually include training local mili tary forces direct support not involving combat operations includes civilmilitary operations intelligence and communications sharing and logistics direct support involving combat operations in troduces the use of us combat forces into coun terinsurgency operations the use of combat forces is presidential decision and serves only as temporary or provisional solution until hn forces are able to stabilize the situation and provide security for the populace counterinsurgency responsibilities regional combatant commanders are responsible fo r conducting planning preparing executing and assessing military operations in their areas of responsibility in support of counterinsur gency close coordination with the us ambassa dor or diplomatic representative and country team within supported hns is essential in order to build an effective regional counterinsurgency program planning imperatives commanders consider longerterm strategic and operational effects of all us assistance efforts before executing counterinsurgency operations they tailor military support of counterinsur gency operations to the environment and the spec ific needs of the supported hn and understand that basic premise of counterinsurgency is that the ultimate responsibility rests with the hn regional combatant commanders may develop theate r strategies or campaign plans that support the cjcs taskings regardless of how commanders may tailor the planning process military activities in support of counterinsurgency requir ements are integrated into concepts and plans at the operational and tactical levels counterinsurgency planning procedures and considerations counterinsurgency operations are often conduc ted in joint environment army commanders and leaders should be familiar with joint planning procedures the five phases of joint deliberate planning proc edures and considerations are initiation concept development and review plan development plan review and supporting plans the initiation phase begins with the combatant commanders rece ipt of planning guidance from cjcs concept

chapter 1 overview definition of insurgency 11 an insurgency is organized movement aimed at th overthrow of constituted govern ment through use of subversion and armed co nflict jp 102 it is protracted politico military struggle designed to weaken governme nt control and legitimacy while increasing insurgent control political power is the central issue in an insurgency 12 each insurgency has its own unique characte ristics based on its strategic objectives its operational environment available resources operational method and tactics for example an insurgency may be based on mass mobilizatio n through political action or the foco the ory insurgencies frequently seek to overthrow the existing social order and reallocate power within the country 13 the goal of an insurgency is to mobilize human and material resources in order to form an alternative to the state this alternative is called the counterstate the counterstate may have much of the infrastructure possessed by th state itself but this must normally be hid den since it is illegal thus th counterstate is often referred to by the term clandestine in frastructure as the insurgents gain confiden ce and power the clandestine infrastructure may become more open as observed historically in communist regions during the chinese revolution in south vietnam after the north vietnamese 1972 easter offensive and in co lombia in the summer of 1998 14 successful mobilization provides active and passive support for the insurgencys pro grams operations and goals at the national level mobilization grows out of dissatisfaction by some elite members with existing political ec onomic or social conditions at the regional level members of an elite have become margin alized that is they have become psychologi cally alienated from the system and have est ablished links with followers by bringing them into the counterstate at the local district and provincelevels local movement representa tives called the cadre address local grievances and do recruiting the cadre gives credit to the insurgent movement for all local solutions loyalty to the insurgent movement is nor mally won through deeds but may occur through appeal to abstract principles promises to end hunger or eliminate poverty may appeal to segment of the population while appeals to eliminate foreign presence or establish gove rnment based on religious or political ideol ogy may appeal to others nonetheless these promises and appeals are associated with tan gible solutions and deeds elements of the insurgency 15 an insurgent organization norm ally consists of four elements z leadership z combatants main forces regi onal forces local forces z cadre local political leaders that are also called the militants z mass base the bulk of the membership 11 fmi 30722 the proportions relative to the larger movement depend upon the strategic approach adopted by the insurgency to the extent state presence has been eliminated in particular areas the four elements can exist openly to the extent the state remains continuous or oc casional presence the elements must maintain clandestine existence leadership 16 leadership figures engage in command and control of the insurgent movement they are the idea people and planners they see soluti ons to the grievances of society in structural terms they believe that only altering the way the institutions and practices of society fit to gether will result in real change reforms an d changes in personalities are deemed insuffi cient to liberate or redeem society histor ically insurgencies have coalesced around unifying leader ideology and organization howe ver this precedent can longer be as sumed it is possible that many leaders at th head of several organizations with different ideologies but united by single goal of overth rowing the government or ridding the country of foreign presence will emerge combatants 17 the combatants do the actual fighting an d are often mistaken for the movement itself this they are not they exist only to carry out the same functions as the police and armed forces of the state they only constitute part of the movement along with the planners and idea people in many insurgencies the combatan ts maintain local control as well as protect and expand the counterstate combatants who secure local areas are the local forces the cal forces use terror initially to intimidate and establish local control and later to enforce the will of the leadership they conduct limited am bushes of government forces and police also combatants who link local areas and provide regi onal security are the regional forces both of these elements normally are tied to specific ao main forces in contrast are the heavy units of the insurgent movement and may be deployed in any ao rather than employing terror local forces and guerrilla warfare the ma in activity of regional forces they engage in mobile warfare and positional warfare bo th subsumed under the conventional warfare rubric but different in emphasis when used by insurgents due to the growing possibility of separate leaders in different regions with vari ous goals this forcerole linkage may not be present instead independent insurgent leader s may carry on military operations to include terror independent of other insurgent forces conventional warfare may be minimized ul timately time is on the side of the insurgent fear intimidation and violencecoupled with the television and internetmay achieve the so cial upheaval the insurgent seeks and force foreign powers to abandon the hn because of pressures from their own people at home cadre 18 the cadre is the political activists and loca l political leaders of the insurgency they are referred to as militants since they are actively engaged in struggling to accomplish insurgent goals the insurgent movement provides guid ance and procedures to the cadre and the cadre use these to assess the grievances in loca l areas and carry out activities that satisfy those grievances they then attribute the solu tions they have provided to the insurgent movement itself deeds are the key to making insurgent slogans meaningful to the popula tion larger societal issues such as foreign presence facilitate such action because these larger issues may be blamed for lifes smalle r problems insurgents however may have regard for popular dissent or local grievances th insurgents play by rules and they will use fear as means to intimidate the popula ce and thereby prevent cooperation with the hn 12 overview mass base 19 the mass base consists of the followers of the insurgent movement that are the popula tion of the counterstate mass base members are recruited and indoctrinated by the cadre who implement instructions and procedures pr ovided by the insurgent leadership though they do not actively fight for the insurgen cy mass base members provide intelligence and supplies mass base members may continue in th eir normal positions in society but many will either lead second clandestine lives for the insurgent movement or even pursue new fulltime positions within the insurgency co mbatants normally begin as members of the mass base before becomi ng armed manpower 110 the insurgent leadership thus provides organizational and managerial skills to trans form regions into an effective base for armed political action while the cadre accomplishes this same transformation at the community and mobilized individual level what results as in any armed conflict is contest of resource mobilization and force deployment state is challenged by counterstate objective force level guarantees victory for either side it is frequently stated that 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 rati of counterinsurgents to insurgents is neces sary for counterinsurgency victory in realit research has demonstrated time and again there are valid ratios that when met guaran tee victory as in conventional war correla tion of forces in an insurgency depends upon the situation though objective and valid force correlation ratios do not exist counterinsurgen cy has been historically manpower intensive time which often works on the side of the insurg ent just as often places serious constraints upon counterinsurgent courses of action origins and causes 111 rising up against constituted authority has been present throughout history the causes for such uprisings have been as num erous as human conditions uprisings against indigenous regimes have normally been termed rebellions uprisings against an external occupying power have normally been termed r esistance movements historical particulars can at times combine the two 112 rebellions and resistance movements are tr ansformed into an insurgency by their in corporation into an armed political campaign s ee figure 11 page 14 popular desire to resist is used by an insurgent movement to accomplish the insurgents political goal the in surgency thus mounts political challenge to th state through the formation of or desire to create counterstate 113 the desire to form counterstate grows from the same causes that galvanize any po litical campaign these causes can range from th desire for greater equity in the distribu tion of resources poverty alone is rarely if ever sufficient to sustain an insurgency to demand that foreign occupation end increasin gly religious ideology has become catalyst for insurgent movements the support of the people then is the center of gravity it must be gained in whatever proportion is necessary to sustain the insurgent movement or contrari wise to defeat it as in any political campaign all levels of support are relative the goal is mobilization such that the enemy may be defe ated this necessarily will depend as much upon the campaign approach that is operationa l art and tactics adopted as upon more stra tegic concerns of support operational and tact ical use of violence as an insurgent strategy has become increasingly commonpla ce objects of violence can be anything the insurgents deem to be obstructions to their cause this ca n be hn forces foreign forces aid workers ci vilians who do not accept the insurgents claims and infrastructure 114 violence is the most potent weapon avail able to insurgents nonetheless violence can alienate when not linked to vision of bette r life violence is often accompanied by vari ety of nonviolent means that act as potent weapon in an external propaganda war and as sist recruiting historically astute movements ve recognized the efficacy of both means to 13 fmi 30722 the extent they have fielded discrete units charged with nonviolent action for example strikes in the transportation sector to supplem ent violent action the insurgents in algeria rarely defeated french forces in the field they employed indiscriminate violence success fully initiated nonviolent strikes developed associated propaganda for external use and thereby handily won their war peoples war in its chinese and vietnamese variants did this also figure 11 insurgency development 115 insurgent movements begin as fire in the minds of men insurgent leaders commit themselves to building new world they cons truct the organization to carry through this desire generally popular grieva nces become insurgent causes when interpreted and shaped by the insurgent leadership the insurgency grow s if the cadre that is local insurgent leaders and representatives can establish link between the insurgent movement and the desire for solutions to grievances sought by the local popu lation this link does not always exist self serving insurgent leaders with regard for cal conditions may launch an insurgency even if the population supports the hn and has few grievances this can occur when the hn gov ernment is weak or even nonexistent because of other factors if the cadre is able to indoctri nate and control the mobilized local manpower often by creating climate of fear and the cadre respond to higher commands with independ ent tactical action the insurgency will be operationally and strategically unified if the opposite is true the insurgency will remain uncoordinated and decentralized 116 insurgent leaders will exploit opportunities created by government security force ac tions the behavior of security forces is critical lack of curity force discipline leads to alienation and security force abuse of the popu lace is very effective insurgent recruiting tool consequently specific insurgent tactical actions are often planned to frequently elicit overreaction from security force individuals an d units overreaction can result from poorly drawn roe and even strategic and operational planning that abets brutalizing recalcitrant population increasingly the use of religious shrines for offensive insurgent actions can be seen as attempts to achieve such an overreac tion such actions can create perception of hn and foreign military forces as oppre ssors rather than as liberators 14 overview insurgent doctrine 117 insurgent doctrine determines how insurg ents actually implement the two types of in surgency defensive insurgency has much in common with resistance movement since the counterstate already exists and will normally adopt overt techniques necessary for self defense an offensive insurgency on the other hand is faced with the task of creating the counterstate from scratch to do th is there are two basic approaches z mass mobilization first approach is to emphas ize mobilization of the masses this course places premium upon political action by the cadre in local areas with strategic and operational directives coming from above emphasizing mass mobili zation results in hierarchical tightly controlled coordinated movement the in surgent movement that results will resemble pyramid in its manpower distribu tion with the combatants the smallest part of the movement the apex of the pyramid z armed action second approach emphasizes ar med action this course favors violence rather than mass mobilization and normally results in an inverted pyra mid with the combatants themselves the bulk of the movement this was the ap proach taken by castro in cuba during the 1950s and may be an approach some in surgents in iraq have taken against the postsaddam government although some efforts to mobilize have been reported mass mobilization 118 mass base sustains the first approach the second approach has much smaller sup port base the support base will not have th numbers of the mass base generated by the mobilization approach 119 if emphasis is upon mass mobilization the combatants exist to facilitate the accom plishment of the political goals of the insurgent movement in local areas terror and guer rilla action are used to eliminate resistance either from individuals who are opposed to the movement or from the local armed representati ves of the state initially the police and mili tia but later the military main force units wh ich are guerrilla units that have been regu larized or turned into rough copies of gove rnment units but are usually more mobile and lightly armed are used to deal with the stat inevitable deployment of the military the purpose of main forces is to engage in mobile or maneuver warfare the intent is forceon force action to destroy govern ment main force units tactics may include major battles as well as ambushes and smallscal engagements these battles and engagements result in the securing and expansion of the counterstate which may be clandestine in all or part but are not designed to seize and hold positions as in co nventional warfare this occurs only in posi tional warfare though the terminology is dr awn especially from soviet usage the north vietnamese army nva and the viet cong vc used both mobile and positional warfare throughout the war in vietnam examples of insurgencies that used the mass mobilization approach follow z the nva and vc frequently deployed battalions and regiments using classic mo bile warfare even as terror and guerrilla action continued against us forces from 1965 until the us withdrawal from vietnam in 1973 z classic positional warfare was seen three times in the vietnam war the tet offen sive in januaryfebruary 1968 the spring 1972 easter offensive which resulted in the permanent seizure and loss of portions of south vietnamese territory and the spring 1975 offensive which saw the fall of south vietnam and its absorption into unified vietnam in the latter two of these campaigns enemy divisions and corps were used with terror and guerrilla ac tion assuming the role of special opera tions in support of conventional operations during tet the nva employed all 52 15 fmi 30722 vc battalions exclusively and multiple ba ttalions attacked objectives simultane ously though these battalions were under individual command and control z more recently in salvador where the united states successfully supported counterinsurgency government forces tw ice in 1981 and 1989 had to beat back positional warfare offensives designed to seize widespread areas including tions of the nations capital z in colombia where the us is similarly involved in support of the counterinsur gency the insurgents of farc fuerzas armadas revolucionarias colombia initiated their mobile warfare phase in 1996 there followed string of colombian army defeats that culminated in farc po sitional warfare attack that seized department capital mitu in mid1998 the relief of mitu galvanized military re form effort that led to go vernment success in half do zen major mobile war battles fought between 1998 and 2001 the largest of these involved farc force of eight battalionequivalents engaged by an equal number of colombian army coun terguerrilla battalions farc consequently returned to an emphasis upon terror and guerrilla action z in nepal where us assistance has play ed an important role in government coun terinsurgency the mass mobilization approach adopted by the communist party of nepal maoist or cpn m has progressed in classic fashion widespread use of terror and guerrilla action has been comp lemented by mobile warfare to overrun government positions of up to company si ze mobile warfare targets have been cho sen operationally that is as part of campaign planning to position the cpn m for anticipated positional war offensives notably against major population centers armed action 120 if emphasis is on the second approach ar med action the political goal is to be accom plished primarily by violence rather than ma ss mobilization the insurgents attempt to in flict such level of casualties and destructio n the state is incapable or unwilling to continue counterinsurgency actions both approaches emphasize inflicting casualties the distinction is whether mobilization or armed insurrection is the initial emphasis insurgents may also employ terrorist tactics if they lack mass base do not have the time needed to create such base or have objectives that do not requir such base in this approach the combatant force rarely moves beyond terro rist and guerrilla actions units are small and specialized frequently more than squad or platoon si zed sympathizers provide recruits for the sup port base but these sympathizers are actively in volved only occasionally though they are of ten central to the information warfare component of the insurgent campaign z an illustration of the armed action approach is the troubles of 196898 in northern ireland ulster an initial mass mobilization approach followed by the provisional irish republican army was pene trated by the state hence it was aban doned in favor of cellular active service unit methodology normally composed of more than 300 people the active rvice unit network engaged almost exclu sively in terror actions and was sustained by support base that numbered only in the thousands out of total 15 million population in an area the size of connecti cut sympathizers came overwhelmingly from minority within the catholic com munity thus forming minority within minority at its peak however this sym pathetic base proved capable of mustering 17 percent of the votes in democratic elections and served to keep open to ques tion the legitimacy of british rule which was actually favored by substantial majority z more recently the insurgents in iraq and afghanistan have used the armed action approach terror and lowlevel guerrilla acti on have been focused on the indigenous supporters and infrastructure of the new regimes in baghdad and kabul simulta neously attacks on us forces have sought to inflict casualties to break the will of 16 overview the us public to continue the insurgents have recognized that the indigenous re gimes cannot continue in the shortterm without us backing and assistance nei ther will the new regimes be able to conti nue if their populations can be suitably terrorized into sullen neutrality as the us begins to withdraw dynamics of insurgency 121 there are seven dynamics that are commo n to most insurgencies these dynamics pro vide framework for analysis that can reveal the insurgencys strengths and weaknesses although analysts can examine the following dyna mics separately they must study their in teraction to fully understand the insurgency these seven dynamics are z leadership z ideology z objectives z environment and geography z external support z phasing and timing leadership 122 leadership is critical to any insurgency insurgency is not simply random political vio lence it is directed and focused political violen ce it requires leadership to provide vision di rection to establish and set the longterm way ahead shortterm guidance coordination and organizational coherence insurgent leaders mu st make their cause known to the people and gain popular support although theoretically th insurgent leader desires to gain popular support for the cause that desire is often accompanied by terror campaign against those who do not support the insurgents goals thei r key tasks are to break and supplant the ties between the people and the government and to establish legitimacy for their movement their education family social and religious connections and position s may contribute to their ability to think clearly communicate organi ze and lead an insurgency or their lack of education and connections may delay or impa ir their access to positions where they are able to exercise leadership 123 insurgencies are dynamic political moveme nts resulting from real or perceived griev ance or neglect that leads to alienation fr om an established government alienated elite members advance alternatives to existing condit ions culture defines elites for example in most of the world educators and teachers are members of the elite in islamic and many catholic nations religious leaders are elite mbers as their movement grows leaders cide which body of doctrine to adopt in the mass mobilization approach leaders recruit indoctrinate and deploy the cadre necessary to carry out the actions of the movement in the armed action approach there is often much more decentralized mode of operations but this is usually guided by central organi zation extreme decentralization results in movement that rarely functions as coherent body but is neve rtheless capable of inflicting substantial casualties and damage 124 the power base of some insurgencies is co llective and does not depend on specific lead ers or personalities to be effective such insu rgencies are easier to penetrate but recover rap idly when they lose key personnel other orga nizations depend on charismatic personality to provide cohesion motivation and focal poin t for the movement organizations led in this way can make decisions and initiate new action s rapidly but they are vulnerable to disrup tions if key personalities are removed or coopted 17 fmi 30722 objectives 125 effective analysis of an insurgency requir interpreting strategic operational and tac tical objectives understanding the root causes of the insurgency is essential to analyzing the insurgents objectives the strategic objective is the insurgents desired end state the seizure of political power and the overthrow of an ex isting government operational objectives are the decisive points military political and id eological along lines of operation toward the strategic objective and they are the means to link tactical goals with strategic end states one of the political decisive points is the tota l destruction of governme nt legitimacy tactical objectives are the immediate aims of insurgent acts tactical objectives can be psychological and physical in nature some examples incl ude the dissemination of psyop products in timidation psychological objective and the ttack and seizure of key facility physical objective ideology 126 in its ideology an insurgency sets forth po litical alternative to the existing state both theoretically and actually it offers vision of counterstate the most powerful ideologies tap latent emotive concerns of the populace such as the desire for justice the creation of an idealized religious state or lib eration from foreign occupation ideology influences the insur gents perception of the environment by provid ing the prism to include vocabulary and ana lytical categories through which the situation is assessed the result is that ideology shapes the movements organization and operational methods environment and geography 127 environment and geography including cult ural and demographic factors affect all par ticipants in conflict the manner in which in surgents and counterinsurgents adapt to these realities creates advantages and disadvantages for each the effects of these factors are im mediately visible at the tactical level where they are perhaps the predominant influence on decisions regarding force structure and doctrine including ttp insurgency in an urban environment often presents different set of pl anning considerations than in rural environ ments these planning considerations affect structure and ttp directly external support 128 the need for access to external resource s and sanctuaries has been constant through out the history of insurgencies rarely if ever has an insurgent force been able to obtain the arms and equipment particularly ammunition ne cessary for decisive action from within the battle area external support can provide polit ical psychological an d material resources that might otherwise be limited or totally unavailable 129 recent phenomenon has been the advent of internal sanctuaries these may be in the form of religious structures they may be larg cities where neither hn nor external military forces are sufficiently strong to counter the insurgents phasing and timing 130 insurgencies often pass th rough common phases of development the conceptualization generally followed by insurgents is drawn from that postulated by mao zedong regardless of its provenance movements as diverse as comm unist or islamic insurgencies have used the maoist conceptualization because it is logi cal and based upon the mass mobilization empha sis it states that insurgents are first on the strategic defensive phase i move to stalemate phase ii and finally go over to the offens ive phase iii strategic movement from one phase to another incorporates the operational an d tactical activity typical of earlier phases it does not end them the north vietnamese explicit ly recognized this reality in their war of 18 overview interlocking doctrine which held that all forms of warfare occur simultaneously even as particular form is paramount 131 not all insurgencies experience every phas and progression through all phases is not requirement for success the same insurgent mo vement may be in different phases in dif ferent regions of country succe ssful insurgencies can also revert to an earlier phase when under pressure resuming development when favorable conditions return 132 political organization occurs throughout ll phases while on the fensive however in phase i per mao movement will necessarily fight the war of the weak emphasizing ter ror and guerrilla action these will be used to eliminate resistance from individuals and local government presence especially the police invariably the government must commit its main force units normally the army to reclai m what it has lost knowing this insurgents form their own main force units these are used to defeat government forces in detail as the latter disperse to engage in area domination it is through such action that stalemate phase ii is achieved the governments forces in th contest of armed power are systematically neutralized through mobile or maneuver force onforce warfare only in phase iii does transition to the holding of position occu r hence the term positional warfare 133 if the insurgents adopt the armed action approach these phases do not necessarily ap ply inflicting an unsustainable level of pain on hn or external military forces may eliminate the need to form main force units pressure from within the hn or country providing the forces may lead to capitulation or withdrawal in attacking democratic societies insurgents using this approach attempt to tap the purpor ted aversion of democratic societies to pro tracted costly conflicts that appear endless they seek to break the will of the state to tinue the struggle state approach to insurgency 134 successful counterinsurgency results in the neutralization by the state of the insur gency and its effort to form counterstate wh ile many abortive insurgencies are defeated by military and police actions alone if an insurg ency has tapped into serious grievances and has mobilized significant portion of the popula tion simply returning to the status quo may not be an option reform may be necessary but reform is matter for the state using all of its human and material resource s security forces are only on such resource the response must be multifaceted and coordinated yet stat typically charge their security forces with waging counterinsurgency this th security forces cannot do alone 135 the state first decides upon its goal resto ration of legitimate government writ then produces plan to accomplish that end all ements of national power are assigned their roles in carrying out the plan the governme nt establishes the legal framework and com mand and control c2 mechanisms to enable the plan to be implemented z the legal framework normally includes ries of extraordinary measures that are associated with emergency situations or even martial law it will frequently ex pand military powers into areas delegated solely to the police in normal times z historically effective c2 architecture s involved setting up local coordinating bodies with representation from all key pa rties this local body directs the counter insurgency campaign in the ao concerne d though one individual will have the lead minimally such coordinating body includes appropriate representatives from the civil authority the military the police the intelligence services and though not always the civil population th most effective use of coordinating bod ies has given permanentparty individuals fo r example district officers responsi bility for counterinsurgency c2 in their aos and control over civil or military assets sent into their aos reinforced intelligence bodies in particular have been as 19 fmi 30722 signed as permanent party involvement of local officials and civilians can defeat the insurgents attempt to undermine the political system 136 hn military and police forces must be the most visible force to the people security forces sent into an area to engage in counterinsurgency perform as follows z strategically they serve as the shield for carrying out reform it is imperative that hn military and police forces protect the populace and defend their own bases while simultaneously fighting an insurgency z operationally they systematically restore government control z tactically security forces eliminate insu rgent leadership cadre and combatants through death and capture by coopting in dividual members or by forcing insur gents to leave the area this is analogous to separating the fish from the sea the local populations that also provide the insurgent mass base are then secure and able to engage in normal activities the force s also assist with civic action projects these actions convey to the people sens of progress and concern by the govern ment 137 the counterinsurgency plan analyzes the bas is of the insurgency in order to determine its form centers of gravity and insurgent vu lnerabilities these dictate the most effective type force to employ either police militia and military or primarily military and police the counterinsurgency plan details the scheme to reclaim what has been lost and establish priority of effort and timelines concurrently it outlines how the government intends to cure the critical infrastructure of the stat and the governments centers of power 138 counterinsurgency operations must balance elimination of grievances that is reform to include elimination of human rights abuses and security force action that eliminates the insurgents the security forces provide the popu lace the protection necessary for the restora tion of government presence basic services and control 139 counterinsurgency plans and operations expl oit shifts in the internal or external situa tion that work against the insurgent and favor th state this normally involves an extended period of time protracted wa r this makes it difficult for representative governments to sustain counterinsurgency campaigns particul arly in the present world environment where there appears to be lack of overt sustaine d agreement regarding strategic interests ends and means and operational and tactical concerns 140 when supporting counterinsurgency the us and its multinational partners assist the hn in implementing sustainable approach to the extent the hn has its basic institutions and security forces intact the burden upon us and multinational forces and resources is lessened to the extent the hn is lacking basic institutions and functions the burden upon the us and multinational forces is increased in the extreme rather than building upon what is the us and other nations will find themselves creating elements such as local forces and government institutions of the soci ety they have been sent to assist military forces thus become involved in nation building while simultaneously attempting to defeat an insurgency us forces often lead because the us military can quickly project and sustain force this involves them in host of current activities regarded as nonstandard from pervising elections to restoring power an d facilitating and conducting schooling 141 leaders and planning staff need to be aw are that there will always be constraints upon the prosecution of counterinsurgency constraint s must be identified and analyzed system atically because they impact upon the conduct of operations at all levels they ought to be reevaluated regularly the bottom line is that fo rces have to operate in the environment as it is not as they might wish it to be some constraints may include z time strategic or political factors may dictate the time frame during which condi tions for success must be achieved see chapter 2 110 overview z means the means for example weapons equipment mature concepts and ttp available are likely to be limited see chapter 3 and appendix c z legal the international us and hn legal frameworks place constraints on the conduct of operations for example roe powers of arrest ability to prosecute and rules of evidence powers of detentio n see chapter 2 and appendix j z geography in addition to terrain factors there may be areas where for reasons of political cultural religious or environmen tal sensitivity the ability to conduct op erations is constrained moderated limited or prohibited for example crossborder operations hot pursuit and bombing sanc tuaries see chapters 2 and 4 and the six associated appendixes z domestic and international considerations events in the theater of opera tions are likely to be subject to media scru tiny and reporting both accurate and in accurate it is reality that us domestic and international considerations must be weighed and these may limit how operations are conducted see chapters 2 and 3 and appendix c z multinational partners multinational partners may have differing political and legal imperatives the need to maintain cohesiveness among members of coalition may affect us force behavior see chapter 2 z host nation the hns leadership culture and politics among many possible fac tors generate wide range of pressures some conflicting upon the military that must be considered carefully these create further source of constraints or limita tions see chapter 2 appendix and appendix b 111 chapter 2 command and control in counterinsurgency environment section i introduction general 21 counterinsurgency has certain imperatives that make planning for it different from other missions planners consider these impe ratives when developing counterinsurgency plans these imperatives are z facilitate establishment or reestablishment of legitimate hn government z counterinsurgency requires perseverance z foster popular support for th hn and us governments z prepare to perform functions and conduct op erations that are outside normal scope of training z coordinate with us governmental depa rtments and agencies and with hn non governmental and foreign agencies 22 insurgencies are protracted politicomilit ary struggles with political power as the cen tral issue therefore military planners ensure closer more effective coordination of mili tary operations between the country team in teragency personnel the hn and military or ganizations than would exist during conventional operations this coordination is normally at the strategic and operational levels us government policy towards the hn and the insur gents is the overriding determinant for military action 23 planners consider longterm effects of ll us assistance efforts before executing coun terinsurgency operations this longterm consid eration is especially important in building hn development and defense selfsufficiency both of which may require large investments of time and materiel counterinsurgency operatio ns also require extensive logistic planning because of the probability of having to provid food and shelter for displaced persons and construction or repair of services such as wa ter planners also reco gnize the ultimate objec tive is to assist the hn in establishing government that is legiti mate responsive to the people and capable of meeting their needs and worthy of their loyalty 24 planners tailor military support to othe r elements of counterinsurgency operations while considering the environment and the specific needs of the hn they consider the threat as well as local political tribal religio us social and economic factors when develop ing counterinsurgency plans overcoming the tend ency to use us frame of reference is im portant because this potentially damaging tend ency can result in equipment training and infrastructure not at all suitable for the hn 25 planners understand that basic premise of the counterinsurgency approach is the ul timate responsibility for idad rests with the hn us planners assess all counterinsurgency plans against this precept 21 fmi 30722 26 political and military leaders realistically evaluate troop requirements in counterin surgency environment in addition to those ta sks inherent in any military situationsuch as base security and offensive operationssome ta sks occur with greater frequency in counter insurgency and deserve special attention among these are z urban operations z protection of government facilities z protection of infrastructure z protection of commercial enterprises vital to the hn economy z protection of cultural facilities z prevention of looting z military police functions z close interaction with civilians z assistance with reconstruction projects z securing the hn borders z training or retraining hn military forces z establishing and maintaining local government credibility 27 faced with these additional tasks the joint force may be required to provide more units and different mix of units than would be required for operations against conven tional force the same approximate size as the insurgent force the preponderance of many of these units may only be available in the re serve components all planning considers the longterm implications and second andthird order effects of counterinsurgency missions counterinsurgency is longterm approach and effort requiring support from political and military leaders additionally leaders must re cognize counterinsurgency operations may in volve nation building counterinsurgency often involves nation building but not all nation building involves counterinsurgency 28 at all levels the conduct planning prep aring execution and assessment of counter insurgency operations involves coordination among hn forces and agencies us organiza tions multinational partners and ngos that may influence the mission fundamental conditions 29 planning for counterinsurgency focuses on the following conditions that the force must establish to be successful secure populace 210 security of the populace is an imperative this is security from the influence of the in surgents initially the population is then mob ilized armed and trained to protect itself ef fective security allows local political and admi nistrative institutions to operate freely and commerce to flourish established local political institutions 211 establishing conditions favorable for the development of hn governmental institutions consistent with us objectives these conditio ns include the establishment of law enforce ment and freely elected political leaders where possible public information health care schools public works and fire fighting capabilities contributing local government 212 contributing local government is both ta ngible and psychological local security forces must reinforce and be integrated into the plan at every stage this local integration is 22 command and control in counterinsurgency environment stantly emphasized with the local and hn police and civil and military leaders through deeds to ensure these forces have great visi bility with the populace psychologically the populace must be assured continuously and effe ctively that conditions are becoming better to counter insurgent propaganda counterinsurgency

insurgencies are armed political movements protracted politicomilitary struggles us ing guerrilla tactics and terrorist activities planners analyze the mission and develop coun terinsurgency concepts

they may be more gen eral as in instability and social unrest this re quires civil and military leaders to also target longterm causes rather than shortterm sympto ms in the event of an insurgency planners must identify the basis of an insurgency in or der to determine its form centers of gravity and the root cause this is key because the form and centers of gravity dictate the most effec tive type force to employ police militia an d military or primarily military and police and identify insurgent vulnerabilities counterin surgency plan describes concept of opera tions to reclaim any cities

stability operations other than counterinsurgency or foreign humanitarian assistance support operation are the most effective solution for the us and the hn gov ernments intelligence estimate 223 an accurate intelligence estimate is essent ial to identify the threat upon which to base counterinsurgency efforts the intelligence estimate supporting counterinsurgency opera 24 command and control in counterinsurgency environment tions has an orientation quite different from that of conventional estimate comprehen sive and intimate knowledge of the environmen t is essential in building this estimate 224 the conventional j2 intelligence estimate concentrates on enemy situation enemy ca pabilities an analysis of thos capabilities and conclusions drawn from that analysis in counterinsurgency however planners expand this concept beyond conventional enemy analysis to focus more on the local population and its probable reactions to potential us or insurgent actions this emphasis requires know ledge of the ethnic tribal racial economic scientific technical religious and linguistic gr oups in the hn as well as their locations and an understanding of how they may perceive fu ture operations understanding the operating environment and the hns social economic and political order are essential to conducting counterinsurgency operations that support th local idad

this characteristic addresses terrain anal ysis from civilian perspective analyze how key civilian areas affect the missions of respec tive forces and how military operations affect these areas factors to consider include polit ical boundaries locati ons of government cen ters bytype enclaves special regions for exam ple mining or agricultural trade routes and possible settlement sites

using the same c2 system as in other military operations 234 c2 during counterinsurgency requires gr eater decentralization to small unit leaders normal operating methods focused around sing commanders approval often prove ineffi cient untimely and ineffective for the situat ion commanders must develop level of trust and communication with subordinates and foster their initiative well before arriving into the theater of operations commanders must empower their subordinates with clear authority for specific operations the subordinate leaders must clearly understand orders missions and the commanders intent down to the squa d and fire team level roe must be clear enough for subordinates to act appropriately if c2 and decision making become slow proc esses the insurgents can exploit this additi onally commanders often coordinate with other agencies that will not be present on conventional battlefield command and control of counterinsurgency forces 235 planning c2 in counterinsurgency environment is extremely complex based on sion requirements commanders plan to conduc t full spectrum operations anywhere within their ao and within adjacent aos after conduc ting necessary coordination therefore task organizations must have flexibility built into th em to support rapid change of focus during operations 236 in addition to other agencies us ctors may be heavily involved in counterinsur gency operations contractors management and control differs from that of soldiers and army civilians commanders make provisions fo r contractor management during planning 26 command and control in counterinsurgency environment to include using the contracting process to fine required conditions the terms and condi tions of the contract establish the relationsh ip between the military and the contractor to include command relationships authority or responsibilities commanders then exercise management control through supervisors employed by the contractor because only contrac tor can directly supervise contract pe rsonnel see fm 60 fm 310021 237 during multinational operations command and support relationships may not be well defined and therefore more open to interpretati on in some international organizations such as the north atlantic treaty organization nato command and support relationship terms may have different meanings from those in army doctrine for example the nato definitions of operational control opcon and tactical control tacon are different from us army definitions in addition other rms for command and support relationships may exist in such cases commanders seek clarif ication from their higher commander from or ders or from the agreements that established the force for example nato standardization agreements stanags commanders use

to sati sfy both jfc requirements and those of sup ported commanders the tactical commander considers sof capabilities and limitations particularly in the areas of tactical c2 stainment and overall counterinsurgency mission accomplishment 249 historically commanders have employed sof before conventional force followon op erations to ensure the timing and tempo of th overall campaign are maintained during ex tended operations involving both sof and conventional forces combined control and decon fliction measures take on added signific ance because situations change rapidly conventional unit commanders may find themse lves under sof units or sof units under conventional unit thus during counterinsurgency operations it is essential to integrate and synchronize sof with other joint and conven tional forces through joint command opera tions and intelligence fusion cell 250 special operations often involve air operat ions that transit theater airspace control ar eas air defense areas and artillery firing pa tterns therefore coordi nation of arsof opera tions is extremely important to prevent dup licate targeting and fratricide the jsotf and conventional force headquarters coordina closely to prevent these actions 251 integration of arsof with conventional forces is always major concern for arsof commanders factors they consider typically include but are not limited to z target deconfliction z command and control z political concerns z civil populace z possible linkup of arsof with conventional forces z intelligence collection efforts z airspace deconfliction z fire support coordination z graphic control measures z coordination of logistics and theater support z combat search and rescue 252 the exchange of liaison elements between the staffs of appropriate conventional forces and sof further enhances integration of all fo rces concerned this normally is accomplished through special operations liaison element this element typically works with the army special operations task force commander to ccomplish this integration but works for the joint force special operations component comma nder these liaison elements aid mission exe cution preclude fratricide and eliminate duplic ation of effort disruption of ongoing opera tions and loss of intelligence sources thes efforts are crucial to maintaining the com manders overall unity of effort coordination of limited resources and campaign tempo multinational forces 253 c2 relationships must remain flexible wi thin and among multinational forces inherent in these relationships is the possibility of competing objectives and conflicting laws of other countries us commanders remain aware of and nsitive to such conflicts depending on the 29 fmi 30722 operational and tactical environment command relationships may change over time in gen eral us forces remain under the command of us commanders it is important to note how ever that conditions determine c2 relationsh ips when foreign nations forces are avail able they may be operating either alongside or under control of us forces see jp 316 fm 1008 section v coordination 254 information sharing across us government and national boundaries is important in counterinsurgency there are likely to be severa l governmental agencies operating in hn and all are exposed daily to information valu able to counterinsurgency operations this situation requires strong focus on lateral c oordination and the development of an effective program of interagency information exchange in addition the very nature of counterinsur gency denotes the sharing of information betw een the hn and the us joint force headquar ters controlling counterinsurgency operations this information exchange may be further complicated by friendly third nation particip ating in counterinsurgency operations the us government can complicate information exchange by restricting third nations access to in formation interagency coordination governmental agencies 255 there are many organizations and extensiv resources available to aid developing na tions commanders should not overlook the ai d these organizations may provide all forces

department of commerce z central intelligence agency z department of transportation 256 various governmental depa rtments directly administer or support other governmental agencies examples of th us agencies are z us agency for international development z the us coast guard under department of homeland security z the federal bureau of investigatio n under department of justice z immigration customs enforcement under department of homeland security z federal communications commission z peace corps nongovernmental organizations 257 nongovernmental organizations are transnational organizations of private citizens that maintain consultative status with th economic and social council of the non 210 command and control in counterinsurgency environment governmental organizations may be profession associations foundations multinational businesses or simply groups with common in terest in humanitarian assistance activities development and relief nongovernmental orga nizations is term normally used by non united states organizations jp 102 there ar several thousand ngos many of these or ganizations focus on relief or shortterm suppo rt and development on longterm support or combination of the two some ngos do not wa nt to be seen as cooperating or associating with us military forces gaining their support an d coordinating operations can be difficult and frustrating task some examples of ngos are z world vision z medecin sans frontieres doctors without borders z catholic relief society z care cooperative for american relief everywhere z oxfam oxford committee for famine relief z international committee for the red cross and red crescent international organizations 258 the most notable of international organiza tion is the regional organizations such as the organization of american states may so be involved depending on the level of re lief or development needed in the country involv ed any one of several of their organizations may be present such as z world food program z refugee agency known by the acrony m for its director the high commis sioner for refugees unhcr z high commissioner for human rights z development program z regional programs such as alliance for progress oriented on latin america multinational corporations 259 us and other multinational businessessu ch as petroleum companies manufacturing corporations and importexport companiesofte n engage in reconstruction and development activities through community relations programs at minimum commanders must know which companies are present in the ao and wh ere those companies are conducting business such information can prevent fratricide or destruction of private property coordination with hostnation civil authorities 260 sovereignty issues are among the most difficult for commanders conducting counterin surgency operations both in regard to forces contributed by nations and by the hn often commanders are required to accomplish the ssion through coordination communication and consensus in addition to traditional comma nd practices political sensitivities must be acknowledged and often commanders and subordin ates act as diplomats as well as warriors commanders address all sovereignty issues in advance through the chain of command to the us ambassador and the country team to ensure that operations are not adversely affected examples include the following z collecting and sharing information z basing z overflight rights z aerial ports of debarkation z seaports of debarkation z location and access 211 fmi 30722 z railheads z border crossings z force protection z jurisdiction over members of the us and multinational forces z operations in the territorial sea and internal waters 261 commanders may create structures such as committees to address sovereignty issues to facilitate cooperation and build trust military or nonmilitary representatives of the hn may cochair these committees these organizati ons facilitate operations by reducing sensi tivities and misunderstandings and removing impediments however such issues are for mally resolved with hns through the developm ent of appropriate technical agreements to augment existing or recently developed status of forces agreements in many cases security assistance organizations ngos and internatio nal organizations resident in the hn having detailed knowledge and the potential to estab lish good will in these areas may be called upon to assist in the conduct of operations or the establishment of positive and constructive relationship in the hn 262 this coordination and support can exist all the way down to the community and village levels soldiers should be aware of both the po litical and societal structures in the aos they are assigned political structures usually have designated leaders within the community who are responsible to the government and people however the societal structure may have other leaders who operate outside of the politic structure these leaders may be economic such as businessmen theological such as cl erics and lay leaders informational such as newspaper publishers or journalists or family based such as elders or patriarchs some societal leaders may emerge due to charisma or other intangible influences commanders and the country team determine the key leaders assess their level of support for us objec tives and influence and coopt them as appropriate coordinating structures 263 at the hn national level the us country team is the primary coordinating structure for counterinsurgency see figure 21 where multinational partners join the us na figure 21 the country team concept 212 command and control in counterinsurgency environment tionallevel coordinating structure is formed where the us country team participates in or leads the multinational effort at each subord inate political level of the hn government coordinating structure the civil military coordi nation center is established including repre sentative of the hn and hn forces and us an d multinational forces this coordination cen ter facilitates the integration of all military and political actions below the lowest political level additional structures may be establis hed comparable to neighborhood watch where lowerlevel commanders and leaders can meet dire ctly with local populace leaders to discuss issues where possible international organization s and ngos should also take part in coor dination meetings to ensure their actions ar integrated and deconflicted with military and hn plans the essential us goal is single co ntrolling agency to direct all efforts with one person in charge of all military and us agency operations the purpose of this agency is to produce unified goal and direction civilmilitary operations center 264 one mechanism for bringing all of the above elements together for coordination is the cmoc cmocs can be established at all levels of command the cmoc coordinates the in teraction of us and multinational forces with governmental organizations international or ganizations ngos and thirdnation agencies an d authorities the cmoc is not designed as nor should it be used as c2 element it is coordination cell between nonmilitary agencies and military forces it is an extension of the commanders guidance 265 overall management of cmoc may be assigned to multinational force commander shared by us and multinational commander or shared by us commander and civil ian agency head the cmoc provides both access and cmorelated data and information from and to nonmilitary agencies operating away from the military headquarters the cmoc has set composition it is mission oriented and staffed appropriately in an armymanaged cmoc the plans officer or civil affairs coordinator is normally responsible for management of or participation in the cm oc it may be composed of or augmented by military and civilian representatives from many different agencies however it normally consists of director deputy director and re presentatives from the operations logistic and medical sections of the supported headquarters it may include other elements the person nel of which may come from the military ngos international organizations and third na tions based on the situation senior ca office rs normally serve as the director and deputy director of the cmoc section vi rules of engagement 266 the proper application of force is cri tical component to any successful counterinsur gency operation in counterinsurgency the cent er of gravity is public support in order to defeat an insurgent force us forces must be abl to separate insurgents from the population at the same time us forces must conduct th emselves in manner that enables them to maintain popular domestic support excessive or indiscriminant use of force is likely to alienate the local populace thereby increasing support for insurgent forces insufficient use of force results in increased risks to us an d multinational forces and perceived weaknesses that can jeopardize the mission by emboldening insurgents and undermining domestic popu lar support achieving the appropriate balance re quires thorough understanding of the na ture and causes of the insurgency the end st ate and the militarys role in counterinsur gency operation nevertheless us forces alwa ys retain the right to use necessary and proportional force for individual and unit selfd efense in response to hostile act or demon strated hostile intent 267 in planning counterinsurgency operations it is imperative that leaders and soldiers understand that military force is not an end in it self but is just one of the instruments of na tional power employed by the political leadersh ip to achieve its broader objectives military 213 fmi 30722 commander is never given the absolute author ity to act without ultimate accountability military action and the application of force are limited by variety of political and practical considerations some of which may not seem sens ible at the tactical level leaders and sol diers at all levels need to understand the nature of such limitations and the rationale behind them in order to make sound decisions regarding the application of or restraint in the use of force 268 determining the appropriate level of militar force is one of the most difficult issues confronting leaders and soldiers tactical decisi ons regarding the application of force can of ten have strategic implications typically us forces look to the roe as the primary method to determine the appropriate application of force rules of engagement are directives issued by competent military authority that delinea the circumstances and limitations under which united states forces will initiate and or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered jp 102 269 roe impose political operational practi cal and legal restrictions on the otherwise permissible use of military force the nature and extent of restrictions contained in the roe vary dramatically based on the justification fo r the initial involvement of us forces the tac tical situation the presence of civilians and th type of terrain in which forces are operating urban or rural leaders conducting counterin surgency operations are likely to find them selves operating with much more constrained t of roe soldiers may find it difficult and frustrating to conduct offensive operations beca use of the restrictive roe for example fense of designated nonus forces or designated foreign persons and their property requires approval from the president or secretary of defense 270 care must be taken to ensure that the mission drives the roe and not viceversa the roe may exercise significant influence on units ability to accomplish its mission there fore it is imperative for commanders and staffs to critically evaluate the roe in light of their mission the impact of the roe must be fully developed and addressed in staff esti mates roe should be used to assist in course of action development analysis wargaming and selection see fm 50 the commander shou ld aggressively seek modifications to the roe if the roe are inadequate in light of the mission and anticipated threat level the velopment modification distribu tion and training of roe must be timely and responsive to changing threats changes must be distributed immediately 271 leaders remember that the roe are applic able in all situations while roe govern the use of force in all situations they do not dictat certain amount of force to be used in all situations roe often identify specific circumsta nces where the use of force is required how ever roe do not identify every possible situat ion soldiers may encounter in counterinsur gency environment instead leaders and soldiers rely on their knowledge and understand ing of roe and apply sound judgment thorough understanding of the mission commanders intent and operational environm ent situational understanding and sound procedures and practices to determine the leve l of appropriate force permitted by the roe finally leaders must balance the safety of th eir soldiers with the safety of civilians 272 knowledge of the roe itself is not suffici ent to help soldiers make informed decisions regarding the appropriate application of force consistent and effective application of the roe requires extensive training and discipline to develop the judgment depth of knowledge skills and procedures necessary to apply force in counterinsurgency environment leaders stress basic troop leading procedures and situ ationalbased training comprehensive plan ning and rehearsals effective precombat chec ks and missionrelated patrol briefs back briefs and debriefs effective communication is equally essential leaders must ensure that every soldier completely understands the missi on and commanders intent and has compre hensive situational understanding at all times the appropriate level of situational under standing realistic training and disciplined adherence to basic troop leading procedures equips soldiers with the tools necessary to make informed decisions regarding the decision to 214 command and control in counterinsurgency environment use or refrain from the use of force roe are mo st effective when they are simple clear and able to be condensed onto small card section vii civilmilitary operations mission planning and criteria of success 273 criteria of success help leaders plan the transfer of control of counterinsurgency op eration to nonmilitary organization planning fo r transition is an integral part of mission planning for counterinsurgency because of the need to transfer control to the hn criteria of success help all concerned assess the status of the cmo portion of counterinsurgency opera tions 274 criteria of success are information requirements deve loped during the operations proc ess that measure the degree of success in ccomplishing the units mission they are nor mally expressed as either an explicit evaluation of the present situation or forecast of the degree of mission accomplishment fm 60 leaders may establish observable usually quantifiable objective data as well as subjecti ve indicators to asse ss tasks progress com pared to expectations leaders use criteria of success to determine how well or poorly an op eration is achieving the goals of the operatio n per the mission statement and concept they use criteria of success to validate effective cour ses of action and tactics and to determine points at which to shift resources transition to different phases and alter or terminate the mission 275 criteria of success are product of pla nning they differ for every mission and for dif ferent phases of single mission as leaders an d staffs identify specified implied and key tasks they define what consti tutes successful completion of each task the leader and staff decide how the criteria of success will be identi fied reported and validated they determine what action will be taken when the criteria of success are met as well as branch plans in case criteria of success are not achieved accordin g to the original plan criteria of success are often adjusted as the situation change s and higherlevel guidance develops 276 although planners begin the process of determining criteria of success when they velop the lines of operation for counterinsurg ency the commanders objectives must be strong upfront consideration cmo planners ge nerally use logical lines of operations see fm 30 these lines of operation normally fo llow the six ca activities foreignnation sup port population resource control humanitaria n assistance military civic action emergency services and support to civil administration however planners are not limited to these lines along each line of operation planners identify objectives desired outcomes and deci sive points then they determine criteria of success to assess the effectiveness of those out comes 277 criteria of success for assessing counterinsu rgency operations should be designed with the same considerations in mind as for any ot her types of missions counterinsurgency plan ners should ensure that criteria of success are z appropriate criteria of success must correlate to the commanders objectives and should relate to the audience objectives if the objective is to present information to those outside the command criteria should be general and few in number if the ob jective is to assist onsite commanders then criteria should be more specific and tailed z mission related criteria of success must relate to the mission if the mission is relief the criteria should help the commander evaluate improvements in living standards mortality rates and other rela ted areas if the mission expands so should the criteria planners should tailo r the criteria of success to address opera tional and tactical levels 215 fmi 30722 z measurable objective quantitative criteria of success reflect reality more accu rately than qualitative or subjective criteria and are generally the measure of choice when the situation permits their us when using qualitative or subjective criteria guidance for determination of th ose criteria and specific measurement cri teria should be established and dissemina ted to more effectiv ely focus judgment where possible try to measure specific aspect condition of the insurgency z numerically reasonable criteria of success should be limited to the minimum required to effectively portray the relief environment avoid establishing excessive criteria criteria of success can become unmanageable or collection efforts can out weigh the value z sensitive sensitive criteria of success force performance and accurately reflect changes related to joint force actions ex traneous factors should not greatly affect established criteria z useful criteria of success should detect situational changes quickly enough to able the commander to respond immediately and effectively 278 in multinational or interagency operatio ns counterinsurgency planners coordinate us criteria of success with those of participating na tions and agencies in some cases they may also collaborate on how the criteria will be asured and reported for example emergency indicators commonly used by the ngo community can be used as baseline for developing criteria 279 in addition to deciding what the criteri of success are counterinsurgency planners cide certain aspects about each one such as z who will observe the criteria for example task specific individual or team z when will the criteria be observed are th criteria event driven or time driven how often will the criteria be tested z how will the criteria of success be observed what method will be used to detect indicators is it direct observ ation or allsource analysis section viii other planning considerations planning for public affairs and media teams 280 counterinsurgency is war of ideas and is punctuated by moves and counters based on flexible and agile thinking and calculation yet if counterinsurgency is predicated on ideas and thinking then influence over the medium th at most easily and effectively gains access to and influences ideas thinking and those relate d processes would seem to be essential this medium is the information network the media print and broadcast the media is source of large portion of the information populati on receives and can greatly influence their col lective thinking the media have access to gove rnment leaders decision makers the public in most nations and our own soldiers to infl uence and shape opinions the media is neither friend nor enemy it is tool to create effect s and conditions in which counterinsurgency op erations are successful however adversaries may use it directly and indirectly against those same operations planning for all exigencies must include the media 281 the media print and broadcast radio televi sion and the internet play vital role in societies involved in counterinsurgency memb ers of the media have significant influence and shaping impact on political direction na tional security objectives and policy and na tional will the media is factor in military op erations it is their right and obligation to re port to their respective audiences on the use of military force they demand logistic support and access to military operations while refusing to be controlled their desire for immediate footage and onthespot coverage of events and the increasing contact with units and sol diers for example with embedded reporters re quire commanders and public affairs officers 216 command and control in counterinsurgency environment to provide guidance to leaders and soldiers on media relations however military planners must provide and enforce ground rules to the dia to ensure operations security public af fairs offices plan for daily briefings and specia l briefing after each significant event because the media affect and influence each potential ta rget audience external and internal to the ao speaking with the media in forwarddeploy ed area is an opportunity to explain what our organizations and efforts have accomplished use of interpreters 282 in conventional operations soldiers rare ly have the need for interpreters during coun terinsurgency there are occasions when soldie rs lack the linguistic ability to communicate personally and effectively with the local populace the use of interpreters is often the best or only option the proper use and supervision of interpreters can play decisive role in the mission leaders plan for the use of interprete rs and their integration into tactical units when necessary see appendix b 217 chapter 3 counterinsurgency operations section i concept of operations general 31 military operations in support of counter insurgency fall into three broad categories cmo combat operations and io cmo are prim arily oriented towards the indigenous popu lation in villages cities and regions combat operations are oriented against insurgent lead ers and cadre smaller units and insurgent ma in force organizations battalion brigade and divisionsized units depending on the phas of the insurgency the operations should deny the insurgents freedom of movement acce ss to the population and access to safe vens io potentially assure common operational picture appropriate to every level of an or ganization down to the individual soldier commanders also use io to shape the informa tion environment to reinforce cmo and combat efforts the overall mission of all military operations in support of counterinsurgency is to provide safe and secure environment within which governmental institutions can address the concerns of the people 32 commanders consider the following when conducting planning preparing executing and assessing counterinsurgency operations z military operations for countering insurgen cy must all be completely integrated with the us country team or established governing authority throughout planning preparation execution and assessment z counterinsurgency must be initiated as earl as possible an escalating insurgency becomes increasingly di fficult to defeat z intelligence civil affairs and psyop are vital parts of all programs z effective local government is vital to ca rrying counterinsurgency programs to the local populations command and control 33 leaders should ascertain the level of or ganization for counterinsurgency within their aos and where none exists should influence or induce their hn counterparts to establish such an organization at all levels counterinsu rgency planning and direction should be ac complished through area security coordination centers these centers are composed of ele ments of z hn forces and agencies z assigned us military and interagency re presentatives and multinational person nel 34 the chief of security coordination center should be military or political leader each center should include civilmilitary advisory committee composed of representatives from the areas major economic and social groups an d activities to facilitate communication with 31 fmi 30722 and participation of the local populace and rve as sounding board for assessing the pro gress of the counterinsurgency effort resource allocation 35 normally ngos private foreign corporat ions hn private enterprises and us gov ernmental activities cooperate in local count erinsurgency programs nonmilitary personnel supervising us government efforts may be assi gned at major subordinate levels of govern ment and often visiting technical representa tives will operate at lower levels the adminis trative area advisor must coordinate military efforts and those of the us government non military representatives in the absence of civ ilian advisors the administrative area advisor may be directed to monitor the execution of pr ograms initiated but not supervised by other us government agencies 36 hn and usaid civil resources are devoted to executing economic social psychological and political programs military resources enga ged in military civic action often augment and sometimes substitute for civil resources in executing these programs section ii civilmilitary operations general 37 local political authorities bridge the gap between the remote and sometimes imper sonal national government and the people to the extent that these authorities are able to satisfy the aspirations of the people and create the image of responsive and capable gov ernment the openings for subversion will dimi nish the military works with the local civil authorities the populace and ngos through cmo military participation is accomplished through military civic action and populace and re source control the leader must be ready to propose civic action projects based on the capabilities of the unit advised and must be pre pared to give guidance on the techniques of pplying these capabilities in accordance with an overall counterinsurgency plan to perform these functions the leader must be aware of the objectives and principles of cmo in paragraph 39 prior to implementation of military civic action projects military oper ations are coordinated with the us ambassador and country team see figure 21 page 212 this coordination is essential to ensure the accomplish ment of us national security interests usai d is the us government agency responsible for nation building usaid activities are coordina ted through the us embassy at the tactical level direct coordination through the chain of command with usaid avoids duplication of effort and ensures adequate resources and technical assistance are made available 38 objectives of cmo in counterinsurgency operations are to z make substantial contribution s to national development z gain the support loyalty and respect of the people for their government 39 principles of cmo include z conserving resources and developing an in tegrated economy as such all projects must proceed within the framework of coordinated plan z conformance to guidance issu ed through command channels population and resource control 310 the insurgents primary target is the p eople therefore counterinsurgency must sepa rate the insurgent from the people and their re sources population an d resource control is implemented as required to support counterin surgency operations leaders must be knowl edgeable regarding the principles concepts tasks and techniques of population and resource control in order to train and work with thei r counterparts on their implementation the pri 32 counterinsurgency operations mary objectives of population and resource co ntrol are to separate the insurgents from the populace and to identify and eliminate the in surgents their organization their activities and influence while doing so 311 civil control measures are very similar to police functions civil police should initiate controls because z they are best suited by cultural background training and experience z their area orientation results in closer relationship with the local population z they permit military forces to concentrat on offensive counterinsurgency opera tions 312 where local police require reinforcement or are ineffective local paramilitary forces including home guards village militia and po lice auxiliariesare mobilized or created or ganized and trained as reserves military forces are used only as expedients since extended assignment to this duty detracts from th eir main mission of offensive operations 313 continuous psyop are mounted to z counter the effects of insurgent propaganda z relate controls to the security and wellbeing of the population z portray favorable governmental image 314 control measures must z be authorized by national laws and regula tions counterparts should be trained not to improvise unauthorized measures z be tailored to fit the situation apply the minimum force required to achieve the sired result z be supported by effective local intelligence z be instituted in as wide an area as possible to prevent bypass or evasion z be supported by good communications z be enforceable z be lifted as the need diminishes z be compatible where possible with local customs and traditions z establish and maintain credibility of local government control program phases 315 control program may be developed in five phases z securing and defending the area internally and externally z organizing for law enforcement z executing cordon and search operations z screening and documenting the populati on performing detailed census z performing public administration to include resource control securing and defending the area of operations 316 security and defense begin concurrently with or immediately subsequent to offensive operations security of urban centers and defens of key infrastructure are prerequisites to beginning offensive operations the entire politic administrative unit region province dis trict village as well as each individual co mmunity must be secured all the time in areas under insurgent influence it will be necessary to construct defenses around existing villages and concentrate rural populations into defend able population units normally this will be accomplished concurrently with counterinsurgen cy operations environmental improvement 33 fmi 30722 and population and resource control programs techniques for securing and defending the ao include establishing defended urban areas and relocating populations defended urban area 317 defended urban areas may be established if z less restrictive measures have failed to liminate population support of the insur gent z government forces have been unable to pr ovide defense or internal security z the population must provide their own defe nse to release military forces to conduct counterinsurgent warfare however the popu lace must be armed and trained to be effective z they are required as bases fr om which to mount operations 318 leaders can assist in the development of the defended community by z coordinating requests for usaid support with appropriate usaid area represen tatives z planning urban defenses to in clude provisions for support z organizing equipping and trai ning urban defense forces z ensuring military defense forces are prov ided until local defense forces are ade quate and supported by regional paramilitary and military forces z implementing control techniques curfews alert and warning systems systems of identifying both friendly and insurgent forces z military civic action projects based on selfhelp z establishing local government by organizing urban civilmilitary leader commit tees electing community officials where possible and creating governmental in stitutions relocating populations 319 the most severe of the restrictive measures is accomplished when z wide dispersion of the population prevents effective defense internal security and control z requirements exist to evacuate or populate selected areas 320 leaders can contribute to the implementati on of this technique by providing assistance in the following areas z psyop to prepare the population for relocation z defense during relocation if relocation is combined with the defended urban area technique the leader can further assist once relocation is completed z logistic requirementssuch as subsistence transportation and medical assistance to facilitate movement and relocation of the population and their possessions organizing for law enforcement 321 successful counterinsurgen cy depends ultimately and initially on legitimate and ef fective hn justice program integrating law enforcement the judiciary and penal system the existing justice program may be limited by capability leadership and training re sources or corruption and require direct or indi rect efforts to support or even reestablish po lice services courts and prisons such effort s must be coordinated with the country team and closely synchronized with other civilmilitar actions the responsibility for these efforts may fall initially on us military assets during th initial stages of an operation or when the security situation is untenable for civilian agenci and contract advisors the division staff 34 counterinsurgency operations judge advocate and provost marshal may require additional technical support from judge ad vocate and military police assets for example administrative and criminal law experts criminal investigators and corrections specialists to support local regional or national level justice programs while setting the conditio ns for transfer of support to other us gov ernmental or international agencies 322 support to law enforcement may be limited to coordinated actions at local levels be tween us military police and the hn police for ex ample joint patrols colocation of military and hn police at police stations or require mo re comprehensive support to national and re gional police headquarters and technical depa rtments other support may include support of z administrative divisions which may incl ude the headquarters personnel and fi nance departments z police training academy z investigative division to includ criminal laboratory facility z traffic division to include highway patr ol and traffic accident investigations z specialized police that may include special reaction teams pers onnel security and customs and immigration police 323 support to the judiciary may be limited to providing security to the existing courts or may lead to more comprehensive actions to build local regional and national courts and the required support apparatus to avoid overcrowdi ng in police jails the courts must have an efficient and timely magistrate capability idea lly colocated with police stations and police jails to review cases for trial 324 support to the penal system may be limited to monitoring conditions and adherence to basic humanitarian standards or require more comprehensive support to reestablish all lev els of incarceration and rehabilitat ive programs points to remember z local jails are typically colocated with po lice stations and administered by the cal police to hold suspected criminals until magistrate determines whether there is sufficient evidence for trial z regional jails are typically run by prison fficials to hold detainees referred to trial but not convicted pretrial detainees sh ould not be incarcerated with convicted criminals z prisons hold convicted criminals and are ty pically designed and divided to address level of inmate risk high medium and w rehabilitative programs eg violence drug addiction sex crimes and the separa tion of genders and juvenile offenders cordon and search 325 cordon and search is technique used by military and police forces in both urban and rural environments it is frequently used by counterinsurgency forces conducting popula tion and resource control mission against small centers of population or subdivisions of lar ger community to be effective cordon and search operations must have sufficient forces to effectively cordon off and thoroughly search target areas to include subsurface areas psyop civil affairs and specialist interrogation teams should augment cordon and search forces to increase the effectiveness of operatio ns consider the following when conducting cordon and search operations z allocate ample time to conduct thorough sea rch and interrogation of residents of af fected areas z operations should be rehearsed thoroughly whenever possible z firm but fair treatment must be the rule every effort must be made to avoid any incident that results in unnecessa rily alienating the people 35 fmi 30722 326 cordon and search operations may be conducted as follows z disposition of troops should facilitate visual contact between posts within the cordon provide for adequate patrolling and immediate deployment of an effective re serve force z priority should be given to sealing the administrative center of the community occupying all critical facilities detaining personnel in place preserving and securing all reco rds files and other archives z key facilities include administrative buildings police stations news media facilities post offices communications centers transportation offices and motor pools prisons and other places of detention schools medical facilities z search techniques include search teams of squad size organized in assault support and security ele ments one target is assigned per team room searches are conducted by twoperson teams room search teams are armed with pist ols assault weapons and automatic weapons providing security for search teams screening operations and facilities z presearch coordination includes between control personnel and screening team leaders study of layout plans communications that is radio whistle and hand signals disposition of suspects z onsite security guard entrances exits to include the roof halls corridors and tunnels assign contingency tasks for reserve z room searches conducted by two or threeperson teams immobilize occupants with one team member search room with other team member search all occupants when available third team member should be the re corder place documents in numbered envelope and tag the associated individual with corresponding number screening and documenting the population 327 screening and documentation include following z systematic identification and registration 36 counterinsurgency operations z issuance of individual iden tification cards containing unique number picture of individual personal identification data fingerprints an official stamp use different colo rs for each administration region family group census cards an official co py of which is retained at the local po lice agency these must include picture and appropriate personal data z frequent use of mobile and fixed checkpoints for inspection identification and reg istration of documents z preventing counterfeiting of identification and registration documents by laminat ing and embossing z programs to inform the population of the need for identification and registration public administration including resource control 328 public administration at local levels is normally performed by the mayor and police it is at this level that resources are managed and controlled after screening has been com pleted action must be taken for continuation of governmental functions and the following factors should be considered z combining internal security and defense ac tivities under public safety office z employing population surveillance overt and covert based on area coverage overt surveillance 329 overt surveillance is the responsibility of th police patrol division it is conducted with conventional police procedures us ing the officer on the beat as the lowest official of govern ment in contact with the public 330 police patrols z vary routes and movement frequently to avoid establishing predictable pattern z should not be limited to the confines of the community but should include adjacent areas z must be coordinated with the activities of military and paramilitary forces to avoid duplication of effort and confusion z use military dogs to contribute to overall effectiveness covert surveillance 331 covert surveillance is collection effort with the responsibility fixed at the intelli gencesecurity division or detective division of the police department covert techniques ranging from application of sophisticated electr onics systems to informants should include z informant nets reliability of informants should be verified protection of identity is must z block control dividing community or popu lated area into zones where trusted resident reports on the activities of the population if the loyalty of block leaders is questionable an informant net can be established to verify questionable areas 332 for detailed discussion and checklists see appendix c 37 fmi 30722 section iii counterinsurgency combat operations objectives 333 the primary objective of counterinsurgency operations is to neutralize the insurgents and together with population and resource control measures establish secure environ ment within which political social and econ omic progress is possible counterinsurgency operations include us hn and multinational fo rces planning includes all three and the conduct of operations must include close coordi nation among the forces of the various nations involved intelligence 334 the key to success is effective and action able intelligence at the local level many in surgents are local boys swept up in the exci tement of the moment others are outsiders easily identified by the locals in either case when insurgents overplay their hand and place the community at risk it is likely local perso nnel will identify these insurgents to the au thorities this information may lead to the development of sound intelligence enabling com manders to focus operations toward specific objectives 335 planning preparing executing and asse ssing counterinsurgency operations adhere to several fundamentals while many apply to co nventional operations others are counterin surgencyspecific figure 31 page 39 is aders guide to support both offensive and fensive operations and reflects the fundamentals of counterinsurgency hostnation security force operations 336 the use of hn forces is essential to deve loping stable society one that looks to the hn government for longterm security whenever practicable hn security forces operate in conjunction with us and multinational forces and assume the major burden in operations when capable of so doing the security forces in counterinsurgency consist of the civil police paramilitary also called the militia and military the elements of the security force work in concert to z secure protect and separate the population from the insurgents z neutralize and defeat the insurgent forces 337 the first line of defense for the government is its police forces which may be organized either locally or nationally in either case their action must be well coordinated with the overall counterinsurgency operations the first ob jective of the police is to identify and stroy the illegal infrastructure of the insurgen t organization police intelligence identifies and locates leaders penetration agents intellig ence and propaganda agents terrorists and recruiters the police arrest them using the minimum force necessary offensive operations 338 there are two types of offensive operations employed against insurgent forces the first is at the local level where us forces sof or trai ners work with local authorities to find fix and destroy local insurgents who seek to exer t control in the communities cities and re gions these forces are normally small but well ar med examples of this type insurgent force include the viet cong in south vietnam the fmln in salvador and qaeda in af ghanistan and chechnya they move freely with in the population

counterinsurgency forces can take immediate action to destroy fast moving insurgents figure 31 leaders checklist for counterinsurgency op erations 39 fmi 30722 339 small units handle local counterinsur gency operations most effectively these small units are usually company sized operating within community or group of communities to find fix and destroy the insurgents when these companies are habitually associated with particular community they can develop the intelligence necessary to identify and destroy the insurgents harassment operations may as sist in locating and fixing insurgents opera tions of this type will prevent insurgents from resting and reorganizing will inflict casualties aid in gaining detailed knowledge of the ao and cause insurgents to expend their limited re sources when an insurgent force has been cated every attempt to encircle the force should be made even if piecemeal deployment is re quired normally such operations require that the counterinsurgency force be much larger than the insurgent force see fm 908 com pany commanders can call on support from their next higher headquarters that also maintains company reserve element see figure 32 platoons are assigned aos with one platoon in reserve platoons teach locals how to pro tect their communities squads run training programs figure 32 company ao 340 the american way of war has been to sub stitute firepower for manpower as result us forces have frequently resorted to firepower in the form of artillery or air any time they make contact this creates two negatives in counterinsurgency first massi ve firepower causes collateral damage thereby frequently driving the locals into the arms of the insurgen ts second it allows insurgents to break tact after having inflicted casualties on friendly forces more effective method is to attack with ground forces to gain and maintain contact with the goal of completely destroying the insurgent force this tactic dictates that m ilitary forces become skilled in pursuits the unit that makes the initial contact with the insurgen t force requires rapid augmentation to main tain pressure against the fleeing force envelo p it and destroy it these augmentation reac tion forces should be given the highest pr iority for use of available transport pursuits 341 the pursuit force is organized into two ements the direct pressure force and the circling forces includes blocking forces the direct pressure force pursues and maintains constant offensive pressure on the enemy force as it withdraws the encircling forces em ploying superior mobility preferably by using ai rmobile or airborne forces conduct local velopments single or double to cut off in surgent forces and destroy them see fm 390 ambushes 342 area ambush is an effe ctive offensive counterinsurgency technique the area ambush consists of primary ambush element that triggers the ambu sh and smaller supporting am bush groups that cover all likely routes of wi thdrawal once the ambush is triggered the smaller ambush groups open fire as the insurg ent force attempts to withdraw see fm 390 defensive operations 343 defense is oriented on the location of th community or installation rather than upon the most favorable terrain since defense of the specific community or installation is 310 counterinsurgency operations mount plans for withdrawal to rearward positions are focused on retaining control of the community or installation 344 security and surveillance measures are coordinated for 24hour operations the provi sions for perimeter defense are particularly app licable in defense of communities or installa tions against insurgent attack when regular co unterinsurgency forces are conducting the fense when using local paramilitary forces tr aining must instill the necessary confidence and ability to provide an effective defense for community under attack until supporting forces are delivered or unt il reinforcements arrive 345 by prearranged sopsto include communi cations forces and fire supportlarger communities and the surrounding smaller ones mutu ally assist in the defense of one another until other support or reinforcements arrive in areas where offensive operations have been conducted to eliminate insurgent control of the population regular military forces are re quired to temporarily

chapter 6 fire support 347 all air and ground fire support elements within range of the route of the mounted col umn take measures to ensure close and conti nuous fire support fire planning to include registration must be as comp lete as time allows continuo us communications are essential to establish positive control in order to clear airspace and apply effects 348 individual and unit sops for maneuver as responsive action and counterambush reac tion include the following z prepositioning of security elements along the route z possible use of airmobile hunterkiller teams z assistance available from friendly units occupying positions along or adjacent to the route dismounted movements 349 security for movement when dismounted presents severa l considerations that are dif ferent from security for mounted co lumns these include the following z secrecy that may preclude air cover z restrictions on registration of artillery and the inability to plan targets when the route cannot be determined in advance z flank security is easier for dismounted movement particularly if ground or air transportation can be used to position security elements z silent movement of dismounted columns pa rticularly at night can allow security elements to locate ambush forces z extended formations that allow part of th column to be in position to maneuver against an ambush force that strike s different part of the column clear and hold 350 the clear and hold operation focuses the three primary counterinsurgency programs cmo combat operations and io supported by intelligence and psychological operations on specific geographical or administrative area or portions thereof the tactics and techniques used to conduct clear and hold operations ar discussed throughout this manual the clear 311 fmi 30722 and hold operation is executed in specific high priority area experiencing overt insurgency and has the following objectives z creation of secure physical and psychological environment z establishing firm government control of the population and the area z gaining willing support of the population and their participation in the governmen tal programs for countering insurgency planning considerations 351 clear and hold operations should expand outward from secure base such as an urban industrial complex whose population support s the government effort and where military forces are in firm control area or its popu lation that has been subjected to the intensive organizational efforts of subversive in surgent organization can be won back until z commander

sufficient nonmilitary resources are allocate d to effectively carry out all necessary environmental improvement and population and resources control operations within the area z the insurgent has been cleared from the area z the insurgent hardcore organization and its support structure has been neutral ized or eliminated z governmental organization to which th local population gives willing support has been established to replace that of the insurgents implementation 352 the clear and hold operation is characteri zed by execution of four generally overlapping stages preparation clearing holding and consolidation preparatory stage 353 inventory assessment and planning are conducted during this stage and are charac terized by the following major actions z selection and delineation of specific ar ea to undergo clear and hold operations z designation of chain of command and form ulation of concept of operations z collection of data and information on the ao area assessment z estimate of resource requirements both military and nonmilitary z preparation of clear and hold operation plan during preparation of the plan sideration to many factors will be given including the following emergency legislation to provide legal basis for population and resource trol measures and the legal use of armed forces key points that may require establishing static defense posts police and paramilitary force requirements and organization coordination to include provisions for joint training and operations involving military police paramilitar intelligence psychological and civilian adminis trative agencies and forces z psychological preparation of the population of adjacent areas to explain the neces sity for these operations deny the insurgent organization the capability to function in the area 312 counterinsurgency operations establish the physical presence of gove rnment military and population and re sources control forces throughout the area establish firm security in the area under the protective shield of government forces clearing stage 354 the clearing stage can be initiated by cl ear in zone or cordon and search operation to either disperse or force reaction by major in surgent elements within the ao once this has been accomplished units employ combination of offensive small unit operations such as area saturation patrolling area ambushes and other techniques 355 repressive actions and retribution against the general population in the area must not be condoned characteristic of all counterin surgency operations is firm and impartial treatment whenever and wherever possible sinc often it will be impossible to identify the insurgent at the onset of operations 356 population and resource control forces introduce surveillance and restrictive control measures as necessary holding stage 357 operations during this phase are designed to z establish firm government control ov er the area and the population z develop local capability for area security z establish government political apparatus to replace the insurgent apparatus z develop dependable network of informants 358 major actions occurring during this phase include z designating and allocating areaoriented regular military forces to continue offen sive military operations in the area other regular military forces that participated in clearing stage actions are now released or are assigned to carrying out other parts of the counterinsurgency effort in the area z introduction of elements of other agencies of the government as the area achieves more secure status to begin carrying out environmental improvement programs resources to support these agencies and th eir operations should be introduced as needed at this time z thorough population

means members of this news and comm unication medium have significant impact on political direction achieving national secu rity objectives policy formation and national will media scrutiny of military operations jo urnalists desire for immediate footage and on thespot coverage of confrontational events and the increasing contact with units and sol diers including embedded reporters require that commanders and public affairs officers provide guidance to leaders and soldiers on dia relations the media affect and influence each potential target audience and personnel ex ternal and internal to the ao speaking with 318 counterinsurgency operations the media in forwarddeployed area is an opportunity to explain what our organizations and efforts have accomplished but be prepared to field questions regarding perceived nega tive impacts also figure 34 contains general public affairs guidelines 378 in addition to these general guidelines aders should always consult the public affairs office guidance related to the cu rrent operation see appendix c points to remember when doing media interviews what to do when the media visits your ao be relaxed confident and professional be concise think about what you will say before you speak avoid using colorful or profane language stay in your lane confine your discussions to areas in which you have firsthand knowledge or where you have personal experience deal in factsavoid speculation and hypothetical questions label your opinions as opinions dont get into political discussions stay on the record if you say it theyll print it dont discuss classified information dont argue with the reporter be firm and be polite speak plainly dont use military slang or jargon protect the record correct the facts if they are wrong do not threaten the m edia representative politely move the media to an area out of harms way where they do not interfere with the performance of the mission notify the senior person present so heshe can determine what the media wants cooperate with the reporter within the limits of opsec and safety if there are opsec or safety concerns that make the interviewing or filming impossible at this time let the reporter know up front at time should media representatives equipment be confiscated if you feel security violation has occurred notify your chain of command if you have problems with the media dont get emotional report the incident through the chain of command to the area public affairs officer figure 34 example of pao guidance card 319 chapter 4 intelligence general 41 the successful conduct of counterinsurgen cy operations relies on the willing support and cooperation of the populations directly involved greater priority and awareness is needed to understand the motivations of the pa rties involved in the conflict and the popula tion as whole the understanding of the background and development of the conflict into which us forces are intervening is of particular significance this requires detailed under standing of the cultural environment and the human terrain in which the us forces will be operating and thereby places hea vy reliance on the use of humint 42 the commander requires intelligence about the enemy and the ao prior to engaging in operations intelligence assists commanders in visualizing their battlespace knowing the enemy organizing their forces and controlling op erations to achieve the desired tactical ob jectives or end state intelligence supports fo rce protection by alerting the commander to emerging threats and assisting in security op erations intelligence to support counterinsur gency operations focuses on three areas z factors motivating the insurgency z appeal the insurgency holds for insurgents z organization leadership and key functionaries of the insurgency 43 opensource intelligence refers to the pr actice of drawing information from the news media and processing it into intelligence it is an increasingly common practice among world intelligence organizations the six categories of media and news sources providing open source intelligence are z newspapers z periodicals z military and other professional journals z internet web logs commonly called blogs z visual media primarily television z radio 44 units engaged in counterinsurgency operations may face multiple threats the com mander must understand how enemies organize equip train employ and control their forces intelligence provides an understanding of the enemy which assists in planning pre paring and executing operations commanders must also understand their operational envi ronment and its effects on both their own and enemy operations the commander receives missionoriented intelligence on enemy forces an d the ao from the g2s2 the g2s2 pends upon the intelligence surveillance and re connaissance isr effort to collect and pro vide information on the enemy and ao 45 one of the most significant contribution s that intelligence can accomplish is to accu rately predict future enemy events although difficult task predictive intelligence enables the commander and staff to anticipate key emy events or actions and develop correspond 41 fmi 30722 ing plans or counteractions the most important purpose of intelligence is to enable decision making commanders receive the intelligence under stand it because it is tailored to the commanders requirements and act on it throug h this doctrinal concept intelligence drives operations 46 the ao during counterinsurgency oper ations includes three primary components physical terrain and weather society sociocul tural often referred to as the human terrain and infrastructure these components provide structure for intelligence personnel to focus and organize to provide support to counterinsu rgency operations these entities are interde pendent not separate these components enabl the commanders to gain an indepth under standing of their ao during counterinsurgency operations and provide focus for the intelli gence analyst intelligence preparation of the battlefield planning considerations 47 ipb includes information about terrain an d weather and civil considerations as well as the enemy the six factors of metttcmission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerationsmake up the major subject cate gories into which relevant information is grouped for military operations see fm 60 rele vant information is all information of importance to the commander and staff in the exercise of command and control fm 30 in counterinsu rgency operations civil considerations are prominent in ipb analysis terrain and weather 48 expect terrain in counterinsurgency operat ions to be complex unit aos may consist of various types of terrain ranging from jungles mountains and deserts to rural or urbanized areas in conventional operations the primary factor is the natural landscape in counterin surgency operations manmade factors may be the primary terrain factors that unit must consider some of these factors that ought to be considered are the density of construction and population within the ao the street pa tterns within urban areas and compartmentali zation of areas within the ao such as areas separated by waterways or highways and func tional zones for example the functions different areas serve within the ao such as residen tial commercial and go vernment areas 49 in addition to weather effects on friendly operations counterinsurgency operations re quire the consideration of how weather effects the local population for example an ongoing drought within the units ao may mean that mo re outside aid is required an insurgency movement may take advantage of the population s potential dissatisfaction to recruit sup port and may even be able to make food or othe r desirable aid available thus making the in surgents look like the only competentlegitimate authorities in the region if the government does not provide necessary aid the population co uld view those they believe to be in charge in an increasingly hostile manner for failing to help prevent disaster civil considerations 410 civil considerations comprise the manmade infrastructure civilian institutions and at titudes and activities of the civilian leaders po pulations and organizations within an area of operations influence the conduct of military op erations fm 60 they include the popula tion of an area and information about it factors of interest include the gender and mix of the populace the cultural religious and socio economic beliefs and thinking and the beliefs attitudes and actions of groups and individuals 42 intelligence population and culture 411 the center of gravity in counterinsurgency operations is the population therefore derstanding the local society and gaining its suppo rt is critical to succe ss in for us forces to operate effectively among local population an d gain and maintain their support it is im portant to develop thorough understanding of the society and its culture to include its his tory tribalfamilysocial structure values religions customs and needs 412 the history of people can often help explain why the population behaves the way it does the roots of an insurgency may become clear through that knowledge given ao may have several different regions each with differe nt sets of customs us forces can anticipate local reaction to friendly courses of action as well as avoid losing indigenous support for the mission through understanding and supporting th ose local customs that support however must be consistent with us laws and the law of war 413 understanding and working within the social fabric of local area is initially the most influential factor in the conduct of counterinsu rgency operations unfortunately this is often the factor most neglected by us forces the density of civilians and the constant interaction required between them and us forces greatly in creases the importance of social considera tions the fastest way to damage the credibilit of us forces and the legitimacy of our in volvement with the local national government is to ignore or violate the social mores or pre cepts of particular population 414 the interaction of different cultures mands greater recognition during counterinsur gency operations than in other environments this greater need for understanding comes from the increased need for interaction with th civilian populace every culture has set of norms and values and these could involve such diverse areas as protocol and social skills attitudes toward women manners food sleep patterns casual and close relationships and cleanliness understanding these differences is only the start of preparation for counterin surgency operations 415 religious beliefs and practices are among the most important yet least understood as pects of culture the role religion plays in both culture and individual value systems varies greatly from place to place while it is never possible to disentangle religion completely from politics mores and the other aspects of cultur religion plays an especially powerful and dominant role in some societies many conflicts have strong religious dimension not only in the origin of the dispute but also in the wa the fight is conducted some religiously moti vated antagonists will operate with significan tly different view of what constitutes just conduct in war than the western consensus that created the law of land warfare and the ge neva conventions 416 when assessing events intelligence profe ssionals consider the norms of the local cul ture or society failure to recognize respec t understand and incorporate an understanding of the cultural and religious aspects of the society in which us forces are interacting could rapidly lead to an erosion of the legitimacy of the mission for example while bribery is not an accepted norm in us society it may be to tally acceptable practice in another society if us intelligence professionals assess an incident of this nature using our own societal norms and values as reference it is probable the si gnificance of the event will be misinterpreted leaders and institutions 417 us military planners should conduct inte ragency coordination to identify key govern ment officials early in the operation us polic officials determine which key hn leaders are supportive of the us military and which are t these key personnel can provide valuable information needed for successful completion of the operations to include local infrastruc ture common picture of cultural norms susp ected enemy strengths and probable means of 43 fmi 30722 support and locations for enemy forces in co unterinsurgency missions us forces are often supporting state as such it is critical to understand the potential audience 418 many governments are rife with nepotism and trading favors are indifferent to local conditions and support security presence at the village level the power of officials may be based on family and personal connections cl an loyalty and age and only after that on education training and competence corruption may be pervasive and institutionalized as practical way to manage excess demand for local services 419 local governments breakdown from pr evious level of effectiveness will quickly ex acerbate problems of public health and mobility attempts to get the locallevel bureaucracy to function along us lines may produce furthe r breakdown passive indifference or resent ment any unintentional or intentional threat to the privileges of ranking local officials or tribal leaders or to members of their familie s will be stubbornly resisted avoiding such threats and assessing the importance of particular officials requires knowledge of family ties 420 us military planners must realize that th local populace will behave in their perceived selfinterest they will be keenly aware of five sets of interests at work those of the us forces the insurgenthostile elements the loca l opportunists the legi timate government and the general population all five elements assess these interests constantly in order to ascer tain their own stakes risks and advantages refugees and ethnic groups 421 another significant cultural challenge is the presence of refugees within units ao rural immigrants displaced by conflict combined with city residents can create significant problem noncombatants and refugees without ho stile intent can disrupt local missions ad ditionally there may be insurgent troops crimi nal gangs vigilantes paramilitary factions and factions within those factions hidi ng in the waves of the displaced 422 the enemy knows it is nearly impossible for us forces to accurately identify friend from foe from disinterested local combat situ ations can change with bewildering speed as the supposed innocent becomes an active aggressor within close quarters and an indefensible position in chechnya chechen rebels and hezb ollah terrorists effectively used the cover of refugees to attack occupying forces the chec hens counted on the ferocious nature of the russian counterattack causing heavy civilian casu alties to gain support from the indigenous population for the chechen separatist cause 423 one goal of insurgent forces will be to place stress on the us and local national gov ernment soldiers in order to break down disc ipline and operational integrity the constant pressure of differentiating friend from f oe taxed and sometimes undermined roe from bel fast to lebanon and in some cases entire missions social structure and customs 424 defining the structure of the social hier archy is often key to understanding the popula tion identifying those local personnel in position s of authority is important these local offi cials tribal leaders or village elders are ofte n the critical nodes of the society and influence the actions of the population at large in many societies nominal titles do not equal power influence does many leaders are figurehead s and the true authority lies elsewhere 425 most areas around the world are not governed by the rule of law but instead rely upon tradition often tribal membership ethnic loyalt and religious affiliation provide societal cohesion and the protocol of proper behavior and ethics in dealing with outsiders such as the us and multinational partners it is important to understand the complicated inner work ings of society where potential internal conflicts predominate this is difficult and requires thorough examination of societys culture and history 44 intelligence 426 identifying and understanding trends an d patterns of activity provide important in formation for intelligence analysts and mission planners every local area has discrete and discernible patterns of daily activity the time of heaviest activity along line of communi cation is one case in point trade and busine ss transactions market sales religious prac tices governmental functions and criminal activity are other examples of daily behavior than can be analyzed for consistencies disrup tions or irregularities in these patterns serve as warning that something is amiss in the area 427 it is important to remember that while ce rtain general patterns do exist most regional areas are normally composed of multitude of different peoples each with its own standards of conduct treating the local population as homogenous entity can lead to false assump tions cultural misunderstandings and poor operational picture individuals act independ ently and in their own best interest and this w ill not always coincide wi th friendly courses of action do not ignore the presence or actions of the different population components within an ao when developing assessments infrastructure 428 understanding the infrastructure and the interrelationships of various elements within units ao and the relationship with neighboring aos is critical in counterinsurgency op erations infrastructure has physical so cial economic and political elements physical 429 intelligence staffs identify critical physic infrastructure components transportation and communications systems water treatment an d waste disposal facilities and the effects they have on the local regional and national populations insurgents will use and exploit ex isting infrastructure common method insurg ents use to display the weakness of the cur rent local national government is to disrupt or destroy critical components of infrastructure such as power stations and waterworks that ffect large portions of the local population they may also create additional infrastructure where gaps in governmentprovided services exist in order gain the good will of the local population if successful this demonstrates the governments inability to protect critical infr astructure components and their inability to provide basic services such as security for the population social economic and political 430 the social infrastructure includes comm unication religious and education centers and the roles of tribes families casts and clans economic infrastructure includes banks stock markets and the monetary control system politic infrastructure includes political parties party headquarters and offices govern ment offices and state institutions intelligence preparation of the battlefield assessment 431 during the military decision making pr ocess intelligence personnel provide command ers with battlefield assessment based upon systematic approach known as ipb ipb sists of four steps z define the battlefield environment z describe the battlefields effects z evaluate the threat z determine threat courses of action 45 fmi 30722 define the battlefield environment 432 in defining counterinsurgency environm ent intelligence professionals do the follow ing z consider the nature and strategy of the insurgency are there internal factors external factor or both that form basis for the in surgency is there an identifiable pattern of insurgent activities does the insurgent organization function primarily within the established po litical system or in open competition with it z determine international and national support to the insurgents include sources of moral physical and financial support z consider the neighboring countries bound aries and frontiers and coastal water ways z consider thirdcountry support for the insurgency z analyze the hn population government military demographics and threat who are the vulnerable elem ents in the population are they subject to insurgent exploitation z evaluate hn political structure economy foreign policy and relations and policies on military use z consider if us presence or potential presence by itself could be catalyst for in surgent activity describe the battlefield s effects terrain and human 433 in defining the battlefields effects in counterinsurgency environment intelligence professionals do the following z determine points of entry infiltration and exfiltration routes c2 structures for op erations and agricultural areas z evaluate weathers effects on the mobility of insurgents and their logistic efforts for example the availability of food supply due to weather extremes z consider migration and settlement patterns to identify which areas are pro government or proinsurgent identify the cations of groups that create territorial boundaries the insurgents may try to make autonomous to gain political advantage z determine how political and religious affiliation and practices influence the peo ples attitudes towards both enemy and friendly operations z examine efforts to create or increase unr est and dissension among the population are the insurgents conducting io against existing or proposed hn policies and pro grams z evaluate how economics and money affect the insurgents ability to conduct offen sive operations they will influence the popu laces active support for or against the insurgency evaluate the threat 434 in evaluating the threat in counterinsu rgency environment intelligence professionals do the following z identify which insurgent groups are present thought to be present or have access to your ao is the insurgency linked to racial religious ethnic or regional base 46 intelligence does the insurgent organization function through predominately legal means or clandestine operations what and who constitute the organizational elements of the movement z identify leaders trainers recruiters st aff members and logistics personnel is the leadership clearly defined or do competing actions exist is the insurgency affiliated with any politic labor student or social organiza tion what is the philosophy of the leadership z develop doctrinal templates based on observed operating procedures z assess and analyze the number of functional specialties within the insurgency for example the number of trainers for spec ific weapon might indicate the type of tactics level of readiness and the number of personnel trained z determine the types of weapons that the in surgents have at their disposal sophis ticated weaponry may be an indicator of ex ternal support as well as the insurgents capability to attack important and possibly welldefended targets z consider the insurgent organization does it have high degree of command and control what is the level of planning and training within the organization z analyze movement patterns movements may coincide with operational or logistic activities determine enemy courses of action 435 enemy courses of action might include the following z attacks and raids on police stations security forces military installations or other hn government and securityrelated facilities z attacks on public utility installations power water telephone or other forms of economic sabotage pipelines transmi ssion towers ports marketplaces z kidnapping murder or intimidation of public officials and their families or family members supporting us or hn forces z propaganda directed against

the support of the loca l population that support can be either ac tive or passive in order to succeed they must increase the support of the local population in their favor to defeat the insurgency us forces assist the local authorities in separating the insurgents from the population and ultimately in gaining the populations active support if substantial portion of the population does not actively oppose the insurgency the insur gents may determine to attack soft targets and purposely inflict civilian casualties to both intimidate the local populace and undermine the legitimacy of hn local authorities 439 rarely are only two sides involved in mo dern conflicts more often one ethnonational group opposes other groups with conflicting in terests this poses significantly more com plex set of enemy or potential adversariesen tities that leaders must understand insur gents try to create conditions to defeat us and hn forces and to slow the support for friendly forces increasingly insurgent groups have regard for the law of war they have used human shields targeted innocent civilians an d occupied religious and health facilities as sanctuaries these actions and techniques offset us advantages and make it more difficult to locate and defeat the enemy us reaction to these tactics can also have tremendous propa ganda appeal 440 insurgents develop organizational structur that are functional for their particular operational environment because insurgents usually operate in hostile environment secu rity is primary consideration therefore insurgent organizations may be organized both conventionally and unconventionally 441 an unconventional or cellular structure pr otects members of the organization and lows for better security individual elements or cells can operate relatively isolated from other elements or cells thereby creating increased security in the event of defection or cap ture one member can identify more than few others some elements within the organi zation may have multifunction cells that comb ine several skills into one operational entity while others create cells of specialists that come together for an operation on an ad hoc basis 442 due to its unconventional nature the insu rgent threat is difficult to determine and identify when determining and identifying th insurgent threat consider the following z threat staging area threat staging area is geographic area from which in surgent organizations and elements coordina operations logistics finance and recruiting as well as stage and plan mission s these areas can be thought of as ei ther the operational or strategic areas in which the group conducts the majority of its behindthescenes activity as well as defining the area in which the group has the largest sympathetic base to support its goals z threat area of operations threat aos are those areas in which an insurgent or ganization conducts operations against its enemy 48 intelligence z threat objectives these are long and shortterm insurgent goals that may in clude but are not limited to attracting publicity to the groups cause demonstrating the groups power demonstrating government and us weakness exacting revenge obtaining logistic support causing government or us forces to overreact 443 see annex d for order of battle factors threat analysis 444 in counterinsurgency operations threat analysis is continual process of compiling and examining all available information concerning potential insurgent activities that target elements of the population local security fo rces and facilities or bases comprehensive threat analysis reviews the factors of an insurg ents existence capability intentions history and targeting as well as the security enviro nment within which friendly forces operate threat analysis is an essential step in iden tifying the probability of insurgent attacks and results in threat assessment 445 when conducting an insurgency the th reat will normally conform to the five low intensity imperatives political dominance unity of effort adaptability legitimacy and per severance see fm 798 under the conditions of insurgency the analyst places more em phasis on z developing population status overla ys showing potential hostile areas z developing an understanding of how each insurgent organization operates and is organized z determining primary operating or staging areas z determining mobility corridors and escape routes z determining the most likely targets z determining where the threats logistic fa cilities are located and how their support organizations operate z determining the level of popular support active and passive z determining the recruiting techniques and methods of each insurgent organization z locating neutrals and those actively opposing these organizations z using pattern analysis and other tools to establish links between each insurgent organization and other organizations z determining the underlying social political ideological and economic issues that caused the insurgency and that are conti nuing to cause the members of the organi zation as well as elements of the population to support it 446 as discussed earlier evaluation of the threat in counterinsurgency operations begins early and covers wide range of factors in bu ilding an accurate threat organizational dia gram in addition to the factors discussed consider the following z group collection and intelligence capabilities z does the actual desired end state differ from that which is publicly advocated if so how does that impact operations z do the insurgents desire different social or political organization than that which exists under current conditions if so wh at are the differences how will they duct operations to achieve that goal 49 fmi 30722 447 motivation ideological religious moneta ry depending on the echelon there may be an opportunity to use psyop against the group or its support network insurgent means and methods of command and control 448 while identifying the specific structure leadership and membership of insurgent or ganizations is important it may also be extremel difficult to obtain this information in the absence of specific information identifying ge neralities about the insurgent groups will be of value to the intelligence analyst leader capabilities 449 an insurgent organization capable of ex ercising c2 over long distances has greater flexibility and reach than an organization that can only operate within the limitations of the leaders interpersonal capabilities international and national support 450 insurgents may receive support from the following sources z moral significant leadership or cultural figure may make pronouncements in support of an organization activity or acti on this may have the effect of influenc ing international policy or increasing the success of recruitment efforts z physical physical support includes safe pa ssage safe houses documentation weapons and training at sites inside the country z financial charities banks informal transfer of currency by traveler or courier z transportation z religious political and ethnic affiliations commonalities and differences are significant in terms of estimating potential support or opposition an insurgent or ganization may receive in given area ho wever in some cultures such as the muslim culture the philosophy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend may cause strange and unprecedented relationships to form recruiting methods locations and target audience 451 an insurgent organization that recruits from an idealistic and naïve upper and middle class will differ significantly from one that re cruits from prisons some insurgent organiza tions recruit university students either to join the movement as operatives and support per sonnel or to prepare for future leadership ro insurgents recruit lowerlevel personnel with little or education because they are more susceptible to insurgent propaganda though many insurgents come from an upper middle class background the impact of target audiences bears directly upon the willingness of the insurgent recruit to fully commit to the cause and to sacrifice lf if deemed necessary civil considerations 452 thorough analysis of the population within the ao is critical to the execution of suc cessful counterinsurgency operations consider the impact the local populace may have on the threat and friendly forces as well as their location in the ao and area of interest when analyzing the population the fo llowing are areas to consider z identify active and passive supporters and why they are supporting z determine what segment of the general po pulation supports or assists the threat and how z determine the extent to which the populati on will support or impede friendly op erations 410 intelligence z identify and depict those segments of the population that are friendly or unfriendly toward usmultinational forces z identify and depict those segments of th population that are progovernment or antigovernment z identify terrorist andor criminal elements and their relationship to the insurgents and the general population z determine the availability of weapons to the general population 453 insurgents move among the local populati on the way conventional forces move over ter rain the military aspects of terrain oakoc s ee fm 60 may be used to analyze how in surgents might use this human terra in to accomplish their objectives observation and fields of fire 454 individuals or groups in the population ca n be coopted by one side or another to per form surveillance or reconnaissance function pe rforming as moving outposts to gather in formation 455 local residents have intimate knowledge of the local area their observations can pro vide information and insights about what migh t otherwise remain mystery for instance residents often know about shortcuts through to wn they might also be able to observe and report on demonstration or meeting that occurs in their area 456 unarmed combatants might provide targ eting intelligence to armed combatants gaged in confrontation this was readily pparent in mogadishu where unarmed combat ants with the ability to observe friendly force activities without the threat of being engaged instructed hidden threat forces on where to fire 457 deception and adversarial propaganda thre ats may hinder clear view of the threats tactics or intentions 458 fields of fire can be extremely limited by the presence of noncombatants in combat zone because restrictive roe may prohibit firing into crowd 459 figuratively the population or regions within local area can be identified as nonlethal targets for io avenues of approach 460 populations present during operations physically restrict movement and maneuver by limiting or changing the width of avenues of approach 461 people may assist movement if grou p can be used as human barriers between one combatant group and another refugee flows fo r example can provide concealed avenue of approach for members of an enemy force 462 certain individual can provide an avenue of approach to specific target audience when acting as mouthpiece for an io mission key terrain 463 the population in counterinsurgency oper ations is key terrain this is based on the idea that public opinion and their support or ck thereof can change the course or the aims of mission the united states withdrawal from somalia following the outcry after seeing dead soldier being dragged through the streets of mogadishu is often used in urban opera tions literature as an example of the power of an audience determining which population or portions of it are key to mission should not be limited to broadbrush characterizations of large populations however certain sectors or individuals within population can be as piv 411 fmi 30722 otal in modern engagements as piece of high ground was in past eras or as the entire us population was in regard to mogadishu 464 captured combatants or wellinform ed noncombatant can provide valuable informa tion about the enemy these individuals can be key terrain in terms of the information they can provide 465 group of people that us forces are depl oyed to protect might be considered key ter rain because loss of that groups respect could jeopardize the entire operation 466 congregated people can be considered key terrain whether moving or stationary large gathering might be ripe target for attack closer observation or attempts at manipu lation obstacles 467 one of the largest obstacles to friendly op erations is the portion of the population that actively supports the insurgent 468 people conducting their daily activities w ill often get in the way of any type of opera tion for instance curiositydriven crowds in haiti often affected patrols by inadvertently forcing units into the middle of the street and pushing them into single file harm was inflicted but the unit was made move vulnerable to sniper and grenade attacks 469 strategically the world audience as well as its local contingent can create political cultural and ideological obstacles to mission the us audience watching events unfold in vietnam can be understood as an obstacle to th governments strategy of pursuing its stra tegic objectives the cultural differences appa rent when us forces were deployed for opera tion desert storm could have been an obstacle if not adequately addressed for instance psyop flier produced to encourage sense of unity among the arab populations included picture of two men holding hands sight not common in western cultures flier designed in accordance with western standards might not have been as effective cover and concealment 470 civilian populations provide ubiquitous concealment for nonuniformed forces threat forces operating in any part of local urban area can instantly blend into any type of crowd or activity 471 threat forces often find cover by operat ing within neutral group for instance qaeda operatives and fighters are able to of ten move freely among and mix with the rural populace living near afghanistanpakistan bord er however these same people have diffi culty remaining nondescript and moving freely among urban populations due to regional dif ferences in their accent mode of dress hair and beard styles and skin pigment reportedly insurgents attempted to move in the company of women and children acting as family mem bers and mixed among the populace exiting an d entering fallujah during operations there in spring 2004 types of intelligence support human intelligence 472 human intelligence is the collection by trained humint collector of foreign informa tion from people and multimedia to identify elements intentions composition strength dis positions tactics equipment personnel and capabilities it uses human sources and vari ety of collection methods both passively and ac tively to gather information to satisfy the commanders intelligence requirements and cross cue other intelligence disciplines fm 20 412 intelligence 473 during counterinsurgency operations th most important information and intelligence will come from the population and those in direct contact with themhumint the quan tity and quality of this information and intellig ence will depend on the credibility of the us forces the continuous security they provide th local population and their ability to interact with the local population communicate and tablish relationships with members of the cal population every member of the us force whether on or off duty is an informal humint collector and must be aware of the ov erall intelligence requirements and how their interactions and observations may assist in the intelligence collection plan this awareness can and should be developed by re gular briefings and debriefings 474 trained humint collectors obtain informat ion from people and multimedia to identify elements intentions composition strength disp ositions tactics equipment personnel and capabilities within and affecting the local area humint can assist to establish and more accurately understand the sociocultural characteristics of the local area 475 humint sources can provide early warning of deeprooted problems awaiting us forces during counterinsurgency operations humint collectors can conduct debriefings screenings liaison humint contact operations document exploitation interrogations and tactical questioning in support of the commanders intelligence requirements 476 information provided by humint can grea tly assist the intelligence staff in deducing critical patterns trends and networks within the local area humint collection team per sonnel provide these types of capabilities in suppo rt of tactical forces the s2g2j2x coor dinates these capabilities between the tactical operational and strategic levels and can pro vide their units with access to pe rtinent national level humint 477 intelligence planning staffs must be awar that battlespace cannot generally be defined in geographical terms for purposes of intelligen ce collection this is especially important when determining the allocation of humint assets concentrations of humans on the bat tlefield do not necessarily denote need to concentrate humint assets in those locations threat actions outside units ao may be sou rce of significant events inside units ao additionally information from sources in one ao may impact operations in distant ao creating arbitrary intelligence boundaries can result in lack of timely fusion of all critical elements of information that may be available imagery intelligence 478 imagery intelligence is intelligence derived from the exploitation of imagery collected by visual photography infrared lasers multispectral sensors and radar these sensors produce images of objects optically electronically or di gitally on film electronic display devices or other media jp 102 479 imint has some severe lim itations during counterinsurgency operations imaging sys tems cannot distinguish between insurgents masquerading as civilians and the general population additionally imaging systems cannot see through buildings in builtup areas so lowflying aerial imagery collection platforms ofte n have restricted fields of vision likewise they cannot see threats that may be located inside buildings additionally aerial platforms that do not have standoff capabilities may be at risk of being destroyed by local enemy air defense fire 480 there are several key advantages that imagery can provide to the commander uav imagery may be one of the fastest least risky methods by which to conduct reconnaissance of specific areas and to update and verify current maps of that area showing clear routes ob stacles such as damaged and destroyed buildings and intact and destroyed bridges the to pographical team can use this imagery to creat updated mapping products for planning and operational uses 413 fmi 30722 481 cameras colocated with masint systems such as rembass and activated when those systems are triggered can give the command er additional eyes on named areas of in terest without wasting manpower by continuously staffing an observation post in those loca tions 482 providing patrols with digital camera or video camera can greatly assist in the briefing process and allow the intelligence st aff personnel to make their own judgments about items of interest that the patrol report s videotaping of events such as demonstra tion can allow analysts who were not on the sc ene to identify key elements leaders and po tential indicators to help preclude future in cidents guncamera images from aircraft that can provide standoff reconnaissance platform may give valuable insight into enemy ttps thermal sights on vehicle patrolling an urban street late at night may note the hot engine of vehicle on the side of the road po ssibly indicating suspicious activity 483 the joint surveillance target attack radar system jstars can provide such infor mation as the amount of vehicular traffic enteri ng and leaving an area via multiple avenues which can be useful when trying to determine if the enemy is shifting forces into or out of specific region or if there is covert attempt to exfiltrate or infiltrate the region via lesser used avenues this could in clude monitoring traffic crossi ng international borders 484 the national geospatial agency can provide wide range of imagery products for use prior to and during operations in the urban vironment these products are usually easier to obtain prior to deployment and are often criti cal to the initial planning stages of an opera tion signals intelligence 485 signals intelligence is category of intelligence comprising either individually or in combination all communications intelligence ectronic intelligence and foreign instrumen tation signals

is of value whenever there is an form of electronic emission whether from communications such as handheld or citizens band radios and mobile phones combat net radio transmissions or for other purposes such as the radio control of explosive devices or use of radar for surfacetoair missile guidan ce the easy availability of hightech communi cations and monitoring equipment now allows most nations to ve relatively sophisticated sigint capability 487 insurgent groups may use unencrypted lowpower communication s systems to conduct local operations groundbased sigint collection assets must be properly positioned in ad vance to be certain that they can obtain the best possible intelligence from these sources 414 intelligence 488 collection of unencrypted threat signals ca n provide key indicators for threat courses of action patterns in the amount of known enemy encrypted signals provide indications of spe cific threat courses of action because of sign bounce within urban areas directionfinding capabilities for all sigint collection systems are significantly impaired during counterin surgency operations it may be possible for th local authorities to monitor local telephone lines and provide relevant information they colle ct to us forces likewi it may be possible for us forces to tip off local national authorities as to what telephone numbers may yield valuable intelligence measurement and signature intelligence 489 masint is technically derived intelligence that detects locates tracks identifies or describes the specific characteristics of fixed an d dynamic target objects and sources it also includes the additional advanced processing and exploitation of data derived from imint and sigint collection 490 masint provides important intelligence at the tactical level systems such as ground surveillance radars have limited uses in the ur ban environments because of the lack of wide open spaces in which they most effectively op erate for that same reason they can cover large open areas that are possible avenues of approach or infiltrationexfiltration routes within units ao systems such as rembass and the platoon early warning device can play primary role in monitoring many of th numerous avenues of approach that cannot be covered by human observers due to manpower constraints rembass can monitor avenues such as subterranean passageways or entrance s and exits to such passageways entrances and exits on buildings fire escapes on buildings base camp perimeters and traffic flow along routes especially foot trails that may be used to infiltrate and exfiltrate personnel and equipment between urban and rural areas counterintelligence 491 ci is focused on countering adversary intelligence collection activities against us forces

conflict to war and during postconflict operations see fm 313 for discussion of psyop as an io element mission of psycohological operations 53 the mission of psyop is to influence the behavior of foreign target audiences to sup port us national objectives psyop accomplishe s this by conveying selected information and advising on actions that influence the emotions motives objective reasoning and ultimately the behavior of foreign audiences behavioral change is at the root of the psyop mission though concerned with the mental processes of the target audience it is the observable modi fication of target audience behavior that termines the mission success of psyop leaders and soldiers must recognize that everything th ey do or choose not to do has psychological impact 54 psyop is an integral part of all counter insurgency activities they meet the specific requirements for each area and operation mission planning for psyop in counterinsur gency must be consistent with us and multin ational objectivesmilitary economic and po litical psyop planners must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the hn environment in which psyop is employed this includes the hi story

capability to the supported commander whether providing information during humanitarian assistance operations or broadcasting surrend er instructions while supporting combat opera tions psyop disseminate products at the tactic level at the most personal level through facetoface communication dissemi nation of visual products or from the close proximity of loudspeaker tactical psyop soldiers can often obtain immediate feedback from the target audience they are trying to influence when attached to maneuver battalion or company the tactical psyop team disseminates psyop pr oducts using visual audio or audiovisual means the tactical loudspeakers employed by the teams can achieve immediate and direct contact with target audience and are used heavily during counterinsurgency operations 58 tactical psyop teams can perform other ta sks in addition to disseminating printed materials they perform facet oface communication gather and assess the effectiveness of friendly psyop and propaganda and acquire psyoprelevant information from the local populace tactical psychological operations team 59 tpts provide psyop dissemination in support of operations conducted by conventional and sof units the tpt is threeperson team commanded by staff sergeant the tpts 52 psychological operations and military police support primary purpose is to integrate and execute ta ctical psyop into the supported commanders operation the tpt also advises the commander and staff on the psychological effects of their operations on the target audience in their ao as well as the effects of propaganda and an swer all psyoprelated questions the tpt can conduct facetoface communication loud speaker operations and dissemination of approv ed audio audiovisual and printed products they are instrumental in the gathering of psyo prelevant information conducting town or area assessments observing impact indicators and gathering pretesting and posttesting data tpts also conduct interviews with the target audience they take pictures and docu ment cultural behavior for later use in products tpts often play role in establishing rap port with foreign audiences and identifying ke communicators that can be used to achieve us national objectives tactical psyop can increase the supported unit commanders ability to operate on the battlefield by reducing or minimizing civilian interference 510 tactical psyop can potentially reduce the number of casualties suffered by the sup ported unit by reducing the effectiveness of insurgent forces through surrender appeals and cease resistance messages 511 tactical psyop can assist the supported unit commander in gaining the tactical ad vantage on the battlefield through the use of deception measures allowing the commander to have the element of surprise 512 in high intensity conflict tpt is normally assigned to each maneuver battalion in stability operations in general and in counter insurgency in particular the tpt should sup port each company or special forces oda the tpt must interact with the local population continuously to be effective most operations that interact with the population regularly are planned and executed at the companyoda level given current force protection doctrine the tpt will not be effective if employed above th companyoda level in supporting counter in surgency advising the supported commander 513 the tpt leader plays key role as advisor to the supported commander the leader analyzes proposed actions by the supported uni t and how they may affect the target audi ences within the ao psyop planners are involved in the targeting process for example if the supported commander wants to destroy bridge that is used by local civilians to trans port goods to and from market the tpt leader should advise him on the possible adverse ef fect this may have on the civilians the tpt leader may also advise the commander on spe cific insurgent forces to target with psyop in order to reduce their effectiveness loudspeaker operations 514 loudspeaker operations are an extension of facetoface communications during opera tions in which violence is an element the udspeaker is the most effective psyop medium loudspeakers achieve immediate and direct contact with the enemy when loudspeaker broadcasts the enemy becomes captive audien ce that cannot escape the message the loud speaker can move rapidly to wherever an ex ploitable psyop opportunity is found and can follow the target audience when the target audi ence moves the loudspeaker achieves in ef fect facetoface communication with the advers ary loudspeakers transmit speeches music news warnings or sound effects printed products 515 the dissemination of printed products by tpts and other soldiers is very effective way of disseminating psyop to target audien ces tpts usually disseminate printed prod ucts by hand in facetoface manner which lends credibility to the product following is 53 fmi 30722 list of some of the types of printed products tpt might disseminate posters novelty items leaflets handbills newspapers pamphlets and magazines facetoface communications 516 facetoface communication is the found ation of tactical psyop and the most common and effective capability that tpts bring to the supported unit increasing rapport trust and credibility with the target audience is accomp lished through effective facetoface communi cation this method also allows psyop soldiers the best way of engaging with target audi ence about complex issues the give and take of personal communication is the most effec tive form of psyop over the long term becaus it builds rapport and establishes personal connection with the target audience pretesting and posttesting 517 psyop personnel use pretesting and postte sting to predict and assess the effectiveness of products on target audience an important function of tpts is that of testing town and area assessments 518 this assessment collects detailed informat ion that is useful for the development of psyop tpts must ensure these town and area assessments are as complete as possible and forward them up the chain of command so they can be incorporated into higher planning and shared with intelligence sections be nefiting all levels of command radio and television station assessments 519 tpts assess radio and television statio ns on almost every mission once the tpt makes contact with station manager it is im portant that they maintain that relationship establishing good habitual working relationship can be an effective way to help ensure the ability to exploit the indigenous broadcast capability such as radio station civil disturbance 520 tpts will often find themselves assisting in the control of crowds and defusing poten tially hostile situation this may occur as mber of planned quick reaction force or on the spur of the moment propaganda assessments and counterpropaganda 521 propaganda is any form of communication in support of national objectives designed to influence the opinions emotions attitudes or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly jp 102 propaganda can be directed against an enemy or potential adversary to disrupt or influence any instrument of national powerdiplomatic information military or economic this info rmation is normally directed at the united states multinational partners and key audiences in the ao psyop personnel advise the commander and staff of the current situation re garding the use or anticipated use of adver sary propaganda in the ao psyop perso nnel advise commanders on recommended coun terpropaganda measures to defeat or diminish the impact of propaganda executing success ful counterpropaganda involves all of the command ers assets to collect the wide variety of information and propaganda existing in an area due to the sheer volume of information and potential sources psyop forces do not have the organic ability to collect all available infor mation 54 psychological operations and military police support psycohological operations considerations 522 the following highlights several consider ations for countering hardline insurgencies from psyop perspective z do not approach the insurgency as only series of criminal acts view the situation through the microscope of root causes of insurgencies the actions may be the be ginnings of highly organized and deeply rooted insurrection z maintain the respect of the hn government officials security forces and civilian population reward repentant insurgent sy mpathizers build the infrastructure of cooperative areas and publicize those acco mplishments to the lessthansupportive groups seeing neighbors being compensated for their help will positively influence others to join in and secure them and their family from insurgent retribution z emphasize the soldiers primary role is to both serve as an ambassador of goodwill to the populace and to destroy the insurgents z include the hn government and security forces in the detailed planning message content and operational execution of the counterinsurgency operation z realize that the practice of judgment pers istency patience tact justice humanity and sympathy are necessary on the part of the hn government and supporting multinational forces these traits are ssential to the achievement of moral and psychological superiority over the insurg ents legitimate force s must fully recog nize that they represent the better state of things that are being offered to the local populace z follow the two guiding principles on the conduct of operations in counterinsur gency the objective is to achieve decisive gains with the least use of combat force and resultant loss of lives the relationship with the local populace must be based on security truth help fulness and kindness section ii military police 523 military police forces provide robust and dynamic combat capability during counter insurgency military police soldiers possess the diverse mobility capabilities lethality in weapons mix and trained communications skills to operate in any environment the actions of the 18th military police brigade supporting operation iraqi freedom demonstrate the di versity and flexibility of military police functi ons these soldiers conducted over 24000 com bat patrols processed over 3 600 enemy prisoners of war deta inees and insurgents confis cated over 7500 weapons and trained over 10000 iraqi police officers military police patrols came under direct or

dental z liaison with international committee of the red cross z public affairs z religious representation detainee operations 530 because of their contact with the local populace in counterinsurgency military police must be aware of how they are perceived by th local culture military police must be trained to be cognizant of cultural differences that can have negative impact on the psyop cam paign there also must be clear lines of auth ority and responsibility established for military police guarding prisoners or detainees negative propaganda from mistreatment of prisoners or detainees can undermine us and hn credibility see appendix i usa criminal investigation division command 531 the criminal investigation division co mmand investigates offenses committed against us forces or property offenses committed by m ilitary personnel or civilians serving with us forces or where there is military interest its agents investigate violations of international agreements and the law of

difference between success and failure of many combat missions 57 fmi 30722 dogs are trained for patrolling searching buildings scouting or explosive detection all of these skills compliment performing the five milit ary police functions the ability of dogs to detect an ambush and to find an explosive devi ce planted by insurgents can be critical to the overall success of the mission the use of milit ary working dog teams to increase combat po tential and enhance response shortages is limited only by lack of training on how to employ dogs dogs cannot be used as security measur against detainees they can be used to rein force security measures agains t penetration and attack by enemy forces some examples of employment techniques are z perimeter patrolling z main supply route patrolling z security of designated pers onnel units or facilities z use during checkpoints and roadblocks z enemy prisoner of war detainee and insurgent control z mine and tunnel detection z area reconnaissance operations 58 chapter 6 health considerations movement security and civil disturbances general 61 although many of the considerations pplicable to counterinsurgency operations are also applicable to conventional operations some require special emphasis this is primarily because counterinsurgency operations often take place closer to civilians than conventional operations this close proximity requires leaders to place greate r emphasis on health consid erations movement security an d reactions to civil disturban ces this chapter addresses those considerations section i health service support considerations 62 during counterinsurgency operations sold iers have greater probability of close tact with the civilian population than during many conventional operations for that reason leaders and soldiers work with army medical department personnel an d policies to conserve the fighting strength disease and nonbattle in jury historically cause the most casualties during operations proper training appropri ate risk management and the application and enforcement of effective preventive medicine measures can prevent many injuries and ill nesses enforcement and application of health and preventive medicine standards are leaders responsibility see appendix g 63 appropriate and limited medical attention may be applied to indigenous populations at the discretion of the commander and proper m ilitary medical authority this care may be appropriate where the level of local civilian medi cal care is limited or nonexistent limited medical assistance may enhance the acceptance of multinational personnel within the local population if possible hn medi cal personnel should be included when treating indigenous people this can enhance the stature of the hn government media cove rage of medical as sistance can create positive effect on peop views of the hn nonetheless the media should be unobtrusive to avoid creating percept ion that medical attention is being provided primarily to gain favorable press attention 64 be aware of and sensitive to local culture customs and taboos relative to medical care and the interactions of multinational personnel with the local population be tactful and cul turally appropriate when giving medical or humanitarian assistance 65 take care not to overextend or take on mission greater than policy or capability dic tates medical care must not interfere with op erations from logistic or personnel stand point nor constitute or imply an overall polic absent the proper approval from appropriate authority 66 be prepared to train indigenous forces in first aid or other healthpreventive medicine subject areas coordination with higher preven tive medicine or veteri nary service personnel may be appropriate in the indigenous population area 67 all interactions between soldiers and indigenous populations are opportunities to make positive impressions and have the potential to change attitudes for the better with the local population every effort should be made for soldie rs to be viewed as friends of the local popu 61 fmi 30722 lation indeed this may pave the way for willin g acceptance of multinational personnel and activities 68 force protection and the timely collectio n of potential intelligence are always primary planning and implementation factors regardless of the missionmedical or humanitarian force protection is always an imperative an d intelligence gathering throughout the ao is always top priority section ii security during movements 69 this section addresses convoy operations in counterinsurgency environment convoys are planned and organized to control and protec t vehicle movements they are used for the tactical movement personnel supplies and eq uipment of combat forces and logistic units movements made during counterinsurgency oper ation face variety of potential threats including local individuals ieds and insurgen ts leaders continually assess the insurgents tactics and implement measures to counter th em soldiers conducting movement security operations remain vigilant at all times s ee fm 390 and fm 5530 for troop movement doc trine convoy operations 610 key to the success of convoy operations is ensuring all personnel and equipment are properly prepared all soldiers in the convoy mu st have task and purpose and know what to do on contact during execution of convoy operations 611 an important leader check is to review ll actions including their timing to avoid set ting patterns enemies use such patterns to pred ict friendly actions and plan attacks inte grate this review throughout all operat ions including afteraction reviews convoy planning considerations 612 consider the following when pl anning and preparing for convoys z route recovery z ambulancemedical coverage most ambulanc have radio communications to in clude casualty evacuation procedures z disperse combat lifesav ers throughout convoy z designate responsibilities such as aid and litter teams z prepare rest plan for drivers z use window screens to deflect grenades z implement security measures to prevent pilferage from the convoy z arrange for escorts military policy infantry or other z disperse key personnel throughout the convoy crossload equipment z identify and verify convoy signals z identify route reference points and available fire support z coordinate for air cover rotarywing securi ty close air support mobile interdiction and radio frequencies and call signs z prepare an air guard plan z prepare deception plan z submit closure report at destination and upon return z perform reconnaissance of the route if possible air reconnaissance is the pre ferred method 62 health considerations movement security and civil distu rbances z determine threat capabilities and potential courses of action to include mine overlay from higher regional or local headquarters if available z civilian considerations along the route z establish phase linescheckpoints along the route to monitor progress of the convoy z determine choke points along the routebr idges openair markets over and derpasses z know whether vegetation grows next to and away from the road and thereby pro vides concealment z determine insurgent convoy attack pattern s base this assessment on s2 input and pattern analysis z vary supply convoy sp times by more than 1 hour sooner or later to keep in surgents off balance z describe and verify the vehicle abandonment plan include how long to wait before stripping and leaving disabled vehicle or trailer prepare transferloading plan for the cargo z establish the condition criteria to abandon vehicle establish when to destroy it burn it or leave it z arrange seats in the back of trucks to allow soldiers riding to face out z increased convoy speeds such as 50 miles per hour limit movement up and down the convoy line z when the roads are only one or two lanes wide civilian traffic will impede any ad jacent movement mission briefing 613 execute mission briefing two hours before the sp time include z tactical briefenemy and friendly situation update from s2 z convoy execution matrix all drivers get strip

know how to use them z primary and secondary frequencies ensure all know the call signs and fre quencies for close air and fire support z security forces ensure roles and responsibilitie s are understood and rehearsed z responsereaction forces ensure leaders know the location of responsereaction forces ensure all know the call signs and frequencies for them convoy organization 616 leaders must know how to position vehicl within the elements regardless of size all columns serials and march units see fm 390 have four parts scout head main body and trail each of these parts has specific function scout 617 two scout vehicles proceed three to five minutes in front of the main body the scouts task is to ascertain road conditions and identi fy obstacles that may pose threat to the voy when scout vehicles are employed leaders plan to react quickly to an attack on those vehicles however conditions ma not allow for the use of scout vehicles if so consider ear lier convoys acting as scouts consider requesti ng the deployment and use of uavs to recon noiter the route head 618 the head is the first vehicle of each co lumn serial and march unit each head vehicle has its own pacesetter the pacese tter rides in this vehicle and sets the pace needed to meet the scheduled itinerary along the route the lead er at the head ensures that the column fol lows the proper route he may also be required to report arrival at certain checkpointsphase lines along the route the head vehicle also looks for possible ieds when passing bridges gunners first observe the approach and then the opposite side of the bridge with the head vehicle performing these duties the convoy co mmander has the flexibility to travel the col umn to enforce march discipline when the convoy speed is low use heavy wellprotected vehicle as the head vehicle if mines or ieds are expected main body 619 the main body follows the head vehicle and consists of the majority of vehicles moving with the convoy the main body may be divided into serials and march units for ease of trol vehicles in the main body are armed with crewserved weapons 64 health considerations movement security and civil distu rbances trail 620 the trail is the last element of each march column serial and march unit the trail leader is responsible for recovery maintenanc and medical support the recovery vehicle maintenance vehicles and medical support vehicl esteams are located in the trail the trail leader assists the convoy commander in maintaining march discipline he or she may also be required to report clear time at checkpoints or phase lines along the route in convoys sisting of multiple march units and serials the convoy commander may direct minimum sup port in the trail of each serial or march unit and larger trail party at the rear of the col umn 621 the convoy commander provides trail curity and communications in case the trail party is left behind to make repairs or recove ry an additional technique is to establish heavily armed and fast security detachment tr ailing the convoy by more than five min utes this time interval enables the security detachment to react and maneuver to an insur gents flank to counterattack in the event the convoy is fixed or otherwise unable to maneu ver against attackers security techniques 622 the enemy may place ieds at intersecti ons where vehicles tend to slow down and bunch up ensure proper spacing at all times between vehicles especially at intersections and turns 623 when making turns move the vehicle as far away from the curb as possible due to most ieds being located on the inside turn 624 soldiers must maintain 360 degree security at all times 625 leaders must adapt quickly to the insurg ents changing tactics to counter threats note convoys must maintain 360degree security and visibility of the surrounding areas attacks may occur after convoys pa ss given location therefore gunners must ensure rear security is maintained vehicle hardening procedures 626 when threat conditions warrant command ers harden vehicles before convoy opera tions 627 adding sandbags armor plating ballistic glass and other protective devices reduces the vulnerability of hardened vehicle to the ffects of explosives and small arms fire the primary purpose of hardening is to protect the vehicles occupants from injury although it may make certain vehicle components and cargo less vulnerable 628 consider the following factors in determin ing the method and extent of vehicle harden ing when threat to friendly forces exists z flexibility harden vehicles to provide the gree of protection required while maintaining maximum flexibility in its use harden the cargo beds of vehicles with sandbags to protect troops z weight all vehicle hardening adds weight to the vehicle this requires command ers to reduce the amount of cargo carried z availability consider the availability of suitable materials and the time needed to complete the project 65 fmi 30722 z types of roads roads traveled may determine the amount of hardening protec tion needed for example hardtop roads generally present fewer hazards from mines than dirt roads z maintenance vehicle hardening normally increases the amount of vehicle maintenance needed if an excessive amount of weight is added it may impact on the vehi cles mobility and operational capabilities kevlar blankets are effective and mini mize extra weight unfortunately the excess weight destroys the tires and th drive train quickly operating with hardened vehicles requires leaders to emphasize preventive maintenance checks and services vehicle weapon improvements 629 strengthening the vehicle weapons platfo rms is an additional countermeasure against insurgent attacks when convoys come under ttack the key to defeating and destroying the attackers is wellaimed overwhelming fire by adding to an already existing weapons mixplatform for particular vehicle soldiers have the capacity to exponentially enhance

receive information about upco ming disturbances from those whom they have befriended 632 to combat civil disturbances leaders pply the minimum force ne cessary to help hn authorities restore law and order leaders and soldiers remain aware that the media often covers civil disturbances even when not covered these disturbances are opportunities to shape the information environment positively toward the us and the hn forces and gov ernment combatting these disturbances may involve the following z maintain the essential distribution tran sportation and communications systems z set up roadblocks z cordon off areas z make show of force z disperse or contain crowds 69 fmi 30722 z release riot control agents only when dire cted to do so only the president can au thorize us forces to use riot control agents z serve as security forces or reserves z initiate needed relief measures such as di stributing food or clothing or establish ing emergency shelters z employ nonlethal munitions and equipment 633 leaders plan and prepare their units for encountering civil disturbances during coun terinsurgency operations plans include not only how soldiers and units react but also the use of tactical psyop teams leaders coordinate with local civil police to establish lines of authority and responsibility when dealing with civilian disturbances us military leaders ensure operations involving us forces and hn police conform to us law and policy 634 when planning and preparing for civil disturbance operations commanders emphasize prevention rather than confrontation once confrontation occurs m ilitary forces also deal with noncombatants that have internationally recognized rights these rights must be re spected while maintaining public order 635 military forces display fair and impartial treatment and adhere to the principle of minimum force 636 civil police apprehend process and deta in civil law violators military forces perform these functions only when necessity dictates and to the minimum extent required return these functions to civil authorities as soon as possible threat analysis 637 proportional and appropriate responses to civil disturbances are based on an analysis of the threat the disturbance poses factors to be considered are z crowd size how many people are actually present of those how many are com bative armed or unarmed and what type people comprise the crowd grown men women juveniles children or mix z motivator is this an individual leading the crowd or the crowd feeding on itself z driving force what is the reason for the gatheringriot z emotions and intentions listen to what the crowd is saying you may be able to deescalate the situation treat the crowd lik an individual person but remain ob servant for changes z crowd evaluation will the size of the force affect the crowd z movement or motion where is the crowd trying to go z type of crowd clothing light or full due to heat or heavy coats to protect due to cold clothing affects the type of m unitions used and the aiming point z area and environment of the situation this affects the types of munitions used z availability of gravel or rocks these can be thrown at the control force z escape routes for the crowd there should be at least two avenues of escape that the crowd can use z avenues of withdrawal for the control force there must also be at least two avenues of withdrawal for the formation crowd characteristics 638 control force leaders consider the followi ng characteristics when assessing situations involving crowds z crowd type 610 health considerations movement security and civil distu rbances z crowd leadership z tactics the crowd is using types of crowds 639 there are four types of crowds z casual crowd required elements of the casual crowd are space and people z sighting crowd includes casual crowd elements an d an event the event provides the groups common bond z agitated crowd possesses the three elements of the sighting crowd plus the ele ment of emotion z mob characterized by hostility and aggression mob is an agitated crowd in volved in physical activity 640 to control the mob requires simultaneous actions the primary goal is to reduce the emotional levels of the individuals within the mob this action will deescalate the aggres siveness and potential violence of the crowd phys ical force of some type may be necessary to quell the disturbance crowd leadership 641 leadership affects greatly the intensity and direction of crowd behavior skillful agi tator can convert group of resentful people in to an angry mob and direct their aggression and anger toward the control group the first pe rson to start giving clear orders authorita tively is likely to be followed radical lead ers can easily take charge exploit the crowds mood and direct it toward convenient target 642 it is important to note that the leader of the crowd or group does not necessarily fit into one category the leader may be combative vocal or seemingly lowkey and may change roles as needed properly identifying the leader of an angry or potentially violent group and skillfully removing the leader without causing dditional violence is key to defusing poten tially dangerous situation crowd tactics 643 crowd tactics can be unplanned or planne d violent or not the more organized and purposeful crowd becomes the more likely the tactics used will have been planned organ ized mobs will try to defeat the control force by employing several different types of tactics these tactics include z constructing barricades z using molotov cocktails rocks slingshots and smoke grenades z feinting and flanking actions 644 crowd behavior during civil disturbance is essentially emotional and without reason the feelings and the momentum generated have tendency to cause the whole group to fol low the example displayed by its worst members skillful agitators or subversive elements exploit these psychological factors during diso rders regardless of the reason for violence the results may consist of indiscriminate burnin g and looting or open and violent attacks on officials buildings and innocent passersby rio ters may set fire to buildings and vehicles to z block the advance of troops z create confusion and diversion z achieve goals of property destruction looting and sniping 611 fmi 30722 645 mobs will often use various types of weap ons against authorities these include but are not limited to z verbal abuse z use of perceived innocents or weak pers ons such as the elderly women and chil dren as human shields z thrown and blunt impact objects s uch as rocks bricks and clubs z vehicles and other large movable objects z firearms explosives and ot her pyrotechnic devices types of resisters 646 individuals can be categorized according to what level of force they can use or what threat they present z complacent resisters complacent resisters are nonverbal they look at you when you talk to them but do not reply in any way they become limp when touched or forced to move their body they can very quickly become violent and physically combative dont underestimate them z vocal resisters vocal resisters offer verbal re ply and when touched highlight themselves in an effort to gain the attention of the media z combative resisters combative resisters pose the greatest danger to the control force they are not passive once they are touched place the individual in prone position cuff them and remove them from the area see appendix i tactical psyop teams 647 tpts using loudspeakers can help control crowds and defuse potentially hostile situa tions tpt members may be assigned as members of planned quick reaction force or take part on the spur of the moment in any case proper planning and clear situational under standing are important to properly using tpts 648 the tpt leader assesses the situation by gathering as much information about the situation as quickly as possible the clearer th leaders situational understanding the more effectively the plan can be developed prepared for and executed use the supported unit and intelligence assets to find out what friendly uni ts are in the area and use them to gather spe cific information these assets may be odas or military police the following are examples of the type of information that should be gathered during planning z location of the crowd z size of crowd z known potential key communicators z agitators z are weapons present if so what types z apparent grievance z stated goals of the crowd 649 during the initial stages of the disturbance the team monitors and attempts to identify facts and validate assumptions about the crowd the tpt uses the following questions as guide to gain as complete an understanding as possible

use line formation to move crowd without di viding it or move it away from an object or place see figure 68 figure 68 platoon line 615 fmi 30722 echelon 655 the echelon is an offensive formation used to turn or divert groups in either open or built up areas and to move crowds away from buildings fences and walls see figures 69 6 10 and 611 figure 610 platoon echelon left with 2nd squad in direct

offensive formation that is used to penetrate and split crowds into smaller groups see figures 612 and 613 figure 613 platoon wedge with right lateral support figure 612 platoon wed ge diamond 657 diamond formation is used to enter crowd it is the formation of choice for ex traction teams as defensive formation the diamond is used when allaround secu rity is required such as in open areas see figure 614 figure 614 platoon diamond formation 617 fmi 30722 circle 658 the circle formation is used for the same purposes as the diamond formation the decision to use either the diamond or circle formation is based on the conforma tion of the crowd see figure 615 vehicles and formations 659 vehicles may be employed with troops in control force formation especially when large rioting crowd is on hand when using vehicles cover the windshield with sturdy close mesh fencing and the standard safety glass create buffer space between the two surfaces 660 shields and or mobile barriers may be built by mounting wooden or metal frame strung with barbed wire across the front of vehicle figure 615 platoon circle 661 members of the formation should walk as near to the front corners of each vehicle as possible to keep rioters from attacking the sides and rear of the vehicles 662 when uparmored hmmwvs or other armo red vehicles are used in crowd control for mations leaders ensure that they are able to see and control the formation crowd control 663 leaders choose their options based on an assessment of the crowd leaders select the combination of control techniques and force opti

be us military personnel or at least us citi zens in some operational or training settings abroad soldiers are not faced with the prob lem of selecting an interpreter they are assi gned one by the chain of command or hn gov ernment in other cases interpreters are chosen from pool provided by the hn government finally in many operational situat ions interpreters are hired from the general hn population whatever the case the followi ng guidelines are critical to mission accom plishment b2 interpreters should be select ed based on the following criteria z native speaker interpreters should be native speakers of the socially or geo graphically determined dialect their speech background and mannerisms should be completely acceptable to the target audien ce ta so that attention is given to the way they talk only to what they say z social status in some situations and cultures interpreters may be limited in their effectiveness with ta if their social standing is considerably lower than that of the audience examples include signific ant differences in military rank or mem bership in an ethnic or religious group re gardless of soldiers personal feelings on social status they should remember the jo b is to accomplish the mission not to act as an agent for social reform soldiers must tolerate local prejudices as fact of life z english fluency an oftenoverlooked consideration is how well the interpreter speaks english as rule if the interp reter understands the soldier and the sol dier understands the interpreter then th interpreters command of english is sat isfactory soldier can check that understan ding by asking the interpreter to phrase in english something the soldier said the soldier then restates the interpreters comments to ensu re that both understand each other in addition in terpreting goes both ways interpreters must be able to convey information ex pressed by interviewees or the ta z intellectual intelligence interpreters should be quic k alert and responsive to changing conditions and situations they should be able to grasp complex concepts and discuss them without confusion in reasonably logical sequence although education does not equate to intelligence generally speaking the better educated the interpreter the better he or she will perform due to increased exposure to di verse concepts z technical ability in certain situations soldiers may need interpreters with tech nical training or experience in special subj ect areas this type of interpreter is able to translate the meaning as well as the word s for instance if the subject is nuclear physics background knowledge is useful z reliability soldiers should beware of potent ial interpreter who arrives late for the interview throughout the world the concept of time varies widely in many b1 fmi 30722 lessdeveloped countries time is relatively unimportant soldiers should make sure that interpreters understand the importance of punctuality z loyalty if interpreters are local nationals it is safe to assume that their first loy alty is to the hn or ethnic group not to the us military the security implications are clear soldiers must be very cautious in how they explain concepts addition ally some interpreters for political or pe rsonal reasons may have ulterior motives or hidden agenda when they apply for an interpreting job soldiers who detect or suspects such motives should tell the commander or security manager z gender age and race gender age and race can riously affect mission accom plishment one example is the status of females in muslim society in predomi nantly muslim countries cultural prohibit ions may render female interpreter in effective in certain circumstances anothe r example is the balkans where ethnic divisions may limit the effectiveness of an interpreter from outside the ta since traditions values and biases vary from country to country it is important to check with the incountry assets or area studies for specific taboos or favorable character istics z compatibility soldiers and interpreters work as teams for interpreters to be most effective they should become psyc hic extension of soldiers the ta will be quick to recognize personality conflicts between soldiers and interpreters such conflicts can undermine the effectiveness of the communication effort if possible when selecting interpreters soldiers should look for compatible traits and strive for harmonious working relationship b3 if several qualified interpreters are avail able soldiers should select at least two this practice is of particular importance if the inte rpreter will be used during long conferences or courses of instruction when two interpreters are available they should work for onehalf hour periods due to the mental strain associated with this type job four hours of active in terpreting is usually the approximate maximum fo r peak effectiveness in the case of short duration meetings and conversations when two or more interpreters are available one can provide quality control and assistance to the ac tive interpreter additionally this technique is useful when conducting coordination or nego tiation meetings as one interpreter is used in an active role and the other pays attention to the body language and side conversations of the others present many times soldiers can gain important auxiliary information that as sists in negotiations from listening to what others are saying among themselves outside of the main discussion target analysis b4 implied throughout the preceding points is the need for careful analysis of the ta this type of analysis goes beyond the scope of this appendix mature judgment thoughtful consideration of the ta as individuals and genuine concern for their receiving accurate in formation goes long way toward accomplishing the mission soldiers must remember that an individual from farm or small village is going to have markedly different expectations than jetsetting polo player evaluation criteria b5 as mentioned it is safe to assume that if interpreters are not us military or us citi zens their first loyalty is to their country or ethnic group not the united states b6 the security implications of using local nationals are clear soldiers must be cautious about what information they give interpreters soldiers must ways keep security in mind b7 certain tactical situations may require the use of uncleared indigenous personnel as field expedient interpreters commanders should be aware of the increased security risk b2 use of interpreters involved in using such personnel and carefully weigh the risk versus the potential gain if uncleared interpreters are used any sensitive information should be kept to minimum b8 interpreters must be honest and free from unfavorable notoriety among the local popu lace their reputation or standing in the comm unity should be such that persons of higher rank and standing will not intimidate them establishing rapport b9 interpreters are vital link between so ldiers and the ta without cooperative suppor tive interpreters the mission could be in serious jeopardy mutual respect and understand ing is essential to effective teamwork soldiers must establish rapport early in the relation ship and maintain rapport throughout the oper ation the difficulty of establishing rapport stems most of the time from the lack of personal contact b10 soldiers begin the process of establishi ng rapport before they meet interpreters for the first time by doing their homework in advance on the people nations and areas to be discussed most foreigners are reasonably know ledgeable about the united states soldiers should obtain some basic facts about the hn useful information may include population geography ethnic groups political system pr ominent political figures monetary system business agriculture and exports good gene ral outline can be obtained from recent manac or encyclopedia more detailed informatio n is available in the area handbook for the country from the internet and from current newspapers and magazines b11 soldiers working with an interpreter should find out about the interpreters back ground soldiers should show genuine concern for the interpreters family aspirations ca reer education and so on many cultures plac greater emphasis on family over career than the united states so soldiers should start with understanding the interpreters home life soldiers should also research cultural tr aditions to find out more about the interpreter and the hn though soldiers should gain as mu ch information on culture as possible before entering an hn their interpreters can be valu able sources to fill gaps showing interest is good way to build rapport b12 soldiers should gain an interpreters trust and confidence before embarking on sensi tive issues such as religion likes dislikes and prejudices soldiers should approach these areas carefully and tactfully although deeply personal beliefs may be very revealing and useful in the professional relationship soldiers must gently and tactfully draw these out of their interpreters orientation b13 early in the relationship with interprete rs soldiers should ensure that interpreters are briefed on their duties and responsibilities soldiers should orient interpreters as to the nature of the interpreters duties standards of conduct expected interview techniques to be used and any other requirements the orientation may include the following z current tactical situation z background information obtained on the source interviewee or ta z specific objectives for the interview meeting or interrogation z method of interpretation to be usedsimultaneous or consecutive simultaneouswhen the interpreter listens and translates at the same time consecutivewhen the interpreter listens to an entire phrase sentence or paragraph then translates during natural pauses z conduct of the interview lesson or interrogation z need for interpreters to avoid injecting th eir own personality ideas or questions into the interview b3 fmi 30722 z need for interpreter to inform soldier of inconsistencies in language used by inter viewee an example would be someone who claims to be colle ge professor yet speaks like an uneducated person during interrogations or interviews this infor mation will be used as part of the assessm ent of the information obtained from the individual z physical arrangements of site if applicable z possible need for interpreter to assist in afteraction reviews or assessments interpreter training b14 as part of the initial training with inte rpreters soldiers should tactfully convey that the instructor interviewer or interrogator alwa ys directs the interview or lesson soldiers should put the interpreters role in proper perspective and stress the interpreters impor tance as vital communication link between sold iers and the ta soldiers should appeal to interpreters professional pride by clearly describing how the quality and quantity of the in formation sent and received is directly depend ent upon an interpreters skills also soldiers should mention how interpreters functions solely as conduit between soldier and subjects b15 soldiers should be aware that some interpreters because of cultural differences might attempt to save face by purposely concealing their lack of understanding they may attempt to translate what they think the soldie r or subject said or meant without asking for clarification because this situation can result in misinformation and confusion and im pact on credibility soldiers should let interpre ters know that when in doubt they should always ask for clarification soldiers should create safe environment for this situation as early as possible b16 soldiers should cover these points wh ile orienting and training the interpreter z importance of the training interview or interrogation z specific objectives of the training interview or interrogation if any z outline of lesson or interview questions if applicable z background information on the interviewee or ta z briefing training or interview schedule s the interviewer must remember that conducting an interview through an inte rpreter may take double or triple the amount of time needed when the interv iewer is directly questioning the inter viewee for that reason the interpreter ma be helpful in scheduling enough time z copy of the briefing questions or lesso n plan if applicable special attention should be given to develop language profic iency in the technical fields in which the interpreters are expected to be employed in general copy of the material will give the interpreter time to look up unf amiliar words or ask questions to clarify anything confusing z copies of handout material if applicable z general background information on the subject z glossary of terms if applicable interview preparation b17 soldiers select an appropriate site for interviews they position and arrange the physical setup of the area when conducting interviews with important people or individuals from different cultures this arrangement can be significant b18 soldiers instruct interpreters to mirro r the soldiers tone and personality of speech soldiers instruct interpreter not to interject th eir own questions or personality they also in struct interpreters to inform them if they tice any inconsistencies or peculiarities from sources b4 use of interpreters b19 whenever possible soldier should identi fy cultural restrictions before interviewing instructing or conferring with particular foreign nationals for instance they should know when is it proper to stand sit or cross on legs gestures being learned behavior vary from culture to culture interpreters should be able to relate number of these cultural re strictions which whenever possible should be observed in working with particular groups or individuals interview conduct b20 whether conducting an interview or pres enting lesson soldiers should avoid simul taneous translations that is both the soldier and the interpreter talking at the same time soldiers should speak for minute or less in neutral relaxed manner directly to the indi vidual or audience the interpreter should watc h the soldier carefully and during the trans lation mimic the soldiers body language as well as interpret his or her verbal meaning sol diers should observe interpreters closely to detect any inconsistencies between an interpreters and soldiers manners soldiers must be carefu l not to force an interpreter into literal translation by being too brief so ldiers should present one major thought in its entirety and allow the interpre ter to reconstruct it in his or her language and culture b21 although interpreters perform some editin g as function of the interpreting process it is imperative that they transmit the exac t meaning without additions or deletions sol diers should insist that interpreters always as k for clarification prior to interpreting when ever they not absolutely certain of the soldier s meaning however soldiers should be aware that good interpreter especially one who is local can be invaluable in translating subtle ties and hidden meanings b22 during an interview or lesson if ques tions are asked interpreters should immedi ately relay them for an answer interpreters sh ould never attempt to answer questions even though they may know the correct answer addi tionally neither soldie rs nor interpreters should correct each other in front of an intervie wee or class all differences should be settled away from the subject or audience b23 just as establishing rapport with the interpreter is vitally important establishing rapport with interview subjects or the ta is equally important soldiers and interpreters should concentrate on rapport to establish rappo rt subjects or audiences should be treated as mature important human beings who are capable and worthy communication techniques b24 an important first step for soldiers in communicating in foreign language is to pol ish their english language skills these skills are important even if attempt is made to learn the indigenous language the clearer soldie rs speak in english including using clear correct words the easier it is for interpreters to translate for instance soldiers may want to add words usually left out in colloquial english such as the air in airplane to ensure that they are not misinterpreted as referring to the great plains or carpenters plane b25 soldiers should not use profanity at ll and should avoid slang and colloquialisms in many cases such expressions ca nnot be translated even those that can be translated do not always retain the desired meaning military ja rgon and terms such as gee whiz or golly are hard to translate b26 soldiers should avoid using acronyms while these have become part of everyday military language in most cases interpreters and tas will not be familiar with them and it will be necessary for the interpreter to interrupt the interview to get clarification regarding the expanded form this can disrupt the rhythm of the interview or lesson moreover if in terpreters must constantly interrupt the interv iewer for clarification they could lose credi bility in the eyes of the ta which could jeopar dize the goals of the interview or lesson in b5 fmi 30722 addition if technical term or expression must be used soldiers must be sure interpreters convey the proper meaning b27 when speaking extemporaneously soldiers must think about what they want to say they should break their thoughts into logica l bits and say them piece at time using short simple words and sentences which can be translated quickly and easily as rule of thumb soldiers should never say more in one ntence than they can easily repeat word for word immediately after saying it each senten ce should contain complete thought without verbiage b28 soldiers should avoid folk and cultur especific references tas may have idea what is being talked about even if interprete rs understand the reference they may find it extremely difficult to quickly identify an approp riate equivalent in the tas cultural frame of reference b29 transitional phrases and qualifiers nd to confuse nonnative speakers and waste valuable time examples are for example i n most cases maybe and perhaps b30 soldiers should be cautious of using american humor since humor does not translate well between cultures cultural and language di fferences can lead to misinterpretations by foreigners soldiers should determine early on what their interpreters find easiest to under stand and translate meaningfully b31 in summary soldiers should z keep presentations as simple as possible z use short sentences and simp words low context z avoid idiomatic english z avoid flowery language z avoid slang and colloquial expressions z avoid folk and culturespecific references dos and donts b32 the following are some dos and donts for soldiers to consider when working with in terpreters dos b33 soldiers should z position the interpreter by their side or even step back this will keep the sub ject or ta from shifting their attention or fixating on the interpreter and not on the soldier z always look at and talk directly to the bject or ta guard against the tendency to talk to the interpreter z speak slowly and clearly repeat as often as necessary z speak to the individual or group as if th ey understand english be enthusiastic and employ the gestures movements voice into nations and inflections that would nor mally be used before an englishspeaki ng group considerable nonverbal meaning can be conveyed through voice and body movements encourage interpreters to mimic the same delivery z periodically check an interpreters accura cy consistency and clarity have an american fluent enough in the language si t in on lesson or interview to ensure that the translation is not distorted in tentionally or unintentionally another way to be sure is to learn the target language so that an interpreters loyalty and hon esty can be personally checked b6 use of interpreters z check with the audience whenever understandings are suspected and clarify immediately using the interpreter ask qu estions to elicit answers that will tell whether the point is clear if it is not rephrase the instruction differently and illus trate the point again use repetition and examples whenever necessary to facilitate learning if the ta asks few questions it may mean the instruction is not under stood or the message is not clear to them z make interpreters feel like valuable members of the team give them recognition commensurate with the importance of their contributions donts b34 soldiers should not z address the subject or audience in the th ird person through the interpreter avoid saying for example tell them im glad to be their instructor instead say im glad to be your instructor address the subject or audience directly make contin ual eye contact with the audience watch them not the interpreter z make side comments to interp reter that are not interprete d this action tends to create the wrong atmosphere fo r communication and is rude z be distraction while the interpreter is tr anslating and the subject or ta is listen ing soldiers should not pace write on th blackboard teeter on the lectern drink beverages or carry on any other distractin g activity while the interpreter is trans lating b7 appendix c population and resources control principles c1 population and

counteract enemy propaganda conduct national io campaign strategy with in teragency planning and resources that dist ributes its message and is responsive to current events to ensure relevancy ex ecute it in the districts and locales c1 fmi 30722 z provide discreet means for citizens to provide information about insurgents peo ple tend to submit reports based on rumors or grudge reports however some of these are true be alert for them phases c3 population and resources control operation has four phases z preparation z task and organization z control z relinquishment phase i p reparation c4 in coordination with the country team and other governmental agencies the initial conditions to create tactical success are estab lished at the theater and operationallevels commanders establish aos based on political g eography and demographics they take into account the levels of concern resistance and violence staffs identify and recommend higherpriority facilities elements and rout commanders assign program responsibilities at the province district and local levels cons ider the following when planning and prepar ing population and resources control operation z do not hurt the people but kill the insurgents where us forces violate this dic tum us policies may fail z obtain legal authority to train and arrest or attack insurgents where necessary local judiciary representative or tribal aderofficials support is crucial here re member police arrest and bring criminals to trial soldiers kill and capture insur gents z establish unity of command and representati on on the us side indigenous leader ship would optimally report to only one us person do not confuse hn forces with convoluted us chain of command z coordinate operations of the hn police civil guard and military through the us multinational and hn command and control systems z strongly recommend the hn local security forces unify their leadershipthe police civil guard and military that secure an d control the populace where possible z secure the town area and then the district around the clock live among the peo ple to develop local relationships and gain walkin intelligence patrolling should be active and avoid static positions plan to establish hasty roadblocks and check points for more than few hours each to decrease the possibility of insurgent at tacks on them z study the local security force and police tr aining plan develop plan to augment and enhance the training to enable the loca ls to secure and police their villages plan for recruiting vetting training and eq uipping the local security people to be gin as soon as possible z plan to request to integrate hn local uni t into an equivalentsized us unit then integrate us organization into hn loca l unit as trainers and liaison personnel stay alert z research and plan to gain the information from recent census or conduct census of each village community district and re gion if you do not have access to cur rent census or do not conduct thorough census you will not know who is supposed to live in the area as compared to who is actually there recognizing any discrep ancy may help identify insurgents c2 population and resources control within each town draw diagram or use satellite imagery and number the buildings in each square block within each building establish who and how many people are living in each apartment or room record the names gender age and relationship to the other occupants take pictures of each where possible there may be cultural sensitivities in this area then build carddigital file with this information categorized use gps devices to establish exact loca tions and to locate huts houses or neighborhoods two to three weeks later cordonandsearch block during the evening or night to verify the data avoid est ablishing target sequencepattern z plan and contract for the upgrade and ree quipping of local security forces as re quired so these forces have superior leve l of arms as compared to the insurgents for example with weapons such as techni cals technicals are field expedient vehi cles used as weapons platforms purchas pickup trucks and equip them with crewserved pintlemounted weapons such as 50 caliber machine guns or mk19 automatic grenade launchers be prepared for increased interest in these weapons by all sides z use io planners to develop psyop prog ram designed to win the confidence and support of the population and establish base of political allegiance ensure the us multinational and hn forces are making the populaces life better on daily basis ensure the townspeople all know what you are doing start with clean water sewage disposal health care dental checks and schools z plan for and coordinate local intelligence development gathering and analysis op erations develop sources among the popu lace while recognizing underlying pur poses children are nondescript collectors of information for you as well as about you they are very effective as lookouts and in surveillance they will divulge in credible information as reward for kindness verify and vet the information z plan for development and issue of an identi fication card to each resident use this card to track personnel movement and as identification for elections checkpoints should have mobile card reader technology that feeds movement data into com puter chipdatabase to track and enable iden tification of personnel movements and patterns z where card reader exists track moveme nt by assigning color and stamp to the community or district close group of village s or towns ensure all citizens have the appropriate color anyone from outside th communitydistrict will have different color or color record the five ws who what where when and why at all checkpoints pass this to inte lligence personnel for analysis z plan to establish civilmilitary coordina tion committees find out the populaces priorities and fears find out what you an d the security forces are doing that works and what does not work listen to your soldiers who are listening to the people beware of local leaders who might be work ing for their own interests publicize and inform the people of what you are doing for them z plan and coordinate civil programs phase ii t ask and organization c5 assign subordinates responsibility for each of the above and belownoted tasks all brief their initial concept and the commander deconflicts and prioriti zes then rebrief z the populace of each town and official s such as the mayor police and teachers must be secure around the clock the secu rity force families must be protected to prevent indirect threats and intimidation c3 fmi 30722 z establish general surveillance measures an d movement control on the roads lead ing into the town as well as those inside the town z organize combine and carry out training for the security forces the graduation exercise is an actual patrol against th insurgents to include scheduled surveil lance z the local villagecommunity must be trai ned to secure and police their village start recruiting vetting training equipping the local security people as soon as possible z establish covert surveillance of the market place and stores record discreetly who buys what how much and how often freque ncy look for unusual amounts of food clothing equipment fertilizers such as urea ammonium nitrate and phosphates not purchased by farmers and abnormal freq uency recruitdraft locals to do this work but crosscheck them to determine wh can be trusted reward the trusted ones z perform daily comparison of the supplies purchase and movements information against the census card file information answer questions such as why is someone buying 50lb bag of rice and 8 pairs of b oots and ten pairs of pants or rolls of cot ton cloth when they have only wife and four children to feed and clothe if they are underemployed where did they get the mo ney to buy the food and clothes look for breaks in patterns such as farmer traveling to nearby village at midday when he is usually working in the fields z select and organize civil guards draft th ose with stake who will benefit from the security train and arm them you must help the populace choose side if they are in some type of civil defense force where they are exposed to insurgent attacks but they have the weapons and training to defe at such attacks they are far less likely to help the insurgents z establish security coordination centers all intelligencerelated information comes here is recorded and analyzed and goes ou t to the security forces establish sepa rate facilities for prisoner detention and interrogation use psychological profiling to set the conditions for gaining informat ion if prisoners are mistreated or tor tured the populace will find out and the fl ow of insurgents turning themselves in will dry up mistreatment can seriously damage us multinational and hn objec tives and motives z establish exercise and refine security and alert systems z intensify intelligence collection and analysis to identify the insurgent political and support apparatus z establish system of block wardens with reporting procedures as well as incen tives hold the wardens accountable for knowing what is going on in their block and environs for example do any resident s go out surreptitiously in the evening and return late but are not regulars at coffee house or bar are there any visi tors in the block where are they from and whom are they visiting are they picious and in what way z establish systems of coordination with security and military forces in the area z intensify psyop to win the political allegiance of the people phase iii c ontrol c6 need sentence describing the point of the phase z the decisive operation is preventing an population support for the insurgents z supporting operations focus on preventing any popular support for the insurgents z secure vital infrastructure using local personnel as the security force c4 population and resources control z establish restrictions and controls cur fews pass systems surveillance road blocks z transition to using hn local and civil curity organizations in ambushes area sweeps and raids z coordinate use of police and military units as backups z establish and develop amnesty and rehabilitation programs protect the families of those who choose to c ooperate with the hn z increase intelligence and psyop activities phase iv r elinquishment c7 during phase iv us forces hand responsi bility for the population and resources control operation to hn forces relinquishment has two stages stage c8 do the following during stage z reduce intensity of controls from phase iii level although patrols surveillance and periodic hasty checkpoints throug hout the district area continue z reduce major operations for example ambushes and raids z gradually phase out military forces with pr imary responsibility for population and resources control passing to hn police and paramilitary units withdraw us forces to bases that are removed from the population z continue intelligence activities at high level and increase psyop programs to the maximum level to prevent regeneration of hardcore apparatus stage b c9 do the following during stage b z continue checks on the movement of personnel and goods z reduce controls and individual restrictio ns to minimum and review block warden system z reward the population for cooperation an d progress assess success by regions and areas in order to gradually ease populati on and resource control measures as dis tricts and provinces demonstrate cooperat ion and stability enable areas to earn less restrictive measures as districts prov inces and regions gain vested interest in assisting the hn government they can compete against each other to gain better treatment and fewer restrictions z continue intelligence and psyop with an em phasis on programs designed to assist in providing solid base of political allegiance to the hn z reduce civil guardlocal militia units to standby basis although organization and training should continue military police and security activities c10 military police support the commander and civil affairs personnel in conducting population and resources control operations during counterinsurgency missions these op erations may consist of z enforcing movement rest rictions and curfews z resettling dislocated refugees z msr regulation and enforcement z amnesty programs c5 fmi 30722 z inspecting facilities z guarding humanitarian assistance distribution sites military police also direct dislocated civilians and refugees to resettlement areas and work closely with local and district hn gove rnment agencies during this process c11 military police training firepower and mobility coupled with their interface with and acceptability to the local populace make them an asset in certain securityrelated popu lation and resources control tasks checkpoints and roadblocks c12 checkpoints and roadblocks are set up to check and control the movement of person nel vehicles and materiel and prevent acti ons that aid the enemy during counterinsur gency operations checkpoints and roadblocks assist the commander in maintaining the ini tiative against the insurgents by disrupting interfering with and deterring insurgent operations and disrupting the insurgents decisi on making cycle it is important to conduct checkpoints and roadblocks with interpreters hn police or other hn security forces c13 when conducting checkpoint operat ions soldiers need the following support z engineers to build obstacles and barriers to channel traffic z linguists that are familiar with the local language and understand your language z hn police or civil affairs officer z trained interrogators z barrier equipment z signs and lighting z communications equipment checkpoints and searches c14 attitude and mindset think of checkp oint as an ambush position with friendly attitude trust one outside of your checkp oint team members while on duty to reduce misunderstandings and confusion on the part of the local populace recommend posting in structions in the indigenous languages on signs at the entrances to checkpoints c15 checkpoints site selection should be bas ed on leader reconnaissance the site must allow for vehicle escape route and include plan s to destroy hostile element that uses such route if the checkpoint is completely sealed off insurgents may only penetrate it by at tempting to run over or bypass emplaced barricades c16 duration of the checkpoint may vary fr om 1 to 72 hours depending on the purpose of the operation checkpoints that are established early operate for several hours during peri ods of peak traffic flow and then reposition to different location may lessen the risk of in surgent attack and increase the probability of detecting and attacking or capturing insur gents lessons learned from operation iraqi freedom indicate checkpoints lasting over 72 hours were less effective for reasons related to predictability and fatigue c17 checkpoints are deliberate and hasty but always must consist of the following z obstacles or barriers emplaced in serpenti ne design to slow or stop speeding ve hicles z search areas for personnel and vehicles z security overwatch and fighting positions z holding areas z lighting for night operations c6 population and resources control z designated assaultreaction forces to attack or pursue individual groups or vehi cles that attempt to maneuver through or turn around and attempt to

if vehicle turns around and attempts to avoid the checkpoint designated element pursues and engages them shoot the tires first approach carefully and assume the worst however the occu pants may simply be tired of waiting in line z overall dont hurt people unnecessarily some people simply dont understand what you are directing them to do hasty checkpoint c22 hasty checkpoints should be set up to st from 5 minutes to up to 30 minutes in du ration one technique is the maximum use of orga nic vehicles to serve as additional security and to assist in funneling traffic through the checkp oint in addition to concertina wire and if available tire spikes c23 the short duration 5 to 30 minutes reduces the risk of an insurgent organizing and conducting mortar or car bomb attack agai nst the checkpoint additionally this may dis rupt the timing of another planned insurgent action c24 characteristics of hasty checkpoint are z located along likely avenues of approach z achieves surprise z temporary and moved often z the platoon is able to carry the construction materials z uses vehicles as an obstacle between th vehicles and personnel and reinforces them with concertina wire z soldiers are positioned at each end of the checkpoint z soldiers are covered by mounted or dismounted automatic weapons z reaction force at least one squad is concea led nearby to attack or assault in case the site is attacked c25 soldiers establish hasty checkpoints wh ere they cannot be seen by approaching traf fic until it is too late for approaching traffic to unobtrusively withdraw effective locations on which to set up hasty checkpoints include c8 population and resources control z bridges near either or both ends but not in the middle z defiles either end is better than in the middle z highway intersections these must be we ll organized to reduce the inherent dan ger z the reverse slope of hill hidden from the direction of the main flow of traffic z just beyond sharp curve vehicle search c26 the following is vehicle search checklist z stop the vehicle at the search area z direct the occupants to exit the vehicle an d escort them away to nearby search area z direct the male occupants to lift all clothi ng to ensure explosive devices are not at tached to their body females must check female occupants when female inspec tors are not present an effective method is to search women by having them pull their garments tight to their bodies so th at any contour formed by an explosive vice or material will stand out use expl osive detection devices if available z soldiers remain behind secure and fortif ied position while this process is being conducted see figure c5 page c13 fo r prescribed standoff distances against ex plosives z direct the occupants to open all doors th trunk the hood of the vehicles and the gas cap to include inside enclosures such as glove compartments z conduct visual inspection while the occupants of the vehicles lift any and all ob structions from the

weapons and ammunition items of intelligence value currency drugs other inappropriate items and anything that seems out of the ordinary c29 soldiers conduct individual searches in search teams that consist of the following z searcher actually conducts the search th is is the highestrisk position z security maintains eye contact with the individual being searched z observer the observer is leader who has pervisory control he provides early warning c30 the two most common methods used to conduct individual searches are frisk and wall searches z frisk search quick and adequate to detect weapons evidence or contraband frisk search is more dangerous because th searcher has less control of the individ ual being searched z wall search affords more safety for the sea rcher any upright surface may be used such as wall vehicle tree or fence the search team places the subject in the kneelin g or prone position if more control is needed to search an uncooperative individual c31 strip searches should only be considered when the individual is suspected of carrying documents or other contraband on his or her pe rson this extreme search method should be conducted in an enclosed area and by qua lified medical personnel when available additional checkpoint considerations c32 the following should be cons idered when operating checkpoint z team duties and reactions must be welldefined backbriefed by all and rehearsed z standardize the following three mandator minimum signals at every checkpoint stop get out of the car lift your shirt z prepare and emplace signs in the local nguage instructing indigenous personnel what to expect and do at the checkpoint z determine if it is necessary to apprehen d or detain those who see the checkpoint ahead and attempt to turn around z use hn police and military when available z position response force close to the approach route to block or detain vehicles that try to avoid the checkpoint z clear and maintain control of all buildin gs and terrain that dominate the check point z stay alert for any change of scenery around the checkpoint crowds gathering for apparent reason or media representative s waiting for an event are all indicators that something may happen z use artificial illumination for night operations z if hn personnel are used to assist ensure they do not represent national ethnic or religious group or faction that is fear ed or hated by the majority of the local population z move the checkpoint location and change the method of operation at random to avoid setting patterns the longer your posi tion remains static the greater the risk you will be attacked c10 population and resources control c33 record the following information z the number and type of vehicles stopped report identifying markings license

operations the nature of the threat requires order of battle intelligence be produced in greater detail than is found in conventional operations all larger organizations must be analyzed mappedout and understood often the focus starts with individuals or cells however order of battle development should not be linear an insur gencys foot soldiers are often easily identified and analyzed due to their more public expo sure however it is paramount to identify the leaders and their relationships at all levels to accurately establish an initial order of battle in counterinsurgency operations the catego ries of personalities culture and internal organizational processes are added to the usual list of order of battle factors that are studied from the same perspective as in conventional warfare and include z composition z disposition z strength z tactics and operations z training z logistics support z combat effectiveness z electronic technical data z personalities z miscellaneous data composition d2 composition is the identification of uni ts and political religious or ethnic organiza tions unit identification consists of the comple designation of specific entity by name or number type relative size or strength and subordination composition includes z operational and support cells simila r to sections in military unit z echelons z staff elements z political religious ideological and military aims z internal and external c2 z operational organizations z internal and external support structure z external ties z assassination squads z bomb and demolition squads z attack or hit squads d1 fmi 30722 disposition d3 disposition consists of the geographic cation of insurgent elements and how they are deployed employed or located additionally disposition includes the recent current and projected movements or locations of these elements z training camps z base camp z logistic camps external and internal z headquarters external and internal z safe houses z front organizations z areas of control strength d4 strength conventionally is described in terms of personnel weapons and equipment in insurgency operations strength as factor is augmented with attack teams political cadre or cells and most importantly popular suppo rt popular support can range from sympathiz ers to assistance in conducting operations storag or moving logistics or just withholding in formation tactics and operations d5 tactics and operations include strategy methods of procedure and doctrine each re fers to the insurgents accepted principles of organization and employment of forces tactics also involve political military psychological and economic considerations insurgent tactics and operations vary in sophistication according to the level of training the individual or or ganization has received insurgents carefully plan and train for individual and small group operations typical insurgent tactics and operations include but are not limited to z assassination term generally applied to the killing of prominent persons and symbolic personnel as well as trai tors who defect from the group z arson less dramatic than most tactics arso n has the advantage of low risk to the perpetrator and requires only w level of technical knowledge z bombing the ied is the insurgents or terrorists weapon of choice ieds can be inexpensive to produce and because of the various detonation techniques available may be low risk to the perpetrator ho wever suicidal bombing cannot be over looked as an employment method other ied advantages include their ability to gain publicity as well as the ability to co ntrol casualties through timed detonation and careful placement of the device it is so easily deniable should the action pro duce undesirable results z hostage taking this is an overt seizure of one or more individuals with the intent of gaining publicity or other concessions in return for release of the hostage while dramatic hostage and hostage barricade si tuations are risky for the perpetrator z kidnapping while similar to hostage taking kidnapping has significant differ ences kidnapping is usually covert seizur of one or more specific persons in or der to extract specific demands it is norm ally the most difficult task to execute the perpetrators of the action may or may not be known for long time media at tention is initially intense but decreases over time unless the kidnapping is accom panied by acts of barbarism that extend news coverage because of the time in volved successful kidnapping requires elabora planning and logistics the risk to the perpetrators may be less than in the hostage situation d2 order of battle factors z intimidationblackmail insurgents may attempt to ga in coerced political fiscal or logistic support from local government officials local businessmen or other in fluential community leaders through intimidati on or blackmail this could be in the form of threats on the individuals life ki dnapping of people close to the individual or threats to disrupt or destroy for exampl bombing or arson infrastructure that is important to the individual z seizure seizure usually involves building or object that has value in the eyes of the audience there is some risk to the perpetrator because security forces have time to react and may opt to use force to re solve the incident especially if few or innocent lives are involved z raids or attacks on facilities armed attacks on facilities are usually under taken for one of three purposes gain access to radio or television broadcasts to make statement demonstrate the governments inability to secure critical facilities or national symbols acquire resources for example robbery of bank or armory z sabotage the objective in most sabotage incidents is to demonstrate how vulner able particular society or government is to insurgent actions industrialized areas are more vulnerable to sabotage than ss highly developed societies utilities communications and transportation system s are so interdependent that serious disruption of any one affects all of them and gains immediate public attention sabotage of industrial or commercial fac ilities is one means of identifying the tar get while making statement of future intent military facilities and installations information systems and information infr astructures may become targets of insur gent sabotage z hoaxes any insurgent group that has established credibility can employ hoax with considerable success threat against persons life causes that person and those associated with that individual to devote time and effort s to security meas ures bomb threat can close commercial building empty theater or delay an aircraft flight at cost to the insurgen t false alarms dull the analytical and op erational efficiency of key security personnel thus degrading readiness z use of technology technology has important implications for the insurgent threat infrastructure technologies provide attractive targets for insurgents who can apply range of rudimentary and advanced attack techniques to disrupt or dermine confidence in range of systems key elements of the national infrastruc turetransportation teleco mmunications energy banking public health and wa ter supplyare becoming increasingly pendent on computerized systems and linkages z use of chemical biological radiological or nuclear weapons some insur gent groups may possess chemical and biological weapons and there is potential for use of both chemical and biological we apons in the future these types of weap ons relatively cheap and easy to make may be used in place of conventional explo sives in many situations the potential for mass destruction and the deepseated fear most people have for chemical and bi ological weapons could be attractive to group wishing to make the world take noti ce although an explosive nuclear device is acknowledged to be beyond the financial and technical reach of most insurgent groups chemical or biological weapon or even radiological dispersion device us ing nuclear contaminants is not the tec hnology is simple and the payoff is poten tially higher than conventional or nuclear explosives z psychological operations since insurgents want to win over the support of the populationor at least separate the suppo rt of the population from the hn gov ernment they will engage in many different types of psyop with this intent they d3 fmi 30722 can accomplish this through many different means for example insurgents may stage and publicize real or fake atrociti which they will blame on the hn gov ernment or us forces they will also be qu ick to take advantage of any inadvertent mistakes that the local national govern ment forces or us forces may make when dealing with the local population training d6 the type and depth of individual and grou p training that insurgents receive is tied to their tactics and operations higher education so plays role in insurgent training insur gent training may include but is not limited to z indoctrination and strategy political ideological or religious z operations z tactics z weapons individual and crew served including such specialties as demolition weapons and assassinations z communications z logistics z transportation covert movement z isr z psyop z media manipulation logistics d7 the effectiveness of insurgent operations depends heavily on logistics this dependency fluctuates horizontally and vertically between the various groups and levels of operation the intensity of logistic activity is based on operations critical components of logistics in clude but are not limited to z financing z food z water z weapons and ammunition z bombmaking components z psyop materials paper ink printing press z medical z transportation onhand and required combat effectiveness d8 combat effectiveness for insurgent forces is not measured the same way as combat ef fectiveness for conventional force s combat effectiveness factor s for insurgent forces include but are not limited to z outside support financial physical moral z intimidation z fear z political change z motivation z popular support d4 order of battle factors electronic technical data d9 in counterinsurgency operations the lack of an obvious formal insurgent organiza tional structure or architecture impedes develo pment of an extensive threat electronic order of battle database and an electronic technica l database the insurgent has communications equipment available ranging from the most modern to the most primitive insurgent forces can use high frequency hf shortwave and ham radio sets cellular phones the internet the mail and couriers citizen bandset is also used while not playing significant histori cal role the insurgents potential use of radar cannot be ruled out personalities d10 personality is critical factor when conducting counterinsurgency operations atten tion must be focused on individuals and leader s insurgent organizational diagrams can be built through multidimensional link analysis determining relationships between critical personalities and then their group associations this applies to virtually any threat repre sented in counterinsurgency operations once re lationships and the level of contact or knowl edge the personalities have are known many of their activities can be determined personal ity files include but are not limited to z leaders political ideological religious military z staff members z organizations spokesperson z family members immediate and extended z previous experience and skill training in professional disciplines trades and spe cialties z media manipulation personnel an d psyop campaign personnel z trainers z code names and nicknames d11 leaders on the ground must understand the political and physical strengths and weaknesses of the insurgent leadership and ho w best to exploit those weaknesses consid erations include z who are the leaders is there single dominant charismatic leader z is the leadership highly dedicated to an ideology z are the leaders committed to specific organizational and operational pattern z are there differences of opinion among aders as to purpose and methods will schism or other event occur as result z what is the relationship between the adership and the operational and support elements are decisions made centralized or decentralized z what is the decision making process of the insurgent leadership are decisions made centralized or decentralized culture d12 culture is the ideology of

purpose i1 the purpose of this appendix is to provid some planning considerations for conducting detainee operations and to provide information to assist the capturing unit in the field proc essing of detainees general i2 while local government officials will deta in certain individuals because of suspected criminal activity or for security purposes ther will be times when us forces will capture and detain individuals who may pose threat to us personnel and interests the act of cap turing detainee is only the first step in lengthy and highly sensitive process i3 detainee is term used to refer to any person captured or otherwise detained by an armed force jp 102 ar 1908 fm 31940 and international law including the law of war and the geneva conventions address polic procedures and responsibilities for the administration treatment protection security and transfer of custody of detainees these publications provide other planning factors an d the regulatory and legal requirements cerning detainees i4 detaining personnel carries with it the re sponsibility to guard protect and account for them all persons captured detained interned or otherwise held in us armed forces custody are given humane care and treatment from the moment they fall into the hands of us forces until final release or repatriation the inhumane treatment of detainees is prohibited and is not justified by the stress of combat or by d eep provocation inhumane treatment is serious and punishable violation under the uniform code of military justice and international law i5 the two geneva conventions most likely to be employed in detainee operations are the geneva convention relative to the treatmen t of prisoner of war 12 august 1949 gpw and geneva convention relative to the protecti on of civilian person in time of war 12 au gust 1949 gc most detainees will usually be ci vilians and very few will qualify as epw planning for detainee operations i6 detainee operations are resource intens ive and highly sensitive holding detainees longer than few hours requires detailed planni ng to address the extensive requirements of the geneva conventions for proper administration treatment protection security and transfer of custody of detainees if commanders anticipate holding detainees at the division level or lower as opposed to expeditiously ev acuating them to detention facility they should

escape easie r or compromise us security interests confiscate these items prepare receipt when taking property from detainee ensure that both the detainee and the receiving soldier sign the receipt such as da form 4137 consider bundling detainees property or pl acing it in bags to keep each detainees property intact and separate maintain strict chain of custody for all items taken from the

legal considerations in counterinsurgency general j1 leaders should remember counterinsurgency operations must conform to the law and the application of the law varies depending on the overall counterinsurgency mission lead ers maintain constant awareness of their ability to lawfully use certain tactics weapons or procedures and understand that there are variou s agreement or treaty obligations that have counterinsurgency operational implications judge advocates assist leaders in tackling the complexities of the law and in integrating lega l considerations into the overall pattern of counterinsurgency operations legal basis j2 leaders should know and understand the gal basis of their operations by doing so leaders promote the legitimacy of their operatio ns and are able to better plan their missions structure public statements and conform their co nduct to policy further since the very goal of counterinsurgency operations is to help ma intain law and order those conducting counter insurgency operations must know and respect the legal parameters within which they oper ate those who conduct counterinsurgency oper ations while intentionally or negligently breaking the law defeat their own purpose and lose the confidence and respect of the com munity in which they operate j3 the legal basis of counterinsurgency oper ations derives from many international us and localhn legal sources these sources may be security council resolutions regional and international agreements and decisions regulations and orders from us multina tional or localhn authorities while legal so urces differ depending on the specific mission counterinsurgency in an international or inte rnal armed conflict and military role in mind lead or in support counterinsurgency mission statements drafted with these sources in mind demonstrate and encourage adherence to law and order law of war principles j4 all counterinsurgency operations comply with law of war principles to the extent prac ticable and feasible some of the basic law of war principles to which counterinsurgency op erations must conform include the following provide humane treatment j5 regardless of the legal status of those pe rsons captured detained or otherwise held in custody by us soldiers they receive humane treatment until properly released they are provided with the minimum protections delineated in the geneva conventions j1 fmi 30722 avoid causing unnecessary suffering j6 weapons munitions and techniques ca lculated to cause unnecessary pain and suffer ing are forbidden toleration of violations of law of war and human rights j7 orders to commit law of war and human righ ts violations are illegal soldiers must dis obey them and report all known or suspected law of war and human rights violations those who violate law of war and human rights w ill be held responsible for their actions status of forces j8 the nature of the conflict internal or in ternational armed conflict stability operations support operations peace operations dictate th legal status of forces when us forces duct counterinsurgency operations in another nation without that nations prior consent the us law applies however if us forces conduc t counterinsurgency operations in another na tions territory with that nations prior consent or invitation in the absence of some type of grant of immunity soldiers must comply with th at nations law as result leaders conduct ing counterinsurgency operations in this envi ronment should understand in detail the extent and effect of any relevant hn criminal civil and administrative jurisdiction status of forces agreement or similar understanding betw een the united states and the hn may re solve many of these matters and prevent them from adversely affecting counterinsurgency operations claims j9 injuries death and property damage ar an unavoidable reality of military operations the leaders ability to promptly and thorough ly redress meritorious claims against the united states will pay considerable dividends in maintaining communitys confidence and respect several statutes and agreements termine whether and how claims against the united states may be adjudicated in some situations claims against the united states may not be adjudicated but payments in sympathy or in recognition of loss solatia may be made multinational partners may be able to ad judicate claims that us law does not recog nize in all circumstances leaders planning co unterinsurgency operations should consider that the prompt and effective handling of result ant claims fosters good will and positive civil military relations fiscal law j10 us legal principles on the proper expendit ure of public funds apply to us forces even when they are part of multinational force or supporting multinational operations fiscal law affects training humanitarian and civic assi stance construction medical care transpor tation maintenance the logistics civilian augmentation program and other activities re quests for support may come from the hn us agencies multinational partners local civil ians international military headquarters high er headquarters and other sources leaders in counterinsurgency operations must be prepar ed to find the correct funding authority and appropriation for the mission and specified tasks to be performed articulate the rationale for proposed expenditures and seek approval from higher headquarters when necessary contracting and acquisition j11 leaders may have to acquire goods and rvices and carry out construction projects while conducting counterinsurgency operations the significant legal issues involved in bat tlefield acquisition contingency contracting or acquisition and crossservicing agreements present challenges that demand creative analysis lawfully conducted confiscation seizure j2 legal considerations in counterinsurgency and requisition of property and use of the local populace as source of services may be valu able means to support the needs implicit in counterinsurgency operations however even when lawfully done there are practical consid erations in acquiring supplies and services from the local populace that may negatively ffect counterinsurgency operations the key to successful contracting and acquisition is the pr oper training and appointment of personnel who are authorized to carry out pertinent ac tions and know the legal and practical limita tions on their authority foreign gifts j12 besides the practical and political consid erations involved in receiving and accepting foreign gifts leaders should remember the lega l implications as general rule soldiers are prohibited from soliciting gifts from foreign governments depending on the circumstances soldiers may be prevented from accepting gift s from foreign governments altogether there are several statutory limitations on the type of gift and the gifts value that leaders should consider prior to accepting any foreign gift intelligence law j13 leaders conducting counterinsurgency op erations probably consider their ability to conduct intelligence gathering as critical to th eir success counterinsurgency intelligence col lection information gathering and counterin telligence operations involve substantial tact with sources from nongovernmental organi zations the local populace and multinational partners there are many legal implications in collecting intelligence or gathering informa tion from these sources there are also legal re strictions on intelligence collection against us persons on disseminating intelligence to other agencies and in using special collection tech niques such as electronic surveillance the co mplexities of intelligence law require leaders to obtain legal review of all proposed intelligence activities law and order j14 maintaining law and order throughout the hn is part of the desired end state of coun terinsurgency operations the following contai n essential enforcement and detention opera tions information z policy on treatment of detained persons z ucmj z military tribunalscommissions z meja jurisdiction over contract ors and private security firms z hn authorities article 98 agreements z evidence collection and war crimes war crime disclosures and the handling of evidence j15 in recent years it has beco necessary for soldiers to be aware of the possibility of in cidents that could constitute wa r crimes the development of in ternational judicial agencies to deal with allegations of wa r crimes makes the issue of providing evidence an increasingly difficult and complicated process expert policin g pathological and forensic skills are essen tial in gaining evidence that coul d lead to successful prosecution j16 military police forces are the most appropri ate army agents for dealing with such inci dents that could have important international significance military police resources should be called upon immediately when such incident s or disclosures are discovered where sol dier or civilian working with army forces is suspected of committing war crime and indeed any crime military police carry out the formal investigation where hn national is j3 fmi 30722 pected the procedure to be adopted depends upon the theater involved usually it will be for the local hn civilian police organization to inve stigate albeit with assistance from the mili tary police or multinational police mission thea terspecific procedures should be clearly derstood prior to deployment with advice being sought from army legal services if need be the guidance below provides few basic procedur likely to be common good practice in cir cumstances where involvement by non militarypolice soldiers is necessary guidelines on how to deal with crime scenes j17 in general two kinds of suspected crime scenes occur there are sites where bodies are present and there are sites where destruction of property has occurred certain basic com mon procedures are recommended for both categori of sites more specific actions with re gard to each kind of site can be reco mmended after these have been dealt with aim j18 at whatever kind of site actions are take n for recording or preserving evidence the ul timate goal is to collect evidence admissible in court of law to large extent the basic principle is that whatever actions are taken should be clearly documented the precise duct of the investigative actions should be note d and recorded if the history of the investiga tion is not clear it opens the way for challenging the reliability of evidence j19 in dealing with physical pieces of eviden ce it is imperative to create an evidentiary chain that starts at the site of the investig ation and will ultimately end in court upon pro duction of the evidence the chain consists of clearly documenting the collection handling processing and storage of potential evidence at all stages upon submission of piece of evi dence in court the precise trail of that evidence must be traceable directly back to the site of the investigation any break in that chain may result in that piece of evidence being ruled inadmissible at trial basic procedures j20 the following actions are recommended for the recording and preservation of evidence at all categories of sites z make photographicvideo record of the site z make detailed report of ll observations at the site z make sketches and diagrams if possible z record measurements and distances where appropriate z record the details of any witnesses to the events before they disappear z record details of any surviving victims z record any details or information on th identity of the alleged perpetrators names descriptions and insignia or uniforms worn j21 be prepared to make your own witness statement describing in detail your involve ment be it as witness to an incide nt or upon attending the aftermath j22 the particulars of those persons undertaki ng the above activities should be clearly documented it should be clear who these persons are in what capacity they were acting and where they can be traced j23 it is important to safely preserve all ev idence and material collected until the arrival of an investigative or prosecuting authority this entails keeping the evidence and material in such manner that it cannot be tampered with or contaminated the evidence and material should be essentially kept under seal until it can be handed over to the appropriate investi gative or prosecuting authority j4 legal considerations in counterinsurgency sites involving bodies j24 it is important to estab lish the cause of death and to identify the deceased if possible for the investigation of scene where dead bo dies are present undertake the basic common procedures described in the previous paragraph with this in mind important therefore are matters such as z the number and position of bodies z are the bodies manacled or blindfolded are there bruises or swelling around the wrists or ankles indicating person migh t have been bound prior to their death z are there any indications of battle fo r example are the bodies uniformed are they armed is there battlefield debriss uch as equipment munitions boxes or binocularsin the area near the body are there any blunt objects or tools with blood debris on them z can any injuries be identified was the person shot stabbed strangled or crushed is blunt trauma evident anywhere on the body z the clothing on the bodies often identifi cation can be done on the basis of the clothing civilian casual work business or formal wear necktie dress or scarf present z documentation found on bodies or at the site identification tags z jewelry or other items found on the body or at the site earrings z is any physical evidence present that coul d indicate the cause of death bullet cas ings or weapons z are there any bloodstains or splattering visible on furniturewalls any stains should be protected because they provid information to forensic experts j25 if possible pathologist should conduct postmortem with view to determining the cause of death and the identity of the deceased j26 in some instances the next of kin of pe rsons killed in the conflict may want to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones for burial or cre mation once site has been found it is likely that very little time will be available to record evidence at that site especially where for mal investigation has not yet been sanctioned it may be very difficult to delay handing over the bodies to next of kin as it may not be possi ble to seal off site with view to proper ex amination at later stage it is important that as much information and evidence as possible be collected at such sites fr equently however it will be appropriate for the troops first on the scene to set up cordon so that potential evidence is not interfered with prior to the arri val of the investigative authorities sites involving destruction of property j27 the main object of investigating sites of destruction is to determine the cause of the struction and identify the perpetrators the caus of destruction is often matter of observa tion for example was the cause burning art illery fire or bombing the data the observa tion is based on must be thoroughly document ed along with any additional evidence that may be found that could substantiate the observation screening and interviewing witnesses j28 during the process of identifying and re cording potentially valuable evidence for use later in criminal prosecution twophase approach can be adopted z undertake wide screening of potential wi tnesses initially the purpose of this is to identify persons who can give direct fi rsthand evidence with regard to events that may fall within the jurisdiction of the tribunal j5 fmi 30722 z investigators should take detailed statemen ts from those witnesses who have been identified during the first phase as being able to give direct and relevant evidence pertaining to events relati ng to the investigations phase i i nitial screening j29 this phase is undertaken at the outset of the investigation it serves to provide the in vestigators with some idea of the amount of in formation potentially available and its quality and consistency it helps the investigators focu s their attention on the events they are inves tigating and identify direct wi tnesses to relevant events ap art from identifying witnesses who can give direct evidence detailed biographical information concerning those being in terviewed with view to tracing persons in the future must be collected during this phase as well it should be borne in mind that it might not always be immediately apparent during this phase whether information being provided will be relevant to investigations of subse quent trial proceedings good biographical info rmation will therefore facilitate the locating of persons who are immediately identified as eyewitnesses as well as those who are only identified as relevant wi tnesses at later stage biographical information j30 obtain as much biographical information as possible from the witness this includes the following z comprehensive personal details z full details of relatives z full details regarding where the person lived during the conflict z full details of where the witness intends to go in the future z any other contact details such as phone numbers or email addresses identifying witnesses j31 during this first phase it is worth the ffort to establish whether the individual to be interviewed is able to relate events that fall within his or her own direct knowledge or is simply relaying events that he or she has been told about by others hearsay j32 it should be borne in mind that person s being interviewed are likely to be traumatized by recent events that they have personally experienced but which may not necessarily be relevant to investigations in the desire to speak out about what has been experienced or vent outrage and frustrations in terviewees are prone to rely heavily on information obtained second or thirdhand such information is ge nerally not reliable with view to ultimate prosecution of criminal cases before court such people may still be of use however as they may be able to provide the details of previo usly unknown persons who are able to provide direct evidence the time spent on clearly est ablishing whether person is indeed direct witness to relevant events or potentially relevant events is therefore an investment in the future of the investigation and may ultimately save considerable time and resources at later stage phase ii t aking statements j33 once potential witness who possesses direct informatio n has been identified com prehensive statement should be obtained from that person the statement should include the following information in as much detail as possible z full particulars of the incident or event in terms of what the witness saw felt heard or experienced z full particulars of the time and place of the event j6 legal considerations in counterinsurgency z particulars of the weather and lighting co nditions and distances or measurements if relevant diagrams or drawings by witnesses may prove useful z details of other witnesses z details with view to identification of alleged perpetrators name uniform unit and description z details about which witness is likely to be questioned in court such as whether he or she had been drinking alcohol prior to the incident or whether he or she has any loyalties to or grudges against any of those about whom he or she is giving evidence formats for statements j34 the format of the statement depends to large extent on the evidentiary requirements of the tribunal ultimately responsible for trying any cases emerging from any investigation where the tribunal has not been determined the format is at the discretion of the head of the investigation j35 whichever situation pertains careful consid eration should be given as to whether it is necessary to require witnesses to sign or attest their statements while the immediate ad vantage is the perception that the witness person ally agrees with what is contained in the statement there is also disadvantage the pr oblem is that should the witness make later statements that appear to contradict or conflic t with that earlier statement this could com promise his or her credibility an alternative pproach would be to not require the witness to sign the statement but simply to rely on the investigators notes of the interview the draw back with such procedure is that it is less likely to be admissible as evidence of the wit nesss version of events if he or she dies or cannot be located continuity of evidence j36 one of the primary roles of overt surveilla nce is to provide detailed information in the form of sightings for local police and other agen cies to use in their attempts to cause attri tion to the insurgent organizations this inform ation could potentially be used as evidence in court of law to secure convictions soldiers on surveillance duty must therefore be evi denceaware to ensure that opportunities from which convictions could arise are not missed because of errors in evidence continuity or in formation handling by the observation post op team types of evidence j37 information gathered by ops can be recorded in variety of formats such as z written z photographic z video written evidence j38 there is number of types of written evid ence that could be produced by an op the main ones being z log sheet z patrol notebook photographic evidence j39 it is important that the film number and frames used be correlated with the sightings entered in the log if it is believed photographic evidence has been captured of an event or in j7 fmi 30722 cident the film should be left complete inside the camera body and the whole package han dled as evidence video evidence j40 video evidence can be extremely useful pr ovided that the tape has been correctly ac counted for there are number of considerat ions that should be taken into account j41 the datetime group display on the camera must be correc tly set and visible on any tape recording the time on the video monitor is the time to be used on all log entries the vcr tape position counter should be zeroed at th is time and also used as reference in the log these procedures ensure th at any video evidence is coordinated with written evidence j42 for full continuity of evidence any sequence of video footage s hould be supported by complete coverage of that day up to and incl uding the event this is possible to achieve us ing 24hour time lapse vcrs so that complete 24hour period is recorded onto one tape this then provides continuity ops should ensu re the vcr is switched to 3hour mode to im prove the quality of the recording when recording an event of inter est j43 these continuity tapes should be continuo usly recording while the op is operational they should be changed over at midnight gged and stored the formation headquarters directs the time period of storage and method of handling j44 if an op captures some vital evidence on f ilm or video then it must deal with it in the correct manner in order for it to have any value in court of law this involves the use of an evidencehandling kit and procedures evidence handling kit j45 suggested evidence handling kit to be kept in ops is z da form 4002 evidence property tag z sturdy opaque bag or envelope z selfadhesive labels z cellophane tape handling procedu re j46 record all markings on the filmtape whether operational serial numbers or the manu facturers these should be written on the da fo rm 4002 place the tape or film into bag or envelope and seal all edges with tape tape the da form 4002 onto the evidence package and only sign the statement section on the form when the evidence is handed
