division updated september 19 2002 abstract current estimates of the number of us commercial ﬁshermen are suspect yet accurate numbers are important for forecasting and planning for the impact of proposed legislation and programs such as disaster relief and capacity reduction under the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act accurate ﬁgures can help congress predict budget implications and allocate limited budget resources for these programs part of the problem lies with how commercial ﬁsherman is deﬁned and how employment data are collected and resolution may hinge on
