which promulgated regulations implementing the act4 the nepa regulations emphasize communicating with the public reducing dela ys of federal projects nd making better decisions5 agencies are to integrate nepa reviews with other agency planning and review processes6 and coordinate with other federal agencies and with similar state processes when appropriate7 each agency is expected to elaborate on how to comply with nepa in the context of its own duties agencies generally issue regulations specifying their nepa review process8 when more than one federal agen cy is involved in an action the regulations provide for the re sponsibilities of lead agency9 and cooperating agencies10 nepa establishes goals for agency actions it sets as nationa l environmental policy that the federal government use all practicab means to improve and coordinate federal actions to assure safe h ealthful productive and aesthe tically and culturally pleasing surroundings and to attain the widest rang of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation risk to health or safety or other undesi rable and unintended consequences11 in addition to this policy nepa requires certain practices including using systematic interdisciplinary approach using natural and social sciences and environmental design in pl anning and decisionmaking12 the most significant of these practices are the requirements in section 102 2 which states that for proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment the agency must prepare detailed environmenta l review discussing i the environmental impact of the proposed action ii any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented iii

decisions already made13 nepa documents an environmental review under nepa can take one of three forms categorical exclusion ce an environmental assessment ea or an environmental impact statement eis for each of these the ceq regulations require consideration of the possible environmental effects of an agency action th extent of that analysis depends on the circumstances and the likely degree of environmental impacts ces are at one end of the spectrum ces are used for categories of actions that have been determined not to have significant effect on the human environment individually or cumulatively and therefore do not require further analysis14 typically ces are used for minor actions that an agency does re peatedly and knows will have or only minor environmental effects agencies publish lists of activities that are ces when project arises that falls into category on the list ce may be invoked15 however if an extraordinary circumstance such as wetlands or threatened or endangered species is present ce may not be used16 even though ce represents determination that an environmental review is not necessary the determination still must be documented and cannot be made after project has begun17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20621crs4 18 40 cfr 15089a1 an ea that results in fonsi is referred to as an eafonsi 19 40 cfr 15089b 20 40 cfr 15014 and parts 1502 and 1503 21 mt

alternatives required by section 1022e and list of the agencies and persons consulted19 at the other end of the spectrum are full reviews for major federal actions that may significantly affect the environment eiss20 these documents are the most complex and have drawn the most scrutiny the t horoughness with which an agency must study environmental effects and consider alterna tives is greatest if an eis is required21 an eis must discuss an adequate range of proposed alternatives and the direct indirect and cumulative effects or impacts of each the required documents can be voluminous and may take years to produce under nepa di fferent versions of eiss are produced deis draft eis which is circulated for commen t feis final eis seis supplemental eis and dseis draft supplemental eis also circulated for comment22 even though both eiss and eas require re views of environmental impacts there is difference between these documents an ea re view is intended to be briefer its purpose is to find whether there are significant environmental impacts if there are significant impacts an eis is developed to analyze those impacts in detail both documents must review not only the impacts of the planned pr oject but the impacts of the alternatives however there is distinction between the review within an ea and that of an eis the regulations require an ea to include brief discussions on th impacts of the alternatives in contrast an eiss alternatives analysis is referred to as the heart of the environmental impact statement23 the document must devote substantial treatment to each alternative24 successful eis will clearly illustrate how the agency made its decision to choose that alternative nepa does not require the agency to choose the most environmentallyprefe rable alternative ces by their nature are extremely brief agencies have been encouraged to create more ces25 because ces are perceived to be less of burden on agency resources

federal agency review but does not specify public involvement in the reviews however the nepa regulations discuss and require public participation the public participation aspects of the nepa process are regarded by many as valuable aspect of the law agencies must provide public notice of neparelated hear ings public meetings and the availability of environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who may be interested or affected27 public input is encouraged early in th process ceq recommends that scoping process be conducted for eiss and that public comment be included in the scoping process28 the ceq regulations specify levels of notice to the public depending on whether an action is of national or local interest and state that in all cases the agency must mail notice to those who requested it regarding particular action29 also draft eiss must be made available for public comment30 those comments must be responded to by the lead agency in the final version of the document31 court challenges to eiss must wait until there is final agency action eiss ar final only upon the issuance of the record of decision rod public hearings are appropriate for any ty pe of environmental document when there is substantial controve rsy regarding project or substan tial interest in having hearing32 public involvement in the preparati on of an ea or in making categorical

ceq regulations for these documents do not requi re drafts to be issued to the public nepa litigation because nepa does not provide righ t of action suit is brought under the administrative procedure act 5 usc 706 et seq like other apa cases the court reviews the administrative record to see if the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously nepa litigation is complicated and just bout every word in major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment has been disputed scrutinized and defined by th courts some issues have been resolved for example there is consensus that courts review of nepa document is to ensure that the agency took hard look at the envi ronmental impacts of an action34 also the courts agree that nepa does not mandate par ticular results but simply prescribes the necessary process35 thus nepa merely prohibits uninf ormed rather than unwise agency action36 most court cases relate to when an eis needs to be prepared and to the adequacy of eis coverage37 for eas the contention generally is whethe r that document demonstrates that eis is required sometimes this can take the form of claim that the agency had decided that an eis was not required before preparing the ea which is against the express purpose of the document the courts review eas to determine whether the agency considered the alternatives and the impacts from those alternatives ces are different they are intended to allo w agencies to find that project has significant effects on the environment wit hout conducting review but the agency must still assemble record to support its decisi on disputes regarding ces center on whether the category was proper in the first place or whether the designation of ce for particular project was appr opriate one factor in dete rmining whether ce was appropriate is whether the action nor mally requires an ea or an eis38
