weight in such areas as federal and state legi slation rules issued by financial regulators and private financial contracts for example credit rating agency particularly one with nrsro status is exempted from certain federal securities regulations one such exemption concerns regulation fd8 which prohibits issuers from making selective disclosure of material information in order to attempt to make certain that the public has information needed to make investment decisions this prohibition does not apply to an entity whose primary business is the issuance of credit ratings provided the information is di sclosed solely for the purpose of developing credit rating and the entitys ratings are publicly available9 another exemption concerns sec rule 43610 which was issued pursuant to sec tion 11 of the securities act of 193311 the statute provides for civil liabilities for those attesting to the information contained in registration statement rule 436 provide s that rating assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organization is not to be considered part of the registration statement thus arguably shielding an nrsro from liability under section 11 of the securities act
