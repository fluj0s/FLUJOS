security administration ssa to conduct demonstration projects to test changes to the agencys social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi programs the demonstration authority granted by congress allows the ssa on its own to tempor arily waive program rules including rules regarding program eligibility and benefit administration in order to test the impact these changes would have on the return to work rate of program beneficiaries and the size of the ssdi and ssi benefit rolls the most recent authorization for the ssa to conduct demonstration projects expired in 2005 at that time the ssa was in the process of pl anning and administering seven disability demonstration projects these projects cover variety of disability program populations including persons with mental illnesses persons with hivaids the homeless and teenagers making the transition into the adult labor force these demonstration projects test variety of program rule changes including providing immediate medicare benefits disability navigator services and graduated offset of benefits fo r ssdi recipients who earn above the substantial gainful activity sga level in 2004 the government accountability office gao criticized the ssa for its administration of its disability demonstration projects the gao found that the ssa did not use the authority granted it by congress to test wide enough variety of program options and did not have in place system to identify program changes and policy options that should be tested in demonstrations in addition the gao criticized the ssa for the methodological limitations of some of its demonstration projects and found that the results of these projects were not properly shared within the agency with congress or with the public because of this the gao concluded that ssa demonstration projects had little impact on the overall policy debate or on the ways that congress and the agency could work to improve the historically low return to work rate of ssdi and ssi beneficiaries and reduce the rolls of these large disability benefit programs this report builds on the work of the gao and presents summary of the existing seven disability demonstration projects currently being administered and planned by the ssa the objective of this information is to aid congress in its ongoing discussions of the future of the ssa disability benefit programs and the decision to temporarily or permanently extend the demonstration authority of the agency this report will be updated to reflect any relevant legislative activity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33585g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152

authority granted to the ssa by the house bill would expire with final report to congress on january 1 1983 the senate version of hr 3236 similarly directed the ssa to conduct ssdi demonstrations that would test various program alternatives in addition the senate version granted the ssa the authority to waive ssdi program rules and conduct demonstrations provided that these demonstrations were of sufficient size and scope to produce generalizable conclusions as in the house bill the senate bill required the ssa to notify congress 90 days before beginning any ssdi demonstration the senate bill differed from the house version in three areas first the ssdi demonstration authority in the senate bill would extend for five years after passage rather than three with only an interim report due on january 1 1983 second the senate bill allowed the ssa to waive some provisions of the existing human subjects protection rules found in title ii of the national biomedical research fellowship trainineeship nd training act pl 93348 and this provision was not included in the house version third the senate bill granted the ssa permanent authority to conduct ssi demonstration projects and pay for them out of the agencys annual ssi appropriation measure not found in the house version the final version of the bill included all of the senate provisions with the exception of the provisions related to the protection of human subjects to replace these the conference committee used language from another house bill the supplemental security income disability amendments of 1979 hr 3464 that required that ssi demonstrations be conducted on voluntary test subjects and that demonstration project participant lose benefits because of their involvement in project 11 the final bill then gave

permanent authority to conduct ssi demonstration in the 1980 amendments the authority given the agency to conduct ssdi demonstrations was temporary and expired in 1985 since 1985 congress has passed five temporary extensions of the agencys ssdi demonstration authority the most recent of which expired in 2005 leaving the ssa without the authority to begin any new ssdi demonstration projects congress first extended the agencys ssdi demonstration authority in 1986 with the passage of the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 pl 99272 section 2101 of this act extended the

tested the full range of return to work strategies and alternatives mandated by statute one area that the ssa did not properly test with demonstration was the use of the private sector to provide rehabilitation services to ssdi and ssi recipients this private sector model became the basis for the ticket to work program without having been tested by the agency despite having first been suggested to the ssa in 1989 the gao also found that the ssa did not follow the directives of the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 which required the agency to test the advantages and disadvantages of allowing disability benefit recipients to choose from both public and private sector vocational rehabilitation providers the gao did indicate that greater variety of poli cy options and alternativ was scheduled to be tested by the ssas planned disability demonstr ation projects however the gao also found that the ssa had clear research agenda and thus way of ensuring that the agency would continue to focus on wide variety of policy options in its demonstrations the gao was not alone in this finding as the social security advisory board and national academy of social insurance both found that the ssa lacked clear research agenda that would guide future demonstration projects 13

the gao found that the four demonstration projects completed by the ssa had little impact on the types of policy changes to the ssdi program considered by congress and the agency congress and the ssa did not rely on the results of the demonstration projects to guide them in their decisions on what changes should be made to the ssdi program the gao blamed much of this lack of impact on the limitations in research design implementation and evaluation of the ssas demonstration projects the gao found significant research design and methodological flaws with each of the ssas completed demonstration projects in one project the gao found that the sample size used was too small to produce any generalizable conclusions about the policy alternatives tested this same project was also plagued by lack of any evaluatio n plan in two other projects multiple versions of the same policy interventions were tested without properly taking into account the differences across sites in one of these projects the reliance on states to collect data was seen as problematic agency officials told the gao that these methodological limitations in their past demonstrations resulted in these projects not yielding useful information for the agency or the policy community but emphasized new commitment from the ssa to improve the design and evaluation of future demonstration projects

results and conclusions not considered by the agency the gao also found that the ssa lacked any sort of formal record of evaluations that have been planned implemente d and concluded and found that in some cases documents relating to project design and implementation were lost and information on some past demonstrations was available only by personally talking to employees who worked on the projects the gao also found that the ssa did not fulfill its statutory responsibility to inform congress of the status and results of its demonstration projects despite statutory requirements that the agency submit to congress reports on demonstration activities at the end of the authority periods in 1985 1990 1993 and 1996 the gao found that the ssa on ly submitted the 1996 report in addition the

historically not made available to the public or congress information about the results of completed projects in addition discussions of planned ongoing or completed demonstration projects are rarely

the purpose of the accelerated benefits demonstration project is to test the impact of providing immediate medical coverage on new ssdi beneficiaries under current program rules these new beneficiaries are not eligible for medicare coverage for period of 24 months after receiving benefits evidence shows that the lack of access to medical coverage during the 24month medicare waiting period has negative impact on the health disability status and employment of ssdi beneficiaries published data on the experiences of new ssdi beneficiaries found that during the 24month medicare waiting period only 21 experienced medical improvements sufficient to remove them from the disability rolls in addition 118 of these beneficiaries died during the waiting period and at the end of the first 24 months of receiving ssdi benefits 861 of new beneficiaries were still on the program rolls 16 survey data of new ssdi beneficiaries supports similar conclusions and found that during the 24month waiting period new ssdi recipients were likely to go without necessary medical care see their medical conditions deteriorate and find themselves medically unable to work17 this demonstration project will target those new ssdi beneficiaries deemed most likely to improve medically in the hope that by providing them with immediate access to medical coverage the agency can increase their

their benefits reduced at rate of 1 for every 2 in earnings above the sga level this type of graduated benefit offset is already used in the ssi program in addition to the graduated benefit offset demonstration participants will be provided with packages of additional employment supports such as benefits counseling and the national demonstration will involve some form of early intervention to provide some benefits to ssdi applicants emed likely to enter the disability rolls congress mandated that the ssa test graduated benefit offset system for ssdi recipients in both the social security disability amendments of 1980 and the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 in the ticket to work act congress added the requirement that benefit offset demonstration also test if the graduated reduction of benefits after work above the sga level resulted in an induced entry to or reduced exit from the ssdi program rolls the current ssdi and ssi programs differ in their treatment of the work activity and earnings of beneficiaries under ssi program rules one half of all earned income in month is counted by the ssa and used to reduce beneficiarys monthly benefit payment effectively allowing an ssi beneficiary to earn over twice as much as the maximum benefit rate and still collect some cash benefits19 under ssdi program rules any earnings ab ove the sga level in given month after the completion of the trial work period result in loss of all cash benefits situation that is commonly referred to as the cash cliff20 this cash cliff is considered significant barrier to the return to work efforts of many ssdi beneficiaries as it provides financial disincentive to earning above the sga level21 it is hoped that removing this cliff through graduated benefit offset and providing package of additional employment supports will encourage demonstration project participants to attempt to return to the workforce with the ultimate goal of full time work and independence from the disability rolls g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561g6g142g156g146g144g151g561 the benefit offset demonstrations will test the impact of the graduated benefit offset and other

reduced exit from the ssdi benefit rolls resulting from the implementation of graduated benefit offset researchers have predicted that the increased benefit generosity of the graduated benefit offset would entice some people to apply for ssdi benefits while discouraging others from leaving the program in addition because under the graduated benefit offset system beneficiary can work above sga and retain benefits some persons that would otherwise lose benefits because of earnings may be retained in the program however one recent study predicts that the implementation of national 1 for 2 benefit offset for ssdi would have only minimal induced entry or reduced exit effects with new applications to the program increasing by 22 and the mean length of time in the program increasing from 127 years to 130 years 23 the evaluation of the national benefit offset 22 the ssa initially planned to test an early intervention pilot program in new mexico vermont and wisconsin that would have given cash benefits to ssdi applicants who were determined to likely meet the statutory definition of disability the ssa cancelled this pilot before enrollment and now plans to use similar model of interventions

applicant assistance services to homeless persons on the quality of their applications for disability benefits it is hoped that these services will result in higher quality applications for ssdi and ssi benefits that will allow more of these people to get the benefits they are entitled to while saving the agency administrative costs this demonstration is unique in that the ssa is providing services through local agencies and organizations to people before they even apply for benefits research has shown that the application process for the ssdi and ssi programs can be challenging especially for homeless persons applicants are required to understand program rules and provide the agency with detailed information about their employment and medical histories in addition applicants can increase the speed with which their applications are processed and possibly improve the likelihood of their applications being accepted by providing additional information such as detailed medical records or by working with an attorney or other representative who is familiar with the process and what the agency is specifically looking for for persons who are homeless or who are transitioning out of an institution successfully navigating this process can be difficult as they may not have access to financial or medical records may not have primary care medical provider and may not be aware of their options to get assistance with their applications in addition without access to computer or even phone

application system or even schedule an appointment to meet with an ss employee at field office an earlier ssi demonstration project conducted by the ssa found that homeless persons had difficulty applying for benefits on their own and often required the assistance of caseworker or counselor and that providing such services to homeless persons with mental illnesses resulted in greater access to disability benefits27 these difficulties then result in an increase in the agencys administrative costs as the ssa is required to follow up on incomplete applications or schedule people for additional medical examinations as part of this demonstration local agencies and organization selected by the ssa will assist homeless persons with understanding and completing their disability applications the hope demonstration is part of president george w bushs initiative to end chronic homelessness within 10 years funding for this demonstration comes from 8 million annual earmarked appropriation for

determine the impact of providing package of health insurance and employment supports to ssdi recipients diag nosed with hivaids or other auto immune disorders upon the employment of these beneficiarie s in addition the ai demonstration seeks to determine if such support packages can be provided in costeffective manner relative to the potential savings to the disability insurance trust fund that would arise from reducing this populations benefit duration before designing the ai demonstration the ssa held two forums on ways to better provide health and employment supports to ssdi recipients with hivaids or other auto immune disorders these forums held in philadelphia and san fr ancisco were attended by medical professionals advocates and persons with hivaids and other au to

several conclusions about the needs of this population that guided the design of this demonstration31 the ssa determined that individuals with hivaids or other auto immune disorders were more likely to develop additional autoimmune disorders these multiple disorders can result in fatigue and other symptoms that can make keeping regular work schedule difficult ongoing employment supports are often necessary to assist people with multiple immune disorders to return to work the ssa also found that many general practitioner physicians were unaware of the rapidly changing treatment options available for this population while specialist care can overcome this the research also found that such care is unavailable for many in this population because of lack of awareness of options geographic limitations or lack of adequate health coverage the research also found that many in this population want to return to work however their conditions are such that returning to their previous jobs or similar jobs is impossible due to their inability to handle the physical demands of these occupations as result retraining is often needed to prepare these people for new opportunities in the workforce however even when rehabilitation and retraining is available many in this population may not access these services because their long absences from the labor force have left them confused about how to return to work or find the help they need the goal of the ai demonstration is to determ ine if providing medical insurance and employment supports can overcome some of these obstacles to employment and result in greater likelihood that ssdi recipients with hivaids or other auto immune disorders will return to work and leave the benefit rolls because of employment

transition demonstration ytd is to determine if waiving ssi income and asset rules and providing coordinated employment support services to younger ssi and ssdi beneficiaries will ease the transition of these beneficiaries into adulthood and result in an increased likelihood that they will leave the benefit rolls because of work the ytd demonstration is being conducted at seven sites in six states and will provide services to disability beneficiaries between the ages of 14 and 25 at the end of 2004 there were 1262373 ssi beneficiaries under the age of 21 included in this group were 269246 beneficiaries aged 1821 33 in addition at the end of 2004 there were 128925 disabled beneficiaries in the insured programs under the age of 25 including 56628 disabled workers in the ssdi program and 72297 disabled adults with disabilities that began when they were children 34 as these beneficiaries prepare to enter adulthood they are faced with additional challenges including the possible loss of benefits the loss of schoolbased supports and the prospect of entering independent living as adults without any savings or accumulated assets to fall back on the ytd demonstration builds upon an earlier ssi demonstration project the youth continuing disability review project that focused on ssi beneficiaries aged 15 and 16 in florida and maryland35 the evaluation of this demonstration found that many of these teenaged beneficiaries were not prepared to enter adulthood and independent living significant numbers of the beneficiaries tracked in this demonstration had contact with the criminal justice system including 165 of the beneficiaries studied that had at least one previous arrest in addition this demonstration found that often these ssi beneficiaries nearing transitionage were not able to get the coordinated educational benefit counseling and employment supports they needed the results of this demonstration were consistent with other research findings that show children with disabilities have worse posteducation outcomes then their nondisabled peers and that vocational 33 social security administration ssi annual statistical report 2004 washington gpo 2005
