federal personnel issues pay general under the federal pay co mparability act of 1990 fepca federal white collar employ ees paid under the general schedule and re lated salary systems are to receive annual adjustment s based on two separate mechanisms the first is the adjustment to base pay which is based on changes in private sector salaries as reflected in the employment cost inde x eci the rate of pay adjustment is supposed to be the percentage rate of change in that element of the eci minus 5 under that formula for january 2003 the base pay adjustment will be 31 on december 31 2002 the president signed an executive order establishing the salary schedules for federal civilian personnel effective january 200373 the president had determined that the locality comparability payments will be made at the same rate at that effective january 2002 therefore the federal general schedule net increase was 31 payable rate throughout the system under the provisions of section 637 division j pl 1087 the full pay increase for the general schedule is 41 there was stipulation as to how the additional 1 will be apportioned between base pay and localitybased comparability payments on march 21 2003 the presid ent signed executive order 13291 which applies the additional 1 to localitybased comparability payments the payment will be retroactive to january 200374 the presidents budget proposed fede ral civilian pay increase of 26 in january 200375 however the proposal did not indicate how the pay increase would be split between basic pay and localitybased payments for the general schedule

parity with the projected military pay adjustment the housepassed version in cludes the 41 adjustment but stipulates that the adjustment would be absorbed by the agencies the senate committee version would have increased salaries nd expenses accounts in the bill to fund the pay parity provision federal wage system the federal wage system fws is designed to compensate the federal blue collar or skilled labor force at rates prevailing in local wage areas for like occupations if the stat utory system were llowed to be managed as planned the wage rates and the rates of adjustment in the over 130 wage areas would vary according to the labor costs and compensation in the private sector for the last several years congress has limited the rates of adjustment based on the rates of adjustment for the general schedule p l 1087 division j sec 613 part of the rationale for that decision is that in certain high cost areas some fws wages would exceed the salaries paid to general schedule supervisors wages in lower cost areas will be allowed to increase accord ing to the findings of the wage surveys but the high cost area wages will be capped76 pl 107117 extends the monroney amendment outofarea survey application to departme nt of defense personnel members of congr ess j udges and other officials under the ethics reform act of 1989 as amended pay adjustments for federal officials including members of congress and judges are also based on eci calculations but for different 12month period the eci calculations dictate pay adjustment in january 2003 of 33 however the statut limits those adjustments to the rate of adjustment for base pay of the general schedule therefore since the general schedule base pay is being adjusted at the rate of 31 31 is the maximum rate of adjustment in salaries of federal officials for january 2003 since the additional 1 in general schedule pa was apportioned to locality pay only the salary of officials is unaffected and the rate of adjustment for january 2003 remains at 31 unlike that for members of congress and executive branch officials the annual pay increase must be specifically aut horized for judges the authorization for the january 2002 pay increase was in the co mmerce state justice and judiciary appropriation pl 10777 s ection 305 the language permitting the judges to receive the january 2003 increase was reported by the senate committee on appropriations as section 304 of s 2778 however congress adjourned prior to enactment therefore the judges did not receive the 31 adjustment as of january 1 2003 the 108th congress enacted pl 108677 for the purpose of permitting the judges to receive the increase retroactive to the first of the year at time since the authorization was required have the judges received lower

disburses the benefits the costs of ad ministration are cove red by appropriation directly to the labor department the proposed legislation would have charged administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs ie through the budgets of each employing agency the stated intention was to make each agency explicitly bear the full cost of their employees claims thus bolstering their incentive to improve workplace safety based on recent experience the administr ative surcharge would be around 45 of benefit costs for example in fy 2000 this would have represented 92 million in administrative

early 1960s us policy towa rd cuba has consisted largely of efforts to isolate the communist government of fidel castro through comprehensive economic sanctions including near tota l trade embargo and prohibitions on us financial transactions with cuba the bush administration has continued this policy of isolating cuba restri ctions on travel to cuba have been key and often contentious component of the sanctions as have restrictions on agricultural exports to cuba the 106th congress passed the trade sa nctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 pl 106387 title ix which allows for oneyear export licenses for shipping agricultural expor ts to cuba although us private commercial financing is allowed numerous initiatives have been intr oduced to ease us sanctions toward cuba including efforts to ease restricti ons on travel and the prohibition against private commercial financing for agricultura l products in the first session of the 107th congress the house debated two amendments

of the 2002 farm bill hr 2646 on february 13 2002 which included provision section 335 that would have eliminated the prohibition on us private commercial financing for agricultural sales to cuba the house version had such provision and it was not included in the conference report on the bill the issue of whether to ease cuba sanc tions was part of the debate during consideration of the fy2003 treasury depa rtment appropriations measure hr 5120 and s 2740 secretary of state colin powell and secretary of the treasury paul oneill said they would recommend that the president veto legislation that includes loosening of restrictions on trav to cuba or the prohibition on private financing for us agricultural exports to cuba the white house also indicated that president bush would veto the treasury partment appropriations bill if it had such provisions in july 23 2002 floor action on hr 5120 the house approved three cuba sanctions amendments and rejected two the house approved flake amendment hamdt 552 by vote of 262167 that w ould provide that funds could be used to administer or enforce the treasury department regulations with respect to travel to cuba the flake amendment would not prevent the issuance of general or specific licenses for travel to cuba the h ouse also approved second flake amendment hamdt 553 by vote of 251177 that would prohibit funds from being used to enforce any restriction on remittances to nationals of cuba current regulations allow remittances but these are limited to 300 per quarter finally the house approved moran kansas amendment h amdt 554 by voice vote that would provide that funds could be used to implement any sanction on private commercial sales of agricultural commodities or medicines some suggest that the practical effect of this amendment woul d be to prevent the treasury departments office of foreign assets control ofac from ensuring that sales to cuba do not include private financing94 some observers have also ra ised the issue of whether the effect of all three of these amendm ents would be limited since the underlying embargo regulations would remain unchang ed enforcement action against violations of the relevant embargo regulations could potentially take place in future years when the treasury department appropriations measure did not include the funding limitations on enforcing the cuba embargo95 the house
