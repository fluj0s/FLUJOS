application that granted an illinois medical license i already hold missouri license this charge is ridiculous as i answered every question on the application in the way that i felt it was requested i

remained the same since the 1960s despite this fact the dol has taken the position that coverage s hould apply individually to my employees because they are engaged in interstate commerce this surely is not true because my employees do not create goods for interstate commerce rather the few employees that i have help treat my patients in my off ice i ask for your assistance in inquiring about perceived abuse of power by the dol there actions are sought to cause financial ruin i have copied this letter to the national office of the ombudsman because i believe my rights under the small b

wwyprmogovhealingartsasp jcome1jerpj side of form n11mber 5 on feb 1st of 2007 my medical license was expired because of bounced check that i sent you by mistake i corrected the problem immediately and license was renewed on feb 2 2007 by bndd and dea licenses were pulled due to the fact that my medical license had expired i halted the reapplication process for the bndd and dea licenses when it became clear that they were not going to allow renewal without prolonged legal battle that i could not afford at that time due to highly contested divorce that i was going through i have not yet reapplied for bndd and dea licenses in missouri number 6 disaplinary actions have been started by the bndd but were halted when i did not reapply for license in mo disaplinary actions are being considered by the medical board and prolonged legal struggle is being contemplated by both sides it is not clear to what i have done to upset the medical board who seems to want to place upon disaplinary actions because psychologists thought i may have common condition called adhd they also want to punish for possibly having personality disorder according to psychiatrist and psychologist i despute these finding believing instead that some odd actions were the result of acute adjustment reaction to terrible divorce i also dont understand punishing person for having psychological disorder if they in fact do number 9 see above bndd and dea were not renewed in feb 2007 number 10 in the last 12 months i was arrested twice but not convicted of any wrong doing the first time was in july 07

536 north taylor st louis mo 63108 dr kalk called about fax he received stating that we are being charged 15000 show fee from contractor that was supposed to put in some ceiling tiles first i sentover fax last week weekend asking to be installed by this wednesday it wasnt even addressed until debra called asking about the rent on wednesday then someone called yesterday about the tiles being installed and i told them to call about anhour before they are to come this contractor called this morning around 915 am and we agreed on monday morning he never came to the office it was scheduled for monday in the am the rent issue was sent over on fax last week that we refuse to pay 26400 in gas when we keep the thermostat on 67 degrees because of being hot natured i aske d for bill to be faxed that shows our office usage agasbill was sent for the entire building of 50823 we are not paying ½ of the building when we dont u that much heat we did agree to 10000 of the gas and the electric was fine but we never heard from you i ordered on 41207to have check issued in the amount of 39867 25000 rent 10000 gas 4867 electric but i have held that up today til theseareas are resolved additionally we never received an updated invoice showing the 25000 credit for the carpet sorry for the confusion but we will not pay 15000 show fee and ½ of any heat especially when i did not even charge u for the carpet damage by your painters and the two mini blinds that we replaced and the cleanup of this building prior to moving in the office was unfit to move in and then when the computer people came in and looked above the tiles they saw the elect rical areas were just taped all over wing nuts and boxes were installed this is hazard situation that must be addressed i never forced you

until monday but he called the bank and got them to let withdraw what money he needed left only small amount on deposit wanted to send cash by courier so nobody in bank would know there was an investigation going on he knew it took large chunk out of my life savings it was not easy come easy go for since i made it farming sometimes slow process lost about ten years income practically

successful at declaring bankruptcy than he was at convincing calvin to release him the court tossed the case because tiller used himself as attorney which isnt allowed in corporate bankruptcies tiller filed motion demanding refund of his 600 filing fee on the grounds that someone in the courthouse should have told him he couldnt play lawyer bu t as with virtually all of tillers legal pleadings judge dismissed the motion postal inspectors subpoenaed tillers business files but ended up serving search warrant after an employee told them that tiller when served with the subpoena at his pro bation revocation hearing had instructed him to destroy records and send computers to his fathers house besides taking money from clients without providing services tiller had been ordering goods and services with intention of paying according to the federal indictment furthermore when vendors whod been stiffed refused to deal with him again tiller placed additional orders using different names again refusing to pay the grand jury also accused him of selling goods he hadnt paid foras alway s tiller had an explanation in 1993 letter to the media tiller wrote from his prison cell that the feds served the search warrant because he had investigated dirty cops prosecutors judges and bail bondsman turned drug dealer he accused prosecutor s of engaging in homosexual acts with juvenile delinquents and claimed to have photographs the conspiracy against him he insisted rose all the way to the us attorneys office the real reason they wanted the search warrants was to obtain and destro the files on their close friends to prevent from disclosing them to the media and for the crooks they really are he wrote hogwash said assistant us attorney david rosen who challenged tiller to put up or shut up in court brief rosen said he was ready to prosecute any crooked public officials and demanded that tiller immediately identify the police officers and other government officials he was investigatin g as well as the cases in which they were being investigated proof was forthcoming tiller delayed the inevitable as long as possible switching attorneys at least three times on the grounds that his lawyers were ineffective or had conflicts of intere st he said he would plead guilty then balked during the plea hearing prompting the judge to reject his guilty plea and order mental evaluation by that time prosecutors were already convinced they might have an unbalanced man on their hands but judge had rejected their request for psychiatric exam six months earlier the state paroled tiller after 14 months in prison releasing him to the custody of the federal government his parents bailed him out of jail getting the 5000 from credit card cash advance and he was ordered to halfway house in letter to us district court judge carol jackson tillers parents included copy of the ir credit card statement and wrote that the bulk of the 14800 in cash advances on their bill had gone to their most cash advances were used for johns business at least we thought james tiller wrote john always promised he would pay us back when the business got going but this did not happen we

employed skip tracer on behalf of clients who were aware of his legal situation he promised that he wouldnt enter into contracts with vendors after the court approved the request tiller asked the judge to allow him to work for his fathers skip tracing business which was incorporated one week before he filed his motion to work there noting that james tiller had experience in the skip tracing field us magistrate judge catherine perry rejected that idea and removed bail condition requiring tiller to work or seek employment allowingtiller to go back to the s ame kind of business that had led to his indictment would pose danger to the community she ruled tiller finally pleaded guilty to four of the twenty counts in exchange for the other charges being dropped federal investigators who combed through tille rs records had trouble figuring out exactly how much money he had stolen the final tally in pre sentencing report was 115628 from burt who had received modicum of service and 10390 from other victims jackson blamed tillers greed for any unc ertainty serial tiller continued from page 5 published on july 24 2002 mr tiller let say this i think that part of the reason that your recordkeeping may have been so sloppy is that you were just so busy defrauding people that you just got little bit ahead of yourself the judge said before sending him to prison for more than four years i hope that you find another line of work because at some point you know i think you got kind of break today but at some point this is going to catch up with you again roy tompkins it was during his time in leavenworth that john tiller says he realized inmates needed legal help i saw people beaten i sa w people abus ed i saw people set up i saw everything burt sued tiller but dropped the suit on the eve of trial saying he couldnt afford any more legal bills it would cost lot of time and money to pursue the case even pro and what would judgment against that crook be worth burt wrote in letter to us district court judge george f gunn i think the court owes notice of prison release in advance so we may engage in real out ofcourt settlement in which the court or anyone else would not b involved burt never got the chance he died of heart attack the same day he received letter notifying him that tiller had been released according to burts niece and nephew he was 79 thats lie tiller says his eyes narrowed of course the yd say that thats really making mad now the feds dont send letter to people when youre being released only the state does that why dont you check that one fair

claiming that prosecutors had miscalculated his sentence tiller packed file folder with motions but he didnt get far not with record as long as his in court documents r osen the assistant us attorney says tiller had 27 felony convictions i know that was point that i was shocked on how does white collar defendant have so many convictions recalls rosen who defended the government against tillers civil case it was surprise to and thats why i put it into the record after mailing scores of fruitless pleas to the court tiller abruptly dropped the case in december 1996 apologizing to rosen and the judge for wasting their time by then hed found new profession when i was in prison i saw you know i was in the state and federal i saw people beaten i saw people abused i saw people set up i saw everything tiller says and i earned my paralegal certificate while i was in there i did nothin g but study every day it was college being in the federal system tiller doubt noticed that inmates are desperate for legal help perhaps he also noticed that the system usually doesnt listen to them when they complain after he was released in 199 9 tiller set up the civil rights legal defense team thats when he turned to allen harris it was curious choice six years earlier tiller had pegged harris as lousy lawyer when his probation was revoked tiller sought harris dismissal as his coun sel on the grounds that he was involved in criminal activity and had conflicts of interest as with his conspiracy claims tiller didnt include any details harris had also initially represented him in his botched bankruptcy filing and tiller in court documents blames harris for screwing up the case by filing faulty motions he said the differences between him and harris were irreconcilable harris isnt necessarily an awful lawyer last year he won an acquittal for client accused of assaulting guards at the st louis county jail hard luck hard time riverfront times march 28 2001 but harris disciplinary record shows that he was less than top notch in 1994 he was reprimanded by thestate supreme court for not fully informing client of settlement offer in lawsuit and for failing to respond to charges against him which resulted in his temporary disbarment harris got his law license back after he answered the charges explaining that he was suffering from depression and other emotiona l problems that required psychiatric help the supreme court ordered him to submit to monitoring of his practice by the office of the chief disciplinary counsel for two years and to provide the office with evidence that his mental problems had been solved but harris ignored orders from the office of the chief disciplinary counsel to provide proof that he had taken required courses in law practice management nor did he submit quarterly reports from his psychiatrist he finally submitted required records in september 1998 nearly two years late and only after more than year of making excuses the office of the

that he failed to supervise the operation i was in charge of them and i was quite honestly in my own little world at that time he says i was just not doing what i should have bee n doing in keeping good supervision candid perhaps but cold comfort to clients of the civil rights legal defense team those who know him say tiller can be very persuasive he certainly was in the early days of the civil rights legal defense team which couldnt do legal work without lawyers name on the shingle i mean he would call on an almost daily basis harris says i kept saying and finally i said ok lets give it shot that was bad judgment on my part extremely bad judgment i honestly thought he was trying to make change for the better under missouri law lawyers are responsible for their paralegals harris says

could supervise him in what he was doing harris says the idea behind the civil rights legal defense team is actually pretty good idea har ris continues the thing is it just didnt work his tillers idea was basically to have laymen who could do legal work lot cheaper and use the paralegals he happened to be friend of mine basically i was doing favor for friend when i told him ill do what has to be done to get us legal but youve got to promise certain things that didnt happen the way i envisioned them happening what kinds of things did he make tiller promise that hed run this cleanly harris

called tiller almost daily begging him to get the petition to her boyfriend she got nothing but lies excuses and promises ive been fighting with these people for two months to get it to the prison to get signature worthen says they tell theyve mailed it but it got lost in the mail they overnighted it i asked for proof of delivery oh my secretary forgot to mail it theyve just been giving the total runaround they told they sent it out probably six times linda wilson who lives in virginia says she sent the civil rights legal defen team 6000 in the fall of 2000 it took her seven months to raise the money she had never heard the words habeas corpus before speaking with tiller and jesse but they assured her that habeas writ was her sons ticket out of jail at point she says did she or her speak with harris or any other lawyer affiliated with the civil rights legal defense team by the spring of 2001 wilson realized shed been d she complained to the office of the chief disciplinary counsel its

i saw people beaten i sa w people abused i saw people set up i saw everythi ng being confined in the institution which offers nothing but subjugation degradation and humiliation will not solve the problems that confront our society today harris wrote it is the undersigneds firm belief that this will only serve to further the ingrain sic hatred within the heart of the prison inmate for both society and the system which detains him although sincoff and her two friends suspected the petition had been patched together from existing documents they had little choice but to file it by the time the civil rights legal defense team fixed the most serious mistakes parole board deadline had arrived tiller refused to ship the papers unless the friends forked over another 385 that appears to be common practice according t several victims who say they were hit up for more money even though theyd gotten nothing for what theyd already paid among other things tiller demanded 200 for processing fee on the day the petition was due plus 14 per parole board member so the petition could be shipped to them overnight says roger lord one of sincoffs friends of course they were supposed to have done it long time before so there woul dnt be an airborne express lord says and the processing fee was complete bullshit having promised duckett that petition would be filed lord paid till er in cash the

office does not have jurisdiction over fraud can you tell who does downing wrote after all fraud is fraud matter the perpetrator on august 30 of last year downing received another letter from lamarre

week the corrections department upgrades tillers parole status from mini mum supervision to regular supervision so that he will be watched more closely in addition parole officers will investigate tiller to determine whether he should be returned to prison standard procedure whenever parolee moves from minimum to regular s upervision corrections spokesman tim kniest says tiller could remain free because he hasnt been arrested or convicted of new crime but his parole could be revoked if he hasnt been truthful about his employment or where hes living at the most tiller would remain behind

cato she doesnt like going after other attorneys tiller says she has on some issues but theres been several cases where other attorneys have actually bl atantly screwed somebody ive argued with her about it and she would not do something an odd statement given that good portion of the civil rights legal defense teams clients claim they were convicted as result of ineffective counsel cato sees herself as cross between janitor and fireman im making an effort to try to clean up the mess for the clients she says we are working diligently every day to try to address the new cases as well as try to catch up on the work that wa s to be done really cato says the mess isnt as ugly as it may seem its as much failure to communicate as anything else she insists regardless of the office of the chief disciplinary counsels conclusions good communication was not had in lot of these files she says its not that the work was not done the work was done and it was not relayed to the appropriate parties as to what was done people dont understand also that because you send money to law firm and theres not lawsuit that is immediately filed that is not an indicator that there was not work done yes the civil rights legal defense team sometimes demands more money before it files anything in court cato says but thats because it takes so much time to review cases cato says you have to do that review before you can give somebody an intelligent answer she explains nobody can work for freecato says clients sign retainer agreements that make it clear their money wont necessarily result in anything being filed in court but she stops short of saying that happens in all cases i try to make it practice to do that she says several people who say they were scammed say thats not what happened in their cases and thats not what mills has heard everyb ody ive talked to in this situation was under the distinct impression that that by paying this money they were in fact going to get some results not just get an evaluation he says cato who formerly worked in the st louis city counselors office han dling nuisance property cases is cagey about who hired her she says she answered newspaper advertisement actually i was hired by the civil rights legal defense team she says i was hired by the corporation who exactly conducted the job intervi ew well i spoke with couple of different people and eventually i took over the stock she says as the current owner of the civil rights legal defense team cato says shes in charge but shes not eager to take responsibility for judgments against the

john tiller scrambles by bruce rushton published october 30 2002 for residents of the neighborhood just north of the edward jones dome salamas market is the closest place to pick up gallon of milk loaf of bread or box of cereal its also popular place to cash check think of it as an inner city bank for people without bank accounts salamas isnt the sort of place one expects to find white collar guy cashing thousands of dollars in checks written on the the account of the law firm where he works but john gary tiller paralegal and resident of clayton isnt your ordinary white collar worker st louis police say tiller cashed 51000 worth of checks at salamas in 2000 and 2001 more recently sam salama says tiller showed up one day in march with three cashiers checks worth total of 50000 salama says his brother who is out of town and unavailable for comment accepted the checks after the issuing bank told him that they were legitimate but the bank later refused to honor them he says leaving salamas with 50000 hole in its accounts they denied to pay us the checks says salama who doesnt blame tiller so much as the bank salamas is curious choice for someone with cashiers checks which are treated almost as if they were cash most banks will accept them with little or service charge regardless of whether the check holder has an account tiller target of an ongoing criminal investigation twice declined to talk to reporter and in an mail sent late monday to the riverfront times accused the reporter of trying to intimidate him by asking about his activities tillers attorney charles w gray says he doesnt know anything about the cashiers checks tiller cashed last spring as for checks cashed at salamas in previous years gray says tiller had reason for using the tiny grocery but he declines to elaborate on the record st louis police are taking hard look at how tiller handled money from accounts in the name of the civil rights legal defense team law firm he helped set up after his release from prison in 1999 dozens of clients have accused tiller and the firm of taking their money and doing work those allegations were first outlined in riverfront times story that chronicled tillers career as convict turned paralegal bruce rushton serial tiller july 24 less than month after the story appeared st louis police served search warrant at tillers apartment in clayton gray says most everything police are saying about his client isnt true the cops said plenty in fourteen page affidavit used to obtain the search warrant which allowed them to seize computers paper files telephone records checkbooks and other documents from tillers apartment on august 21 but the gist can be stated in single sentencepage 1of3 7282009 httpwwwriverfronttimescomcontentprintversion112903the civil rights legal defense team is the latest in long line of fraudulent businesses created by mr tiller to steal money wrote detective ronald sheppard in the search warrant affidavit the civil rights legal defense team promised to help inmates gain their freedom but inmates and their families received little or nothing in the way of legal services after tiller and others convinced them to pay thousands of dollars in retainer fees on the basis of complaints received by the missouri attorney general and the state office of chief disciplinary counsel sheppard says he believes there are more than 60 victims from across the nation with total losses reaching into six figures in his affidavit sheppard says nearly 1 million moved through civil rights legal defense team bank accounts in the space of three years much of the money went to tiller who cashed about 200000 worth of checks payable to himself during the first six months of 2001 according to the affidavit during that same period the civil rights legal defense team spent 1919 on expenses directly related to clients including 500 that was refunded to one client sheppard writes in 2000 the civil rights legal defense team spent little over 2000 on client expenses that same year tiller cashed checks to himself totaling more than 89000 according to the affidavit gray says his client hasnt done anything wrong im ready to admit that the accounting procedures at this firm suck just because you happen to see payment going to mr tiller doesnt necessarily mean that money went into his pocket bottom line gray claims civil rights legal defense team attorney allen harris who was suspended from practice in september 2001 and disbarred in may and harris successor sarah cato are responsible for whatever happened the victims all tell essentially the same story after sending money to the civil rights legal defense team they received plenty of promises but services the typical client lost about 3000 some lost much more pam lyons of cocoa beach florida says she sent 19375 to st louis early this year after tiller told her that the attorney for her brother antonino lyons was screwing up and that the civil rights legal defense team could help at one point she says tiller called bank directly in an attempt to get money from her brothers legal defense fund he constantly kept harassing we need more money or the federal governments going to hang your brother we really need money in order to fight this case lyons says he kept asking us for more and more and more each time he called he was just getting more aggressive and more demanding tiller in an mail says i did nothing wrong with that client he says his investigative work led that client to new trial greg eisenmenger lawyer for antonino lyons says hes never heard of tiller and that the civil rights legal defense team did zero to help his client pam lyons agrees her brothers been demanding refund since april in july he filed complaint with the office of chief disciplinary counsel sheppard says cato has cooperated with police and isnt suspect although he cant rule out the possibility of her becoming one cato says she wont discuss the lyons case or any others citing attorney client privilege clients say shedoesnt return phone calls nathan lumbard of howe indiana says he spent two days in st louis earlier this month trying to track cato down but the civil rights legal defense team office in the locust building was always locked and dark he says he gave 11500 to the civil rights legal defense team in december to file police brutality suit but that papers were filed he adds that an attorney in indiana recently told him that the deadline for filing lawsuit has passedpage 2of3

rft she fired tiller in july she also says the civil rights legal defense team longer has any employees we are in bad financial straits and getting ready to try to do something to resolve it she says the civil rights legal defense teams phone number has been changed and cato wont provide working one callers who dial the old number get an electronic message directing them to different number when they call that number tiller answers hes launched company called the paralegal group say cato and gray the firm provides paralegal services and also acts as an attorney referral service according to the companys web site tiller who refers questions to gray has sued the rft for libel acting as his own lawyer in an mail sent to the paper tiller says i am going to do everything legally i can do to show him bruce rushton and the public that john tiller was out to help people not hurt them steve suskin legal counsel for new times owner of the rft says the riverfront times expects this lawsuit to be dismissed among other things tiller who has 27 felony convictions mostly for fraud is angry that the paper contacted his parole officer as result the missouri department of corrections has stepped up his supervision occasionally sending parole officer to his home and requiring that he visit his parole officer at least once week rocky gitlin an administrator for the missouri department of corrections says parole officers havent pursued parole revocation because prosecutors havent filed charges the office of chief disciplinary counsel started getting complaints about tiller and the civil rights legal defense team more than two years ago sometimes it makes sense to how slow the justice system is or what theyre waiting for gitlin says sheppard says he needs to bolster what victims are saying with canceled checks mails and other documents and that takes time he inherited the case from the attorney generals office and us postal inspectors who interviewed former civil rights legal defense team employees and obtained the firms bank records then called the circuit attorneys office im going to try to think about this in terms of trying to be as diplomatic as i can be in terms of passing the buck sheppard says he estimates hes spent two weeks looking into the matter theres one particular attorney there in the circuit attorneys office and myself that are pretty much saddled with this caper sheppard says the missouri attorney generals office wrote some 39 different individuals referring these people to frankly i havent had the opportunity to respond to all these folks theres ton of them and tiller feels for them says his lawyer he feels bad that these clients have been screwed gray says these people are still getting screwed and mr tillers not therepage 3of3

once an md is charged with wrong doing many boards place that md into guilty until proven innocent position that is very much contrary to our civil liberties in some states for every physician with gross deficinecie s there is one doctor working in high risk medicine who for political reasons finds himself or herself charged with gross malpractice which enters into the area of opinion in how patient is best treated some consumer medical boards just bring allega tions and never look at the whole picture of how care was rendered or why their investigative procedures are sometimes based on

check to renew his medical license and he lost the right to prescribe painkillers and other controlled substances boeger says it is rare for doctor to work under such circumstances its liability insurance company will work with them hospital will give them privileges yet in november 2007 kalk was granted an illinois medical license and full drug clearance by the states pharmacy board susan hofer spokeswoman for the illinois division of professional regulation says there was way of knowing about kalks troubles in missouri until theres final action taken they dont notify the association of state medical boards kalk also continued his affiliation with missouri baptist medical center until december 2007 hospital spokeswoman mary beck declined an interview request and refused to specify why he was dismissed by the facility the missouri board of registration for the healing arts was last to act kalk wasnt formally disciplined until december 2008 when the state charged him with six counts of misconduct including sending threatening mails to medical billing company manager and inappropriately touching female patient several allegations and different accounts came to us at different times when new allegation of misconduct comes in we go and investigate says tina steinman the agencys executive director explaining the delay you only have one opportunity to revoke the license we have to make sure we have all the evidence we need kalk signed settlement allowing him to voluntarily surrender his missouri medical license rather than have itrevoked effective july 1 2009 susan hofer says that distinction is what has allowed him to remain unscathed in illinois we frequently open an investigation and take action based on the actions of another state hofer says the issue with voluntary surrender is it doesnt trigger the same kind of urgency as revoked or suspended license its not clear that its disciplinary issue medical licensing experts say such oversights are common because each states system is unique many are underfunded and theres often miscommunication between the bureaucracies they dont have staff to do adequate monitoring let alone speedy resolution of cases says tim greaney director of the center for health law studies at saint louis university those delays can hurt the public an eighteen month investigation can really cause harm during the pending investigation kenneth vuylsteke who chairs the medical legal committee for the citys bar association and represents patients in malpractice claims believes missouris system is biased in favor of physicians their whole theory is we have lot invested in their training with the doctors education they have so much tooffer he says doctors are valuable commodities but theyre also in position to cause great harm if they dont know what theyre doing i think the board of healing arts in missouri and in other states needs to take second look at what theyre doing and try to protect patients

ninety percent of people who die by suicide have mental disorders she says the studies are unequivocal physicians have the highest suicide rate of any profession in the western world clayton

severe insomnia and tendency to do things that many around them would regard as morally objectionable its often tragic harry says it can be very disruptive not just to an individuals life but to everybody around them its not surprising harry adds that kalk refused treatment for so long the highs from the manic part of manic depressive sometimes feel so great its hard to give that up especially for someone whos down and out or hard on their luck they feel like they are literally on top of the world but when his family finally came to his rescue they were shocked at what they found
