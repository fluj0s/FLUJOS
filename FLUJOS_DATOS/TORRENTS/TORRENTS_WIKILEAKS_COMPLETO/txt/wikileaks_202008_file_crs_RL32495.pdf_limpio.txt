to meet ayp standards need be applied only to schools and leas participating in title ia another major break with the pre nclb period is that stat ayp standards must inco rporate concrete movement

upon requestgeneral elements of ayp provisions esea title i part has included requirements for participating leas and states to administer assessments of academic achievement to par ticipating pupils and to evaluate lea programs at least every two years since the program was initiated in 1965 however relativel little attention was paid to school or leawide outcome accountability until adoption of the school improvement act of 19882 under the school improvement ac t requirements for states and leas to evaluate the performance of title ia schools and indivi dual participating pup ils were expanded in addition leas and states were for the first time required to develop and implement improvement plans for pupils and schools whose performance was not improving however in comparison to current title ia outcome accountability provisions these requirements were broad and vague st ates and leas were given little direction as to how they were to determine whether performance was satisfactory or how performance was to be defined with one partial exception the exception applied to schools conduc ting schoolwide programs under title ia in schoolwide programs title ia funds may be used to improve instruction for all pupils in the school rather than be ing targeted on only the lowestachieving individual pupils in the school as under th other major title ia service model targeted assistance schools under the 1988 version of the esea schoolwide programs were limited to sc hools where 75 or more of the pupils were from low income families currently th is threshold has been reduced to 40 the school improvement act requi red schoolwide programs in or der to maintain their special authority to demonstrate that the academic achievement of pupils in the school was higher than either of the following the average level of achievement for pupils participating in title ia in the lea overall or b the average level of achievement for disadvantaged pupils enrolled in that school during the three years preceding schoolwide progra m implementation the embodiment of outcome accountability in the specific concept of ayp began with the 1994 improving americas schools act iasa under the iasa states participating in title ia were required to develop ayp standards as basis for systematically determining whether sc hools and leas receiving title ia grants were performing at an acceptable level failure to meet the state ayp standards was to become the basis for directing technical assistance and ultimately corrective actions toward schools and leas where performance was consistently unacceptable generic ayp factors before proceeding to description of the title ia ayp provisions under the iasa of 1994 we outline below the general types of major provisions frequently found in ayp provisions actual or proposed primary basis they are based primarily on aggregate measures of academic achievement by pupils as long as title ia has contained ayp provisions it has provided that these be based ultimately on state standards of curriculum content andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs3 3 for additional information on the standard and assessment requirements under esea title ia see crs report rl31407 educational testing impl ementation of esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by wayne c riddlepupil performance and assessments linked to these standards more specifically the title ia requirements have b een focused on the percentage of pupils scoring at the proficient or higher level of achievement on state assessments not common national standard however when ayp provisions were first adopted in 1994 states were given an extended peri od of time to adopt and imple ment these standards and assessments and for lengthy peri od after the 1994 amendments various transitional performance standards and assessments were used to measure academic achievement3 ultimate goal ayp standards may or may not incorporate an ultimate goal which may be relatively sp ecific and demanding eg all pupils should reach the proficient or higher level of achievement as defined by each state in specified number of years or more ambiguous and less demanding g pupil achievement levels must increase in relation to either lea or state averages or past performance if there is specific ultimate goal there may also be requirements for specific numerical annual objectives either for pupils in the aggregate or for each of several pupil groups the primary purpose of such goal is to require that levels of achievement continuously incr ease over time in order to be considered satisfactory subject areas with respect to subject areas ayp standards might focus only on reading and math achievement or they might include additional subject areas additional indicators in addition to pupil scores on assessments ayp standards often include one or more supplemental indicat ors which may or may not be academic examples include high school graduation rates attendance rates or assessment scores in subjects othe r than those that are required levels at which applied states may be required to develop ayp standards for and apply them to schools leas or for states overall further it may be required that ayp standa rds be applicable to all schools and leas or only to those participating in esea title ia disaggregation of pupil groups ayp standards might be applied simply to all pupils in school lea or state or they might also be pplied separately and specifically to variety of demographi c groups of pupils such as economically disadvantaged pupils pupils with disabilitie s pupils in different ethnic or racial groups or limited english proficient pupils in program such as title ia the purpose of which is to impr ove education for the disadva ntaged it may be especially important to consider sel ected disadvantaged pupil groups separately to identify situations where overall pupil achievement may be satisfactory but the performance of one or more disadvantaged pupil groups is not basic structure the basic structure of ayp models generally falls into one of three general categories the three ba sic structural forms for ayp of schools or leas are the group status successive group improvement and individualcohorthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs4 growth models in the context of these term s group or subgroup in the case of detailed demographic categories refers to collection of pupils that is identified by their grade level and usually other demographic characteristics eg race ethnicity or educational disadva ntage as of point in time the actual pupils in group may change substantially or even completely from one year to the next in contrast cohort refers to collection of pupils in which the same pupils are followed from year to year the key characteristic of the group status model is require d threshold level of achievement that is the same for all pup il groups schools and leas statewide in given subject and grade level under this model performance at point in time is compared to benchmark at that time with direct consideration of changes over previous period and whatever the schools or leas sta rting point for example it might be required that 45 or more of the pupils in any of states elementary schools score at the proficient or higher level of achieve ment in order for school to make ayp status models emphasize the importance of meeting certain minimum levels of achievement for all pupil groups schools and leas and arguably apply consistent expectations to all the key characteristic of the successive group improvement model is focus on the rate of change in achievement in subject area from one year to the next among groups of pupils in grade level at sc hool or lea eg the percentage of this years 5th grade pupils in school who are at proficient or higher level in mathematics compared to the percentage of last years 5th grade pupils who were at proficient or higher level of achievement finally the key characteristic of the i ndividualcohort growth model is focus on the rate of change over time in the level of achievement among cohorts of the same pupils growth models are longit udinal based upon the tracking of the same pupils as they progress through their k12 education careers while the progress of pupils is tracked individually results are typically aggregated when used for accountability purposes aggregation may be by demographic group by school or lea or other relevant characteristics in general growth models would give credit for meeting steps along the way to proficiency in ways that status model typically does not alternative or saf harbor provisions ayp systems often have alternative provisions under which schools or leas that fail to meet the usual requirements may still be deemed to have made ayp if they meet certain specified alternative conditions for example unde r status model it might be generally required that 45 or more of the pupils in any of states elementary schools score at the proficient or higher level of achievement in order for the school to make ayp but school where aggregate achievement is below this level might still be deemed to have made ayp through safe harbor provision if the percentage of pupils at the proficient or higher leve l in the school is higher than for the previous year by some specified degree such concept may be seen as adding successive group improvement model element to status model of ayphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs5 4 for more information on all aspects of the esea title ia assessment requirements see crs report rl31407 educational testing implem entation of the esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by wayne c riddleassessment participation rate it might be required that specified minimum percentage of schools or leas pupils pa rticipate in assessments in order for the school or lea to be deemed to have t ayp standards the primary purposes of such requirement are to assure that ssessment results are broadly representative of the achievement level of the schools pupils and to minimize the incentives for school staff to discourage test participation by pupils d eemed likely to perform poorly on assessments exclusion of certain pupils beyond general particip ation rate requirements see above states may be specifically required to incl ude or allowed to exclude certain groups of pupils in determinin g whether schools or leas meet ayp requirements for example statutory provisions might allow the exclusion of pupils who have attended school fo r less than one year in determining whether school meets ayp standards special provisions for pupils with particular educational needs beyond requirements that all pupils be included in assessments with accommodations where appropriate there may be special provisions for limited english proficient lep pupils or pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities averaging or other statistical manipulation of data finally there are variety of ways in which statistical mani pulation of ayprelated data or calculations might be either authorized or prohibited major possibilities include averaging of test score data over periods of two or more years rather than use of the latest data in all cases or the use of confidence intervals in calculating whether the aggregate performance of schools pupils is at the level specified by the states ayp standards these techniques and the implica tions of their use are discussed further below in general their use tends to improve the reliability and validity of ayp determinations while often reducing the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards ayp provisions under the iasa of 1994 under the iasa states were to deve lop and implement ayp standards soon after enactment however states were given several years generally until the 2000 2001 school year to develop and implement curriculum content standards pupil performance standards and assessments linked to these for at least three grade levels in math and reading4 thus during the period between adoption of the iasa in 1994 and of nclb in early 2002 for most st ates the ayp provisions were based on transitional assessments nd pupil performance standards th at were widely varying in nature ayp standards based on such transitional assessments were considered to be transitional themselves with fin ayp standards to be based on states final assessments when implemented the subject areas required to be included in state ayp standards as opposed to required assessments were not explicitly specified in statute ed policy guidance required states to include only math andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs6 5 all pupils in states where ayp determinations were made for all public schools or all pupils served by esea title ia in states where ayp determinations were made only for such schools and pupilsreading achievement in determining ayp further the inclusion in ayp standards of measures other than academic achievement in math and reading on state assessments was optional with respect to the ultimate goal of the state ayp standards the iasa provided broadly that there must be continuous nd substantial progress toward goal of having all pupils meet the pr oficient and advan ced levels of achievement however timeline was specified for reaching this go and most states did not incorporate it into their ayp plans in any concrete way the iasas ayp standards were to be applied to schools and leas but not to the states overall further while states were encouraged to apply the ayp standards to all public schools and leas states could c hoose to apply them only to schools and leas participating in title ia and most did so limit their application the iasa provided that all relevant pupils5 were to be included in assessments and ayp determinati ons although assessments were to include re sults for pupils who had attended school for less than one year only in tabulating leawide results ie not for individual schools lep pupils were to be assessed in the language that would best reflect their knowledge of subjects other than english and accommodations were to be provi ded to pupils with disabilities importantly while the iasa required st ate assessments to ultimately by 2000 2001 pr ovide test results that were disaggregated by pupil demographic groups it did not require such disaggregation of data in ayp standards and calculations the 1994 statute provided that state ayp standards must consider all pupils particularly economically disadvantaged and lep pupils but did not specify that the ayp definition must be based on each of these pupil groups separately finally the statute was silent with respect to data averaging or other statistical techniques as well as the basic structur of state ayp standards i whether group status successive group improvement or i ndividualcohort growth model must be employed concerns about the ayp provisions of the iasa thus the iasas provisions for state ayp standards br oke new ground conceptually but were comparatively broad and ambiguous alt hough states were required to adopt and implement at least transitional ayp standa rds on the basis of transitional state assessment results soon after enactment of the iasa they were not required to adopt final ayp standards in conjunction w ith final assessments and pupil performance standards until the 20002001 school year further states were not allowed to implement most corrective actions such as reconstituting school staff until they adopted final assessments so these provisi ons were not implemented by most states until the iasa was replaced by nclbhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs7 6 see http wwwcpreorgpub licationspublications_accountabilityhtm 7 us department of educati on office of the undersecretary policy and program studies continueda compilation was prepared by the consortium for policy research in education cpre of the tra nsitional ayp standards that states were applying in administering their title ia prog rams during the 19992000 school year6 overall according to this compilation the state ayp definitions for 19992000 were widely varied and frequently complex general patterns in these ayp standards outlined below reflect state interpretation of the iasas statutory requirements most considered only achievement test scores but some considered variety of additional factors mo st often dropout ra tes or attendance rates often the state ayp standards set threshold of some minimumpercentage or minimum rate of increase in the percentage of pupils at the proficient or higher leve l of achievement on composite of state tests these thresholds were often based at least in part on performance of pupils in school or lea relative to statewide averages or to the schools or th leas performance in the previous year several states identified schools as failing to make ayp if they fail to meet expected growth in performance on the basis of factors such as initial achievement levels and statewide average achievement trends these threshol ds almost never incorporated ladder of movement toward go of all pupils at the proficient level or otherwise explicitly incorporated an ultimate goal to be met by some specific date while some state ayp standards were based on ach ievement results for single year they were frequently based on two or threeyear rolling averages the ayp standards generally refe rred only to all pupils in school or lea combined without specific focus on any pupil demographic groups however th ayp standards of some states included focus on single category of lowachieving pupils separately from all pupils and ve ry few eg texas included specific focus on the performance of several pupil groups african american hispanic white or ec onomically disadvantaged one state new mexico compared school scores to predicted scores on the basis of such factors as pupil demographics the state ayp standards under the iasa were sometimessubstantially adjusted from yearto year often with consequent wide variations in the percentage of title ia schools identified as needing improvement according to cpre two states iowa and new hampshire left ayp standards and determinations almost

adequate yearly progress ayp growth models under the child left behind act continuedvariation among the states in the impact of their ayp policies under the iasa on the number and percentage of t itle ia schools and leas that were identified as failing to meet the ayp standards in some states substantial majority of title ia schools were identified as failing to make ayp wh ile in others almo st schools were so identified in july 2002 just before the in itial implementation of the new ayp provisions of nclb ed released comp ilation of the number of schools identified as failing to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years and therefore identified as being in need of improve ment in 20012002 for most states or 2000 2001 in states where 20012002 data were not available8 the national total number of these schools was 8652 the number in individual states ranged from zero in arkansas and wyoming to 1513 in michigan and 1009 in california9 while there are obvious differences in the size of these states there were also wide variations in the percentage of all schools pa rticipating in title i that failed to meet ayp for either one year or two or more consecutive years ayp under nclb statute nclb provisions regarding ayp may be seen as an evolution of and to substantial degree as reaction to per ceived weaknesses in the ayp requirements of the 1994 iasa the latter were freque ntly criticized as being insufficiently specific detailed or challenging criticism often focused specifically on their failure to focus on specific disadvantaged pup il groups failure to require continuous improvement toward an ultima goal and their required applicability only to schools and leas participating in t itle ia not to all public schools or to states overall under nclb the title ia requirements for statedeveloped standards of ayp were substantially expanded in scope and specificity as under the iasa ayp is defined primarily on the basi s of aggregate scores of pupils on state assessments of academic achievement however under nclb state ayp standards must also include at least one additi onal academic indicator which in the case of high schools must be the graduation rate the additiona l indicators may not be employed in way that would reduce the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs9 10 continued growth model pilot project has been initiated by ed 11 in addition program regulations federal register december 2 2002 do not require graduation rates and other additional academic i ndicators to be disaggregated in determining whether schools or leas meet ayp standardsone of the most important differences between ayp standards under nclb and previous requirements is that under nclb ayp calculations must be disaggregated that is they must be determined separately and specifically for not only all pupils but also for several demographic groups of pupils within each school lea and state test scores for an individual pupil may be taken into consideration multiple times depending on the number of designated groups of which they are member eg pupil might be considered as part of the lep and economically disadvantaged groups as well as the all pupils group the specified demographic groups are as follows economically disadvantaged pupils lep pupils pupils with disabilities and pupils in major racial and ethnic groups as well as all pupils however as is discussed further below there are three major constraints on the consideration of these pupil groups in ayp calculations first pupil groups need not be considered in cases where their number is so relatively small that achievement results would not be statisti cally significant or the identity of individual pupils might be divulged11 as is discussed further below the selection of the minimum number n of pupils in group for the group to be considered in ayp determinations has been left largely to state di scretion state policies regard ing n have varied widely with important implications for the numbe r of pupil groups actually considered in making ayp determinations for many schools and leas and the number of schools or leas potentially identified as failing to make ayp second it has been left to the states to define the major racial and ethnic groups on the basis of which ayp must be calculated and third as under the ia sa pupils who have not attended the same school for full year need not be consid ered in determinin g ayp for the school although they are still to be included in lea and state ayp determinations in contrast to the previous statute unde r which ayp standards had to be applied only to pupils schools and leas particip ating in title ia ayp standards under nclb must be applied to all public schools leas and fo r the first time to states overall if state chooses to receive title ia grants however corrective actions for failing to meet ayp standards need only be applied to schools and leas participating in title ia another major break with the past is that state ayp standards must incorporate concrete movement toward meeting an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or advanced vel of achievement by the end of the 20132014 school year the steps that is required levels of achievement toward meeting this goal known as annual measurable objectives amos must increase in equal increments over time the first increase in the thresholds must occur after morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs10 12 states may of course establish star ting points above the required minimum level 13 the base year is the 20012002 school year 14 this is determined by ranking all public sc hools of the relevant grade level statewide according to their percentage of pupils at the pr oficient or higher level of achievement on the basis of all pupils in each school and tting the threshold at the point where onefifth of the schools weighted by enrollment have been counted starting with the schools at the lowest level of achievement 15 under program regulations 4 cfr 20016c 2 the starting point may vary by grade span eg elementary middle etc and subjectthan two years and remaining increases at least once every three years as is discussed further below several states have accommodated this requirement in ways that require much more rapid progress in the later years of the period leading up to 20132014 than in the earlier period the primary basic structure for ayp under nclb is speci fied in the authorizing statute as group status model uniform bar approach is employed states are to set threshold percentage of pupils at proficient or advanced levels each year that is applicable to all pupil subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in ayp determinations the threshold levels of achievement are to be set separately for reading and math and may be set separa tely for each level of k12 education elementary middle and high schools the minimum12 starting point for the uniform bar in the initial pe riod is to be the greater of the percentage of pupils at the proficient or advan ced level of achievement fo r the lowestachieving pupil group in the base year13 or b the percentage of pupils at the proficient or advanced level of achievement for the lowestperforming quintile fifth14 of schools statewide in the base year15 the uniform bar must generally be increased at least once every three years although in the initial period it must be increased after more than two years in determining whether scores for group of pupils are at the required level the averaging of scores over two to three year s is allowed in addition nclb includes safe harbor provision unde r which school that does not meet the standard ayp requirements may still be deemed to meet ayp if it experiences 10 not 10 percentage point reduction in the gap be tween 100 and the base year for the specific pupil groups that fail to meet the uniform bar and those pupil groups make progress on at least one other academic indicator included in the states ayp standards as noted earlier this lternative provision adds successive group improvement as secondary ayp model unde r nclb in addition as is discussed below under pilot project nine states ve been approved to use third model of ayp growth model for ayp determinations finally nclb ayp provisions include an assessment participation rate requirement in order for school to meet ayp standards at least 95 of all pupils as well as at least 95 of each of the mographic groups of pupils considered forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs11 16 if the number of pupils in specified demographic group is too small to meet the minimum group size requirements for consider ation in ayp determinations then

guidance on implementation of the ayp provisions of nclb states began determining ayp for school s leas and the states overall on the basis of nclb provisions beginning w ith the 20022003 school year the deadline for states to submit to ed their ayp standards based on nclb provisions was january 31 2003 and according to ed all states met this deadline on june 10 2003 ed announced that accountability plan s had been approved for all states however many of the approved plans re quired states to take additional actions following submission of their plan17 in the period preceding eds review of state accountability plans under nclb the department published tw relevant documents re gulations published in the federal register on december 2 2002 mirrored the detailed provisions in the authorizing statute the second document policy letter published by the secretary of education on july 24 200218 emphasized flexibility stating that the purpose of the statute for both assessments and accountability is to build on high quality accountability systems that states already have in place not to require every state to start from scratch the letter went on to list 10 criteria that it said would be applied by ed in the process of reviewing state ayp standards these criteria included most but not all of the specifications regarding ayp from the authorizing statute and regulations eg appli cability to all public schools and their pupils and specific focus on individual pupil groups in res ponse to concerns that large numbers of schools might be identified as failing to ma ke ayp as is discu ssed further below ed officials emphasized the importance of taking action to identify and move to improve underperforming school s matter how numerous they also emphasized the possibilities for flexibility and variation in taking corrective actions with respect to schools that fail to meet ayp depending on the extent to which they fail to meet those standards aspects of state ayp plans that apparently received special attention in eds reviews included 1 the pace at which proficiency levels are expected to improve eg equal increments of improvement over the entire pe riod or much more rapid improvement expected in later years than at the beginning 2 whether schools or leas must fail to meet ayp with respect to the same pupil group s grade levels or subject areas

determinations and 6 whether to allow use of statistical techniques such as confidence intervals ie whether scores are below the required level to statistically significant extent in ayp determinations recent developments regulations proposed in april 2008 on title ia assessments and accountability several new final regulations affecting the title ia assessment ayp and accountability policies were pub lished in the federal register on october 29 2008 pages 6443564513 most of the proposed regulations deal with policy areas other than ayp many of the regulations clarify pr evious regulations or codify as regulations policies that have previously been established through less formal mechanisms such as policy guidance or peer reviewer guidance the proposed regulations related to ayp are briefly described below group sizerelated provisi ons in state ayp policies states must provide more extensive rationale than previously required for their selection of minimum group sizes use of confidence inte rvals and related aspects of their ayp policies although specific limits are placed on these parameters states must explain in their accountability workbooks how their policies pr ovide statistically reliable information while minimizing the exclusion of designated pupil groups in ayp determinations especially at the school level states must also report on the number of pupils in designated groups that are excluded from sepa rate consideration in ayp determinations due to minimum group size policies in addition the regulations codify provisions for the nati onal technical advisory council that was established in august 2008 to advise the s ecretary on variety of technical aspects of state standards assessments ayp nd accountability policies each state is required to submit its accountability workbook modified in accordance with the proposed regulations to ed for new round of technical assistan ce and peer review workbooks must be submitted in time to implement any needed changes before making ayp determinati ons based on assessment re sults for the 20092010 school year assessments and accountabilit policies in general the proposed regulations clarify that assessments re quired under title ia may include multiple formats as well as multiple academic asse ssments within each subject area reading mathematics and science this does not include the concept of multiple measures as this term has been used by many to refer to proposals to expand nclbhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs13 20 this includes students who graduate following summer program after

standardsba sed assessments in reading mathematics and science also states are required to include results from the most recent national assessment of educational progress naep assessments on their state and lea perform ance report cards further ed policies regarding provisions for states to request waivers allowing them to use growth models of ayp are codified in the oct ober 2008 regulations previously they were published only in policy guidance and peer reviewer guidance documents graduation rates numerous changes have been made to previous policies regarding graduation rates used as the additional indicator in ayp determinations for high schools previously states were allowed substantial degree of flexibility in their method for calculating graduation ra tes and were not requi red to disaggregate the rates by pupil group except for reportin g purposes also although states were required to determine leve l of or rate of improveme nt in graduation rates that would be adequate for ayp purposes they were not required to set an ultimate goal toward which these rate s should be progressing under the october 2008 regulations stat must adopt uniform method for calculating graduation rates this method must be used for school lea and state report cards showing results of asse ssments administered during the 20102011 school year and for purposes of termining ayp based on assessments administered during the 20112012 school year states unable to meet these deadlines may request an extension this thod has been endorsed by the national governors association the graduation rate is defined as the number of students who graduate from high school in four years20 divided by the number of students in the cohort for the students class adju sted for student transfers among schools states may also propose us ing supplementary extende dyear graduation rate in addition to the fouryear rate in order to accommodate selected groups of students such as certain students with disabilities who may need more than four years to graduate these gradua tion rates must be disaggregated by subgroup states must set an ultimate goal for graduation rates that they expect all high schools to meet federal standard is established but the state goal as well as annual targets toward meeting that goal mu st be approved by ed as part of the states accountability policy growth models in november 2005 the secretary of education announced growth model pilot program under which in itially up to 10 states would be allowed to use growth models to make ayp terminations for th 20052006 or subsequent school years21 in december 2007 the secretary lifted the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model pilot and regulations published in october 200822 incorporate this expanded policy the models proposed by the states must meet at least the following criteria in addition to variety of criteria applicablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs14 23 see httpwwwedgovpolicyelsecguidgrowthmodelguidancepdfto all state ayp policies that is measure achievement separately in readinglanguage arts and mathematics they must incorporate an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or higher level of achievement by the end of the 2013 2014 school year achievement gaps among pupil groups must decline in order forschools or leas to meet ayp standards annual achievement goals for pupils must not be set on the basis of pupil background or school characteristics annual achievement goals must be based on performance standards not past or typical performance growth rates the assessment system must produce comparable results from grade tograde and yeartoyear and the progress of individual students must be tracked within state data system in addition applicant states must have their annual assessments for each of grades 38 approved by ed and these assessments must have been in place for at least one year previous to implementa tion of the growth models in january 2006 ed published peer review guidance for growth model pilot applications23 in general this guidance ela borates upon the requirements described above with special emphasis on the follo wing pupil growth targets may not consider their raceethnicity socioeconomic status school ayp status or any other nonacademic factor b growth targets are to be established on the basis of achievement standards not typical growth patterns or past achie vement and c the state must have longitudinal pupil data system capable of tracking individual pupils as they move among schools and leas within the state the requirements for growth models of ayp under this pilot are relatively restrictive the models must be consistent with the ultimate goal of all pupils at proficient or higher leve l by 20132014 major goal of the statutory ayp provisions of nclb more significantly they must incorporate comparable annual assessments at least for each of grades 38 plus at least one senior high school year and those assessments must be approved by ed and in place for at least one year before implementation of the growth model further all performance expectations must be individualized and the state must have an infrastructure of st atewide longitudinal database for individual pupils proposed models would ve to be structured around expectations and performan ce of individual pupils not demographic groups of pupils in school or lea although individual resu lts would have to be aggregated for the demographic groups designated in nclb two states north carolina and tennessee were initially approved to use proposed growth models in making ayp terminations on the basis of assessments administered in the 20052006 school year nine additional states arkansas delaware florida iowa ohio alaska arizona michigan and missouri havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs15 24 delawares proposal included the use of confidence intervals at an unspecified level in continuedbeen approved to participate in the pilot pr ogram subsequently contingent in the case of missouri on adoption of uniform minimum group size for all pupil groups the growth models for these states are briefly described below the north carolina policy does not actually provide for separate ayp model but rather the addition of projection co mponent to the current group status model if the achievement level of nonprof icient pupil is on trajectory toward proficiency within four years then the pupil is added to the proficient group all other provisions of the current group status and successive group improvement models would continue to apply thus the ultimate goal becomes by the end of the 20132014 school year all pupils will be either at proficient or higher level or on fouryear trajectory toward proficiency w ithout use of confidence intervals the trajectory calculations will be made for pupils in the 3rd through 8th grades sea staff estimate that 4 of the schools in north ca rolina that failed to meet ayp standards on the basis of 20042005 assessm ent results would have t ayp standards if this growth model had been in place under the tennessee policy schools and leas will have two options for meeting ayp meeting either the ayp standards under the group status or successive group improvement models of current law or meeting ayp standards according to projection model unde r the projection model pupils are deemed to be at proficient or hi gher level of achievement if their test scores are projected to be at proficient or hi gher level three years into the future on the basis of past achievement levels for indi vidual pupils it should be noted that under this model pupils who currently score at proficient level but who would be projected to score below proficient leve l in three years would not be counted as proficient further the tennessee growthprojection model imp licitly assumes that pupils attend schools performing at state average level if in actuality they attend lowperforming schools their future achievement level may be overestimated tennessees projection model will not be applied to hi gh schools sea staff estimate that 13 of the schools in tennessee that failed to meet ayp standards based on 20042005 assessment resu lts would have met ayp st andards if this model had been in place under the delaware growth model ayp will be calculated each year on the basis of both the statutory provisions and using the states growth model school will meet ayp standards if it qualifies using either method individual pupil performance will be tracked from one year to the next specified numbers of points up to 300 will be awarded on the basis of changes if any in pupils performance level points will be awarded for partial movement toward proficiency but the points awarded for movement to adva nced levels beyond proficienc will be the same as for movement to proficienc maintaining level of pr oficient or higher awards 300 points as well the average growth sc ores for schools and leas to meet ayp standards increase steadily until 20132014 by which time all pupils would be expected to achieve at pr oficient or higher level24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs16 24 continued implementing the growth model however ed approved use of the model without confidence intervalsunder the arkansas policy ayp will be calculated each year on the basis of both statutory provisions and using the st ates growth model school will meet ayp standards if it qualifies using either method under the growth model pupils in grades 48 will be deemed to be proficient if they are on growth path toward proficiency by the end of 8th grade pupils already prof icient must be on path to continue to be proficient through grade 8 ie growth path criteria will be applied to all pupils proficient and nonproficient individua l annual proficie ncy thresholds and growth increments are designed to enable nonproficient students to reach proficiency by grade 8 and pr oficient students to continue to be proficient mobile pupils will be associated with the school they attended at th time of assessment administration in the previous year under the florida model ayp will be determined separately for each pupil subgroup in each school or lea ie not for schools or leas as whole using the statutory models status and safe harbor plus growth model the school or lea will meet ayp standards if each pupil subg roup makes ayp using one of the three models floridas growth model will be essentially the same as the current status model except that proficient pupils will include bot h those currently scoring at proficient or higher level plus those who are on an individual path toward proficiency within three years the combined percentage of pupils rated proficient will be compared to the standard amo the model will be applied to ayp determinations for grades 3 10 with some modifications for pupils in gr ade 3 in its application the florida sea estimated that for 20062007 938 of the states public schools would meet ayp standards with the growth model applie d compared to 743 schools without out of total of 3200 schools under the iowa model pupil tests score ranges below proficient have been divided into 3 categories hi marginal marginal and weak student who rises from one of these levels to higher level and has not previously attained the higher level will be deemed to have met adequate yearly growth ayg ayg is considered to be more than typical years growth over oneyear period for schools and leas that have not met ayp t hough application of the standard status and safe harbor models students making ayg will be added to those scoring proficient or above nd this combined total will be us ed in determining whether the school or lea makes ayp for the year st udents scoring below th proficient level must continue to move to higher subproficient level each year in order to be included in the combined proficient ayg student count this implies that students beginning at the weak level must reach proficiency within three years those beginning at marginal must become proficient within tw years and those beginning at hi marginal must reach proficiency within one year by 2014 the growth model would longer be used and all pupils will be expected to achieve at proficient or higher levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs17 confidence intervals will continue to be applied to determine whether the combined proficient ayg student count meets the required threshold to make ayp this growth model will be applied statewide to test scores for grades 38 and 11 and to grades 9 and 10 as well in the leas that administer the iowa tests in those grades the iowa growth model does not currently include students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take the iowa alternate assessment ohio has adopted variation of the proj ection or on track to proficiency approach that is common to the models for all of the other participating states except delaware and iowa after app lication of the standard stat us and safe harbor models if any pupil group fails to meet ayp then determination w ill be made if sufficient proportion of pupils in the group is on track toward meeting the required proficiency threshold as of target grade in th case of elementary and middle schools the target grade will be either the grade level following the highest grade offered by the school ie for k5 school the 6th grade or 4 grades beyond the pupils current grade whichever comes first in the cas of high school pupils would have to be on track toward proficiency by the 11th grade pupils currently scoring at proficient level but who are projected to be below the proficient level by the target grade will not be considered to be proficient in ohios projection model student achievement trajectories will be projected on an individual basis projections will be based on past test results in all subjects but with greater weight applied to past test results in the same subject for each pupil under alaskas growth model pupils will be included in the proficient group if their achievement level trajectory is on growth path toward proficiency within 3 additional years for pupils in grades 49 or within 2 additional years for pupils in grade 10 alaska currently has standa rdsbased assessments for grades beyond 10 pupils in the third grade the earliest grade at which state assessments are administered will be measured on the basis of status only not growth the growth model will not apply to pupils with disabilities who take alternate assessments while alaska had proposed that confidence intervals be applied at relatively low level 68 under the growth model the st ate agreed to drop this in the approved version in its application alaska timated that approxima tely 13 of pupils currently not proficient are on track toward proficiency under the terms of the states growth model in arizona the growth model will be applicable to pupils in grades 48 only pupils will be included in th proficient group if their achievement level trajectory is on growth path toward proficiency within three years or by 8th grade whichever comes first pupils in the third grade the earliest grade at which state assessments are administered will be measured on the basis of status only not growth unlike some other states participating in the growth model pilot pupils with disabilities who take the states alternate assessment aimsa will be included in the arizona growth model such pupils with disabilities who move up one performance level ie from falls far below to approach or from approaches to meets the proficiency standard will be deemed to have met their growth target in missouri schools and leas will first be ev aluated under the status model of ayp if the school or lea does not make ayp under that model the growth modelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs18 25 most states use confidence intervals in th eir ayp determinations however in most cases the confidence intervals are applied to group average percentages of students scoring proficient or above not to individual student scoreswill be applied if the sc hool or lea still does not make ayp after application of the growth model then safe harbor cal culation will be applied if the school or lea does not meet any of these 3 cr iteria then it fails to make ayp in the growth calculation it will be determined whether students currently scoring below proficient level are on track to be proficient within either four years or by 8th grade whichever occurs first if so they will be added to the number of students currently scoring at proficient or higher level students in grades 3 and 8 will be evaluated on the basis of the status model and safe harbor only grade 3 scores will be used as the baseline for growth trajectory calculations confidence intervals will be applied to growth model calculations only the current status and safe harbor models will used for ayp determinations fo r grades 912 students with disabilities including those taking the states alternate assessment for students with the most severe cognitive disabilities will be included in the growth model applying trajectories and achievement levels associated with either the regular or alternate assessments in michigan the approved growth model provi des third option for deeming student achievement to be pr oficient for purposes of ayp determinations currently michigan students are deemed to be proficient if their achievement test scores are at proficient or advanced leve l or if the scores of individual students are within 2 standard errors of measurement in effect 95 confidence interval of the test score cut point for proficiency25 the latter students are cons idered to be provisionally proficient and are treated the same as st udents scoring proficie nt or above in ayp determinations the growth model adds third categor of students on trajectory toward proficiency to determine whether students are on trajectory toward proficiency each of the four proficiency leve ls not proficientbelow basi c partially proficientbasic proficient and advanced is divided into 3 sublevels low middle high similar but slightly different procedures are app lied to michigans alternate assessment for students with mild co gnitive impairm ent the growth model does not cover high school students or students w ith disabilities taking alte rnate assessments who have moderate or severe cognitive impairment if students performance improves over the previous year by number of sublevels such that if the improvement continued at the same rate in the future they would reach proficiency within three years they are counted as being on trajectory toward proficiency confid ence intervals will not be applied to the growth model determinations thus the number of students deemed proficient will be the total of students scoring proficient or above plus students on trajectory to proficiency plus students provisionally proficient if this number of students divided by total students tested meets or exceeds the annual measurable obj ective then ayp is met with respect to the subject and student group in question since many students may meet both the trajectory toward proficiency and the provisi onally proficient criteria it will first behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs19 26 this limitation does not apply to the administration of alternate assessments based on the same standards applicable to all students fo r other pupils with noncognitive or less severe cognitive disabilitiesdetermined whether students are on traj ectory then whether any remaining non proficient students meet the provisionally proficie nt criterion it is estimated that use of the growth model will add only minima lly 0713 to the number of students already deemed to be proficie nt or provisiona lly proficient overall most of the growth models approved by ed thus far are based upon supplementing the number of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level with those who are projected to be at proficient level within limited number of years nine of the eleven approved models follow this general approach among these states distinction may be made be tween seven states north carolina arkansas florida alaska arizona missouri and michigan that combine currently proficient pupils with those not proficient who are on tr ack toward proficiency and two states tennessee and ohio that consider only pr ojected proficiency levels for all pupils ie currently proficient pup ils who are not on track to re main proficient are counted as not proficient in cont rast the models used by two other states delaware and iowa focus on awarding credit for movement of pupils among achievement categories up to proficiency pupils with disabilities the most substantial of eds recent ayp policy changes involves pupils with disabilities first regulations addressing the application of the title ia standards nd assessment requireme nts to certain pupils with disabilities were published in the federal register on december 9 2003 pp 6869868708 the purpose of these regulations is to clarify the application of standard assessment nd accountability provisions to pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities under th regulations states and leas may adopt alternate assessments based on alternate ach ievement standards aligned with the states academic content standards and re flecting professional judgment of the highest achievement standards possible for limited percentage of pupils with disabilities26 the number of pupils whose profic ient or higher scores on these alternate assessments may be considered as proficient or above for ayp purposes is limited to maximum of 10 of all tested pupils appr oximately 9 of all pupils with disabilities at the state and lea vel there is limit fo r individual schools seas may request from the us secretary of education an exception allowing them to exceed the 10 cap statewide and seas may grant such exceptions to leas within their state according to ed st aff three states in 20032004 montana ohio and virginia and four states in 2004 2005 the preceding three states plus south dakota received waivers to go marginally above the 10 limit statewide in the absence of waiver the number of pupils scoring at the proficient or higher level on alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards in excess of the 10 limit is to be added to t hose scoring below proficie nt in lea or statelevel ayp determinations new ed policy affecting an additiona l group of pupils with disabilities was announced initially in april 2005 with final regulations based on it published in the federal register on april 9 2007 the new policy is divided into shortterm andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs20 27 under current regulations the shortterm policy cannot be extended beyond the 20082009 school year 28 this would be calculated on the basis of statewide demographic data with the resulting percentage applied to each affected school and lea in the state in making the ayp determination using the adjusted data further use may be made of confidence intervals or other statistical techniques the actual not just the adjusted percentage of pupils who are proficient must also be reported to parents and the publiclongterm phases it is focused on pupils with disabilities whose ability to perform academically is assumed to be greater th an that of the pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities discusse d in the above paragraph and who are capable of achieving high standards but may not reach grade level within the same time period as their peers in eds termi nology these pupils would be assessed using alternate assessments based on m odified achievement standards the shortterm policy may apply with th approval of the secretary to states until they develop and adminis ter alternative assessments under the longterm policy described below27 under this shortterm policy in eligible states that have not yet adopted modified achievement standards schools may add to th eir proficient pupil group number of pupils with disabilities qual to 20 of all pupils assessed in effect deeming the scores of all of thes pupils to be at the proficient level28 this policy would be applicable only to schools and leas that would otherwise fail meet ayp standards due solely to their pupils with disabilities group according to ed staff as of the date of this report 28 states are currently exercising this flexibility alternatively in eligible states that ve adopted modified achievement standards currently six states schools and leas ma count proficient sc ores for pupils with disabilities on these assessments subject to 20 of all assessed pupils cap at the lea and state levels the longterm policy is embodied in final regulations published in the federal register on april 9 2007 these regulations ffect standards assessments and ayp for group of pupils with disabilities w ho are unlikely to achieve grade level proficiency within the current school year but who are not among those pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities whose situation was addressed by an earlier set of regulations di scussed bove for this sec ond group of pupils with disabilities states would be authorized to develop modified academic achievement standards and alternate ssessments linked to these the modified achievement standards must be aligned with gradeleve l content standards but may reflect reduced breadth or depth of gradele vel content in comparison to the achievement standards applicable to the majority of pupils the standards must provide access to grade level curriculum and not preclude affected pupils from earning regular high school diploma as with the previous regulations regarding pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities there would be direct limit on the number of pupils who take alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards however in ayp determinations pupil scor of proficient or adva nced on alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards may be counted only as long as they do not exceed number equal to 20 of all pupils sted at the state or lea level ie anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs21 29 the 30 limit might be exceeded for leas but only if and to the extent that the sea waives the 10 cap applicable to scores on alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards 30 in such cases the former pupils with disabilities would not have to be counted in determining whether the minimum group size was met for the disability subgroupestimated 20 of pupils with disabilities such scores in excess of the limit would be considered nonproficie nt as with the 10 cap for pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities this 20 cap does not apply to individual schools in general leas or states could exceed the 20 cap only if they did not reach the 10 limit with respect to pupils with th most significant cognitive disabilities thus in general scores of proficient or above on lternate assessments based on alternate and modified achievement standards ma not exceed total of 30 of all pupils tested at state or lea level29 in particular states are longer allowed to request waiver of the 10 cap regarding pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities the april 9 2007 proposed regulations also include provisions that are widely applicable to ayp determinations first states are longer allowed to use varying minimum group sizes n for different demographic groups of pupils this prohibits the previously common practice of setting higher n sizes for pupils with disabilities or lep pupils than for other pup il groups second when pupils take state assessments multiple times states and leas may use the highest score for pupils who take tests more than once finally as with lep pupils states and leas may include the test scores of former pupils w ith disabilities in the disability subgroup for up to two years after such pupils have exited special education30 in summary there are now five groups of pupils with disabilities with respect to achievement standards ssessments and the use of

more of pupils all pupils as well as pupils in each designated demographic group participate in assessments in order for the school or lea to make ayp on the basis of average participation rates for the last two or three years rather than having to post 95 or higher participation rate each year in other words if particular demogra phic group of pupils in public school has 93 test participation rate in the most recent year but had 97 rate the preceding year the 95 participation rate requirement would be met in addition the new guidance would allow schools to exclude pupils who fail to participate in assessments due to significant medical emergency from the participation rate calculations the new guidance further emphasizes the authority for states to allow pupils who miss primary assessment date to take makeup tests and to establish minimum size for demographic groups of pup ils to be considered in making ayp determinations including those related to participation rates according to ed in some states as many as 20 of the school s failing to make ayp did so on the basis of assessment particip ation rates alone it is not known how many of these schools would meet the

first with respect to assessmen ts lep pupils who ve attended schools in the united states other than puerto rico for less than 10 months must participate in english language proficiency and mathematics tests however the participation of such pupils in reading tests in english as well as the inclusion of any of these pupils test scores in ayp calculations is to be optional ie schools and leas need not consider the scores of first year lep pupils in determining whether schools or leas meet ayp standards such pupils are still considered in determining whether the 95 test participation has been met second in ayp determinations schools and leas may continue to include pupils in the lep demographic category for up to two years after they have attained proficiency in english however these formerly lep pupils need not be included when determining whether school or lea s count of lep pupils meets the states minimum size threshold for inclusion of the group in ayp calculations and scores of formerly lep pupils may not be include d in state lea or school report cards both these options if exercised should increase average test scores for pupils categorized as being part of the lep gr oup and reduce the extent to which schools or leas fail to meet ayp on the basis of lep pupil groups ayp determinations for ta rgeted assi stance schools d h s released february 4 2004 letter

assisted by title ia for purposes of making ayp determinations for individual schools lea and state level ayp determinations would s till have to be made on the basis of all public school pupils the impact of this authority if utilized is unclear in schools using this authority there would be an increased likelihood that pupil demographic groups would be below minimum size to be considered at the

damage to school systems and dispersion of pupils in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september 2005 interest has been expressed by officials of states and leas that were damaged by the storms or that enrolled pupils displaced by these storms in the possibility of waiving some of nclbs assessment ayp or other accountability requirements in series of policy letters to chief state school officers c ssos the secretary of education has emphasized forms of flexibility already available under current law and announced number of policy revisions and potential waivers that

alabama mississippi texas or florida without sp ecific waiver being required in addition waivers of these requirement s will be considered for other leas or schools heavily affected by enrolling large numbers of ev acuee pupils further all affected leas and schools could establish separate subgroup for displaced students in ayp determinations on the basis of assessm ents administered during the

of the ir accountability plans over the period following the initial submission and appr oval of state accountability plans for ayp and related policie s in 2003 through the present many states have proposed number of revisions to their plans sometimes these revisions seem clearly intended to take advantage of new forms of flexibility announ ced by ed officials such as those discussed above while in other cases states appear to be attemptin g to take advantage of options or forms of flexibility that reportedly been approved for other states previously the proposed changes in state accountab ility plans have pparently almost always been in the direction of increased flexibility for states and leas with reductions anticipated in the number or pe rcentage of schools or leas identified as failing to make ayp issues that have arisen with respect to these changes include lack of transparency and possibly inc onsistencies especially over time in the types of changes that ed officials have approved debates over whether the net effect of the changes is to make the accountabi lity requirements more reasonable or to undesirably weaken them concern that the changes may make an already complicated accountability system even more complex and timing whether decisions on proposed changes are bein g made in timely manner by ed the major aspects of state accountability plans for which changes have been proposed and approved include the following changes to take advantage of revised federal regulations and policy guidance regarding assessment of pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities p pupils and test par ticipation rates b limiting identification for improvement to sc hools that fail to meet ayp in the same subject area for two or more consecutive years and limiting identification of leas for improvement to those that failed to meet ayp in the same subject area and across all three grade spans for two or more cons ecutive years c using alternative methods to determine ayp for schools with very low enrollment d initiating or expanding use of confidence intervals in ayp terminations including safe harbor calculations changing usually eff ectively increasing minimum group size and f changing graduation rate targets for hi gh schools accountability plan changes that have frequently been requested but not approved by ed incl ude identification of schools for improvement only if they failed to meet ayp with respect to the same pupil group and subject area for two or more consecutive years and b retroactive application of new forms of

states and d focus attention especially on disadvantaged pupil groups at the same time it is generally deemed desirable that ayp standa rds should allow flexibility to accommodate myriad variations in state and local conditions demographics and polic ies and avoid the identification of so many schools and leas as failing to meet the standards that morale declines significantly systemwide and it becomes extremely difficult to target technical assistance and corrective acti ons on lowperforming schools the ayp provisions of nclb are challenging and co mplex and have ge nerated substantial criticism from several states leas and interest groups many critics are especially concerned that efforts to direct resources and apply corrective actions to low performing schools would likely be ineff ective if resources and attention are dispersed among relatively large propor tion of public schools others defend nclbs requirements as bein g measured response to the weaknesses of the pre nclb ayp provisions which were much more flexible but as discussed above had several weaknesses the remainder of this re port provides discussion nd analysis of several specific aspects of nclbs ayp provisions that have attracted significant attention and debate these include the provision for an ultimate goal use of confidence intervals and dataaveragi ng population diversity effects minimum pupil group size n separate focus on specific pupil groups number of schools identified and statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs30 variations therein the 95 participation rule state variations in assessments and proficiency standards and timing it should be noted that this report focuses on issues that have arisen in the implementation of nclb provisions on ayp as such it generally does not focus on alternatives to the current statutory provisions of nclb ultimate goal the required incorporation of an ultimate goal of ll pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within 12 ears of enactment is one of the most significant differences between the ayp provisions of nclb and those under previous legislation setting such date is perhaps the primary mechanism requiring state ayp standards to incorporate annual in creases in expected achievement levels as opposed to the relatively static expecta tions em bodied in most st ate ayp standards under the previous iasa without an ultima goal of having all pupils reach the proficient level of achievement by specific date states might simply establish relative goals eg performance must be as high as the state average that provide real movement toward or incentives for significant improvement especially among disadvantaged pupil groups nevertheless goal of having all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within 12 years or any other specified period of time may be easily criticized as being unrealistic if one assumes that proficiency has been established at challenging level pr oponents of such demanding ultimate goal argue that schools and leas frequently m eet the goals established for them even rather challenging goals if the goals are very clearly identified defined and established if they are attainable and if it is made visibly clear that they will be expected to meet them this is in c ontrast to prenclb system under which performance goals were often vague undemanding and poorly communicated with few if any consequences for failing to meet them demanding goal might maximize efforts toward impr ovement by state public school systems even if the goal is not met further if less ambitious goal were to be dopted what lower level of pupil performance might be acceptable and for which pupils at the same time by setting deadlines by which all pupils must achieve at the proficient or higher level the ayp provisions of nclb create an incentive for states to weaken their pupil performance standards to make them easier to meet in many states only minority of pupils sometimes small minority are currently achieving at the proficient or higher level on state reading and mathematics assessments even in states where the percentage of all pupils scoring at the proficie nt or higher level is substantially higher the percentage of those in many of the pupil groups identified under nclbs ayp provisions is substantially lower it would be extremely difficult for such states to reach goal of 100 of their pupils at the proficient level even within 1012 years without reduc ing their performance standards there has thus far been some apparent movement toward wering proficiency standards in small number of states re portedly few states have redesignated lower standards eg basic or partially proficient as constituting proficient level of performance for title ia purposes or established new proficient levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs31 39 see for example states revise the meaning of proficient education week october 9 2002 40 see httpwwwedgovadminsleadaccountstateplans03cocsapdf p 7 41 see httpwwwedgovadminsleadaccountstateplans03lacsadoc p 12 42 according to section 1111b2 h each state shall estab lish intermediate goals for meeting the requirements of this paragraph and that shall i increase in equal increments over the period covered by the stat timeline the program regulations also would seem to require increases in equal increments each state must establish intermediate goals that increase in equal increments over the period covered by the timeline 34 cfr 20017of performance that are below levels prev iously understood to constitute that level of performance and other states have considered such actions39 for example in submitting its accountability plan which was approved by ed colorado stated that it would deem students performing at both its proficient and partially proficient levels as defined by that state as being proficient for nclb purposes40 in its submission the state argued that colorados standards for all students remain high in comparison to most states colorado s basic proficiency vel on csap is also high in comparison to most states similarly louisiana decided to identify its basic level of achievement as the profi cient level for nclb purposes stating that these standards have been shown to be high for example equipercentile equating of the standards has shown that louisiana s basic is somewhat more rigorous than naeps basic in addition representa tives from louisianas business community and higher education have validated the us of basic as the states proficiency goal41 this is an aspect of nclbs ayp provisions on which there will likely be continuing debate it is unlikely that any state and few schools or leas of substantial size and he terogeneous pupil population will meet nclbs ultimate ayp goal unless state standards of proficient performance are significantly lowered or states aggressively pursue the use of such statistical techniques as setting high minimum group sizes and confidence interval s described below to substantially reduce the range of pupil groups considered in ayp determinati ons or effectively lower required achieveme nt level thresholds some states have addressed this s ituation at l east in the short run by backloading their ayp standards requi ring much more rapid improvements in performance at the end of the 12year period than at the beginning these states have followed the letter of the statutory lang uage that requires increases of equal increments in levels of performance after th first two years and at least once every three years thereafter42 however they have backloaded this process by for example requiring increases only once every twothree years at the beginning then requiring increases of the same degree every year for the final years of the period leading up to 20132014 for example both indiana and ohio established incremental increases in the threshold level of performance for schools and leas that are equal in size and that are to take effect in the school years beginning in 2004 2007 2010 2111 2012 and 2013 as result the required increases per year are three times greater during 20102013 than in the 20042009 period these states mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs32 43 alternatively the confidence interval window may be applie d to average test scores for each relevant pupil group that would be compared to fixed threshold score level to determine whether ayp has been metbe trying to postpone required increases in performance levels until nclb provisions are reconsidered and possi bly revised by congress confidence intervals and dataaveraging many states have used one or both of pair of statistical techniques to attempt to improve the validity and reliability of ayp determinations use of these techniques also tends to have an effect whether intenti onal or not of reducing the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards the averaging of test score results fo r various pupil groups over two or three year periods is explicitly authorized under nclb and this authority is used by many states in some cases schools or leas are allowed to select whether to average test score data and for what period two years or three whichever is most favorable for them as discussed above recent policy gu idance also explicitly allows the use of averaging for participation rates the use of another statisti cal technique was not explicitly envisioned in the drafting of nclbs ayp provisions but its inclusion in the accountability plans of several states has been approved by ed this is the use of confidence intervals usually with respect to test scores but in couple of states also to the determination of minimum group size see below this concept is based on the assumption that any test administration represents sample survey of pupils educational achievement level as with all sample surveys there is degree of uncertainty regarding how well the sample results average test scores for the pupil group reflect pupils actual level of achievement as with surveys the larger the number of pupils in the group being tested the great er the probability that the groups average test score will represent their true level of achievement all else being equal put another way confidence intervals are used to evaluate whether achievement scores are below the required threshold to statistically significant extent confidence intervals may be seen as windows surrounding threshold test score level ie the percenta ge of pupils at the proficie nt or higher level required under the states ayp standards43 the size of the window varies with respect to the number of pupils in the relevant group who are tested and with the desired degree of probability that the groups average score represents their true level of achievement this is analogous to the margin of error commonly reported along with opinion polls while test results are not based on small sa mple of the relevant population as are opinion poll results since th tests are to be administered to the full universe of pupils the results from any particular test administration are considered to be only estimates of pupils true level of achie vement or of the effectiveness of school or lea in edu cating specified pupil groups and thus the margin of error or confidence interval concepts are deemed by many to be relevant to these test scores the probability or level of confidence is most often set at 95 but in some cases may be as low as 90 or as high as 99 that is it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs33 44 the text above describes the way in which confidence intervals have been used by states for ayp determinations the concept could be applied in different way requiring scores to be at or above the highest score in the window in order to demonstrate that pupil group had meet ayp standards to statistically significant degree this would reflect confidence at the designated level of probability that school or lea had met ayp standards whereas the current usage reflects confidence that the school or lea had failed to meet ayp standards95 or 90 or 99 certain that the true achievement level for group of pupils is within the relevant confidence interval of test scores above and below the average score for the group all other relevant f actors being equal the smaller the pupil group and the higher the desired degree of probability the larger is the window surrounding the threshold percentage for example consider situation where the threshold percentage of pupils at the proficient or higher level of achievement in readin g for elementary schools required under states ayp standards is 40 w ithout applying confidence intervals school would simply fail to ma ke ayp if the average scores of all of its pupils or of any of its relevant pupil groups meeting min imum size thresholds is below 40 in contrast if confidence intervals are pplied windows are established above and below the 40 threshold turning the threshol d from single point to variable range of scores the size of this score range or window will vary pending on the size of the pupil group whose average scores are be ing considered and the desired degree of probability 95 or 99 that the aver age achievement levels for pupils in each group are being correctly categorized as be ing truly below the required threshold in this case school would fail to make ayp with respect to pupil group only if the average score for the group is belo w the lowest score in that range44 the use of confidence intervals to termine whether group test scores fall below required thresholds to statistically significant degree improves the validity of ayp determinations and ddresses the fact that test scores for any group of pupils will vary from one test administration to another and these variations may be especially large for relatively small gr oup of pupils at the same time the use of confidence intervals reduces the likelihood that schools or to lesser extent leas will be identified as failing to make ayp also for relatively small pupil groups and high levels of desired accuracy especially 99 probability the size of confidence intervals may be relatively large ultimately the use of this technique may mean that the average achievement levels of pupil groups in many school s will be well below 100 proficiency by 20132014 yet the schools would still meet ayp standards because the groups scores are within the relevant confidence interval population diversity effects minimum pupil group size n another important tec hnical factor in state ayp standards is the establishment of the minimum size n for pupil groups to be considered in ayp calculations nclb recognizes that in the disaggregation of pupil data for schools and leas there might be pup il groups that are so small that average test scores would not be statistically relia ble or the dissemination of average scores for the group might risk violation of pupils privacy rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs34 45 in texas the minimum group size for pupil groups other than the all pupils group where the minimum is 40 is the greater of 50 students or 10 of all students in school or lea up to maximum of 200 in california the minimum group size is the greater of 50 students or 15 of all students in the school or lea up to maximum of 100 46 under regulations published on april 9 2007 this practice is longer allowed 47 minimum group sizes for ayp purposes are typically in the range of 30 to 40 pupils while those for reporting are typically in the range of five to 20 pupilsboth the statute and ed regulations and other policy guidance have left the selection of this minimum number to stat discretion while most states have reportedly selected minimum group size between 30 and 50 pupils the range of selected values for n is rather large va rying from as few as five to as many as 200 pupils45 under certain circumstances one state north dakota has set specific level for n relying only on the use of c onfidence intervals see above to establish reliability of test results although most states have ways set standard minimum size for all pupil groups some states until r ecently established higher levels of n for pupils with disabilities or lep pupils46 in general the higher the minimum group size the less likely that many pupil groups will actually be separa tely considered in ayp terminations pupils will still be considered but only as part of the all pupils group or possibly other specified groups this gives schools nd leas fewer thresholds to meet and reduces the likelihood that they will be f ound to have failed to meet ayp standards in many cases if pupil group falls below the minimum group size at the school level it is still considered at the lea level where it is more likely to meet the threshold in addition since minimum group sizes for reporting achievement data are typically lower than those used for ayp purposes47 scores are often reported for pupil groups who are not separa tely considered in ayp calculations at the same time relatively high levels for n weaken nclbs specific focus on variety of pupil groups many of them disadvant aged such as lep pupils pupils with disabilities or economically disadvantaged pupils separate focus on specific pupil groups there are several ongoing issues regarding nclbs requirement for disaggregation of pupil achievement results in ayp standards namely the require ment that variety of pupil groups be separately considered in ayp calculations the first of these was discussed immediately above the establishment of minimum group size with the possible result that relatively small pupil groups will not be considered in the schools and leas of states that set n at comparativel high level especially in states that set higher level for certain groups eg pupils with disabilities than others second issue arises from the fact that the definition of the specified pupil groups has been left essentially to state discretion this is noteworthy particularly with respect to two groups of pupils p pupils and pupils in major racial and ethnic groups regarding lep pupils many have been concerned about the difficulty of demonstrating that these pupils are perfo rming at proficient level if this pupil group is defined narrowly to include onl pupils unable to perform in regular englishlanguage classroom settings in other words if pupils who longer need special language services are longer identified as being lep how will it behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs35 48 thomas j kane and douglas staiger unintended consequences of racial subgroup rules in paul peterson and martin west eds child left behind the politics and practice of school accountability washington brookings institution press 2003 pp 152 176possible to bring those who are identifie d as lep up to proficient level of achievement in developing their ayp standards so states addressed this concern by including pupils in the lep category for one or more years after they longer need special language services as was disc ussed above ed has r ecently published policy guidance encouraging all states to follow this approach allowing them to continue to include pupils in the lep group for up to two years after being mainstreamed into regular english language in struction and further allowi ng the scores of lep pupils to be excluded from ayp calculations for the first year of pupils enrollment in united states schools if widely adopted these policies should reduce the extent that schools or leas are identified as failing to meet ayp standards on the basis of the lep pupil group another aspect of this issue arises from the discretion given to states in defining major racial and ethnic groups neither the statute nor ed has defined this term some states defined the term relativel comprehensively eg maryland includes american indian african american asian white and hispanic pupil groups and some more narrowly eg texas iden tifies only three groups white african american and hispanic more narrow interpretation may reduce the attention focused on excluded pupil groups it woul d also reduce the number of different thresholds some schools and leas would have to meet in order to make ayp final overarching issue arises fro m the relationship between pupil diversity in schools and leas and the likelihood of being identified as failing to meet ayp standards all other rele vant factors being equal specially the minimum group size criteria the more diverse the pupil populati on the more thresholds school or lea must meet in order to make ayp while in sense this was an intended result of legislation designed to focus within limits on all pupil groups the impact of making it more difficult for schools and leas serving diverse populations to meet ayp standards may also be seen as an uninte nded consequence of nclb this issue has been analyzed in recent study by thomas j kane and douglas staiger who concluded that such subgroup targets cau large numbers of schools to fail arbitrarily single out sc hools with large minority subgroups for sanctions or statistically disadvantage di verse schools that are likely to be attended by minority students moreover while the costs of the subgroup targets are clear the benefits are not although these targets are meant to encourage schools to focus more on the achievement of minority youth we find association between the application of subgroup targets and test score performance among minority youth48 according to the national assessment of title i final report publis hed by ed in october 2007 among schools with relatively low poverty ra tes the percentage of schools failing to make ayp ranged from 3 for those with only 1 subgroup to 25 for those with 3 subgroups and 32 for those with 4 or 5 subgroups among schools with relativelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs36 49 john r novak and bruce fuller penalizing diverse schools pace policy brief 034 december 2003high poverty rates the percentage of schools failing to make ayp ranged from 31 for those with only 1 subgroup to 70 for those with 6 or 7 subgroups an additional study published by polic analysis for california education pace49 found that when comparing public schools in califor nia with similar aggregate pupil achievement vels schools with larger num bers of different nclb relevant demographic groups were substantially ss likely to have met ayp standards in the 20022003 school year s imilarly when comparing california public schools with comparable percentages of pupils from lowincome families schools with larger numbers of rele vant demographic groups of pupils were much less likely to have met ayp however without specific requirements for achievement gains by each of the major pupil groups it is possible that insufficient attention would be paid to the performance of the disadvantaged pupil groups among whom improvements are most needed and for whose benefit the title ia program was established under previous law without an explicit specific require ment that ayp standards focus on these disadvantaged pupil groups most state ayp definitions considered only the performance of all pupils combined and it is theoretically possible for many schools and leas to demonstrate substantia l improvements in ach ievement by their pupils overall while the achievement of th eir disadvantaged pupils does not improve significantly at least until the ultimate goal of all pupils at the proficient or higher level of achievement is approached this is especia lly true under status model of ayp such as the one in nclb unde r which advantaged pupil groups may have achievement levels well above what is required nd an overall achie vement level could easily mask achieveme nt well below the required threshold by various groups of disadvantaged pupils one possible alternative to current policy would be to allow states to count each student only once in net in ayp calculations with equal fractions for each relevant demographic category eg hispanic lep pupil from lowincome family would count as onethird of pupil in each group number of schools identified and state variations therein as was discussed earlier c oncern has been expressed by some analysts since early debates on nclb that relatively hi gh proportion of schools would fail to meet ayp standards on the basis of ssessment results fo r 20062007 approximately 28 of all public schools na tionwide failed to make ayp and approximately 12 of all public schools were identified as needing improvement ie failed to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years future increases in performance thresholds as the ultimate goal of all pup ils at the proficient or higher level of achievement is appr oached may result in higher percentages of schools failing to make ayphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs37 50 see alfie kohn test today privatize tomorrow using accountab ility to reform public schools to death phi delta kappan vol 85 8 april 2004 pp 568577in response to these concerns ed offi cials have emphasized the importance of taking action to identify and move to improve underperformin g schools matter how numerous they have also emphasized the possibilities for flexibility and variation in taking correctiv actions with respect to sc hools that fail to meet ayp depending on the extent to which they fail to meet those standards it should also be reemphasized that many of the schools reported as having failed to meet ayp standards have failed to meet ayp for one year only while nclb requires that series of actions be taken only with respect to schools or leas participating in esea title ia that fail to meet ayp for two consecutive years or more further some analysts argue that set of ayp standards that onequarter or more of public schools fail to meet may accurately refl ect pervasive weaknesses in public school systems especially with re spect to the perform ance of disadvantaged pupil groups to these analysts the identif ication of large per centages of schools is positive sign of the rigor and challeng embodied in nclbs ayp requirements and is likely to provide needed motiv ation for significant improvement and ultimately reduction in the percen tage of schools so identified others have consistently expressed concern about the accuracy and efficacy of an accountability system under which such hi gh percentage of schools is identified as failing to make adequate progress with consequent strain on financial and other resources necessary to provide techni cal assistance public school choice and supplemental services options as well as other corrective actions in addition some have expressed concern that schools might be more likely to fail to meet ayp simply because they have diverse enrollments nd therefore more groups of pupils to be separately considered in termining whether the school meets ayp standards they also argue that the application of tec hnical assistance and ultimately corrective actions to such high percentage of sc hools will dilute available resources to such degree that these responses to inadequate performance would be insufficient to markedly improve performance few anal ysts even speculate that the ayp system under nclb is intended to portray large gments of american public education as having failed leading to proposals for rge scale privatization of elementary and secondary education50 the proportion of public school s identified as failing to meet ayp standards is not only relatively large in the aggregate but also varies widely among the states as was discussed above the per centage of public schools id entified as failing to make ayp on the basis of assessment results for 20062007 ranged from 4 to 75 among the states this result is somewhat ironic given that one of the major criticisms of the prenclb provisions for ayp was that they resulted in similarly wide degree of state variation in the proportion of schools id entified and the more consistent structure require d under nclb was widely exp ected to lead to greater consistency among states in th proportion of schools identified it seems likely that the prenclb vari ations in the proportion of schools failing to meet ayp reflected large differences in the nature and structure of state ayphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs38 standards as well as major differences in the nature and rigor of state pupil performance standards and assessments while the basic structure of ayp definitions is now substantially more consistent across states significant variations remain with respect to the factors discussed in this section of the report such as minimum group size or use of confidence in tervals and substa ntial differences in the degree of challenge embodied in st ate standards and assessments remain overall it seems likely that the key influences determining the percentage of states schools that fails to make ayp include in particular order 1 degree of rigor in state content and pupil performance st andards 2 minimum pupil group size n in ayp determinations 3 use of confidence intervals in ayp determinations and whether at 95 or 99 vel of confidence 4 extent of diversity in pupil population 5 extent of communication about and understanding of the 95 test participation rule and 6 possible actual differences in educational quality 95 participation rule it appears that in many cases schools or leas have failed to meet ayp solely because of low participation rates in ssessments meaning that fewer than 95 of all pupils or of pupils in relevant demographic groups meeting the minimum size threshold took the assessments while as discussed above ed recently published policy guidance that relaxes the participation rate requirement somewhat allowing use of average rates over two to threey ear periods and excusing certain pupils for medical reasons the high rate of assessmen t participation that is required in order for schools or leas to meet ayp standards is likely to remain an ongoing focus of debate although few argue against having any participation rate requirement it may be questioned whether it needs to be as hi gh as 95 in recent years the overall percentage of enrolled pupils who attend public schools each day has been approximately 935 nd it is generally agreed that attendance rates are lower in schools serving relatively hi gh proportions of disadvantaged pupils even though schools are explicitly allowed to administe r assessments on makeup days following the primary date of test ad ministration and it is probabl that more schools and leas will meet this requirement as they become more fully aware of its significance it is likely to continue to be very difficult fo r many schools and leas to meet 95 test participation requirement state variations in assessments and proficiency standards as noted above it is likely that state va riations in the percentage of schools failing to meet ayp standards are base d not only on underlying differences in achievement levels as well as variety of technical fact ors in state ayp provisions but also on differences in the degree of rigor or challenge in state pupil performance standards and assessments pa rticularly now that all stat receiving title ia grants must also participate in statelevel administration of naep tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and math every two years this variation can be illustrated for all states by comparing the percentage of pupils scorin g at the proficient level on naep versus state assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs39 51 center on education policy from the capital to the cla ssroom year 2 of the child left behind act january 2004 p 61 52 in two additional states the percentages were essentially the samesuch comparison was conducted by private organization achieve inc based on 8th grade reading and math assessments administered in the spring of 200351 for variety of reasons eg several st ates did not administer standardsbased assessments in reading or math to 8th grade pupils in 2003 the analysis excluded several states 29 states were included in the comparison for reading and 32 states for math according to this analysis the percentage of pupils statewide who score at proficient or higher level on st ate assessments usin g statespecific pupil performance standards was generally much higher than the percentage deemed to be at the proficient or high er level on the naep tests and employing naeps pupil performance standards of the states cons idered the percentage of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level on the state assessment was lower than on naep implying more rigorous st ate standard fo r five states52 out of 32 in math and only two states out of 29 in reading further among the majority of states where the percentage of pupils at the proficient level or above was found to be higher on state assessments than on naep the relationship between the size of the two groups varied widely in some cases only marginally higher on the state assessment and in others the percentage at the proficient level was more than twice as high on the state assessment as on naep although some portion of these differences in performance may result from differences in the motivation of pupils to perform well and of teachers to encourage high performance on naep versus state assessments comparisons to naep results help to illuminate the variations in state proficiency standards it is not yet clear whether such comparisons will significantly encourage greater consistency in those standards second issue is whether some states might choose to lower their standards of proficient perform ance in order to reduce the number of schools identified as failing to meet ayp and make it easier to meet the ultimate nclb goal of all pupils at the proficient or higher level by the end of the 20132014 school year in the affected states this would increase the percentage of pupils deemed to be achieving at proficient level and reduce the number of schools failing to meet ayp standards although states are generally free to take such actions without jeopardizing their eligibility for title ia grants because performance standards are ultimately state determined and have always varied significantly such actions have elicited public criticism from ed in policy letter dated october 22 2002 the secretary of education stated unfortunately some states have lowered the bar of expectations to hide the low performance of their schools and fe w others are discussing how they can ratchet down their standards in order to remove schools from their lists of low performers sadly small number of persons have suggested reducing standards for defining proficiency in order to ar tificially present the facts those whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32495crs40 53 see
