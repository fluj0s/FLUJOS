varies depending on the program for research and general purposes the small business administration sba defines small business as for profit enterprise located in the united states with fewer than 500 employees sba government contracting programs frequently use size standard that varies by industry 1 the size standard is set either in annual receipts or employees for example most crop farming uses size standard of 750000 in annual receipts and the size standard for new singlefamily housing construction is 31 million in annual receipts the size standard for residential electrical lighting fixture manufacturing is 500 employees and the standard for scheduled air passenger transportation is 1500 employees other agencies and legislation use other definitions for example the securities and exchange commission sec and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 define small as company with publicly traded stock valued at 75 million or less 2
