consumers the same types of voice services and features that are offered by traditional local circuitswitched voice telephony service providers ie local exchange carriers and wireless service providers cgvop service providers use carriergrade packet network to carry the communicating end users conversations and associated signaling information cgvop service is one of the many evolving packetbased services that are being utilized more frequently as forms of communication with the growing use of cgvop service communication between users of the service will become increasingly relevant to law enforcement lawfully authorized electronic surveillance laes is critical tool used by law enforcement for investigative purposes laes capabilities have been in place for many years to intercept communicationidentifying information and communication content for circuitswitched voice telephony services however these capabilities are not sufficient for cgvop service therefore laes capabilities must be defined and deployed specifically for cgvop service critical to achieving laes for cgvop communications is the exchange of information between law enforcement and industry this exchange includes law enforcements presentation of their needs to cgvop service providers and their equipment suppliers including the need for access to communicationidentifying information and communication content for cgvop service providing law enforcements needs early in the development process is expected to help ensure timely deployment of effectual and costeffective laes capabilities to facilitate industry interaction this document captures law enforcements needs regarding laes capabilities for cgvop service the document focuses mainly on communicationidentifying information

enforcements electronic surveillance needs regarding carriergrade voice over packet cgvop service this section introduces the content of the document it contains background information and describes the purpose and scope of the document the section also describes the target audience defines the service presents the organization of the document and introduces the labeling convention used for requirements contained in the document 11 background lawfully authorized electronic surveillance laes is critically important investigative tool whereby law enforcement agencies leas are permitted to intercept communications andor acquire communicationidentifying information many serious law enforcement investigations would be thwarted without the availability of laes as an investigative technique and the cooperation of service providers the legal authority for laes is found in federal statutes including but not limited to the electronic communications privacy act of 1986 18 usc 3121 et seq which governs pen registers and trap and trace devices and the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 18 usc 2510 et seq which governs interceptions of communication content and is commonly referred to as title iii or the wiretap act the assistance of service providers has long been authorized and required pursuant to these federal statutes in addition certain service providers labeled telecommunications carriers are required to design their systems so as to ensure that they are capable of enabling the government to conduct laes pursuant to the 1994 communications assistance for law enforcement act calea 1 service providers who meet the definition of telecommunications carrier must meet the requirements of calea in may of 1995 the federal bureau of investigation fbi in cooperation with federal state and local leas published law enforcement requirements for the surveillance of electronic communications 2 the document provided guidance to service providers with wireline wireless and broadband personal communications services pcs networks law enforcement recognizes that in some instances service provider may be able to ensure that an lea has access to the communication content andor communicationidentifying information associated with an intercept subjects use of service without the service provider having to modify its networks or systems however for many of the new services offered over packet networks electronic surveillance has not been adequately addressed in fact many of the new packetbased services and architectures impede or even preclude law enforcements full and proper execution 1 see generally 47 usc 1001 to 1010 calea applies to telecommunications carriers but not to information services see 47 usc 1002b2a 10016 2 law enforcement

surveillance solutions will likely be required to address these problems in order to stimulate development of effective electronic surveillance solutions for packetbased services law enforcement developed set of general capability requirements that identify law enforcements basic needs when performing electronic surveillance for packetbased communications these requirements are specified in the packet surveillance fundamental needs document psfnd for telecommunications carriers equipment manufacturers and providers of telecommunications support services law enforcement recognizes that each packetbased service has moredetailed needs based on the specific characteristics of the service and architectures employed for the service cgvop service 3 is packetbased service for which law enforcement has identified the need for specific electronic surveillance capabilities therefore law enforcement has selected cgvop service for development of requirements for these capabilities these requirements are the primary content of this document 12 purpose and scope as stated above capabilities are needed from service providers to assist leas in conducting laes for cgvop service the purpose of this document electronic surveillance needs for carriergrade voice over packet cgvop service is to set forth the surveillance capabilities needed by leas for cgvop service this document is intended to build awareness of law enforcements needs provide understanding of the specific electronic surveillance requirements that address these needs and stimulate thinking towards the development of costeffective electronic surveillance solutions that meet these requirements and strike balance between privacy and national security and public safety this document is intended to provide guidance to cgvop service providers and equipment manufacturers in the form of law enforcements requirements for these electronic surveillance capabilities the requirements contained in this document define what communicationidentifying information and communication content are needed by leas conducting laes for carrier grade vop service the requirements do not define how cgvop service provider would access an intercept subjects communicationidentifying information and communication content within the cgvop service provider network in addition this document does not assume particular physical architecture or implementation for meeting the capabilities identified this document is not intended and should not be considered to require any specific design nor prohibit the adoption of any equipment this document is meant to describe the technical capabilities and features that leas view as important to accomplishing their goal in conducting 3 section 14 contains definition of cgvop

which is to acquire accurate and complete information for their investigations in the best manner possible and in accordance with law this document does not address the various types of legal authorizations that dictate the specific information to be provided for laes the definition of electronic surveillance capabilities in this document and the subsequent deployment of these capabilities by cgvop service providers do not preclude leas from continuing to use existing surveillance techniques for packetbased services this document was prepared in cooperation with representatives of the us law enforcement community including federal state and local law enforcement 13 target audience this document is intended to offer guidance regarding law enforcements electronic surveillance needs to entities involved in the delivery of cgvop service to end customers including cgvop service providers offering the service manufacturers of equipment used to offer the service and standards bodies and industry associations developing specifications for the service this document is also intended to inform federal government entities including the federal communications commission fcc and congress of law enforcements electronic surveillance needs lastly this document is intended to assist leas that conduct electronic surveillance and manufacturers of electronic surveillance equipment in understanding the inherent complexities in performing laes for packetbased services and the corresponding necessary electronic surveillance capabilities 14 definition of carriergrade voice over packet cgvop service within the last five years there has been significant movement within the telecommunications industry to utilize packet technology to offer voice services that parallel the services provided through the public switched telephone network pstn and that strive to achieve quality reliability security and connectivity comparable to the pstn this movement has been an attempt to leverage the inherent flexibility and cost effectiveness of packet technology mainly for the purpose of migrating existing pstn infrastructure for incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs and wireless service providers or competing with ilecs by deploying new infrastructure for competitive local exchange carriers clecs the focus of this document is on law enforcements electronic surveillance needs for cgvop service cgvop service is defined as the set of subscriptionbased voice services and features provided over carriermanaged packet networks and includes wireline and wireless services 15 assumptions the following assumptions have been made in the development of this document 1 cgvop service as defined in this document is limited to voiceband communications which includes voiceband telephone calls voiceband facsimile calls and voiceband modem calls hence the focus of this document is voiceband communications u s government restricted for official use only

that might be offered by provider of cgvop service are not addressed for example while cgvop service providers might offer other applicationlevel services eg video conferencing unified messaging email such services are not addressed herein as another example while cgvop service providers might also offer broadband access services eg digital subscriber line dsl service and cgvop service subscribers might leverage these broadband access services to use cgvop service broadband access services are not addressed herein 4 3 cgvop service only includes services to which an end user must subscribe service subscription is defined as establishing with cgvop service provider static information that uniquely identifies an end user or an end users equipment facilities or service since service subscription makes available unique information that can be used to definitively identify an end user service subscription is critical to the performance of electronic surveillance for service 4 it is not necessary for the document to explicitly address cases where subscribedto cgvop service provider resells service or hires another provider to offer part of the service law enforcements needs apply to the subscribedto cgvop service provider regardless of whether or not the service provider owns the functionality 16 document organization the document is organized into the following sections

surveillance capability regardless of the authority under which laes is performed there are fundamental electronic surveillance capabilities for packetbased communications law enforcements fundamental need for laes is to gain access to the communication identifying information and communication content associated with an intercept subjects use of service this need applies to communications initiated received and redirected by an intercept subjects equipment facilities or service in performing laes for packetbased services law enforcement expects to have access to communicationidentifying information that is reasonably available to the provider of the service for particular provider the determination of whether or not information is reasonably available for service is based on the role that the provider plays in the particular service and what information is present at the providers network entities that support the service there are typically multiple providers involved in an intercept subjects use of particular packetbased service one of these providers is considered to be the actual provider of the service the other providers enable the service cgvop service provider employs equipment for providing cgvop service based on the functionality supported by this equipment certain communicationidentifying information about an intercept subjects use of the service is present at the equipment and could be made available by cgvop service provider without the provider being unduly burdened by network modifications the equipment at which communicationidentifying information or communication content is accessed is termed an intercept access point iap for packetbased services because the underlying service architecture is often distributed in nature iaps for communicationidentifying information and iaps for communication content are commonly different types of equipment furthermore for given service scenario ie the use of service in particular way and the particular chain of occurrences associated with this use there could be multiple iaps for communicationidentifying information and communication content moreover the iap for communicationidentifying information andor communication content could vary between different service scenarios however this document does not require or assume the distribution of iaps

services and features provided over carriermanaged packet network the modifier carriergrade is used to indicate that the cgvop network is managed network in that the services and features offered achieve comparable levels of quality reliability security and connectivity as the levels found in the traditional circuit switchbased pstn cgvop networks are now being positioned to supplement and eventually replace the circuit switched networks currently comprising the majority of the network components of the pstn in fact growing percentage of carriergrade voice calls are already traversing these carriermanaged packet networks service providers will want the transition to the new technology to be seamless consequently the differences between the packet network and the present circuitswitched network will be introduced to customers in terms of additional services and features built on the base of present capabilities 31 service capabilities cgvop service can be viewed as the packetmode equivalent of circuitswitched local voice telephony service as such cgvop networks perform the fundamental functions of call control signaling switching and routing inherent in the circuitswitched pstn call management server cms is fundamental network element for cgvop service cms is typically involved in call control and signaling cgvop service is characterized by traditional telephony capabilities such as local calling which includes number portability toll calling access to interexchange carriers for long distance calling operator services including operator intercept and busy line verification directory assistance access to tollfree 800 888 877 etc services emergency services 911 n11 services including 711 telecommunications relay service integrated services

automatic callback automatic recall voice mail distinctive alerting anonymous call rejection outgoing call restriction multiline hunt groups 33 use of service the calls placed for cgvop service can be made using traditional enduser telephone sets or newer telephony technology while it is fact that new customer premise equipment cpe is available that enables callers to connect directly to cgvop network commonly called ip phones it is not necessary for endusers to purchase and connect such equipment in order to place calls on cgvop network in addition endusers using traditional telephone equipment in most cases are unaware that cgvop network is being used to process and transport their calls the fact that call is handled by cgvop network is generally transparent to endusers making cgvop service appear practically identical to traditional circuitswitched voice telephony service 5 class is service mark of telcordia technologies inc class services are group of subscriber services that provide selectivecall screening alerting and callingidentification delivery functions class services take advantage of the callingnumber information in commonchannel signaling in some cases class services are invoked apart from call setup and therefore use nonassociated call signaling ie signals generated apart from normal dialing u s government restricted for official use only electronic

one enduser addresses another enduser is dialing standard telephone directory number dn the dns assigned to subscribers of cgvop service with access to the pstn are in the e164 format in north america this number will be part of the north american numbering plan nanp in 10digit dn format npa nxxxxxx however cgvop network often has the capability to support an alternate dialing plan or plans the alternate dialing plan could provide connectivity to other customers on the same or other networks by using addressing schemes that are based for example on ip addresses rather than traditional dn 3311 onnet calling providers of cgvop service have sought to implement enhanced services and features to be used between endusers served on the same cgvop network consequently there may be dialing techniques and capabilities such as abbreviated dialing or nonnanp numbers that are made available to endusers in addition to standard dialing capabilities it is even possible that separate dialing plan for onnet calls applicable to all endusers served by the same cgvop service provider can be invoked distinct from the dialing plan used for offnet calling this is not unlike the present capabilities on pbx or centrex the key difference is that the unique dialing plan can be applicable for all endusers served by the same cgvop service provider even though there is affiliation or association among the endusers other than that they are served by the same cgvop service provider the cms would then have two separate addressing schemes for the enduser that the cms may or may not directly associate internally calling where endusers can be connected without dialing nanp dn is considered part of cgvop service 3312 offnet calling offnet calling occurs when call either changes from packetmode to circuit mode involving wireline provider andor wireless service provider wsp or the network service provider changes at some point in the call examples of how these conditions can occur are as follows 1 the customer dials nanp dn and the call is directed to network element on the same service providers circuitswitched nonvop network this is an offnet call because the call changes from packetmode call to circuitmode call 2 the customer dials nanp dn and the call is directed to network element on another service providers circuitswitched network this is an offnet call because the call changes service provider and changes from packet mode to circuit mode 3 the customer dials nanp dn or signals another type of address eg session initiation protocol sip uniform resource locator url and the call is directed to another service providers network that is cgvop network this is an offnet call because different service providers are involved in general it will not be necessary for customers to dial an access code to egress their cgvop service providers network again most customers are likely to be unaware that their calls are processed and transported in cgvop

types of access figure 31 depicts typical cgvop network architecture and illustrates six common types of access to cgvop network this architecture is presented solely for illustrative purposes and is not intended to confine cgvop service to services based on this architecture figure 31 cgvop network architecture the following is brief generic description of each access type represented in figure

connectivity the fibercoax spectrum is broken down at the customer location using settop box or other equipment this provides access for analog cable television connectivity digital cable television connectivity and digital connectivity for internet access and voice services including cgvop service wireless connectivity depending on the spectrum allocated and the technology used wireless connectivity can include voice services highspeed data and internet access at the very least it provides cgvop service f ip phone connectivity direct digital packet connectivity is available from phone set that converts speech into digital packet signaling typically the ip phone accesses the cgvop network via xdsl hfc cable modem access or via customer lan as illustrated in figure 31 there is different cpe associated with each of the six types of access shown note that some cpe associated with each access method can at the customers option be used to make cgvop calls including voiceband voice calls voiceband facsimile calls and voiceband data calls some of this equipment can also be used to access other servicescapabilities beyond the voiceband eg dsl line or an hfc connection cgvop service as defined in this document is separate and distinct from these other services and capabilities outside of the voiceband range cgvop service must meet unique set of industrydefined quality reliability security and connectivity requirements that sets it apart from the other digital packet services to which the customer may have access the access gateway customer gateway cgw 6 and network mediation gateway nmgw7 shown in figure 31 can be separate piece of equipment or may be an integral part of other pieces of network equipment for access types and b the voice transmission for cgvop service enters the cgvop network via an access gateway component the access gateway converts the analog voice signal to digital packets for access types c through f the voice transmission for cgvop service is packetized by the customer gateway and enters the cgvop network through the network mediation gateway which is an optional gateway since some networks may not implement this function for access type f ip phone connectivity the equipment that performs this conversionpacketization is included as part of the cpe whenever conventional pstn phone is used to access the cgvop network equipment is needed somewhere outside of the telephone itself to perform this conversion this network equipment could take the form of an access gateway or another piece of cpe eg customer gateway as the pstn evolves toward network of interconnected vop components the conversion of voice to digital packets may come to reside fully outside of any formal network equipment components such as an access gateway 6 note that customer gateway is typically located at the customer premises in some cases it may be just outside of the customers premises in addition the cgw may be network owned or customer owned the decision of which approach is used is cgvop service provider policy 7 network mediation gateway is device that provides entry into the cgvop service providers network for call signaling traffic and voice media traffic an nmgw may provide some or all of the following functions enforcing traffic priority policy enforcing encoding policy providing conferencing capability providing networkbased call cutthrough and generating audible ringing for terminating calls cgvop service provider may or may not implement an nmgw u s government restricted for official use only electronic surveillance needs for cgvop service january 29 2003 36 fbi calea implementation u s government restricted for official use only 35 call processing in the cgvop network figure 31 also illustrates another distinctive technical characteristic of cgvop network this is the separation of callconnection management from media routingswitching it is the function of the cms to keep track of when call is made by subscriber and where that call is to terminate either onnet within the cgvop network boundaries or offnet somewhere in another network eg pstn once the cms has performed any call setup functions it turns over the functions of media transport and routing to other mediarelated network components the cms tracks active calls based on the last information it receives from the access gateway nmgw and signaling gateway the cms does not handle the actual communicationsmedia packets as they traverse the cgvop network it involves itself in the course of typical call only when features are invoked that require its call processing capabilities it is the job of the packet network to route the packets between the various gateways or ip phones in the case of access type f for cgvop service the cms typically performs the types of number translations that are performed in the pstn as examples the cms could translate tollfree number to routable number or speed dialing code eg 2 to the corresponding directory number the cms could also perform number translations that are specific to cgvop environment translation of an e164 number to technologyspecific identifier eg h323 address or sip url and the subsequent translation of this identifier to network address eg ip address is likely to become common with the introduction of enum e164 number databases 36 cpe capabilities in cgvop networks certain key functionality and features are or could be provided by cpe in traditional circuit switches the customers line is activated in the switching system when the service is initiated the line remains active ie it can make or receive calls until some work is done to deactivate the line in cgvop network there is concept of registration of the equipment making call with the cms it is possible that the registration with the cms is handled automatically by the cpe or by the network access equipment but this is not always the case therefore customers may have to proactively register their cpe with the cms before being able to make or receive calls cpe could also support features commonly provided by network components for example in the pstn when midcall service like threeway calling or call waiting is invoked circuit switching systems central processor gets involved with managing the second call and bridging the three parties together for threeway calling or toggling between calls for call waiting in cgvop network for access type and the low end of access types c d and f the cms or other centralized network component eg bridging server will perform the same functions that circuit switch does today because the cpe is not capable of performing these functions however for the other access types and for morecapable customer premisesbased equipment it is possible that the cpe will perform these functions and in such way that the cms will have specific knowledge that the use of the feature has taken place in the threeway calling example the cms will know about both calls but it may not know specifically that the two events are related to each other as threeway calling event in the call waiting example the cms will know about both calls but it may not know which call is currently active u s government restricted for official use only electronic surveillance needs for cgvop service january 29 2003 37 fbi calea implementation u s government restricted for official use only 37 interconnection to the pstn cgvop calls may be placed to and received from subscribers in the pstn this requires that cgvop networks be interconnected with the pstn currently this means interconnection to mostly circuitswitched networks under the fccs rules for interconnection of local telephone companies with long distance carriers every lec network is required to provide other interconnecting networks with very specific grade of service from an internetwork trunking perspective therefore cgvop network if considered lec network or an integral part of lecs network must provide managed network fully capable of sustainable and guaranteed level and quality of service qos that meets these fcc regulations this necessitates the presence of network management capabilities to ensure that the network meets industry and tariff standards and that the network does not fail or if it does fail does not propagate those failures to other interconnecting networks or into the pstn as whole therefore cgvop service providers build or lease transport and transmission facilities that allow their cgvop networks to meet these industry requirements since the level and quality of service on the public internet does not currently meet these industry requirements cgvop calls are considered to traverse only carrierprovided packetmode transport facilities and not the public internet 371 outgoing calls currently reaching dns served by other provider networks requires the cgvop network to interface with the circuitswitched pstn figure 31 illustrates that the cgvop network has two critical interfaces with the pstn the first interface is to the signaling gateway 8 that is used to set up calls directed out from the cgvop network to the pstn and those directed in for termination in the cgvop network the second interface is to the trunking gateway that carries the actual communications between the networks 372 incoming calls an offnet call incoming from noncgvop network is first detected at the signaling gateway call setup information type of communicationidentifying information passes from the signaling gateway to the cms the cms uses the nanp dn number it receives to identify its internal network address for that dn determines where the call should terminate commonly from registered address information and the characteristics of the connection and initiates ringing to alert the enduser of the incoming call when the voice content packets arrive at cgvop networks trunking gateway from the pstn the packets are converted from circuit mode to packet mode conversion of the voiceband transmission to packet transmission and connection to the end users cpe are the functions of the gateways and routers in the cgvop network as with outgoing calls the cms typically involves itself in an active call only when recognized feature is invoked by the end user 8 in some configurations signaling gateway and trunk gateway may be colocated eg in the case of an isdn primary rate interface pri or t1 trunk s upporting multifrequency mf signaling in some architectures associated with certain signaling protocols eg h323 and sip signaling gateway and trunking gateway are necessarily melded into single gateway in fact in this latter case the processing of signaling including the call control signaling is performed at the gateway u s

access to for cgvop service and addresses law enforcements needs regarding the state of the communication content 511 access to communication content when legally authorized law enforcement must have access to communication content for the intercept subjects use of cgvop service regardless of the service architecture used in the communication including cases where the communications between the intercept subject and associates are sent and received over separate channels or may be accessed at different iaps at different geographical locations in the service providers network accessible communications includes communications originated by terminating to and redirected by the intercept subjects equipment facilities or service including both twoparty and multiway communications law enforcement agencies need access to communication content when the intercept subjects communication stream is placed on hold during multiway communication but the remaining parties communications continue to be supported by the intercept subjects equipment facilities or service law enforcement needs continued access to the remaining parties communications as long as the carrier continues to carry the communications tofrom the intercept subjects equipment facilities or service r51 when law enforcement is legally authorized to access communication content for an intercept subject law enforcement requires access to the following communications when and for as long as the intercept subjects equipment facilities or service are involved in the communications communications originated by redirected by and terminated to the intercept subjects equipment facilities or service communications for twoparty calls and multiway calls including when the intercept subject places multiway call on hold to enable lea collection systems to identify cgvop communication content the unique identifier assigned to the communication content by the cgvop service provider must be provided with the content when the content is delivered in packetized form this would be the same identifier that is populated in the content identity information element for the corresponding content delivery start event see section 451 or content delivery change event see section 452 this unique identifier is used to distinguish between multiple communication content streams that are simultaneously delivered to

understand communication content transmitted by the cgvop service provider intercept subject communications are encoded and could also be compressed andor encrypted section 103b3 of calea addresses the obligation of service provider regarding encryption of intercept subject communications if the cgvop service provider provides or controls encoding compression andor encryption for the intercept subject or at least is knowledgeable of this processing the provider must either transmit the communication content in decoded decompressed andor decrypted form or provide the information eg encoding method compression method encryption keys needed by the lea collection system to perform this processing r53 when communication content is to be delivered to law enforcement when the cgvop service provider provides or controls encoding compression andor encryption for the intercept subjects communications or is knowledgeable of this processing law enforcement requires the cgvop service provider to either transmit the communication content toward the lea collection system in decoded decompressed andor decrypted form or to provide to the lea collection system the information necessary to decode decompress andor decrypt the communication content law enforcement prefers that the cgvop service provider perform any decoding decompression andor decryption prior to the transmission of communication content this preference is greater if proprietary or specialized encoding compression andor encryption had been used o19 with respect to r53 law enforcement desires the cgvop service provider to transmit the communication content toward the lea collection system in decoded decompressed andor decrypted form especially if the encoding compression andor encryption is proprietary or specialized if the cgvop service provider transmits the communication content toward the lea collection system in an encoded compressed andor encrypted form and the encoding compression andor encryption is proprietary the cgvop service provider needs to make the proprietary algorithms available to law enforcement licensing of proprietary algorithms is beyond the scope of this document and would be handled between law enforcement and the licensor 513 nonalteration of communication content it is paramount that the cgvop service provider ensures against alteration of communication content provider must not intentionally alter communication content other than what is necessary for delivery to law enforcement eg processing associated with the requirement contained in section 512 and the

arrange for this transmission r55 law enforcement requires the cgvop service provider to transmit communicationidentifying information and communication content toward the collection system designated by the particular lea 522 interface types to best ensure timely availability of electronic surveillance solutions for cgvop service it is highly desirable that standard costeffective and generally available interface types be employed for the delivery of communicationidentifying information and communication content o20 law enforcement desires that the facilities data communications protocols and data format used for the transmission of communicationidentifying information and communication content toward the lea collection system be standard cost effective and generally available it is highly desirable to law enforcement for cgvop service providers to reuse or reapply message formatting and encoding of communicationidentifying information from existing specifications furthermore it is highly desirable to minimize the number of physical transmission facilities used to transmit communicationidentifying information and communication content toward the lea collection system the intention is to consolidate the number of interfaces with which law enforcement will need to comply o21 law enforcement desires that cgvop service providers reuse or reapply message formatting and encoding definitions when appropriate from existing relevant specifications for the transmission of communicationidentifying information toward the lea collection system o22 law enforcement desires

for certain cgvop electronic surveillance solutions several different types of iaps may be involved in accessing communicationidentifying information and communication content the communications may be accessed not only at different iaps but possibly also at different geographical locations within the service providers network in these cases law enforcement would prefer connection from single centralized delivery system to the collection system rather than connections from each iap involved in the surveillance 53 security of communicationidentifying information and communication content it is vital that the cgvop service provider take measures to protect the communication identifying information and communication content as it is being transported to ensure security and integrity these measures must include separation of the informationcontent from public communications if any part of cgvop service providers implementation uses network resources also used to support subscribers traffic and should include encryption of the informationcontent using suitable commercially available keyexchange protocols and encryption algorithms this encryption is for securing the communicationidentifying information and communication content while it is being transported it is not related to any necessary decryption of communication content resulting from the original encryption of the communications by the intercept subject andor associate cr1 if any part of cgvop service providers implementation uses network resources that are also used to support subscribers traffic ie shared network resources law enforcement requires the communicationidentifying information and communication content to be logically physically or otherwise separated and protected from access by the service providers subscribers co1 if shared network resources are to be used for the transmission of communicationidentifying information and communication content toward an lea collection system law enforcement desires that the communicationidentifying information and communication content be encrypted for transmission toward the lea collection system using suitable commercially available keyexchange protocols and encryption algorithms cgvop service providers are not expected to ensure level of security for laes beyond the capabilities of their own equipment 54

part of servicelevel agreements however cgvop service could also be offered with grades of reliability such that there are assurances provided for connection establishment or successful delivery of user packets to their intended destination in these latter cases the cgvop network does not make any assurances on the quality or reliability of the service offered to the subscriber the required level of reliability of surveillances of the intercept subjects communications is dependent on the level of reliability provided for cgvop service r59 when the cgvop network assures the reliability of the intercept subjects service law enforcement requires the reliability of the surveillance of the intercept subjects communications to be at least equal to the reliability of the intercept subjects service r60 when the cgvop network does not assure the reliability of the intercept subjects service law enforcement requires the reliability of the surveillance of the intercept subjects communications to be higher than the reliability of the intercept subjects service regardless of the level of reliability of the intercept subjects service the transmission of communicationidentifying information and communication content toward leas must be reliable r61 law enforcement requires that the transmission of communication identifying information and communication content toward lea collection systems be reliable cgvop service providers must prevent disruption or termination of laes law enforcement needs cgvop service providers to establish plans for ensuring that system upgrades software upgrades and other network management procedures do not disrupt or terminate ongoing laes 6112 fault management fault management capabilities are needed to detect and resolve problems

quality of service refers to the quality of the communications channel or system used to transmit communicationidentifying information and communication content toward the lea collection system for example quality of service may be measured based on quantitative factors such as packet loss bit error rate or any other parameter used to measure communications quality r62 law enforcement requires cgvop service providers to achieve quality of service for transmission of communicationidentifying information and communication content toward lea collection systems that is compliant with the qualityofservice standards of the cgvop service provider for the cgvop service 62 security and integrity adequate security and integrity are achieved through transparency of surveillances protection
