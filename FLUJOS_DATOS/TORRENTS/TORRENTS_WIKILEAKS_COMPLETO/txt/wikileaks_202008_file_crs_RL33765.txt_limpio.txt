2008 garrett l hatch analyst in government organization and management government and finance division ombs financial management line of business fmlob initiative background issues and observations summary federal financial management systems generate the information that is used by government officials to manage and oversee agency programs and operations concerns about the quality of agency financial information and about the costs of operating and modernizing the systems that produce it have prompted number of systems improvement initiatives in recent years one such effort the financial management line of business fmlob seeks to improve the cost quality and performance of government financial systems by consolidating agency core systems functions at limited number of thirdparty shared service providers ssps and by standardizing the related business processes governmentwide as part of the initiative the office of management and budget omb in 2006 directed all federal agencies needing to upgrade or modernize their financial management systems either to transfer their core financial functions to an ssp seek designation as an ssp or to prove that they can operate their inhouse systems with less risk and at lower cost than an ssp agencies that undergo migration must in most cases select their ssps through competitions between public and private organizations ombs guidance also requires all agencies eventually to adopt governmentwide business and accounting practices which are under development in fmlob workgroups it is widely acknowledged that consolidation and standardization might improve the cost and quality of agency financial data proponents suggest that the sooner agencies move to ssps the sooner the government might enhance its efficiency and capacity for oversight concerns have been expressed however by both public and private sector observers that the initiative is moving too fast and that important issues surrounding the transition to shared service providers have not been adequately addressed critics argue that migration should be delayed until agencies have strengthened their internal controls fully evaluated the qualifications of potential ssps and educated their personnel about the initiative evidence from previous systems modernization efforts suggests that these issues might put the fmlob at increased risk for cost overruns schedule delays and problems with the accuracy of the data after implementation effective congressional oversight of agency programs and operations is dependent in part on the availability of timely and accurate financial data congress has invested billions of dollars in systems modernization projects in recent years but these efforts have not consistently yielded significant improvements in the information they produce the house subcommittee on government management finance and accountability has held several hearings on the initiative although bills have been introduced this report

fmlob initiative background issues and observations introduction each year the federal government spends billions of dollars implementing operating and modernizing agency financial management systems1 financial systems are vital to the effective management and oversight of public funds because the information they provide is used by government officials to make decisions about agency programs and operations for example federal managers use financial data to monitor contract costs measure program performance and identify improper payments when agency financial systems provide inaccurate or incomplete data the government might be less able to operate at maximum efficiency and the risk of waste fraud and abuse arguably increases for example gao has reported that financial management deficiencies at the department of defense dod have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in over and underpayments to contractors and contributed to dods high rate of travel card delinquency2 significant financial management weaknesses can be found throughout the government and according to gao most agency financial systems are unable to routinely produce reliable useful and timely information3 in order to improve the quality of financial data available to government officials congress has funded number of financial management improvement initiatives such initiatives by their nature are often complex and entail degree of risk the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for example spent 180 million on two failed efforts to modernize its financial systems and nasas third such attempt currently underway will cost an additional 983 million4 similarly problems with inaccurate data led the department of veterans 1 chief financial officers cfo council and joint

financial systems the financial management line of business fmlob initiative was launched by the office of management and budget omb in 20046 based on the recommendations of an interagency task force the fmlob proposed that the government move to shared services model of financial management whereby agencies would transfer their core financial system functions such as accounting payments and reporting to governmentwide shared service providers ssps7 outsourcing administrative and financial operations to thirdparty service providers is common practice in the private sector and it has already been employed by the federal government in some instances8 the national finance center for example component of the us department of agriculture usda currently provides payroll and personnel services for 120 federal organizations across the three branches of government9 according to omb the use of ssps will enhance the timeliness and accuracy of financial information while reducing the costs associated with operating and modernizing agency financial systems10 several departments and agencies have already begun making plans to migrate core functions to ssps including the department of labor the department of commerce usda and the environmental protection agency omb has estimated that remaining agencies will follow suit within the next seven or eight years11 while the objective of moving to shared services environment is widely supported in principle range of public and private sector observers has expressed concern that the initiative is moving too fast critics say that the capabilities of some ssps have not been adequately demonstrated that internal control problems should be addressed prior to migrating core financial systems and agencies need time to prepare their

timely and accurate financial data which are needed for effective oversight of agency programs and operations as previously noted however modernization initiatives require substantial funding and often fail to produce the intended results the house subcommittee on government management finance and accountability has held several hearings on the initiative although bills have been introduced this report provides background information on the fmlobs origins and goals and presents the arguments of supporters and critics of the initiative finally it discusses options regarding future implementation background in the spring of 2004 omb launched series of interagency task forces to determine if services commonly found in numerous agencies called lines of business might be provided in more efficient manner12 the financial management task force determined that significant savings over 10year period were possible if the government consolidated agency financial systems and standardized the related business processes13 in order to realize these savings the task force recommended that the government establish centralized shared service providers ssps to which agencies would transfer their core financial management functions rather than invest in modernizing existing agency systems14 12 omb presidential initiatives at httpwwwwhitehousegovombegov cpresidentialhtml in

case that outlined the shared services concept and its expected benefits15 the business case called for consolidating agency financial systems into smaller number of governmentwide ssps each of which

referred to both ombdesignated federal agencies and private contractors in the migration planning guidance the term shared service provider ssp is used instead in an email to the author ombs legislative affairs office said the term center of excellenceapplies only to those agencies designated by omb to act as service providers crs5 for doing so as part of their fy2006 budget submissions18 omb then evaluated the business cases using due diligence checklist that assessed agencies past performance current capabilities skill to operate customerfocused organization and adherence to federal policy and regulations19 based on these evaluations omb designated four agencies as federal ssps the bureau of the public debts administrative resource center the department of the interiors national business center the department of transportations enterprise service center and the general service administrations external services division only these agencies are permitted to compete with private firms for fmlob contracts migration planning guidance in order to explain the initiative to federal agencies and help them prepare for the transition to shared services environment omb released version 1 of its migration planning guidance in september 200620 key provisions of the guidance are outlined below goals the stated objective of the fmlob is to improve the cost quality and performance of government financial management systems by utilizing shared service providers and implementing other governmentwide reforms specific goals of the initiative include providing timely and accurate data for decision making strengthening internal controls providing competitive alternative for agencies to acquire develop implement and operate financial systems through shared services standardizing business systems processes and data elements and providing seamless data exchange between agencies timing with limited exception the guidance requires that when an agency identifies need to upgrade or modernize its core financial system it must at that time either select an ssp or become designated as federal ssp itself omb maintains that this policy enables the government to avoid investments on inhouse agency systems that would eventually be replaced by more cost effective shared service providers an agency may continue to operate its inhouse system without being designated as federal ssp only if it can demonstrate that doing so is better 18 omb presidential initiatives at httpwwwwhitehousegovombegov c62financialhtml 19 ibid 20 memorandum from linda combs omb controller to

agencies to move to ssps within the next seven to eight years21 competition the guidance stated that all agencies are required to conduct publicprivate competitions when selecting an ssp unless omb grants deviation additionally when publicprivate competitions involve work performed by more than 10 fulltime employees those competitions are required to follow omb circular a76 which establishes governmentwide guidelines for opening federal jobs to private bids the guidance makes a76 optional for competitions involving work performed by 10 or fewer fulltime agency employees standardization and transparency the fmlob includes an effort to establish standardized business practices that all agencies would eventually adopt for example it is developing standard processes for core financial management functions such as payments and reporting which would make it easier for agencies to share data the fmlob has also developed standard government accounting code which was released in july 200722 in january 2008 memorandum omb stated that agencies are required to adopt the new business standards when they migrate to ssps23 there is also an effort to increase transparency by developing series of financial system performance metrics which omb says would make it easier for agencies to compare the performance of inhouse and ssp financial systems outstanding issues omb said it intends to update the guidance to provide more complete information on policy issues that remain under consideration including 1 arbitration of bid and contract disputes between federal agencies 2 screening and evaluation of ssps 3 partnership agreements between federal ssps and private firms and 4 and instructions for smaller agencies on migration competitions relationship to other financial management

24 agencies covered by the act were in substantial compliance finding gao called significant challenge to improving the management of government26 omb has stated that by moving some agencies to ssps and standardizing financial processes across the government the fmlob will help agencies select and implement ffmiacompliant financial systems27 omb also stated that it worked with agencies to align the goals of the fmlob with the standards of success defined in the presidents management agenda pma28 the pma is series of governmentwide and programspecific initiatives designed to improve the most apparent deficiencies in government management and performance29 according to omb the fmlob and the pma are aligned in two ways first the overarching objective of the fmlob is ensuring that federal managers have accurate and timely financial information for decision making which is also one of the standards for success comprising the improved financial performance initiative of the pma30 in addition omb has stated that the fmlob supports the pma goal of expanding electronic government although it did not reference any specific points where the two initiatives overlap31 support and

httpwwwwhitehousegovombegov c62financialhtml crs8 qualified however by concerns over the pace of implementation which is already underway at several agencies by the time omb released the migration planning guidance in september 2006 the department of labor had awarded contract to private firm for hosting components of its financial system the department of commerce had announced plans to begin consolidating its financial management platforms the office of personnel management had selected the bureau of public debt as its ssp and the environmental protection agency had begun evaluating proposals for software integration and hosting services32 some observers say that the initiative given its scope and complexity is moving too quickly and that agency migration efforts should be delayed in order to reduce the risk of costly mistakes33 survey of chief financial officers cfos and other federal financial managers for example found almost opposition to using ssps in principle so long as the quality of service and the cost of migration met expectations34 the survey also revealed that one of the greatest fears of agency officials was that they would invest millions of dollars into migrating to ssps only to discover that their service provider was not capable of delivering the promised services one reason for this concern was that some of the designated federal ssps were components of departments that were themselves not ffmia compliant35 some managers also suggested that small agencies those with budget of less than 100 million might realize greater gains in efficiency from migrating to ssps than larger agencies overall respondents said that they wanted more evidence of the capabilities of potential ssps more guidance on agency recourse should an ssp fail to meet performance expectations and more time to consider their options before migrating similarly report by the national academy of public administration napa endorsed the objectives of the fmlob while expressing concerns about its implementation in the report which was prepared at the request of the house subcommittee on government management finance and accountability napa stated that the move to shared services environment makes great deal of sense citing its potential to reduce operating costs and free agency cfos and their staff to focus on core program activities36 many of the cfos interviewed for the report were however concerned about moving core accounting and reporting functions outside their purview an opinion that napa shared37 the report also said that economies of scale

discussion and analysis of these issues private sector observers have also offered qualified support for the initiative at fmlob hearings held in march 2006 stan soloway the president of the professional services council psc called the strategic underpinnings of the initiative sound and rational the right thing to do38 he cautioned however that the benefits of shared services might not be realized if agency leadership and staff are not involved and fully invested in the initiative additionally he questioned whether sufficient attention had been paid to the need for the fmlob to connect with other lines of business particularly the human resources line of business hrlob where travel systems will need to interface with financial systems if poor planning causes the government to change its requirements during implementation soloway said then the costs of the initiative might rise pricewaterhousecooper partner joe kull also testified at the march 2006 hearings39 kull former omb deputy controller said agencies should not be required to meet an arbitrary timeframe for implementation asserting that government projects like fmlob have often failed because agencies had not invested sufficient resources in educating training and communicating with employees about the initiative kull also said that it was critical for agencies to improve their internal controls prior to migration even though those improvements might take several years because core systems are only as good as the data flowing into them agency financial systems would thus continue to be limited by weak internal controls even after migration and presumably those problems would be more difficult to correct when core functions were hosted by third party one union the american federation of government employees afge has strongly criticized the initiative largely over ombs policy on the application of circular a76 to migration competitions as previously discussed agencies are only required to follow the provisions of a76 when migrating more than 10 fulltime positions to an ssp and a76 is optional when 10 or fewer fulltime employees are involved in hearings on the fmlob held in june 2006 the afge argued that by making a76 optional in some cases agencies were in effect authorized to transfer federal jobs to private contractors without giving agency employees the opportunity to compete for them practice called direct conversion40 an omb official said 38 testimony of professional services council president stan soloway in us congress house committee on government reform subcommittee on

committee on government reform subcommittee on government management finance and accountability ombs financial management line of business initiative do recent changes to the implementation guidance clarify the continued crs10 the afge had misinterpreted the policy stating that while a76 is optional in some instances publicprivate competition is required for every migration regardless of the number of employees involved41 ombs migration planning guidance released three months after the hearings clarifies this point explicitly stating that direct conversions are not authorized42 concluding observations observers generally agree that there are potential benefits to moving agency core financial systems to shared service providers including reduced costs and enhanced data for use in decision making the crux of the fmlob debate is not whether consolidation should take place but when omb argues migration should proceed as soon as agencies identify need to upgrade their systems while critics say migration should not take place until potential risks have been adequately addressed this does not mean however that the only available options are to proceed with implementation full speed ahead or bring it to standstill two additional considerations are described below standardization and transparency as previously noted the fmlob has undertaken three efforts in addition to migration that might improve federal financial management work on these lessvisible initiatives developing performance metrics standardizing business processes and implementing the new government wide accounting code might continue independently of any migration timetable in this way the government would have the earliest opportunity to realize the potential benefits of these efforts such as an improved ability to compare financial data across agencies pilot projects migration to ssps might be initiated through pilot project it is not uncommon for largescale management reform initiatives to begin with pilot projects typically pilot project is launched as way to observe the change process under controlled circumstances the agencies involved could be limited in number and carefully chosen implementation could be closely managed and the consequences could be analyzed and discussed by the initiatives stakeholders the results of pilot project might lead to changes in the larger implementation process in order to maximize the likelihood of success 40 continued rules hearings 109th cong 2nd sess june 28 2006 prior to 2003 agencies could convert public jobs to the private sector without holding publicprivate competition direct conversions were eliminated in the 2003 revisions to a76 41 daniel pulliam guidelines for financial consolidation draw fire govexeccom sept 25

fsio_fmlob_mpg_v1shtml crs11 some have argued that pilot project is unnecessary because ssps have already demonstrated their ability to successfully host agency core financial systems not all agencies however appear to share this view in an interview with government computer news the deputy chief financial officer at the department of education noted that some large agencies are hesitant to migrate because they dont see any real examples of sharedservices provider handling large external customer that has tremendous amount of volume and complexity in their financial business processes43 large agencies might also be concerned about migrating to an ssp after the office of personnel management opm cancelled its sharedservices contract in 2005 opm signed contract with an ssp selecting the bureau of public debts administrative resource center arc in 2006 opm cancelled the contract after determining that the arc could not meet its service requirements the following year another large agency usda signed 1026 million contract with accenture private sector ssp to consolidate and modernize its financial management systems44 the migration process at usda might be closely observed by those federal financial managers who are unsure whether it is feasible and desirable for large agencies to shift core financial operations to an ssp 43 mary mosquera the big issue for fmlob small
