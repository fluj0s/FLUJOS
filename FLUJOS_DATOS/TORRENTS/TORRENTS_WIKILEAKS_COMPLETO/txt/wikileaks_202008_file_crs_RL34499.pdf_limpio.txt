congress adrienne l fernandes domestic social policy division september 5 2008 abstract this report begins with discussion of the characteristics of older foster youth in care and the types of outcomes experienced by youth who have recently emancipated the report then provides an overview of the federal foster care system including the chafee foster care independence program and provisions in federal foster care law that are intended to help prepare youth for adulthood the report goes on to discuss other federal support through other programs for youth aging out of care in the areas of education health care employment and housing the report seeks to understand how states vary in their approaches to serving older youth in care and those who are recently emancipated small number of states are known to extend foster care to youth ages 18 to 21 and beyond in some cases and less than half of states provide medicaid coverage to former foster youth beyond age 18 through the chafee pathway option the report also intends to demonstrate that despite negative outcomes for the group on average many former foster youth are engaged in decisions about the services they receive and display resiliency the report concludes with discussion of issues that congress may wish to consider as well as pending legislation relevant to each of the issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34499 order

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34499youth transitioning from foster care background federal programs and issues for congress summary nearly half of states have laws that explicitly permit the state child welfare system to continue providing foster car for children beyond the age of majority usually later than 19 however the number of states that actually facilitate youth remaining in care beyond their 18th or 19th birthdays is significantly smaller over 20000 young people have been eman cipated from foster care annually from fy2002 thr ough fy2006 while most young people have access to emotional and financial support systems throughout their ear ly adult years older youth in care and those who age out of care often face obstacl to developing i ndependent living skills and building supports that ease the trans ition to adulthood older foster youth who return to their parents or guardians may continue to experience poor family dynamics or lack of emotional nd financial supports and studi have shown that recently emancipated foster youth fare poorly rela tive to their counterparts in the general population on several outcome measures recognizing the difficulties faced by olde r youth in care and youth emancipating from foster care congress created new independent living initiative pl 99272 in 1986 to assist certain older foster yout h as they enter adulthood the legislation authorized mandatory funding to states under new section 477 of the social security act in 1999 the john h chaf ee foster care independence act pl 106 169 replaced the independent living program with the chafee foster care independence program cfcip and doubled th total annual funds available to states from 70 million to 140 million the law also expanded the population of youth eligible to receive indepe ndent living services with lower age limit and gave states greater flexibility in designing independent living programs independent living services can refer to assistance in obt aining high school diploma training in daily living skills and training in financial management among other services amendments to the cfcip in fy2002 p l 107133 authorized discretionary funding for states to provide education nd training vouchers to eligible youth along with the cfcip federal child welf are law and other federal programs are intended to help older current youth in care and foster care alumni make the transition to adulthood the federal foster care program has protections in place to ensure that older youth in care have written case plan that addresses the programs and services that will assist in this tran sition among other supports further federal law authorizes funding for states to provide workforce assistance and housing to older foster youth despite these efforts and the resilience displayed by current and former foster youth policymakers and child welfare practitioners have suggested that at minimum young people need better s upport to build stronger connections with caring adults before leaving foster care nd should have the option to remain in care upon reaching their 18th or 19th birthdays several bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that propose greater assistance to older youth in foster car and those who have aged out including legislation to provide federa l foster care assistance for youth age 18 and older

at least some time in foster care during their teenage years on the last day of fy2006 over 176800 youth ages 13 to 17 comprised more than one third of the foster care caseload nationally1 most teenagers who leave foster care are reunified with th eir parents or primary caretakers adopted or placed with relatives yet as many as 26000 youth age out or are emancipated from care each year when they reach the age of majority in their states usually later than age 192 youth who spend their teenage years in foster care and those who are likely to age out of care face challenges as they m ove to early adulthood while in care they may forego opportunities to velop strong support networ ks and independent living skills that their counterparts in the gene ral population might more naturally acquire even older foster youth who return to their parents or guardians can still face obstacles such as poor family dynamics or lack of emotional and financial supports that hinder their ability to achieve their goals as young adults perhaps the strongest evidence that youth who have spent at least some years in care during adolescence have not adequate ly made the transition to young adulthood is their poor outcomes across number of domains during their early adult years these youth are much more likely than their peers to forego higher education describe their general health as fair or poor become homeless and rely on public supports the federal government has recognized that older youth in care and those aging out are vulnerable to negative outcomes and may ultimately return to the care of the state as adults either through the public welfare criminal justice or other s upport systems in 1986 congress passed legislati on to assist certain older youth in care under new independent living program enacted as part of pl 99272 the legislation authorized mandatory funding to states under sec tion 477 of the social security act and was made permanent in 1993 as part of pl

time in care as teenagers characteristics of youth in foster care the foster care dynamics report l ongitudinal study of children in 11 state child welfare systems from 2000 through 2005 provides detailed information about older youth who have been placed in foster care3 the study examined state administrative data to determine the typical trajectory of children across four age categories who first entered foster care during the fiveyear period less than age one one through five six through12 and 13 th rough 17 the study found that teenagers make up significant share of the foster care population have s horter median lengths of stay relative to younger children liv in placements other than foster family homes experience more placements in their first year in care than younger children and most often exit care through reunifica tion although running away and reaching the age of majority are exit pathways fo r about 10 to 24 of these older youth depending on their age from 2000 through 2005 about 350000 children entered care in the 11 states of whom 27 were teenagers ages 13 through 17 youth in the age 13 through 17 category comprised the second largest share of

children were moved within their first six months in foster care however greater share of teenagers experienced multiple placements within their fi rst six months of entering care about 18 of youth ages 13 through 17 had two or more placements compared with 12 to 16 of children in other age categories teenagers were also more likely to move to new living arrangements in the six to twelve months after entering care while older youth in care had shorter median length of stay than younger children in care this median ngth of stay increased over the fiveyear period the median lengths of stay fo

teenagers were less likely to be adopted or placed with relatives as they got older and were more likely to run away and exit by reaching the age of majority or some other pathway such as independent living with the exception of 17yearolds about the same share of teenag ers were reunified as children ages three to 12 onethird to 46 of youth ages 13 through 17 exited to reunification the balance of

afford to live on their own or are unable to live with relatives or friends upon emancipation in most states youth may not remain in foster care beyond age 18 time when most young people explore educational and career options research on the transition for former foster youth is limited and most of the studies on outcomes for these youth face thodological challenges they tend to be dated include brief followup periods eg more than year after exit from care have low response rates nonrepresen tative samples and small sample sizes and do not follow youth prior to exit from foster care6 few studies include comparison groups to gauge how well these youth are transitioning to adulthood in relation to their peers in the foster care population or gene ral population however two studies the northwest foster care alumni study and the midwest evaluation of the adult functioning of former fost er youth have tracked outcomes for sample of youth across severa l domains either prospectively following youth in care and as they age out or retrospectively examining current outcomes for young adults who were in care at least few years ago and comparing these outcomes to other groups of youth either those who aged out andor youth in the general population both studies indicate that youth who spent time in foster care during their teenage years tended to have difficulty during the transition to adulthood and beyond the studies do not posit that foster care per is associated with the challenges former foster youth face in adulthood in fact children tend to have range of challenges upon entering care7 the midwest evaluation has examined the extent to which outcomes in early adulthood are in fluenced by the individual characteristics of youth or their outofhome care

years in fy2006 for foster youth nationwide11 surveyed young adults experienced these outcomes even though most 836 reported having access to lot of child welfare services and supports and about eight out of ten 815 said that they felt loved while in care these findings suggest that confluence of factors including the reasons they entered care family dynamics and access to services and supports before and after care among many other variables have likely influenced how we ll they function as adults the study compared the mental health status educational attainment and employment and finances

three data collection waves at wave 1 when they were age 17 or 18 at which time most were in care at wave 2 when they were ages 19 or 20 at which time some remained in care and at wave 3 when they were ages 20 or 21 and longer in care of those who remained in care beyond age 18 all were in illinois the only state of the three that retains court jurisdiction of foster youth with the youths

services health education services and outh development services16 at wave 2 not more than half of the youth in care reported receiving at least one independent living service17 at wave 3 receipt of

third wave about onet hird had left foster care within the previous 12 months and another onethird had left care in the past three to four years the balance of youth had left care one to three years

disagreed or strongly disagreed about the same proportions of youth reported feeling satisfied with their experiences in foster care youth were also asked about receipt of independent living services across six domains education vocational training or employment budgeting and financial management health education housing and youth development such as conferences and leadership development activities for each of the domains about onethird of the youth or less reported having received relevant services since th wave 2 study and more than one third reported having received relevant services since they were discharged from care the researchers speculated that the services were available but that the young adults did not perceive need for the services or were unable to access them httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34499crs9 19 the add health sampled young adults from across the country the majority about 75 of whom were white data from the add health survey were collected three to four years before wave 3 of the midwest evaluation as result data on earnings and income have been adjusted by the consumer price index cpi for comparison purposesat ages 21 or 22 most youth reported st rong family ties w ith 94 having said that they felt somewhat or very close to at least one biological family member the greatest shares of youth reported feeling very close to their siblings followed by another relative aunt uncle or cousin grandparent biological mother and biological father the survey ed youth were most likely to be in daily contact in this order with their siblings biological mother grandparents and other relatives overall more than half of all youth perceived that some or most of the time they had social supports such as someone to listen to him or her 661 to help with favors 592 to loan money 503 and to encourage his or her goals 536 emancipated youth compared to youth in care at midwest evaluation wave 3 findings from wave 3 of the midwest evaluation suggest that youth who remain in care as late as age 20 tend to experience an easier transition to adulthood than their counterparts who eman cipate at age 18 the study found that the young adults from illinois who were more likely to remain in care than youth in wisconsin and iowa were almost two times as likely to have ever attended college than their peers in the other two states and were more likely to have higher earnings and delayed pregnancy see the last sec tion of this report for further information youth at midwest evaluation wave 3 compared to youth age 21 generally for each of the three data

have been primarily responsible for providing child welfare services to families and children that need them while in outofhome foster care the state child welfare agency under the supervision of the court and in consultation with the parents or primary caretakers in some cases serves as the childs parent and makes decisions on his or her behalf that are to promote his or her safety permanence and wellbeing safety refers to the state child welfare systems goal of ensuring that children in foster care are protected from further abuse or neglect permanence refers to the states goal of ensuring that children do not spend too many of their formative years in foster care placement and that the state either returns them to their families quickly and safely or quickly finds another safe and permanent home for them well being is inextricably linked to safety and permanency the term refers to efforts by the child welfare system to promote positive outcomes for children in care including education and physical and mental health outcomes as well as supportive families in most cases the state relies on public and private entiti and organizations to provide these services the federal government plays role in shaping state child welfare systems by providing funds and linking those funds to certain requirements two programs under title ive of the so cial security act may provide

senator jay rockefeller described the intent of the legislation youths need for family does not nd at any particular age each of us can clearly recall times when we have had to turn to our own families for advice comfort or support long after our 18th or 21st birthdays many of us are still in the role of providing such support to our own children who are in their late teens or 20s therefore an important provisi on in this senate version of the foster care independence act states that inde pendent living il programs are not alternatives to permanency planningyoung people of all ages need and deserve every possible effort made towards perm anence including adoption it would be counterproductive to create any disinc entive for adoption of teenagers37 youth aging out of foster care prior to the enactment of the cfcip states had the option to serve young people who had emancipated from care until age 21 the chafee foster care independence act requires states that receive cfcip funds to provide independent living servi ces to youth who have aged out of care between the ages of 18 through 21 according to hhss child welfare policy manual this requirement does not preclude stat from

by representative jd hayworth during debate of the house version of pl 106169 hr 1802 in june 1999 when he said that tribes are in the best position to identify the needs of tribal yout h and local resources available for these young people42 although tribal entities may not receive direct reimbursement from the federal government for foster care and related costs on behalf of title ive eligible children and must enter into intergovernmental agreem ents with states to receive this funding tribes are not required to have entered into title ive agreement43 with the state to participate in

demonstrated because the cfcip lacked longterm performance measures and time frames for these measures as well as adequate progre ss in achieving its annual performance goals and because some states did not use all of their cfcip or etv funding omb made the determination about the performance measurem ent because the national youth in transition database which will provide longterm performance and annual performance measurement beginning in fy2011 had not yet been implemented the part review also found that independent evaluations of the program have been routinely conducted while the

their 18th birthdays under certain conditions such as the youth attending college or university see appendix b and appendix c yet few states appear to actually facilitate youth staying in care in light of the negative outcomes that young people often experience upon emancipating polic ymakers and child welfare practitioners have raised concerns about policies requiring youth to leave foster care custody on their 18th birthday on july 12 2007 the subcommittee on income security and family support of the house ways and m eans committee held hearing to highlight the challenges youth aging out of care face as they transition to adulthood111 the witnesses child welfare practitioners and researchers and youth explained that foster care services end abruptly for many older youth in care when they reach age 18 one practitioner said that county child we lfare agency has begun buying luggage for youth aging out to replace the garbage bags they were using to haul their few belongings he went on to say that this practice is merely bandaid and does not address the bigger issue that youth ofte n lack housing and other support upon aging out of care extending federal foster care beyond ag 18 might raise concerns that youth would be more ready at age 21 than at age 18 to emancipate and that even if given the option to stay in care youth may welcome the opportunity to be on their own another related concern is that extending federal foster care maintenance payments may encourage youth to rely on the state fo r basic supportive services and not develop adequate independent living skills the limited research on youth who remain in care after their 18th birthday suggests that the benefits of remaining in care likely outweigh the drawbackshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34499crs44 112 iowa amended its child welfare statute in 2006 to create program that provides continuing support to foster youth ages 18 to 21 the iowa youth in the midwest study were already too old to benefit from

of publicly operated facilities they may not have more than 25 bedsfindings from wave 3 of the midwest eval uation see above for more information suggests that youth who remain in care as late as age 20 tend to experience an easier transition to adulthood than their counterpa rts who emancipate at age 18 the study examined outcomes for former foster youth in three states illinois iowa and wisconsin these three states offer natural experiment for comparing youth outcomes iowa and wisconsin emancipated n early all of the foster youth in the study by age 21 while approximately threefourths of foster youth in illinois who reached age 18 in care remained under the custody of the state until age 21112 the study found that the young adults from illinois were almost two times as likely to have ever attended college than their peers in iowa and wisconsin and after controlling for observed differences ie gender raceethnicity age at most recent entry into care number of prior placements among other ch aracteristics illinois youth were four times as likely to have ever attended college and approx imately 35 times as likely to complete one year of college113 further remaining in care appears to be associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy the study found that wh ile the young people in illinois were less likely to be employed due likely to being in school each additional year in care after age 18 was associated with 470 increase in annual earnings annual earnings for youth who remained in care longer incr eased by 924 after controlling for certain characteristics of the young adults measured at baseline that are likely to affect later earnings eg work history education ttainment mental health problems and criminal behavior as well as unobserved ch aracteristics further young people in illinois were 38 less likely to become pr egnant between ages 17 and 19 although there was reduction in the risk of pregnancy after age 19 for youth in care compared to their counterparts this difference was not statistically significant eligible placement setting extending federal foster care for youth age 18 and older raises the question about whether states should be reimbursed for youth who do not live in traditional foster care settings state may only claim some federal reimbursement for foster care maintenance payments made on behalf of child if that child is placed in an eligible setting s ection 472a2c under current law this is defined to include licensed foster family home or childcare institution including group homes or other

foster youth pay his or her rent115 yet many older foster youth even those who remain in state care do not live with foster family or in child care institution but instead live in supervised independent living quarters or with relatives the midwest evaluation of the adult func tioning of former foster youth study found that at age 19 half 50 of the surv eyed youth some of whom were in foster care lived in supervised independent livin g settings about 20 lived in foster family homes and 19 lived with relatives the remainder lived in group quarters 7 or other settings 4116 judicial
