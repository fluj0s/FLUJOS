availability of energy especially gasoline and other liquid fuels played critical role in world war ii another ergyrelated factor wa s the application of research and development rd to the atomic bomb and othe r military technologies during the post world war ii era the federa l government began to apply rd to the peacetime development of energy sources to support economic growth at that time the primary rd focus was on fossil fuels and new forms of energy derived from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion from fy1948 through fy1977 the federal g overnment provided an extensive amount of rd support for fossil energy and nuclear power technologies1 t t l spending on fossil energy technologies ove r that period amounted to about 154 billion in constant fy2008 dollars the federa l government spent about 464 billion in constant fy2008 dollars during that period fo r nuclear fission and nuclear fusion energy rd2 the energy crises of the 1970s spurred th federal government to expand its rd programs to include renewabl wind solar biomass geot hermal hydro energy and energy efficiency technologie s modest efforts to suppor t renewable energy and energy efficiency began during the early 1970s from fy1973 through fy1977 the federal government spent about 15 billion in c onstant fy2008 dollars on renewable energy rd 140 million on energy efficiency rd and 170 million on electric systems rd3 the department of energy was established by law in 1977 all of the energy rd programs fossil nuclear re newable and energy effici ency were brought under its administration doe also undertook small pr ogram in energy storage and electricity system rd that supports the four main energy technology programs4 does funding support for those technologies began in fy 1978 funding for all four of the main technologies skyrocketed in itially and then fell drama tically in the early 1980shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22858crs3 table 1 doe energy technology cumulative funding totals
