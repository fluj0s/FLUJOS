stop iranian proliferation concerned about tsa regulations classified by ambassador james b smith reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary saudi foreign ministry officials told visiting nea as feltman that they are convinced iran intends to develop nuclear weapon and that the saudi foreign minister pressed his counterpart hard for greater chinese engagement on this threat during the chinese fms visit earlier in january while explicit deal was discussed saudi arabia made it clear it was willing to address chinese concerns on energy security and trade in exchange for effective chinese support to prevent iranian proliferation saudi arabia is also concerned about irans unhelpful role in yemen while generally very pleased with the state of bilateral relations saudi officials strenuously and under instruction complained about the continued negative effect of the recent transportation safety administration tsa regulations that call for extra security screening for saudi arabia the saudi foreign minister will raise these concerns with the secretary in london on january 27 they noted that the saudi public is increasingly upset by this and does not understand why they were put in the same group with cuba which has prompted some saudis to question how special their relationship with the united states really is as feltman urged saudi arabia to associate itself with the copenhagen accord by january 31 the mfa reported that saudi arabia donated 50 million for haitian relief efforts on january 25 end summary iranian nuclear ambitions 2 c visiting nea as feltman discussed wide range of issues with deputy saudi foreign minister dr prince torki alsaud alkabir on january 26 prince torki said saudi arabia is convinced that iran intends to develop nuclear weapons and reported that saudi foreign minister saud alfaisal pressed the chinese foreign minister on this issue on his january 17 visit saud alfaisal told the chinese that for saudi arabia this is critical security issue irans getting nuclear weapons will open the door to the rest of the middle east pursuing nuclear weapons saudi arabia would prefer that the middle east remain nuclear free zone when the chinese foreign minister replied that china will not accept irans development of nuclear weapons saud alfaisal told him that china will have to work more closely with the rest of the world and the security council to prevent this from happening 3 c prince torki agreed that it was not helpful that the chinese sent lowlevel delegation to the most recent 5 1 talks he also agreed it was unfortunate the delegation did not agree it was time now to increase pressure on iran alkabir also noted that time was not in the security councils favor but in irans prince torki said that saudi arabia was convinced the time was ripe to push china on this issue it would be important to demonstrate that the assurances fm alfaisal got were not just from the foreign minister but represented the thinking of the whole government he said that saudi arabia repeated these points to the chinese middle east special envoy who visited week later saudi arabia has also raised these concerns with russia which is closer to the us and saudi positions and with the deputy french foreign minister three weeks ago prince torki also agreed to work with lebanons mission now on the security council where it is sure to confront the issue of iranian proliferation 4 c prince torki said that china never directly raised the issue of its concerns about securing sufficient oil supplies particularly in the event of cutoff of iranian supplies however saudi arabia fully understands chinas concerns and in that context is pleased that the chinese foreign minister had successful8 talks with saudi aramco and trade officials about specific commercial and energy issues prince torki noted that saudi arabia has become one of chinas largest energy suppliers and has invested billions of dollars in refineries in china trade has grown from 140 million decade ago to 75 billion now with prospects for further increases prince torki concluded by noting that saudi arabia knows what concerns china and is willing to take actions to address those concerns but must have chinese cooperation in stopping irans development of nuclear weapons as quid pro quo saudi arabia is encouraging other gulf countries to meet with china to explore similar cooperation although it expects these countries will seek the same exchange yemen 5 c prince torki explained that saudi arabia also believes that iran is playing an unhelpful role in yemen dismissing the need for specific evidence he said it was hard to explain how the houthis as poor tribal group managed to get so much money so quickly to obtain the heavy armaments that they have been using absent the help of some outside group it is also hard he argued to explain the striking similarities with techniques that have been used by proiranian groups in iraq saudi arabia is convinced that iran is providing money for poor tribesmen to fight as well as payments to their families and is facilitating contact with somalia and qaeda prince torki said the saudi defense forces have been impressed how well the houthis have fought displaying advanced training note in separate meeting ministry of interior officials echoed many of these assessments in greater detail septel end note 6 c prince torki was unequivocal in stating that saudi arabia has intention of becoming part of the current conflict between the central government and the houthis saudi arabia felt it had to respond however after houthi forces crossed its border he said that it made little sense for the houthis to have attacked saudi arabia especially since the sag had warned them previously not to he concluded that iran was trying to test saudi reactions yemen does not need us troops but does need equipment training and information as well as assistance to meet its longterm development challenges he also said that saudi arabia is very concerned about qaedas continued presence in yemen as it will exploit any opportunity to attack saudi arabia and the united states bilateral relations 7 c prince torki agreed that our bilateral relations are quite strong in general he singled out counterterrorism as an example of the strength of cooperation noting that saudi arabia enjoys unique level of cooperation on security with the united states prince torki confirmed that saudi arabia had contributed 50 million to the haiti relief effort on january 25 which is the largest contribution to date of any middle eastern country he also welcomed greater us engagement in multilateral and international organizations climate change 8sbu as feltman noted the importance that the president places on climate change and the copenhagen accord given that minister of petroleum alnaimi was involved in crafting the final agreement as feltman noted the united states is counting on saudi arabia to associate itself with the accord by january 31 prince torki said that saudi arabia was very pleased the united states was more actively engaged in this issue and said that the ministry of foreign affairs supports trying to address this issue he noted that the mfa will have to consult with other involved ministries such as the ministry of petroleum and promised to respond before january 31 concern over tsa regulations 9 sbu prince torki noted he had been instructed to raise saudi arabias significant concern about the tsa regulations which had included saudi arabia in limited group of countries for additional airport screening prince torki said that this issue had caused lot of difficulties and embarrassment for saudi arabia to the degree that foreign minister saud alfaisal will raise this with the secretary in london on january 27 prince torki said that saudi arabia was not upset about the regulation itself as it recognized the us right and obligation to protect its citizens the issue rather was inclusion on the list with the likes of cuba which causes saudi arabias friends and enemies to question how strong its bilateral relationship with the united states really is prince torki said it is very hard to explain to the saudi public why they are included on this list despite not being the origin of the december 25 flight while other countries that have had recent terrorist incidents on planes like the uk egypt and turkey are not prince torki said that saudi arabia had been shocked to be included on the list he noted that saudi arabia had been told these provisions would only be temporary and said saudi arabia would like to know how and when they will be amended implying that the longer they remained in effect without any public explanation from the usg the more it was likely to prompt the saudi government to reevaluate areas of cooperation including counterterrorism cooperation as feltman promised to convey the spirit and strength of the message and invited any specific saudi suggestions to address the security gap regarding nonmetallic explosives exploited in the december 25 incident middle east peace 10 c in response to question as feltman explained that the united states believes that we need to get the israelis and the palestinians back to the negotiating table which will be the best way to compel israel to follow through on its public statements and to overcome palestinian skepticism as feltman noted that the united states had referred to the 1967 lines with swaps as way of helping encourage the palestinians to return to the table prince torki welcomed this overview u this cable has been cleared by as feltman smith
