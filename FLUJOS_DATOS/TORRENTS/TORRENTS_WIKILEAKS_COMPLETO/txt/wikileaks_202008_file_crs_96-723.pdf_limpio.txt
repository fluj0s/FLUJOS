deployment overview the prospect of deploying us ground troops to the former yugoslavia had been present since the beginning of the c linton administration as the war in bosnia continued with viable peace settleme nt in view from 1993 to 1995 debate in congress for the most part focussed on alternative options such as lifting the arms embargo against the bosnian government ra ther than on possible us participation in peacekeeping2425 prior to the dayton peace agreement in november 1995 practically support in congress had been voiced for the deployment of us ground forces for humanitarian enforcemen t peacekeeping or any other purposes as nato engaged in sustained air strike campaign against the bosnian serb forces and the administration stepped up diplomatic initiatives in mid1995 rough military parity on the ground in bosnia sign alled more promising prospects for peace settlement such prospects also in creased the likelihood that the president would fulfill his longstanding pledge to ve us forces participate in peacekeeping as discussed above the president did not seek authorization from congress for us armed forces participa tion prior to the conclu sion of

the dayton schedule should be upheld where possible some members of congress questioned the us insistence on elections given that such elections were unlikely to be free and fair and likely to reinforce rather than weaken forces for separation in bosnia in addition to concern about overall progress in peace implementation it was feared that problems in civilian implementation might endanger

outside experts on the prospects for followon force in addition to charges of broken promises by the administration critics decried the lack of consultation with the congress on the future of us
