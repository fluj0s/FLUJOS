receive if they could receive both government pension and full social security spousal benefits opponents contend that the provision is basically imprecise and often unfair while defenders argue it is

security if he or she pays into social security through the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi payroll tax approximately 96 of all workers are covered the majority of noncovered positions are held by government employees most federal employees hired before 1984 and some state and local government employees nationwide approximately 71 of state and local government employees are covered 3 however coverage varies from state to state for exampl approximately 97 of state and local employees in new york are covered by social security while only 3 of state and local employees in ohio are covered4 this disparity in coverage occurs because while social security originally did not cover any state and local government workers over time the law has changed most state and local government employees became covered by social security through voluntary agreements between the social security administration and individual states5 beginning in july 1991 state and local employees who were not members of public retirement system were mandatorily covered by social security those public employees who were already members of public retirement system through their employment were not mandatorily covered because their state pensions already fulfilled the social insurance functions of social security 1 the gpo is often confused with the windfall elimination provision wep which reduces social security benefits that person receives as worker if he or she also has government pension based on work that was not covered by social security for additional information in the windfall elimination provision wep please refer to crs report 9835 social security the windfall elimination provision wep by laura haltzel 2 42 usc 402b4 3 social security administration estimated social security coverage of workers with state and local government employment 2005 4 ibid 5 these agreements are known as section 218 agreements because they are authorized by section 218 of the social security act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32453g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g497g561g22

benefit earned as worker based on ones own social securitycovered earnings be subtracted from any social security spousal benefit one is eligible to receive based on their spouses social securitycovered earnings and only the difference if any is paid as spousal benefit in other words the dualentitled worker will receive the higher of his or her own retirement benefit or the spousal benefit but not both the rationale is that social security spousal benefit is based on the concept of dependency and someone who receives his or her own social security benefit as retired worker is assumed to be financially independent of his or her spouse because most workers are in social securitycovered employment the dual entitlement scenario is the most common among twoearner couples in 2005 approximately 63 million out of 305 million social security retired worker beneficiaries or about 20 were duallyentitled not including those whose spousal benefit was completely offset by their retired worker benefit 6 table 1 demonstrates how the social security dualentitlement rule is applied t able 1 regular dualentitlement f ormula john mary social security retirement be nefit based on

her potential 450 spousal benefit and only the difference of 50 is paid as spousal benefit in total mary will receive 450400 as social security worker benefit and 50 as social security spousal benefit john is also eligible to receive social security spousal benefit of up to 50 of marys retirement benefit or 200 however in this application of the dualentitlement rule john would not be paid spousal benefit because his 900 retirement benefit based on his own earnings is higher and more than offsets the potential 200 spousal benefit

john worked enough years in social securitycovered employment to qualify for social security retirement benefits he has earned social security benefit of 900 his wife mary is not eligible for social

security spousal benefit of up to 450 based on johns work history mary is also eligible for 400 government pension based on her work in nonsocial securitycovered position under the gpo marys potential social security spousal benefit is reduced by an amount equal to twothirds of her nonsocial securitycovered government pension or 26667 and only the differ ence of 18333 is paid to her as spousal benefit in total mary will receive 58333400 from her noncovered pension and 18333 as social security spousal benefit in this example john is not eligible for social security spousal benefit because mary did not qualify on her own earnings history for social security worker benefit

employment was not covered by social security and who are eligible for social security spousal benefit in approximately the same position as workers whose jobs were covered by social security and are also eligible for social security spousal benefit before the gpo was enacted in 1977 workers who received pensions from government job not covered by social security could also receive full social security spousal benefits even though they were not financially dependent on their spouse because the social security administration ssa does not have complete earnings records of those who work in nonsocial securitycovered positions ssa is forced to rely on the government pension as measure of those uncovered earnings essentially it is assumed that 7 social security administration office of

social security retirement or disability benefit the spouse would have earned as worker if his or her job had been covered by social security thus the gpo attempts to replicate the social security dualentitlement rule by requiring that an amount equal to twothirds of the workers noncovered government pension be subtracted from the social security spousal benefit the scenarios below demonstrate why the law was changed table 3 shows how the spousal benefit of the same individual mary would vary under three scenarios 1 as duallyentitled recipient of social security retirement and spousal benefits 2 as the recipient of noncovered government pension and social security spousal benefits before the gpo was enacted and 3 as the recipient of noncovered government pension and social security spousal benefits after the gpo was enacted in each case marys earnings and thus the social security retirement benefit or noncove red government pension and the maximum spousal benefit she is eligible to receive are identical under the first scenario as duallyentitled retiree 100 of marys own social security retirement benefit of 400 is used to offset the 450 social security spousal benefit that she is eligible for leaving her with net spousal bene fit of 50 under the second scenario where mary receives noncovered government pension instead of social security retirement benefit before the gpo was enacted marys social security spousal benefits are not reduced at all and she receives full social security spousal be nefit of 450 under the third scenario when the gpo is put into effect marys social security spousal benefit is reduced by twothirds of her 400 noncovered government pension leaving her with net spousal benefit of 18333 therefore with the gpo in place marys earnings and resulting retirement benefit are used to offset her social security spousal benefit just as they were under the dualentitlement scenario table 3 also shows how given equal social security retirement benefits or noncovered government pension amounts of 400 individuals under the gpo actually receive lesser reduction in social security spousal benefits compared to those covered by social security and subject to the dualentitlement rule those under dualentitlement face 100 offset and receive only 50 spousal benefit while those under the gpo face 666 offset and receive 18333 as spousal benefit if those nonsocial security covered workers had been covered by social security they would have been subject to the dualentitlement rule and their spousal benefits would be lower than what they receive under the gpo t able 3 mar s spousal benefit bef or and after gpo enactment dually entitled before gpo after gpo social security retirement be nefit based on own ea rnings record 40 000 000

established by the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 the original 1977 law provided that 100 of the government pension be subtracted from the social security spousal benefit if the original legislation had been left intact the treatment of individuals affected by the dualentitlement rule and the gpo would in fact have been identical because the social security spousal benefit would have been offset by 100 of the retirement benefit in both cases in 1983 congress passed pl 9821 which made number of amendments to social security in an attempt to strengthen the systems finances one section of the house version of this law proposed that the amount used in calculating the offset be onethird of the government pension the senate version contained such provision the conferees adopted

smaller social security benefit than they had assumed in making retirement plans they also argue that the provision especially hurts lowincome workers such as teachers and in some circumstances is sufficient to throw these workers into poverty opponents maintain that the original purpose of the gpo was to prevent high erpaid workers from reaping windfall benefits and it was not intended to have such negative effect on lowerpaid workers they question why the provision applies only to government workers and not to workers in the private sector who also receive pensions from their employers

job been covered by social security they say this procedure has uneven results and that it is especially disadvantageous for surviving spouses and lowpaid workers ideally opponents argue the way to compute the offset to replicate the dualentitlement rule would be to apply the social security benefit formula to an individuals total earnings including the noncovered portion and reduce the resulting social security benefit by the proportion of total earnings attributable to noncovered earnings g3g155g144g158g150g142g151g157g156g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g9g18g17g561 defenders of the gpo maintain that it is an effective method to curtail what otherwise would be an unfair advantage for nonsocial securitycovered government workers the provision was phased in over six years and now has been in the law for 30 years therefore they say there has been ample time for people to adjust their retirement plans pl 108203 passed in 2004 included provision that seeks to ensure that ssa and government employers notify potentially affected individuals about the effect of the gpo others maintain that it is not true that the measure was intended to apply particularly to higher paid workers nor does analysis support the position that the measure disproportionately affects lowerpaid workers last year crs completed an analysis of the benefit reductions under the gpo relative to those under the dualentitlement rule to determine how well twothirds of the government pension amounts serve as proxy for the social security worker benefits that individuals would receive if they had worked in covered employment if twothirds of the government pension were in fact good proxy for social security retirement benefits the overall increase or decrease in the offset amount under the dualentitlement rule on the basis of the social security benefit formula would be zero however the estimates show that there is great variation in outcomes some individuals including lower ea rners would have much larger offset amount under the dualentitlement rule while others incl uding higher earners would have somewhat smaller offset amount this finding suggests that the common criticism that the gpo penalizes lower earners more than higher earners may not be accurate other evidence of the effect of the gpo on low earners comes from statistics produced by the social security administration while 75 of those affected by the gpo have their benefits fully offset only 39 of those with noncovered pensions of less than 1000 per month had their benefits fully offset compared with 88 of those with noncovered pensions between 1000 and 1999 and nearly 100 of individuals with noncovered pensions over that amount 23 of the 75 of individuals affected by the gpo whose benefits were fully offset as result of the gpo only 17 had noncovered pension amount of less than 1000 per month 24 thus if the non covered pension amount is reflection of the earnings levels of individuals affected by the gpo greater percentage of those with lower earnings receive at least partial social security benefit relative to the overall gpoaffected population 23 crs calculations based on table i

poverty in 2001 the poverty rate among those affected by the gpo was approximately 60 whereas the poverty rate for those affected by the dualentitlement rule was approximately 8925 the poverty rate for all social security beneficiaries age 65 and older was about 85 for comparison purposes the poverty rate for the general population at that time was approximately 113 on average private sector workers who are affected by the dualentitlement rule earn less than their counterparts in state and local government who are affected by the gpo june 2006 data from the bureau of labor statistics indicate that state and local government workers earned on average 2399 per hour compared with the national average of 1929 per hour and the private sector average of 1856 per hour26 some point out that if these government workers had been covered by social security in many cases social securitys dualentitlement rule would produce higher reduction in spousal benefits than does the gpo thus they say to weaken or eliminate the gpo would be unfair to other workers incl uding the majority of government workers whose jobs are covered by social security and therefore are subject to social securitys dualentitlement rule defenders of the provision maintain that the fact that the gpo does not apply to private sector pensions is irrelevant because the employment on which the private pension is based would be covered by social security and thus so cial securitys dualentitlement rule which the gpo is meant to replicate would reduce any spousal benefits for which the workers would be eligible some also argue that weakening or eliminating the gpo would be costly at time when neither social security nor the federal budget is in sound financial condition the social security administration has projected the 10year cost of repealing the gpo to be about 42 billion 27 such move could lead to demands of repeal of the dualentitlement rule to ensure parallel treatment for those working in social securitycovered employment by comparison eliminating the dualentitlement rule would cost approximately 500 billion over fiveyear period 28 finally because administrative considerations have precluded applying the social security benefit computation rules to government employment the gpo is defended as practical way to prevent undue social security benefits from going to government annuitants 25 poverty rates were calculated by david weaver of the social security administrations office of retirement policy using the march 2001 current population survey cps poverty status is taken directly from the cps and is thus subject to errors in the reporting of income the sample for the gpo and duallyentitled poverty rates only includes persons for whom ssa administrative records could be matched the sample size for the gpo poverty rate is relatively small 130 cases the poverty rates for the social security beneficiary population age 65 and over and for the general population do not require matched data and are based completely on cps data 26 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics national compensation survey occupational wages in the united states

government workers had been making use of littleknown provision of the law that allowed them to escape the application of the gpo if they switched jobs at the end of their government careers these workers could do this because until recently the law granted an exception to the gpo if on the last day of ones government service he or she worked in social securitycovered position on august 15 2002 th government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office released report that found that as of june 2002 4819 individuals in texas and georgia had switched to social securitycovered positions to avoid the application of the gpo to their social security spousal benefits the gao projected that the cost to the program for these cases could be bout 450 million the gao stated that possible remedies to these potential abuses of the lastday exception clause could be to lengthen the time period to qualify for the exemption or to prorate the reduction in benefits to the proportion of time spent in the noncovered job compared to the covered one on february 11 2004 the house of representatives agreed to senate amendments and passed hr 743 the social security protection act of 2003 which became pl 108203 29 as discussed below pl 108203 eliminated the lastday exception clause by requiring those workers switching from noncovered positions to social securitycovered
