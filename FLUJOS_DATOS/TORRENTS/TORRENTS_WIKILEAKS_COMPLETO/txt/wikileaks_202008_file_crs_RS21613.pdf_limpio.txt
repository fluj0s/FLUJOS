private land it was first enacted by congress in 1985 to help control soil erosion stabilize land prices and control excessive agricultural production since then program purposes have been expanded to include environmental goals the program is administered by usdas farm services agency fsa with technical assistance from usdas natural resources conservation service nrcs and funding from usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the fsa makes annual rental payments based on the agriculture rental value of the land and provides costshare assistance for up to 50 of the participants costs in establishing various approved conservation practices eg planting cover crop on the land to reduce erosion participants enroll in crp contracts for 10 to 15 years participants bid to retire land from production for 1015 years contracts are awarded by fsa based on their assessment of the lands environmental value using an environmental benefits index ebi if the land is accepted the landowner may enroll the land receive annual rental payments for it and maintain the land under an approved conservation plan after crp contract expires federal payments cease if the land in question is highly erodible about 75 of the land enrolled in the crp meets this definition and participants decide to return the land to production they must manage this land under nrcsapproved conservation system if they wish to be eligible for some federal farm programs including commodity payments g7g151g155g152g149g149g146g151g144g561g146g151g561g5g20g18g561 there are two types of signups for enrolling land in the crp general and continuous as of december 2008 there were 744041 crp contracts nationally on 417754 farms approximately 20 of all farms under all crp programs these data compare to 788118 crp contracts on 443615 farms in september 2007 land eligible for crp enrollment must be either 1 cropland that is planted or considered planted to an agricultural commodity in four of the previous six crop years from 1996 to 2001 or 2 certain marginal pastureland that is enrolled in the water bank program or suitable for use as riparian buffer or for similar water quality purposes

887 of crp acreage 295 million of 336 million acres is enrolled through general signup applicants must meet certain eligibility criteria evaluate their land according to fsas environmental benefits index and submit bids to fsa for enrollment fsa accepts applications that demonstrate the highest environmental benefits these general signups are always competitive for the crps most recent general signup number 33 which ran from march 27 to april 28 2006 usda selected 1 million acres of the 14 million acres offered this most recently enrolled acreage includes about 673000 acres of land located within conservation priority areas about 629000 acres with an erodibility index of eight or greater highly erodible and about 265000 acres to be restored to rare and declining habitats

environmental goals fsa has adjusted the categories and points awarded under the ebi for example fsa announced in june 2003 that for the first time it may award points to projects which have the potential to sequester carbon reducing greenhouse gas emissions other factors include wildlife habitat benefits from planted cover crops water quality benefits from reduced erosion and whether benefits will endure beyond the contract period offers that included willingness to accept less than the maximum rental rate for acreage as well as offers to reenroll land may have received additional points fsa ranks all applications nationally and then sets an ebi score cutoff above which applications will be accepted

enrolled in the crp at any time for 1015 years under continuous signup1 offers are automatically accepted provided the land and producer meet certain eligibility requirements and are not subject to competitive bidding contracts usually include additional incentive payments within the continuous signup program there are some options tailored to certain conservation needs such as restoring floodplain wetlands and native hardwood trees in wetlands on august 4 2004 the administration announced two more initiatives 250000acre initiative to restore bobwhite quail habitats in the midwest and the southeast and 250000acre initiative to restore wetlands located outside floodplains including great plains playa lakes there are currently december 2008 41 million acres enrolled under continuous signups including crep acreage discussed below the 2008 continuous signup number 36 added 282000 acres to the crep total bringing the total to crep to 380000 acres in december 2008 there were

everglades some states eg new york and ohio have multiple creps each targeting different area of the state usda provides 80 of the funding and nonfederal entity typically the state contributes the remainder states may automatically enroll up to 100000 acres unlike the general signup crep both encourages landscapescale conservation efforts and offers the flexibility to address locally identified

approximately 28 million acres under crp contract will expire between 2007 and 2010 contracts covering 59 million acres expired in 2008 with 34 million more acres expiring in 2009 and 16 million acres in september 2010 approximately 83 of this expiring acreage has been reenrolled or had contracts extended as of august 2008 of the 157 million contract acres that expired september 30 2007 136 million 866 were approved for extensions or new enrollment contracts approximately 48 million of the 59 million acres expiring in 2008 also have extensions or new contracts 816 contracts were extended or renewed based on the environmental benefit index ebi score and the lands location within national priority areas 2 fsa ranked individual contracts into one of five tiers based on the environmental benefits of the original ebi score eligible participants rankin g in the first tier 81100of the ebi could reenroll their land in new 10year contracts farmers and ranchers in this top tier with wetlands enrolled were eligible for 15year contracts only acreage under general signup contracts is eligible contract extension ranges from two to five years eligible participants ranking in the second tier 6180 of the ebi could extend their contracts for five years thirdtier participants 2140 of the ebi could receive threeyear extensions eligible participants in the bottom tier could extend their expiring contracts by two years participants with contracts expiring between 2008 and 2010 were also notified by fsa that they could choose to reenroll or extend by june 30 2006 of the 121 million acres expiring in 2008 2010 96 million 803 had been approved for reenrollment or extension as of december 2007 the high commodity prices in 2008 potentially discouraged some eligible producers from reenrolling or extending their contracts other producers however may have judged the high commodity prices as temporary phenomenon and decided to reenroll or extend their contracts approximately 75 of the acreage expiring in 2010 has been reenrolled or extended this compares to approximately 82 reenrollment and extension for acreage expiring in 2008 and 2009 continuing lower commodity prices could remove some of the incentive for eligible producers not to renew contracts going forward 2 national priority areas named in crp authorizing legislation are the chesapeake bay long island sound and the great lakes region usda established two other national priority areas prairie pothole region in the northern great plains and longleaf pine region in the southeast

2008 appeared to make contract terminations attractive to some producers under current law however pr oducer wishing to terminate contract early faces penalty fee of 25 on rent payments paid plus repayment with interest of all the funds already paid to the producer this includes any costshare payments crp acreage is also seen in some quarters as potential resource for renewable fuel feedstocks in july 2008 secretary schafer stated that there would be penaltyfree terminations penalties would apply to any contract holder who reenrolls or extends acreage and then decides to terminate the contract an expiring contract that is extended and then later terminated would have penalties based on the original contract not just the period since contract extension expiring acreage that is reenrolled is under new contract and would incur penalties only on the period covered by the new contract

of farming as such they are subject to selfemployment social security taxes producers however would like to treat crp payments as rental income not subject to the self employment tax of 153 the irs position was supported by the sixth circuit court in march 2000 in wuebker v commissioner 205 f3d897 in december 2006 the irs issued notice 2006 108 reinforcing its position that crp payments are subject to selfemployment taxes section 15301 of the 2008 farm bill exempts crp payments from selfemployment taxes for disabled and retired contract holders after december 31 20073

could result in fewer farmers and fewer farmingrelated jobs in these areas usda report found that although high crp enrollment was associated with some job loss in rural areas between 1986 and 1992the years the crp was first underwaythis was generally not the case during the 1990s however the report noted that national trends could mask regional adjustments and that local economic adjustments might be sizeable 4 losing existing crp acreage or halting new enrollments may also have effects on local economies where hunting and fishing are important economic activities according to fsa data the crp had 336 million acres enrolled in crp as of december 2008 including the various subprograms eg conservation reserve enhancement program farmable wetlands this is decline of about 3 million acres over the total acreage enrolled in september 2007 by statute crp enrollment is capped at 25 of countys cropland approximately 130 counties have at least 225 enrolled although this can include counties with very small total 3 for more detail on the tax treatment of crp payments see crs report rs22910 the 2008 farm bill analysis of taxrelated conservation reserve program proposals by carol pettit 4 us

eligible for higher payments than acres enrolled under general signups because of their higher environmental benefits location and prevailing rental rates and additional financial incentives for participation however such contracts involve much smaller acreage on average crep payments average 127 per acre and 117 for the fwp versus an average peracre payment of approximately 44 for the general signup acreage crp payments under all programs in fy2008 were approximately 18 billion the congressional budget office estimated crp cont ract obligations would cost 192 billion in fy2007 and 24 billion annually through 2017 nrcs estimated that prior to 2003 monetized crp benefits such as increased wildlife habitat and small game hunting averaged about 14 billion per year this figure does not include nonmonetized benefits such as improved groundwater quality and wetland restoration

range from an average of 44 for general signup acreage to nearly 128 for crep acreage crp rental rates are based on the threeyear average of local dryland cash rental rates an upfront signing incentive payment sip of 100 to 150 per acre depending on contract length is available for eligible participants who enroll certain practices the onetime sip is made after contract is approved and all payment eligibility criteria have been met practice incentive payment pip equal to 40 of the eligible inst allation costs is also available for eligible participants who enroll certain practices on

reduced erosion by more than 454 million tons per year on the 346 million acres enrolled in the program through april 2006 crp had also restored two million acres of wetlands and 25 million acres of buffers other conservation benefits nrcs has documented on these lands include the sequestration of more than 48 million metric tons of carbon annually more than 32 million acres of wildlife habitat established and reduction in the application of nitrogen by 681000 tons and phosphorus by 104000 tons also participants have planted about 27 million acres to trees making it the largest federal
