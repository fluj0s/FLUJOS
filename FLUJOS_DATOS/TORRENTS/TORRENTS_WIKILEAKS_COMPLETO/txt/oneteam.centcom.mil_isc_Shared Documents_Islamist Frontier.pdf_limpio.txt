mrzsthis monograph is the first in series by the center on faith international affairs cfia that will examine the intersection of religion and security issues in global context the center has for several years been at the forefront of this topic in 2003 it sponsored conference which examined the role of religion and religion policy in political and social stability an event which formed the basis of book religion and security the new nexus in international relations 1 the centers religion security research program builds on this initial work and by way of international conferences special reports and cfias journal the review of faith international affairs 2 has taken the lead in examining this critical issue from various regional and religious perspectives3 multifaith initiative the center conducts this research with the conviction that the free exercise of religion practiced peacefully can contribute in profoundly positive ways to stable social and political order but also that states must take seriously and deal intelligently with the social and security implications of religious extremism the center exists in part to help scholars policymakers and practitioners strike this critical balance and encourage discussion about the changing role of religion in global affairs the center operates as an education and research program of the institute for global engagement ige faithbased global affairs think tank which since 2000 has worked to promote sustainable environments for religious freedom and sponsor innovative international programs that focus on the intersection of reli gion law and security issues it was an ige initiative which invited nwfp chief minister akram khan durrani to washington in 2005 for discussions regarding political islam in the frontier and which resulted in joshua whites reciprocal trip to peshawar as part of small delegation joshuas subsequent stay in peshawar and his extended interaction with religious and political elites throughout the frontier formed the inspiration for this research project many of the themes and recommendations which appear below were first outlined by the author at presentation prefacein washington in november 2007 which was jointly sponsored by cfia and the south asia studies program of the johns hopkins university school for advanced international studies it is our hope that this monograph proves to be valuable resource to both scholars and policymakers as they seek to understand the changing nature of islamic politics in pakistans frontier dennis r hoover dphil and

on religion and security in the central asian contextislamic politics counterinsurgency and the state pakistans western frontier has been geographic and ideological focal point for religious extremism for nearly thirty years it served as staging ground for mujahidin operations against the russians in afghanistan throughout the 1980s it was the birthplace of qaeda in 1988 and the t aliban movement in 1994 more recently over the last several years neot aliban insurgency has emerged in the pakafghan border areas which has grown into complex religiopolitical movement with three distinct but overlapping objectives one is focused westward on fueling the afghan conflict and overturning the karzai government second is oriented globally toward providing safe haven for qaeda and its af filiates to plan attacks against western interests and third is focused on pakistan itself on carving out sphere of influence within the tribal agencies of the federally administered t ribal areas fata and the nearby settled districts of the northwest frontier province nwfp for the establishment of islamist rule and on destabilizing the pakistani state so as to disrupt its cooperation with the us and western allies focusing on this third objective of the neot aliban movement this monograph examines in historical perspective the interaction between islamic politics and the state in the frontier paying particular attention to the nwfp proper and the nearby settledtribal border regions although the analysis largely brackets number of important bilateral and regional issues such as the challenge of strengthening counterterrorism cooperation improving pak afghan interaction on border issues and larger regional questions dealing with concerns over pakistans lack of strategic commitment to rooting out militant groups and interacting with fragile civilian government in islamabad it seeks to provide framework for understanding the religious and political dynamics which are critical to the development of any successful us strategy in the frontierexecutive summary4 pakistans islamist frontier the narrative begins with an historical review of islamism in the frontier high lighting several recurring patterns which shed light on contemporary trends against this backdrop the monograph goes on to analyze the fiveyear tenure 20022007 of the muttahida majliseamal mma islamist government in nwfp which represented the first extended attempt at actual governance by religious parties in pakistans history and review the ways in which it shaped the current political environment this analysis is followed by discussion of the mmas decline over the last year the rise of the neot aliban insurgency and the return of pashtun nationalist politics the concluding chapters examine the history of american interaction in the frontier and recommend policies by which the us might work with the government of pakistan to implement programs which deny insurgents foothold in the settled areas of the frontier buttress the legitimacy of the state in dealing with religious and militant groups increase the political util ity and longterm sustainability of american development assistance and address the governance deficit in both the settled and tribal areas in such way as to lay the groundwork for more robust state influence and counterinsurgency planning given the upsurge in attention devoted to the hardcore t ehriket alibane pakistan ttp militancy in places such as waziristan and bajaur an analysis which focuses on islamic political behavior in the nwfp might at first seem to be out of step with current crises but this could not be further from the truth religiopolitical dynamics in the frontier are arguably more important than ever before while pakistan and the united states may increasingly resort to military action against ttp and other insurgent groups military efforts alone will ultimately prove insuf ficient in producing stable political order that satisfies the strategic objectives of either country ultimately counterinsurgency is about incentivizing political endgames in the frontier this requires much more robust and comprehensive policy focus on local governance politics and even religion many us officials have come to adopt jaundiced view of political solutions in the frontier believing that they too often serve to empower religious parties militants or both in this the us is often correct but also complicit american patronage has heavily privileged the pakistani military and done little to strengthen the kinds of civilian institutions that are necessary to provide counterweight to both religious politics and insurgent mobilization focus on the settled areas of the frontier is also long overdue while the neo t aliban insurgency remains heavily dependent upon bases deep in the fata the movements center of gravity is gradually becoming more diffuse blurring the distinction between settled and tribal regions the nwfp has been rocked by steep rise in militant activity over the last two years and increasingly resembles the ungoverned tribal areas political reforms in the fata on the other hand are likely to make the tribal areas look more like the settled regions by introducing regular forms of political activity this convergence makes the case for the development of counterinsurgency programs which operate across settled and tribal lines and which deny political space to new religious insurgent movementsexecutive summary 5 the frontier 20012008 evaluating islamic politics the limits and lessons of islamist moderation the religious parties five year tenure leading the nwfp government from 2002 to 2007 represents valuable case study of the ways in which involvement in the politi cal process can serve to shape and ultimately moderate islamic political behavior rather than serving as the vanguard of t alibanlike rule in the frontier as many observers had feared the mma instead became relatively pragmatic and found its islamist agenda limited by both internal and external pressures the lessons of the mmas transfor mation remain deeply relevant in the frontier even following the alliances defeat in february 2008 religious parties will continue to play significant role in nwfp politics particularly if and when their rightofcenter patrons among the pmln return to power in islamabad the united states which has generally avoided engagement with the religious parties also has lessons to learn from the constructive role that the interna tional community played in shaping the mmas islamist experiment understanding the mainstreammilitant divide the rise of the neot aliban insurgency since 2005 has deeply complicated the relationship between mainstream religious parties of the mma such as the jamaateislami ji and the jamiat ulemaeislam fazl juif and more militant organiza tions such as the ttp while these two kinds of islamists often share common political discourse eg regarding the west and the shariah and retain many informal linkages the religious parties are increasingly ambivalent about the goals of the neot aliban and threatened both directly and indirectly by the movements expansion into areas which were traditionally dominated by democratic islamist groups this realignment has reduced the influence of parties such as the juif over the younger generation of madrassah graduates many of whom are now easily recruited to militant groups but has also created new common interests between the religious parties and the state in channeling discontent into the formal political process insurgency as local politics just as analysts in 2002 made the mistake of reading the mma through the lens of the afghan t aliban and thus underestimating the degree to which religious parties would be shaped by local political interests so today observers often make the mistake of reading the neot aliban insurgency narrowly through the lens of qaeda and the waziri militant networks in doing so they again tend to underestimate the ways in which these insurgent groups and their agendas are woven deeply into the fabric of both local and regional politics neot aliban organizations operating in places such as swat khyber darra adam khel and south waziristan while all linked are also quite distinct and require unique strategies on the part of the government while there is clearly unifying ideological dimension to the insurgency it nonetheless remains highly fragmented and dependent upon local grievances6 pakistans islamist frontier legitimacy and peace deals the waziristan accords in 2006 signed by the pakistan army and local militants demonstrated that successful negotiations with neot aliban groups can easily end up as strategic failures american policymakers however have been slow to recognize that the converse can be equally true the failed peace deals in swat in the spring of 2008 were in many ways effective in that they demonstrated the governments good faith and created political space for the state to undertake strong action when the militants reneged on their commitments while some agreements with militants are clearly counterproductive not all peace deals are created equal negotiations can contribute to larger strategy of delegitimizing islamist insurgent activity the false secularism vs shariah debate the mmas defeat in the february 2008 elections sparked optimism that secular nationalism would replace religious politics in the frontier the awami national party anp took advantage of public disillusionment with the islamists governance and with their inability or unwillingness to stem the rising tide of militancy the nation alists victory however says more about cyclical politics and antiincumbency sentiment than it does about political islam the anpppp coalition government vulnerable to criticism from the rightofcenter parties has in fact adopted religious rhetoric of its own and promulgated new shariah regulations in an attempt to under cut public support for islamist insurgent groups local governance and islamism the rise of new militant islamism in the frontier is rightly attributed to political ideological and demographic factors but comparatively less attention has been paid to the internal and structural weaknesses of the state which opened the door to insurgent influence musharraf s 2002 governance reforms inadvertently facilitated the rise of new insurgents by crippling the states ability to respond to threats at the local level and by further bifurcating administration of settled and tribal regions the governments consistent failure to follow through with basic governance reforms in the fata has also weakened its hand against groups which have established religious basis of legitimacy in the tribal areas the present crisis us policy recommendations american policy toward the frontier has focused heavily on counterterrorism objectives in the fata the spreading insurgency however calls for more integrated and creative agenda designed to bolster the states political legitimacy and improve its capacity to respond to new threats this means crafting policies which encourage local communities to side with the state and against islamist insurgents these policies which may take distinct forms in the fata and the nwfp must integrate polit ical engagement public diplomacy security programming and development assistanceexecutive summary 7 broadening political engagement throughout the musharraf era american political engagement was tentative and overly focused on few elites although this is slowly beginning to change it is important that the us continues to find practical ways to signal its commitment to civilian governance institutionalize indirect support to moderate parties in the frontier such as the anp and retool its bureaucracy for longterm engagement with pakistan american diplomats also need to make greater efforts to engage with rightofcenter and religious parties regular consis tent interaction with parties such as the pmln and juif would ironically help to normalize and depoliticize the interaction and allow the us to be better prepared for political realignments which may bring these parties back into power refocusing public diplomacy americas public diplomacy strategy is often overly focused on trying to reduce antiamericanism the focal objective of us public diplomacy in pakistan should be to encourage pakistanis to see cooperation against militancy and extremism as being in their own interest this requires that us politicians and not just diplomats adopt language of common interests and common threats avoid framing the neot aliban insurgency in religious language and find ways to highlight the bleak realities of insurgent governance in both the settled and tribal areas there are also opportunities for the us to promote tracktwo dialogues on issues of religion and on the role of religious leaders in fostering social and political stability and rather than interacting with those muslim lead ers who are moderate by the standards of american liberalism the us must instead seek out interlocutors who are both moderate and influential in their own contexts planning for counterinsurgency in the nwfp communities in the settled areas of the frontier increasingly view local neot aliban groups as criminal enterprises rather than legitimate religious movements and have in some areas begun pushing back against insurgent advances the us should work with the provincial government to take advantage of this trend by funding and equipping rapidresponse police forces which could supplement and support communitybased lashkars as well as programs which address local discontent over the judicial system discontent which the insurgents often use to their advantage american policymakers should also encourage reform of provincial and local governance frameworks in the nwfp which might improve the states capacity to respond to militancy particularly across complex settledtribal boundaries8 pakistans islamist frontier planning for counterinsurgency in the fata us support for counterinsurgency efforts in the fata has been focused largely on the provision of equipment and training to the frontier corps this support is worthwhile but it should not be confused with promotion of actual counterinsur gency which turns on political contestation over government legitimacy absent institutionoriented governance reform in the fata successful and sustain able counterinsurgency activities are effectively impossible the united states should take the lead in organizing an expanded and more robust friends of pakistan consortium which could serve as an umbrella organization for multilateral develop ment efforts in the fata this consortium should then work with the government of pakistan to promote the establishment of model reform zones mrzs in the tribal areas which would integrate critical governance reforms eg elected councils and judicial access highly concentrated and visible development programming steppedup security presence and political incentives in such way as to incrementally build the legitimacy of the state and create demonstration effect throughout the fata leveraging fragmentation the pakistani government has long history of taking advantage of cleavages within and among tribal structures in the wake of the anbar awakening in iraq american policymakers have discussed whether similar strategies might be successful in pakistan carrying out tribeoriented anbar model in and around the fata would pose real challenges on account of the internally fragmented egalitarian and increasingly entrepreneurial nature of the pashtun tribal system although tribal lashkars may prove to be useful in pushing back neot aliban advanc in some areas and should be supported by the state when they do so these ad hoc alliances are likely to disintegrate quickly or even turn against the government any effort to take advantage of fragmentation in the frontier must integrate political strategy with tactical approaches from the outset and as argued above should be oriented around concerted program to incentivize tribal communities and relatively moderate islamist groups to integrate into the political mainstream increasing the effectiveness of development just as successful counterinsurgency campaigns require institutional frameworks so us development programs in the tribal areas need to come to terms with the massive governance gap in the fata much of the usaid programming in the fata is innovative but is unlikely to be sustainable or politically effective given the scope of the american aid commitment in the fata policymakers should insist that broader governance issues are concurrently put on the table the us government should also develop plans to direct more aid to the nwfp proper for more on the mrz concept see epilogue frontier 2010 executive summary 9 especially the border areas adjacent to the fata and explore skills training programs in partnership with moderate madrassah networks and local universities situated in the southern part of the province conclusion as the united states looks toward formulating more comprehensive strategy in the region it would do well to recognize that islamism in the frontier remains highly fragmented not only between those groups which participate in the democratic process and those which contest the legitimacy of the state but also between those which have ideological or transnational agendas and those which simply operate in the realm of local politics solutions to the problems posed by illiberal or insur gent islamism ultimately require political mainstreaming this in turn calls for legitimate and capable state institutions both civilian and military which can set the political boundaries for islamist participation and respond effectively to new and unexpected forms of religious insurgencythe changing frontier pakistans northwest frontier province nwfp is increasingly geographic and ideological focal point for religious extremism bordering afghanistan and the troubled federally administered t ribal areas fata the nwfp has experienced social and political shift over the last two decades toward conservative and sometimes militant islam the overwhelming success of the muttahida majliseamal mma islamist alliance in the 2002 nwfp provincial elections an alliance dominated by conservative religious leaders who espoused antiamerican rhetoric and shared an ideological affinity with the t aliban appeared to many to signal shift toward t alibanized frontier inimical to both pakistani and us longterm interests in the region that narrative however turned out to be far too simple the reality which has unfolded over the last six years has instead been unexpectedly complex rather than acting in the radical mold of the afghan t aliban the mma bent to the exigencies of governance and moderated on host of key policies rather than forging qualitatively new political form in the frontier the islamist alliance succumbed to the cyclical nature of local politics losing spectacularly to pashtun nationalist parties in the 2008 general elections and rather than maintaining their hold on rightofcenter religious politics the mma constituent parties were outflanked by new class of religious actors operating on the blurred boundary between formal politics and insurgent militancy how dramatically has the frontier changed in six short years in 2002 the preem inent concern of policymakers was that coalition of antiamerican and proshariah religious parties would establish an electoral foothold in the frontier and would use their political position to enact an array of discriminatory laws in the mold of the afghan t aliban less than six years later the preoccupations of policymakers are both more profound and more complex t oday the concerns to list only few are that introduction12 pakistans islamist frontier qaeda has reconstituted its operations in the fata and is planning international operations against the west that regional strongmen such as baitullah mehsud are facilitating crossborder militancy against coalition forces in afghanistan and internal disorder in cities such as islamabad and lahore that local t alibanlike insur gencies often in collaboration with punjabi or waziri groups are gaining ground in the settled areas of the nwfp threatening the writ of the state and the longterm viability of civilian governance and that religious parties once feared as the vanguard of t alibanization are now losing even the ability to draw religiouslyminded young people away from insurgent activity and into the political mainstream 1 in light of these dramatic changes the key objectives of this monograph are two fold first to examine through political lens the overlapping islamist narratives of the last six years the rise and fall of the mma and the concomitant rise of new insurgent actors and second to propose set of policies by which the united states in close cooperation with the people and government of pakistan might constructively respond to the prevailing situation in the frontier the first objective is important for the simple reason that much of the analysis of religious politics in the frontier tends to focus on militant capabilities and outcomes access to resources organizational structures number of attacks etc rather than political and social drivers objectives rivalries partnerships leverage etc in doing so it is easy to miss the fundamentally political nature of the conflicts in todays frontier in and around 2002 for example observers often made the mistake of reading the mma through the lens of the afghan t aliban in doing so they underestimated the degree to which the pakistani islamists would be shaped by even entrapped by local political interests similarly observers today often make the mistake of reading the new class of neot aliban insurgent groups narrowly through the lens of qaeda and the waziri militant networks in doing so they again tend to underestimate the ways in which these insurgents and their agendas are woven deeply into the fabric of both local and regional politics the second objective is equally critical in the years since 2001 the united states has unfortunately not adequately come to terms with the implications of this changing islamic political activity for americas core interests us policy toward the frontier has been politically cautious generally uncreative largely driven by counterterror ism objectives and poorly coordinated with the pakistani government although the frontier has historically been recruiting ground for militant groups us political engagement public diplomacy and aid initiatives in the region are only beginning to focus in coherent way on countering ideological support for extremism both the us and pakistan have also been slow to recognize the importance of good governance and access to justice in coopting local support for islamist insurgent groups key questions the work which follows does not purport to be study of terrorism extremism or militancy as such neither does it purport to delve deeply into the macro politi cal environment in south asia or the transnational character of pakistans current security dilemmas it is rather focused attempt to trace the dynamics of political introduction 13 islam in the frontier in the post911 era in particular it seeks to provide insight into several fundamental questions about religious dynamics and political stabil ity in the frontier the answers to which may have resonance beyond simply the scope of us policy toward pakistan i what can we learn from the mmas experience about the moderating effects of governance on islamic political behavior what were the enabling and constraining factors which acted upon the alliances ability to carry out the illiberal aspects of its agenda what are the legacies of the mmas islamist experiment ii what are the advantages and disadvantages of islamist participation in the formal political process that is how do we weigh on the one hand the risks of illiberal political behavior by islamists against on the other hand the mitigating advantages of islamist participation in politics namely the coopting of potentially radical religiopolitical impulses iii what are the patterns of relationship and the lines of contestation between religious parties and groups which engage in vigilantism or militancy are there cleavages between and among these groups that pakistan can leverage in the pursuit of regional stability iv how can the us craft forwardlooking policy toward the frontier that in cooperation with the government of pakistan engages the full range of political actors in such way as to buttress moderate democratic and politically accommodationist elements over the longterm v how can the us partner with pakistan to address the underlying weakness of the state especially in those areas which are most prone to the advance of an islamist insurgency and what does the recent history of islamist governance in the nwfp tell us about the tradeoffs inherent in undertaking structural and governance reforms in the frontier project sco pe this study is bounded in two significant ways first the narrative covers six years from september 2002 through september 2008 given that nearly five of these years fell under the governance of the mma alliance in the nfwp the history and politics of the religious parties in the frontier forms large part of the analytical discussion more recent developments including the rise of new insurgent groups and the victory of the anp are also dealt with although it is still too early to draw conclusions about many of the broad trends which underlie these more recent events second rather than presuming to discuss the entire frontier region comprehen sively this analysis focuses predominantly on the nwfp proper that is the areas under the control of the provincial government one cannot of course discuss the nwfp without seriously accounting for the fata and issues of tribal governance and the states management of the settledtribal border areas will indeed be examined below that being said what follows is not detailed review of the situation in the fata itself 2 the history analysis and recommendations seek instead to fill an analytical gap by focusing in large part on the settled areas and the implications of recent frontier developments for policymakers in the us and pakistan14 pakistans islamist frontier research methodology this analysis is for the most part descriptive and is drawn largely from the authors own experiences in the frontier as well as formal interviews and background research the bulk of the fieldwork was conducted in the spring and summer of 2007 during which time the author was visiting research associate at the lahore university of management sciences lums during that period he conducted over hundred semistructured interviews in peshawar islamabad and lahore with leaders from the major religious parties senior officials in the provincial and federal governments local experts and civil society groups representatives of international organizations and officials from the military and security services the author also drew upon his experience of living in peshawar as cfia fellow from the fall of 2005 through the summer of 2006 during which time he had extensive interaction with the mma leadership and traveled widely in the nwfp his participation in the ussponsored election observer delegation to the february 2008 general elections review of existing literature including english and urdu newspaper archives research trip to pakistan in august 2008 and interviews in washington conducted during 20078 note on geogra phy and governance pakistans frontier is managed under complex and sometimes baffling patch work of governance systems many of which were inherited and adapted from british times 3 for the purpose of this monograph the term frontier is taken to include both the northwest frontier province nwfp which is governed by an elected provincial government in peshawar and the federally administered t ribal areas fata which operates under the oversight of the federal government through the office of the governor in peshawar the nwfp is subdivided into both settled and tribal areas the settled areas are those in which all or most of pakistani civil law regulations and taxation apply 4 the provincially administered t ribal areas pata on the other hand are those in which some or all aspects of regular pakistani law have been withheld or in some cases rescinded in favor of tribal or shariah systems of governance of the 24 administrative districts in the nwfp 17 are settled areas and 7 are trib each district whether settled or tribal is managed by district coordination officer dco the pata districts often operate as hybrid between settled forms of governance and autonomous tribal rule malakand district in northern nwfp for example is pata region which in many respects operates like settled dis trict with local elections courts etc but is also exempt from taxation and other regulations and has hybrid system of governance which inter alia draws on levied rather than professional police forces 5 all told the nwfp covers an area of about 29000 square miles and has population of about 21 million which consti tutes 13 of pakistans total its economy is heavily oriented around services and agriculture although only 30 of the land is cultivable and it ranks third out of pakistans four provinces with respect to most health and development indicators 6introduction 15 the fata for its part is subdivided into tribal agencies and frontier regions frs each of the seven tribal agencies is administered by political agent pa who reports to the governor of nwfp under the framework established by the frontier crimes regulation of 1901 the pa negotiates principally with tribal leaders who have been appointed by the state as maliks the six fr areas which are considerably smaller than the agencies are each attached to nearby settled district bannu dera ismail khan kohat lakki marwat peshawar and t ank and are managed by an assistant political agent apa who reports to the dco of that district although the fr areas are federally administered the provincial government also at times plays role in the frontier regions on account of their proximity to the settled areas and their oversight by dcos who operate in the settled districts the fata covers an area of about 10500 square miles and has population of about 35 million male and female literacy are approximately 30 and 3 respectively and the area suffers from profound lack of infrastructure and basic services 7 notes 1 examining these and other challenges bipartisan group concluded in september 2008 that we find us interests in pakistan are more threatened now than at any

pakistans nwfp and fata 21 i the r ise and s co pe of islamic political influence the history of islamist influence in the pakistani political process has been extensively documented and debated the historical review which follows is simply capsule summary of major trends which have shaped the islamism of the modern frontier as well as discussion of several key patterns of islamic politics which help to frame the contemporary situation as the focus on this work is on the changing dynamics of political islam this narrative focuses in large part on the origins and development of pakistans major islamist parties their interaction with the state and with external actors and the politics which lie behind their agitation this history is essential for framing proper evaluation of the post2001 frontier in which the religious parties and their insurgent affiliates on the political fringe played central role in reshaping the regions political and security environment pre1947 religio political movements the ninety years between the failed uprising of 1857 and the partition of 1947 laid the groundwork for islamic political expression in independent pakistan the history of this period is multifaceted and deeply complex and has received excellent scholarly treatment in several recent works 1 number of important movements arose during this period particularly in the northwest frontier province and the indoafghan borderlands which are worth noting insofar as they set into relief the contemporary political context of the frontier the first of these was the uprising of 1858 which arose in the areas dominated by the yusufzai clan the region now roughly constituting districts buner malakand mardan swabi and swat this region has centurieslong history of alliancesofconvenience between charismatic spiritual leaders and their tribal supporters what began as an internecine struggle between two such power blocs eventually coalesced into overt opposition to the british 2 akhund abdul ghaffur sufi pir saint who succeeded sayyid akbar shah as leader of the swat kingdom cultivated network 24 pakistans islamist frontier of mujahidin who were known to the british as the hindustani fanatics as well as line of murids disciples who would come to have enormous influence in the religious and political development of the adjacent tribal areas3 confrontation unfolded in 1863 between these mujahidin and the british and following pattern which would continue well into the modern era the conflict was eventually resolved along essentially political lines the akhund fearful of the prospect of british armies advancing into an area which had resisted foreign rule for nearly three hundred years turned on his sayyid allies and assisted the british in expelling the mujahidin by assisting the british with their tactical objectives he assured his own continued role in the northern frontier areas and at the same time leveraged the british action to decapitate his leading religiopolitical rival the three decades which followed the swat uprising were by means uneventful for british administrators on the frontier they were forced to confront widespread criminal activity in the indoafghan border areas leading to the enactment of the first frontier crimes regulation in 1873 and engaged in fullscale armed conflict in afghanistan in the second afghan war beginning in 1878 this was significantly period marked by the gradual expansion of british influence in 1881 the railroad reached peshawar in 1893 the border with afghanistan was finally settled and in 1895 british administrators demarcated malakand agency which included the princely states of chitral dir and swat 4 what looked to the british like simple plan of rationalizing oncechaotic frontier policy looked to the tribesmen like scheme designed to encircle coopt and control regions which had for centuries remained autonomous as result the tribes rose up in 1897 against this british expansionism first in malakand and then throughout nearly all the frontier regions 5 the resistance was led in large part by the hadda mullah murid in the line of the late akhund and the hadda mullahs own disciple sartor faqir who was dubbed the mad mullah by the british6 the resistance of 1897 did not last long in the face of largescale british military operations and by 1898 the british had restored peace and effectively extended their writ to the boundaries of what is today the modern frontier the creation of the nwfp as formal political space in 1901 by lord curzon not only influenced the ways in which the british conceived of their project of frontier governance it also by the second decade of the twentieth century began to influence local conceptions of ethnic pashtun identity and create pressures for pashtun participation in the rising tide of panislamism that was creating linkages among muslims in india afghanistan and the arab states in the silk letter conspiracy of 191416 british intelligence uncovered wildly ambitious plot by leading clerics in the united provinces modernday uttar pradesh india to raise an islamic army of pashtun tribesmen in support of the turkish sultan against the british 7 and on the far western front the british became embroiled in third angloafghan war in which the new afghan amir rallied the hindustani fanatics from the tribal areas to afghanistan for jihad 8 all of this was in addition to the regular british expeditions against the fiercely independent mehsud tribes in waziristan important changes in mass politics were also taking shape in the frontier alongside gandhis noncooperation movement designed to pressure the british to honor their prewar rhetoric of selfdetermination muslims launched the khilafat the rise and scope of islamic political influence 25 movement in 1919 which agitated against the proposed abolition of the ottoman caliphate9 one of the stranger subnarratives of the khilafat story was the attempted hijrat migration of tens of thousands of muslims from india into afghanistan in 1920 seeking to cross the durand line into the dar ulislam abode of islam while both the khilafat movement and the hijrat were spectacular failures these move ments marked the first attempt to mobilize panislamic sentiment across the subcontinent and presented the religious clerics of the frontier with an opportunity to rally the pashtun in opposition to the british build networks with other organizers and try their hand at activist politics 10 the locus of islamic agitation in the frontier shifted somewhat in the 1930s and 40s away from swat the peshawar valley and afghanistan proper and toward the tribal agencies in 1930 the government mobilized its largest frontier operations since the war of 1919 in response to lashkars raised by local mullahs and khilafat committees 11 the british were also forced to confront quite regularly the specter of ad hoc tribal militias led by charismatic leaders in waziristan often these lead ers used panislamic language in order to provide veneer of legitimacy for their project of aggregating selfinterested tribal factions against larger neighbor or an external power the faqir of ipi was one famous exemplar of charismatic leadership in waziristan bringing together in 1936 lashkar of mehsuds wazirs and assorted mullahs to conduct raids against the british military 12 his influence would continue well through independence decade later pre1947 the emergence f islamist parties the two major islamic political movements operating in pakistan today both have their antecedents in pre1947 india the first of these are the deobandis this movement traces its roots to modernday uttar pradesh where group of clerics founded the dar ululum deoband in 1866 established in the wake of the failed uprising in 1857 this madrassah became the focal point of wider religious revivalist movement which sought to reconsolidate and refocus the religious and cultural life of the muslim ummah on the subcontinent far from being political the early deobandis were for the most part inwardlooking and primarily concerned with the islamic quality of individual lives 13 through the first world war most deobandi clerics remained apolitical some however came to believe that the revivalist message which began at deoband had to be broadened beyond its pietistic vision so as to include political restoration of the muslim community several of the clerics such as maulana mahmud ulhasan and other faculty at the dar ululum implicated in the silk letter conspiracy sought military response to the dual problems of british rule and muslim disenfranchisement others perhaps the majority of the politicallyminded deobandis entered the political realm by means of the khilafat movement of these clerics great number eventually formalized their political participation by joining the jamiat ulemaehind assembly of indian clerics juh party established in 1919 throughout the 1920s the juh clerics struggled to define their political agen da and their role in the antibritish agitation the partys activist energy however could not be sustained after the failure of the khilafat movement and from the end 26 pakistans islamist frontier of the 1920s to the middle of the 1940s the juh again turned inward focused as in the early days of the dar ululum on aggressive cultural renewal and improving the conditions of the muslim minority by the mid1940s however the majority of the deobandi ulema were longer debating whether or not they ought to engage in politics the question before them was politics toward what end while they shared common opposition to british rule deep fault lines began to emerge surrounding the twonation theory proposed by muhammad ali jinnah and the muslim league and its call for pakistan as homeland for muslims of the indian subcontinent in 1945 the juh split over this issue the promuslim league faction became the jamiat ulemaeislam jui and the juh maintained its affiliation with the indian national congress party arguing that the creation of pakistan would divide and dangerously weaken the muslims of india 14 despite support from the british who sought to blunt the influence of pro congress politics in the frontier the jui performed poorly in the 1946 nwfp elections the results in any case were shortlived in 1947 india was partitioned and nwfp joined the new pakistani state in spite of competition between the juh and the jui which continued right up until the partition neither side was able to gain overwhelming support among the muslims living in the frontier areas there was wide diversity of opinion among the pashtuns as to whether the estab lishment of pakistan was truly in their interest and if it was whether muhammad ali jinnah and the muslim league represented legitimate islamic principles 15 the jui began in the new state with limited influence in the frontier but would in time emerge as one of pakistans leading islamist movements and play major role in post2001 frontier politics the second important movement to emerge out of the prepartition milieu was the jamaateislami ji the jamaat as it is known was founded by deobandi cler ic maulana abul ala mawdudi in 1941 unlike the jui which drew largely from rural support base and recruited the clerical classes the ji sought to recruit technocrats and activists and drew its support predominantly from the devout middle classes of pakistans urban centers 16 opposed to the muslim league the ji was mawdudis attempt to institutionalize movement of islamic renewal among muslims in india the jamaats islamist vision was somewhat different from that of the deobandi clerical class mawdudis ideology emphasized the importance of reforming the state and the legal apparatus and his focus on political transformation influenced the writings of arab islamist intellectuals such as hassan albanna and sayyid qutb 17 as vali nasr has argued in his excellent treatment of mawdudis life and ideology in traditional islam there had been balance between religion as individual piety and religion as social order it was the piety of men that created and sustained religious order in mawdudis formula although individual piety featured prominently in the final analysis it was the society and the political order that guaranteed the piety of the individual very large part of the islamic system of law however needs for its enforcement in all its details the coercive power and authority of the state 18the rise and scope of islamic political influence 27 this ideological bias toward reform of the state in contrast to the original deobandi focus on reforming the individual and society did not emerge fully formed when the jamaat was founded in the early 1940s it was as we will see below shaped profoundly by the creation of pakistan 194769 state formation and islamic identity the opening years of pakistans history were formative period for the countrys two major islamist movements the jui and the ji each of which were wrestling with their role in the first modern islamic state in the first place key leaders in both movements had chosen to support the wrong side in the years leading up to 1947 members of the procongress juh who ended up in pakistan after partition had to pivot to join the jui which adopted more statecentric view of islamization and maulana mawdudi of the jamaat who had outright opposed not only the creation of pakistan believing that he should be the one to found and lead the muslim state of pakistan if there had to be one 19 but also the kashmiri jihad in 1948 was forced to compensate for these decisions by becoming the leading advocate for an islamist pakistan once the religious parties came to terms politically speaking with the creation of the state of pakistan they set out to influence its early development as an islamic institution the jamaat though small numerically was particularly influential in this regard in the first two decades of pakistans history in the early years after partition the party put forward vision of the ideal state as an islamic institution with the shariah as its legal code the jamaats ideology was and remains synthesis of reviv alist islam with an emphasis on preserving the ummah in the face of colonial and neocolonial pressures and modern institutionalist quasitechnocratic islamic vision not unlike that of the muslim brotherhood particularly after the establishment of pakistan mawdudi became convinced that the state was the proper and indeed indispensible vehicle for islamic revival in contrast to the philosophy of the early deobandis the t ablighi jamaat and other revivalist movements of the subcontinent mawdudi argued that individual and social reformation was not possible in the absence of an islamic state structure 20 islam must work from the outsidein21 this fundamentally statecentric logic of the jamaat was brought to bear on mawdudis efforts to influence the framing of the objectives resolution statement of principles that was eventually adopted as an annex to pakistans first constitution in 1956 22 early attempts by the ji and the jui to give the new state substantive islamist character were on the whole unsuccessful many of their failed efforts however set the pattern for future islamist strategies of political agitation for example the t ehrikekhatamenabuwat movement for the finality of the prophethood which pressed for the government to declare the ahmadiyya sect as nonmuslim was harshly suppressed by the government in 1953 but by 1974 after significant public pressure by islamist groups its main objectives had been accommodated in the form of constitutional amendment 2328 pakistans islamist frontier the jamaats early experiences of confrontation with the martial state would also anticipate its future interaction with the military and bureaucratic elite when governor general iskander mirza declared martial law in october 1958 and appointed general ayub khan as chief martial law administrator he did so in part to thwart the designs of the jamaat and its growing involvement in the political process 24 and when ayub khan took control from mirza later that same month and inaugurated his own martial law government the result was the banning of political parties although mawdudi chose to follow pragmatic path that avoided direct confrontation with the military regime perhaps because he was aware of the fate of the muslim brotherhood in egypt the jamaat remained one of the fiercest opponents of ayubs martial rule the basic political orientation of the jamaat during the ayub era was pro democracy antimilitarist and above all antisecularist it resented ayubs modernist experimentation which ran almost directly counter to its vision of the ideal islamic state its popular slogan in the 1960s t ajaddud band karo stop the innovations expressed the spirit of its protest and its fear of polity modeled increasingly along western lines 25 the partys antipathy toward secularism in the ayub era was part and parcel of its antipathy toward the west mawdudi saw the secularizing trends in the arab and persian world and feared that with americas help the ayub regime was charting similar course in language which very much foreshadowed the jamaats rhetoric four decades later he claimed in 1960 that america does not want muslim nations to remain muslim that the americans most unscrupulously support dictatorships against democracy and that their policies are possessed by the devil called jewry in spite of his strident opposition to the atheism of the communist bloc he concluded that the western countries loom upon islam as greater menace than communism 26 on the whole ayubs tenure was an era of vociferous rhetoric by the religious parties but minimal islamist influence the 1965 war with india brought the jamaat and ayub onto the same page for short while but it was only temporary conver gence of interests 27 the islamists influence would begin to change in the decade which followed 197077 islamists and electoral politics the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rise of leftist politics in pakistan led by zulfikar ali bhutto and his pakistan peoples party ppp the religious parties forced to confront the emergence of new mass politics split on the question of socialism the more politicallyminded madani faction deobandis insisted that socialist thought was basically in resonance with the populism and antiimperialism of the prepartition jamiat ulema movements while the less politicallyactive thanwi faction deobandis and pecially the jamaateislami claimed that socialism amounted to kufr infidelity 28 the madani deobandis were ultimately more adept at aligning their politics with the leftism of the time and did so in way that established patterns of jui politics which continue to the present day few expected that it would be mufti mahmud who would take up the mantle of leftist deobandi politics in pakistan born in the southern nwfp district of dera ismail khan in 1919 he studied at deobandi seminary in muradabad in the united the rise and scope of islamic political influence 29 provinces where he became involved in the juh before returning north to teach at madrassah in mianwali pashtundominated district adjacent to dera ismail khan29 during the 1940s the mufti formed close ties with the procongress maulana husain ahmad madani traveling with him in nwfp in 1943 and began building political base in his home district by the late 1960s the mufti had inherited the socialistleaning madani wing of the jui and had developed an active pashtun constituency in the southern nwfp and the tribal agencies 30 when it came time for the 1970 elections mufti mahmuds jui did not fare par ticularly well with one notable exception the mufti himself managed an upset victory over zulfikar ali bhutto chairman of the ppp in the hotly contested national assembly seat from dera ismail khan the muftis political stature and influence among the jui ulema particularly in the frontier paid off once bhutto came to power as president in late 1971 following the war which saw the defeat of pakistan and the creation of bangladesh seeking to form government bhutto mufti mahmud and wali khan of the great red shirt movement leader khan abdul ghaffar khan of the national awami party nap signed t ripartite agreement in 1972 that set up joint juinap government in nwfp 31 on may 1 1972 mufti mahmud was sworn in as chief minister the juinap government was not to last for more than ten months32 it was how ever the first instance of religious party coming to power in pakistan and it served as high water mark for deobandi influence in the political arena mufti mahmuds agenda as chief minister would set the tone for the next 30 years of jui politics he began vigorous islamization program banned alcohol introduced an islamic reform of the inheritance law and mandated the observance of ramadan he further though unsuccessfully set out to grant interestfree loans establish an ulema advi sory board make reading of the quran and study of arabic compulsory for university admission require women to be veiled in public insist that the shalwarkamiz tunic to be mandatory for government servants ban dowry and prohibit gambling 33 the muftis tenure was brief and unsuccessful but once his government fell he seemed not dissuaded in the least his politics in the final years of bhuttos democratic era involved the proposal of increasingly sweeping and stringent islamicoriented legislation including antiblasphemy amendments to the constitution in 1974 he took the lead with maulana yusuf binori of the famous madaniinfluenced binori madrassah in karachi to once again raise this time successfully legislation that would declare ahmadis as nonmuslims 34 zulfikar bhutto went along with these islamist initiatives in the latter years of his tenure in an effort to strengthen his increasingly tenuous political position by the time zia ulhaq took power in 1977 the jui of mufti mahmud had grown into serious and vociferous political voice in pakistan its association with the socialist ppp and its simultaneous use of islamist rhetoric and promotion of shariah agenda led many to dismiss it as hypocritical expedient and cynically pragmatic movement that was only committed to keeping itself alive and not an ideological organization fighting for given cause 35 the early reticence by madani deobandis to create an islamic society from above had been washed away by the opportunities that partition presented them to redefine their politics and make themselves newly relevant to state and society 30 pakistans islamist frontier 197788 zia ul haq and islami zation zia and the jamaat general zia ulhaq seized power in coup détat in july 1977 and quickly declared martial law his tenure marked period of tremendous expansion of islamist influence in pakistani politics the contours of which are now well known zia began drive to islamize pakistans institutions from the army to the courts to the bureaucracy he propagated the hudood ordinance revised the penal code to make blasphemy capital crime and promulgated number of token islamic reforms which nonetheless sent powerful message about the ideological character of the state 36 it was program that he would continue for 11 years until his death in 198837 the jamaats domestic policy during this era was consumed with the question of whether to give precedence to zias program of islamization or to hold to the partys democratic principles and insist on civilian governance after much internal disagreement mawdudis successor mian tufail decided that the opportunity to do away with bhutto and institutionalize the shariah program of the jamaat was too appealing to pass up the party became partner with zia and contributed several cabinet members to his government 38 the jamaats governance experience during the early years of the zia regime was on the whole disappointing aside from khurshid ahmad who promoted new policies for zakat and banking the ministers were unable to stir the federal bureaucracy into implementing their shariah agenda 39 their influence was more pronounced however in the council of islamic ideology where jamaat nominees helped to formulate new package of islamic penal reforms and most of all in the military where they were given unprecedented access to the senior officer ranks this became most evident during the afghan jihad where the ji was mobilized to take on major role the years of the afghan jihad under zia are often characterized as the heyday of the jamaat and in sense they did represent the apex of the partys influence in official circles but the narrative linking military rule and islamic politics is not as clean cut as some observers would make it just as there was sporadic and symbiotic manipulation between the military and the religious parties during the ayub era punctuated by periods of outright hostility so the relationship between zia and the jamaat played out in complex and ambivalent ways even in the heady early days of the jihad some elements within the party were less than enthusiastic about the martial government they considered the opportunities that came from partnership with zia to be distraction from the real political vision of the movement it was therefore only matter of time before the jamaat became disil lusioned with its stepchild role in the zia government and in the jihad operations 40 by 1982 the relationship had begun to sour zia was feeling more confident in his support from the united states and from the ulema and at the same time more concerned about the potential for the jamaat to mobilize its wellorganized student base against him 41 after the 1985 nonparty elections in which jamaataffiliated candidates performed poorly the split was complete the results demonstrated to zia that the jamaat had lost its influence and he turned to other parties for popular support 42the rise and scope of islamic political influence 31 the deobandis and the afghan jihad the jui had much more limited interaction than the jamaat with zias govern ment as such by the early 1980s the jui like the ji was disillusioned with zias reforms and began agitating for return to civilian rule but the deobandis were ultimately shaped in profound ways during the zia era through their participation in the afghan jihad and by the patronage they received from the state the jihadi campaign against soviet forces in afghanistan funded by the americans and saudis and operated by the pakistani intelligence services resulted in the establishment of hundreds of madaris throughout the frontier not only did the madaris proliferate but their quality deteriorated markedly throughout the 1980s the jihadi ideology became more important than mastery of traditional scholarly subjects the careful and comprehensive curriculum designed by the founders at dar ululum gave way to mass education that was decidedly more ideological in character in one respect the education system itself changed from model which valued extended study under learned alim to one that promoted some thing of freelance franchise model these changes did not take place in vacuum they were part and parcel of the jihad in afghanistan conflict which fundamen tally altered the face of deobandism particularly in the frontier many of the muja hidin were trained in nwfp either by or with deobandi compatriots and leading deobandi ulema including mufti mahmud in dera ismail khan and mufti yusuf binori in karachi issued fatawa encouraging jihad against the soviet infidels these new legitimating ideologies of jihad that had previously not held significant place in deobandi religious thought combined with newly decentralized educational infrastructure facilitated the rapid spread of radical ideologies in the frontier the jihad also began to change in basic ways the role of the ulema in pashtun society t raditionally the village mullah did not have separate political role outside the scope of his religious duties 43 the ulema were able to operate in political role only if they managed to leverage their religious credibility in the pursuit of power politics akbar ahmeds account of how maulvi nur muhammad disciple of mufti mahmud played this game beginning in the 1950s in south waziristan is an example of the ways in which some leading clerics learned to control islam rather than be controlled by it that is to impose religious frame on secular issue so as to wield religious language for nonreligious ends 44 in this way the mullah functioned opportunistically as political mobilizer sparring for influence with tribal elders and government officials 45 such figures are still prominent in pashtun society today indeed one could argue that the current generation of jui leadership largely operates in this mold leveraging the symbolism of islam in order to mobilize what is essentially political base the real legacy of the afghan jihad however is to be found not only in the proliferation of the madrassahasfranchise culture of the 1980s but in the alim asentrepreneur culture which followed it lowerlevel ulema benefited only indirectly from state patronage during the jihad following the end of the war and the withdrawal of foreign involvement these poorly trained clerics product of the theologically shallow madaris that had proliferated throughout the province 32 pakistans islamist frontier found themselves unemployable or at least discouraged by the bleak prospects available outside of the jihadi line of work46 these ulema vali nasr argues began to stake out their own claim to power and wealth satiating appetites for power status and wealth that islamization had whetted but left unsatiated 47 the secondorder effects of the emergence of this new class were also in retro spect of great import both the prestige and the external financing which came with the jihadi vocation began to upend the traditional social order particularly in the tribal areas t ribal elders including those maliks who served as paid liaisons between the tribes and the states political agent found their standing undermined by new groups of entrepreneurial youth this trend dovetailed with the explosion of remittance income from the gulf states in the 1970s which further reshaped in dramatic ways the political economy of the tribal areas 48 the systems of indirect rule which the state had relied upon for over century began to deteriorate in the face of new regional and economic realities the afghan jihad and the politicaleconomic shifts which it occasioned opened the door to new forms of islamism in the frontier it brought to the forefront new clerical class largely deobandi in orientation which was both more diffuse and more ideologically entrepreneurial than its antecedents it was these petty ulema many of whom to be clear had only loose connections to the scholarly deobandi establishment who in part carried on the most destructive aspects of the jihad into the postzia era the proliferation of small arms and the development of the socalled kalashnikov culture the entrenchment of sectarian movements and their ideologiesofdifference 49 and perhaps most dangerously the creation of vast cadre of both ideological and opportunistic veteran jihadis beholden in only the most tenuous fashion to the state system the jihad also fundamentally reshaped the demographic profile of the frontier the influx of refugees from afghanistan beginning in the early 1980s eventually reached staggering figures many estimates put the number above 3 million 50 peshawar once dominated by speakers of hindko punjabi dialect was soon filled with pashtospeaking afghans who quickly overwhelmed the education and social service capacity of the provincial government and came to dominate the transportation sector and important routes of the smuggling trade the sprawl ing refugee camps near peshawar and the tribal belt became over time mujahidin recruitment centers even long after the end of the jihad and the soviet with drawal from afghanistan this afghanization of the pakistani frontier was complemented by the stant stream of foreigners who passed through peshawar during the 1980s seek ing to stoke the jihad and serve as facilitators for panislamist cadres in their own countries these foreigners hailed from the arab world chechnya and the horn of africa among their ranks were most infamously abdullah azzam founder of the maktab alkhidmat the precursor to qaeda and osama bin laden the broad international participation in jihadi activity in the frontier in the 1980s foreshadowed the post911 environment in which the frontier would once again become proving ground for young religious militants from the farflung corners of the muslim worldthe rise and scope of islamic political influence 33 19882001 fragmented politics political realignments 198893 the first two civilian governments which came to power in islamabad after more than decade of martial rule faced host of problems in asserting civilian domi nance over an entrenched militarybureaucratic complex this was period of rela tively minimal political involvement for the deobandi clerics and one of indecision for the jamaat which was torn between its antimartial idealism and the pressures of political expediency benazir bhuttos ppp garnered plurality of votes in the elections held after zias death in 1988 and managed to form government in the face of rival electoral alliance orchestrated by the isi the islami jamhuri ittihad iji which included the jamaat and promilitary mainstream parties the iji leveraged islamist rhetoric played on fears of female prime minister and argued for the necessity of continuing the jihad in afghanistan even in defeat the iji parties continued to be thorn in bhuttos side her govern ment which lasted less than two years was hobbled by the awkward powersharing arrangement with president ghulam ishaq khan and chief of army staff aslam beg as well as local competition from punjab chief minister nawaz sharif the jamaat though it had played major role in the ijis election campaign was never entirely comfortable with its place in the promilitary alliance in 1987 qazi hussain ahmad had taken over leadership of the jamaat from mawdudis successor mian tufail as an ethnic pashtun qazi hussain was the first nonmohajir to lead the party since it inception in 1941 and was more sympathetic than his predecessors to populist political mobilization 51 under his leadership the jamaat retained its ideo logical focus on islamization but broadened its political agenda to include populist agitation and more rhetoric on socioeconomic issues this orientation did not always fit comfortably with the ijis political approach the jis ambivalent relationship with the promilitary block in the postzia era was also accelerated by domestic political realignments which were threatening its hold on its traditional base of support among the mohajir community the rise of the mohajir qaumi movement mqm in karachi in the late 1980s rise engineered in part by zia and the army to weaken the jamaat left the party casting about for new constituencies qazi hussains ethnic background and islamicthemed populism allowed the jamaat to broaden its base of support among the nonmohajir middle classes in punjab and perhaps most importantly into the pashtun frontier areas as result of these shifts the jamaat played very vocal but relatively insignifi cant role in the five years following the return to democratic rule its politics were almost consistently contrarian during the 1988 campaign it joined the promilitary iji reluctantly in march 1990 upset at the ijis pressure on the army to overthrow the ppp government the jamaat looked for an excuse to back away from the alli ance it found it as it so often did by pivoting around foreign policy issue and announcing its principled intention to stand with benazir bhutto in her support 34 pakistans islamist frontier of the kashmiri independence movement52 when it became clear several months later that the iji was on track to win the new elections the ji in shrewd act of bandwagoning at last decided to rejoin and again used an international issue to pivot domestically in this case opposition to the us decertification of pakistan under the pressler amendment but once again the jamaat would chart its own way dissatisfied with the ijis fail ure to carry out islamic reforms the party once again became disillusioned and one again turned to foreign policy in order to provide convenient cover for its pivot with respect to domestic politics when the iji government decided to accept settlement to the conflict in afghanistan the jamaat crowed that it was selling out the mujahidin and betraying the path of jihad it quit the iji in may 1992 and began agitation against the nawaz government that lasted until its fall in april 1993 new islamist movements 199399 the final six years of democratic governance in the late 1990s saw second terms for benazir bhutto 199396 and nawaz sharif 199699 this was period full of significant developments including financial crisis pakistans first nuclear test the rise of the t aliban in afghanistan and war over kashmir from the perspective of religious politics both the deobandis and the jamaat played foundational roles during this era in faciliating the emergence of new islamist movements the most visible of these new movements was the t aliban led by mullah muhammad omar and seeded from the extensive network of deobandi madaris which had sprung up in the pakistani frontier areas after the afghan jihad as noted above the jihad not only resulted in proliferation of madaris but spawned new trepreneurial class of clerics whose ties to the deobandi establishment were informal at best many of the talibs students who eventually joined the t aliban movement had studied at sami ulhaqs dar ulhaqqania madrassah outside of peshawar and many others at madani deobandi madaris in karachi 53 at the time the jui leaders went out of their way to highlight their connections with and influence over the burgeoning t aliban movement in reality their influence on the new movement was overstated they had been overtaken by the entrepreneurial character of deobandi politics in the frontier it was the poorly educated ideologically hardened disenfranchised ulema who formed the core of the movement responding to this trend the traditional leaders had gravitated toward the role of broker trading on access influence and rhetoric to mediate between institutions governments madaris political parties and the organic movements themselves perhaps political figure was so adept at this as maulana fazlur rehman of mufti mahmud who threw his support behind benazir bhutto during her second term but was also like nearly every element of the pakistani militarypolitical establishment including bhutto herself providing rhetorical and logistical support to the ta l i b n 54 the support for the t aliban among deobandi figures in pakistan was largely attributable to their shared history among the madaris and the opportuni ties which the taliban movement presented to the pakistani clerics for advancing the rise and scope of islamic political influence 35 their own political agendas but the pashtunization of the pakistani deobandis was also major contributing factor the t aliban represented set of obscurantist and supposedly islamic values many of which would have shocked the early scholarly deobandis in reality their aims were more closely aligned with the spread of conservative pashtun values than with any grand islamic vision the deobandi experience in the frontier had produced over time syncretic form of sunni islam and one in which as practical matter pashtunwali trumped traditional hanafi interpretations although the jamaat was not at the forefront of the t alibans advance into afghanistan it did play role indirectly in the emergence of another islamist movement during this period the t ehrikenifazeshariatemuhammadi tnsm or movement for the system of the shariah of muhammad was established in 1989 in district dir part of the malakand administrative division in the northern mountainous region of the frontier province the region which became known as malakand division was originally constituted by princely states these independent states acceded to pakistan in 1969 55 but by the mid1970s there was agitation in district dir over the rights of local merchants to timber royalties and local movement formed which demanded return to the more favorable legal status quo which was operative before 1969 56 in response to the demands from malakand division zulfikar ali bhutto imposed new system of tribal law in the area this system in turn was challenged in the peshawar high court by lawyers from malakand during the first prime ministership of benazir bhutto and was eventually overturned the legal wrangling over the tribal law created an opening into which maulana sufi muhammad the first amir of the tnsm rallied members of the movement to demand shariah as the proper successor to the system of tribal law the movement was also not surprisingly able to rally local smugglers and timber merchants to the cause 57 the maulana and his followers were not highly educated ideologues in the traditional mold of the jamaat they drew for example on antimodernist wahhabi influences as well but they did have linkages to the ji and their focused insistence on the implementation of the shariah was resonant with the partys political approach 58 eventually the state relented to the tnsms demands and in may 1994 promulgated shariah ordinance for malakand which was to remain in effect for four months59 the ordinance instituted qazi courts which were to be enforced by the provincial government60 the tnsm conducted further protests after the ordinance expired and the conflict turned violent eventually an agreement was reached between the tnsm and the government in which the state adopt ed handsoff approach to the areas around malakand the new shariah system resulted in few facto changes to the structure of governance and the state avoid ed intrusive taxation policies which might inflame local religious sentiment 61 the policy was effective in muting the impact of the tnsm for seven years only following the us attacks in afghanistan after 911 was the movement again able to mobilize the masses around cause36 pakistans islamist frontier return to military rule 19992001 pervez musharraf s coup in october 1999 brought return of military rule one of the most notable aspects of the two years which followed was musharraf s policy of supporting an enlightened moderation with respect to domestic affairs while continuing vigorous state support for kashmiri militant groups and for the t aliban shortly before the coup nawaz sharif had been under pressure by the united states to reverse course on pakistans policy toward the t aliban and the army coup was at least in part an attempt to forestall that change 62 the governments support for the pashtun t aliban was extensive and the state in telligence services also provided protective cover over qaeda members operating in pakistan including the northwest frontier 63 in may 2000 musharraf publicly attested to his support for the t aliban i just want to say that there is difference of understanding on who is terrorist the perceptions are different in the united states and in pakistan in the west and what we understand is terrorism afghanistans majority ethnic pashtuns have to be on our side this is our national interest the t aliban cannot be alienated by pakistan we have national security interest there 64 the states support of the t aliban much of which was covert was facilitat ed in part by the pakistani religious parties most notably the deobandi jui in july 2001 human rights watch reported that retired senior pakistani military officer claimed in an interview with human rights watch that up to 30 percent of taliban fighting strength is made up of pakistanis serving in units organized by pakistani political parties 65 on account of the extensive links which had been established in the 1980s between the deobandi political establishment and the pakistani intelligence services the jui by and large had only muted response to the military coup in 1999 the partys investment in the t aliban precluded it from taking more confrontational approach to the return of military rule the jamaat by contrast had considerably less political investment in the t aliban movement and realized that for all of the states support for t aliban and kashmiri islamist proxies musharraf would be unlikely to make even halfhearted attempts at expanding the reach of islamist legal or political influence the party thus conducted protests following the coup qazi hussain was temporarily banned from the nwfp and party activities were closely monitored by the government to prevent domestic unrest 66 patterns f islamic politics there are several recurring themes which emerge from the brief narrative above regarding the ways in which islamic politics and religious parties in particular have developed in the pakistani context these patterns form an important contextual backdrop to understanding the rise of the mma in 2002 and the subsequent fragmentation of islamism in the frontierthe rise and scope of islamic political influence 37 mutual manipulation much has been made of the pakistan armys use of the islamists this nexus com monly known as the mullahmilitary alliance is seen to be at the heart of the states duplicity with respect to islamic militancy ie its history of selectively empowering and undercutting islamist actors in the pursuit of political ends 67 this story contains great deal of truth the militarys cultivation of islamist fighters during the afghan jihad and subsequently during the kashmiri infiltrations established deep linkages between the militarybureaucratic complex and the web of islamist parties and militant groups the mullahmilitary nexus is however more complicated story than is commonly portrayed it is relationship anchored in mutual manipulation and one which has produced at least as much antagonism as cooperation the mili tary often used the islamists for domestic or foreign policy ends to distract from the unpopularity of martial government or antagonize india or extend its sphere of influence into afghanistan but it is also evident that the islamists were not infrequently at odds with pakistans martial regimes the religious parties bitterly opposed ayub khan even during zia ulhaqs martial government as the mutual manipulation reached its zenith with the armys instrumentalization of the religious parties for the jihad and the islamists attempts to garner state funds and press for islamist reforms the partnership was shortlived by the mid 1980s the relationship had soured and groups like the jamaat were again deeply disillusioned with the martial state leveraging external events second as might be expected from any political movement the islamists have long history of leveraging external events in order to advance their political standing at home this was true for both the deobandis and for the jamaat though they tended to focus on different regions and issues for the modern jui afghanistan was always the dominant external issue around which the party would pivot politically the juis predominantly pashtun base felt strong connection to the pashtuns in afghanistan and as consequence of its historical ties to deoband was often ambivalent about the fierce antiindian rhetoric of the martial governments 68 the jamaat adopted considerably more panislamic perspective drawing on events in the wider islamic world to incrementally advance its standing at home it was particularly adept at fomenting public outrage over foreign events for the pur pose of forcing the sitting government in islamabad to make show of its islamic credentials it vigorously criticized pakistans early prowestern orientation became deeply involved in supporting the kashmir insurgencies in the 1990s vocally opposed the american war to oust saddam hussain from kuwait and stoked the violent protests against salman rushdie in 1988 this broader internationalist out look reflected the jamaats loose ties to the muslim brotherhood and its historical panislamism which saw the islamization of pakistan as an important catalyzing event for wider global islamist movement38 pakistans islamist frontier shifting constituencies third islamist movements have been forced to respond to the shifting charac ter of their own constituencies this is especially true for islamist parties which pend on electoral support from particular demographic blocs the early deobandis for example had long history of interaction with madaris in afghanistan and the tribal areas but the movement did not begin as one dominated by ethnic pashtuns the afghan jihad accelerated the process of pashtunization among the deobandi parties in pakistan process which has resulted in the emergence of jui factions which often put greater emphasis on ethnic and regional issues than on the broader implementation of islamic revivalism throughout pakistan 69 the jamaat too has seen dramatic changes to its constituent base since partition founded on an appeal to punjabi and mohajir urban religiosity the party was weak ened by the rise of the mqm in karachi in the 1980s which cut into its voter base the selection of qazi hussain as amir in 1987 and the partys efforts to broaden its appeal to pashtun constituency subsequently realigned the jamaats approach to mobilizing its political base most notably it increased its focus on issues relat ing to foreign influence in afghanistan and played off of gender issues eg condemning genderintegrated events in way that was likely to appeal to the socially conservative pashtun population limited electoral influence prior to 2002 pakistans islamists had put forward very poor showing in elec toral politics at the most they were fringe players in parliament garnering more than 12 of national assembly seats 70 even their parliamentary high water marks were not especially substantive the 1970 mufti mahmud government in nwfp in 1970 collapsed after less than year the jamaat received cabinet positions in the early years of the zia ulhaq regime but made little headway outside of some reforms in islamic banking and maulana fazlur rehman was given the chairmanship of the foreign affairs committee during the second benazir bhutto government but implemented significant policy changes in spite of this limited success in the electoral arena the islamist parties have ex erted an influence disproportionate to their electoral strength this has come about in large part because of their effectiveness at mobilizing their political bases and their skill at using islamic identity and islamist goals as wedge issues by which to pressure the mainstream and martial governments into adopting aspects of an islamic platform divergent islamisms islamism in pakistan is frequently portrayed as something of monolith as an organized and disciplined group of activists pressing for coherent vision of an islamic state the reality is more multifaceted even the two major islamic political blocs the jamaat and the juif have distinctly different visions of an islamic state and society and have often been at odds with one another the parties for example had the rise and scope of islamic political influence 39 notably different views on the t aliban71 the jis outlook is deeply ideological mod ernist and panislamic its urban middleclass constituents are primarily concerned with restructuring the legal and political order the juif by contrast is relatively pragmatic party with rural clerical constituency whose objectives are to protect the madrassah system from state interference and promote conservative interpretation of pashtun social values which they defend as islamic it should come as surprise that these two movements have often found themselves on different sides of the politi cal space in pakistan and prior to 2002 did not join together in any meaningful way to advance common agenda the parties organizational structures also reflect and shape the ways in which they approach their islamist agendas the jamaat leadership runs the party like modern corporation with wellstaffed headquarters outside lahore wide range of publica tions relatively meritocratic policies of promotion strong party discipline an array of affiliations with international islamist organizations and focus on ideological training the jui parties operate more loosely with much of their political activity taking place outside of formal party committees key decisions by the juif are routinely made by fazlur rehman and traveling coterie of personal advisors and the party has only recently invested in wellequipped headquarters 72 the combination of charismatic leadership and decentralized party structure has led to nearly constant dissention within the juif most of which is dealt with informally in pashtunstyle shuras and quiet deals these two major islamist parties are often considered mainstream not because they meet the standards of western liberalism but because they participate in electoral politics and generally eschew violence aside from these parties pakistan is also home to great number of smaller islamist groups including militant jihadi organizations sectarian militias and vigilante islamist movements these groups tend to be more localized in nature and operate outside of the formal political space their islamist objectives vary wildly some like the tnsm make their appeals to the state much as would the jamaat others like the waziri movements in the early twentieth century and again today confront the state and fundamentally question its writ and others like the sectarian sipahesahaba for the most part ignore the state focusing their attention on cleansing pakistan of infidels who take the name of islam balancing and bandwagoning islamist groups having consistently been minority players in pakistani politics have employed various strategies to obtain political advantage visàvis the state and their local opponents as an ideological and politically revisionist movement the jamaat has typically chosen to balance against the state by allying itself with opposition movements those cases in which it partnered with the state such as during the zia era were relatively shortlived the deobandi political leadership by contrast has proven to be relatively less driven by ideological motivations and more attuned to patronage incentives from the state its strategy for the most part has been to bandwagon with the ruling party so as to ensure that it retains access to state resources40 pakistans islamist frontier these general patterns change somewhat at the local level particularly in areas which have history of tribal governance such as the fata and presentday swat in these regions islamist political behavior is often less related to ideology or patronage concerns than it is to established patterns of group conflict which appear in segmentary lineage tribal systems these are patterns in which small tribes or factions partner with the state or with other small factions to take on dominant faction in their own area this kind of perpetual balancing and the highly provisional alliances which make it possible are regular features of religious politics in the tribal areas and ones which are integral to understanding islamism in the contemporary frontier it is important for example to realize that when islamist groups in the tribal areas ally with the state they usually do so in the pursuit of political advantage visàvis local rivals rather than in allegiance to state authority or shared political ends splinter groups and market segmentation the pakistani islamist scene is replete with splinter groups and political rivalries this tendency toward factionalization occurs primarily in three ways in the first case splinter groups are formed as result of political rivalries grounded in personality poli tics this is not to suggest that ideology does not play role often it does it is rather that factional leaders leverage minor ideological differences in order to bring about political fragmentation which results in new faction under their leadership in other instances the factionalization is simply result of patronage considerations ie contests over which leader can bring more resources to the community in the second case islamist groups splinter because of real ideological differences some of the early deobandi disputes for example centered around basic questions of the proper role of the clerical class in the political sphere most ideological splits upon close examination actually implicate personality politics to considerable degree the third case is the most complex and arguably the most important in this scenario islamist groups splinter as result of methodological differences these disputes center around questions such as what do we do if the state does not accept our demand for islamization and what forms of protest are appropriate sometimes these splits are the result of real disputes regarding the proper limits of islamization in which hardcore faction frustrated with the political vacillations of mainstream politicallyoriented body splits off and starts new movement other times these splits are ones of convenience in which islamist groups imple ment form of market segmentation whereby they spin off politically unpalatable but strategically useful islamist agitation into separate entity with which they retain formal affiliation this approach offers several advantages to given movement most essentially it allows the movement to retain its place in the political center as respected islamist entity operating within the bounds of legality at the same time it facilitates the creation of hardcore factions which can perform specific tasks eg sectarian agitation without damaging the reputation of the movement as whole and finally it establishes informal linkages between political and militant factions linkages which can be used as channels for recruitment or the provision of resources or as vehicles through which to extend political protections to militants who may run afoul of the lawthe rise and scope of islamic political influence 41 deobandi politics is replete with these kind of linkages parties such as the jui have historically been careful to remain in the political mainstream and act in accordance with democratic and constitutional norms but have also cultivated links with movements such as the t aliban and today the neot aliban sectarian groups such as sipahesahaba and kashmiri militant organizations such as harkat ulmujahidin 73 not entirely unlike the bifurcation of political and militant wings of the irish republican army or hamas the deobandi establishment has produced network of segmented organizations which together advance an overarching political or social agenda this segmentation model as will be explored below can present challenges to islamist groups most notably in that political factions can rarely rely on militant factions to remain pliable and subservient to the movements broadly political agenda segmentation also however provides secondary advantage to the religious par ties both the jui and the jamaat have learned to leverage their positions as political organizations in order to serve as middlemen between the state and the various militant factions to which they are linked in this respect the deobandi parties have focused their efforts on the western afghan front positioning themselves as occasional bro kers between the government and t aliban groups in the tribal areas the jamaats link ages by contrast have proven particularly useful to the state in support of antiindian incursions on the eastern kashmiri front 74 often these parties are asked to serve as interlocutors in secret negotiations but just as often they take up the cause of mili tant groups in public fora either to rally their own political base or to express by proxy certain strategic interests of the state which cannot be expressed on an official basis 75 notes see especially sana haroon

frontier today faces new and troubling array of insurgent threats religious parties like the juif and the jamaat appear to have been eclipsed by new move ments and longer set the tone for islamist discourse why then is narrative of the mmas tenure still relevant in the contemporary context it matters for two reasons first even though the religious parties are longer in governing role and longer command the influence they did even several years ago the relationship between mainstream democratic islamists and the new insurgent movements is critical dynamic in understanding islamism in the frontier the promises and demands of groups such as t ehriket alibanepakistan ttp the tnsm in swat and the lashkareislami li in khyber are not very far removed from those of the mma six years ago the tactics and organization of such groups to be sure differ in profound ways from those of the mma but the continuities are equally important absent the historical backdrop of the mmas tenure it would be easy to miss the quasipolitical nature of groups like the tnsm and li it would also be easy to misconstrue the complex relationships between the democratic islamists and the new insurgent groups relationships which may figure prominently in the ability of the state to eventually bring insurgents into the political mainstream second taking longer view the mma constitutes worthwhile case study of islamist governance in practice there are few instances in south asia in which islamists have moved from an oppositional and agitational role to one of actual governance the dynamics of this shift can reveal important clues about the ways in which islamist leaders change rhetorically politically and organizationally when they are forced to interact with domestic and foreign interlocutors in this respect the experience of the mma may be able to shed light on both the promises and the limits of the political process in bounding the more problematic aspects of islamism particularly in pakistani context 148 pakistans islamist frontier the r ise f the mu ttahida m ajliseamal regional context the rise of the islamist alliance in 2002 cannot be understood apart from the american invasion of afghanistan in late 2001 which immediately became the cause célèbre of the religious parties and gave them an electoral issue with strong regional ethnic and religious appeal not surprisingly it was pashtun religious politicians such as maulana fazlur rehman of the juif maulana sami ulhaq of the juis and qazi hussain ahmad of the ji who were best positioned to make use of islamic rage in the wake of american operations against the pashtun t aliban in afghanistan 2 in retrospect it appears natural that these politicians and their respective religious parties would coalesce into an alliance opposing the american war in afghanistan but in fact the parties had long history of dysfunctional interac tion and had never before formed broadbased islamist alliance 3 in the year preceding 911 there were signs that such an alliance was increasingly possible but it seems to have taken prodding from former isi chief hamid gul to coalesce the islamists into pakafghan defense council which in 2002 became the basis for the muttahida majliseamal mma electoral alliance 4 the sixparty alliance brought together the pashtundominated juif and juis the jamaateislami the jamiat ulemaepakistan jup barelvi party led by maulana shah ahmed noorani the jamiat ahlehadith jah saudiinfluenced wahhabi party led by sajid mir and the islami t ehrikepakistan itp shia party formerly known as t ehrikejafaria pakistan tjp and led by allama sajid naqvi 5 the formation of this broadbased alliance served the interests of the pakistani state by stoking prot aliban sentiment in the pakafghan border areas but also by fostering the perception to the americans in particular that islamism was on the rise in the frontier and that only strong militaryexecutive power in islamabad could prop erly check this emergent danger domestic context the domestic situation was also unusually favorable to the islamists president musharraf had instituted governors rule in the nwfp after his 1999 coup and the 2002 polls were to be the first general elections since 1997 two parties which had traditionally been dominant in the frontier the ppp and the pashtun nationalist anp were both weak fragmented and demoralized the mma found it especially easy to impugn the credibility of the nationalists who had supported musharraf s post911 capitulation to the americans 6 the mma alliance also benefited from support by the state which recognized that the islamists could serve as useful proxy by which the musharraf government could decapitate its chief political rivals in the frontier the ppp pmln and anp musharraf s own pmlq faced grim prospects outside of the nonpashtun hazara division in the eastern part of the province and the isolated pml bastion of lakki marwat in the south and the islamists therefore presented secondthe mmas islamist governance 49 best solution to the ruling partys political quandary in the nwfp particularly in those areas in which representatives of the central government and security services could not convince local powerbrokers to support weak pmlq candidate they often asked them to throw their weight instead behind the religious parties 7 the role of the pakistani security services in the 2002 nwfp elections has been much disputed some commentators have suggested in retrospect that the islamists victory was entirely engineered by the isi the reality is that the manipulation was significant but subtle rather than engaging in largescale elec toral manipulation the services chose instead to stifle the mainstream parties while allowing religious leaders free hand in capitalizing on the wave of antiamerican sentiment in the frontier 8 the governments assistance to the religious alliance took several forms first the mainstream and nationalist parties were given only narrow window of time before the elections in which to campaign and counter the mmas electoral rhetoric this restriction perhaps more than anything else played to the advantage of the islamists who were able to organize blatantly political religious gatherings in mosques and madaris throughout the province beginning weeks and even months before the official start of the campaign season the result was the creation of an organizational vacuum that the mma was easily able to fill second the election commission further boosted the prospects of the mma by arbitrarily assigning to it the official electoral symbol of the book the alliances leadership wasted time in playing up the religious significance of the symbol claiming the book to be the quran and the mma to be the undisputed party of learning third federal electoral statutes holding that candidates must possess certain educational qualifications typically bachelors degree were interpreted by the federal government so as not to disqualify candidates who held certificates from the madaris this was great boon to the jui many of whose members did not have degrees from accredited institutions and finally some mma candidates were reportedly aided by the quiet withdrawal of criminal cases against them in advance of their nomination papers being scrutinized this process was welldocumented in the case of mma leaders in balochistan and there is good reason to believe that the same process took place in the nwfp by late 2002 the conflict in afghanistan had given the mma potent political issue and electoral momentum not only did the ruling elites in islamabad find it unnecessary to use blunt instruments of electoral manipulation in support of the mma but doing so would have posed special challenges unlike the feudal poli tics of punjab and sindh pashtun politics in nwfp is decidedly more egalitarian and the security services have historically found it more challenging to engage in wholesale votebuying and intimidation in the frontier than in the other prov inces 9 and in fact the extent of the mmas success proved surprising even to those agencies which were charged with facilitating its victory many in the security services reportedly underestimated the extent of the mmas popularity in the peshawar valley and malakand areas 1050 pakistans islamist frontier electoral strategy and mobilization the mma alliance was originally formed around relatively narrow afghanistan focused agenda as it began campaigning in 2002 however the mma gradually adopt ed more robust platform unlike the mainstream parties which relied on charismatic party leadership or the ethnonationalist parties which relied on set of ethnicallycharged historical grievances the jui and the ji brought complementary methods of mobilization to the alliances campaign strategy the jui drew on its madaris network for massmobilization and the jamaat under the leadership of qazi hussain was able to tap burgeoning network of pashtun political workers in the frontier who could leverage the partys famously disciplined bureaucracy what began as protopolitical movement oriented against western military action in afghanistan became over the course of the campaign fairly robust alliance however vague or unrealistic its promises may have been the mma was arguably the electoral bloc which articulated the most forceful prochange agenda of any party contesting the elections 11 this change agenda was not only reactive but also sweepingly proactive the mma promised the institution of true islamic system in the frontier including the prohibition of obscene material on cable television the provision of islamic banking and the conversion of the provincial assembly into an islamic jirga 12 other pledges were considerably more vague such as the curtailing of unislamic work by ngos and foreign elements the enforcement of islamic justice the imposition of the shariah into the provincial framework of law and the promotion of policies signed to encourage the use of head coverings much as mufti mahmud had done in 1970 the mma wove this islamic reform agenda together with rhetoric of populist governance an approach which in many ways echoed the language of the ppp 13 drawing on its lower and middleclass roots the religious alliance put forward strikingly populist campaign that equated islamic political reforms with propoor agenda 14 the mmas plan for its first hundred days promised the creation of half million new jobs free education through the secondary level interestfree loans for lowcost housing cheap medications and oldage allowances 15 accounting for islamism it was not surprising that the juif would prove successful in the conservative southern districts bordering afghanistan or that the jamaat would gain solid support in outlying areas such as district dir what surprised analysts was the mmas success in making inroads into areas that had previously been almost offlimits to religious politics such as the pashtun agricultural heartland of the peshawar valley regions like malakand division in which anp and ppp had traditionally held sway and even pml strongholds such as hazara division capturing remarkable 48 of 99 provincial assembly seats and 29 of 35 national assembly seats from the frontier the mmas victory in 2002 was dramatic realignment of the nwfp electoral map away from virtually all of the established parties such as the ppp the anp and the pml factions and toward group of mostly unknown politically inexperienced religious leaders and party operatives 16the mmas islamist governance 51 federal intervention by the security services undoubtedly explains part of the mmas success as does the presence of the conflict in afghanistan but these two factors alone are still insufficient to account for the mmas sweep17 if state manipu lation was enough to bring the mma to power then why were the security services manifestly unable to engineer anything more than token victories by the ruling partys own pmlq if the afghan situation had sufficient explanatory power to describe the election results then why did the mma make such surprising inroads into nonpashtun hazara division an area in which there is minimal concern among the electorate about afghan issues or why did the mma lose in district t ank adjacent to waziristan where there is widespread affinity for the afghan t aliban the afghan situation along with the political interference by the ruling elites signed to capitalize upon it were necessary but not sufficient factors to explain the ascent of political islam in the frontier in 2002 acute antiestablishment feeling was significant driver of the electoral shift as was the success of the mmas own populist agenda and its drive to implement new kind of politics oriented around islamic values and religiopolitical motifs the islami zation program ambitions and realities at the heart of the mmas campaign in 2002 and at the heart of observers fears about its implications was its program of islamization the mma constituent parties had played on broadbased sympathies for the t aliban in their 2002 elec toral success and had an ongoing and multivalent relationship with both the t aliban and with kashmiri militant groups there was almost universal fear following the 2002 polls that the mma would institute process of t alibanization in the frontier areas mimicking the abortive attempt of the afghan t aliban to establish shariah state human rights groups mainstream and nationalist parties and international observers all voiced concern about the advent of an islamist government in nwfp although the mma made efforts to assuage the fears of the diplomatic and minority religious communities in particular its chaotic first year in power did little to quell concerns that it represented subversive and destabilizing force in pakistani politics more complete assessment however accounting for the mmas full fiveyear tenure reveals decidedly more benign outcome while the mma certainly introduced or reinforced several troubling sociopolitical trends it did not bring about widespread change in the frontier and neither did it demonstrate the means or the will to carry out more than superficial program of islamization the story of the mmas gradual adaptation to the exigencies of governance begins with this first tumultuous year in power troubled start expectations were high when the mma formed its government in the frontier in october 2002 the nascent government was under public pressure to show quick results on its promises relating to islamization anticorruption and social welfare and since most previous governments in the frontier had lasted only 52 pakistans islamist frontier year or two mma politicians felt extraordinary pressure to maximize their politi cal advantage while they had the opportunity the islamists first year however was nothing short of chaotic as interest groups within the islamist fold from mpas to party workers to the chief ministers secretariat to mmaaffiliated vigilante groups began taking action on their own in support of the alliances mandate the result was what one official described as rampant adhocism characterized by flurry of mostly symbolic actions opening with the azaan call to prayer in the provincial assembly banning alcohol even to nonmuslim foreigners prohibiting the playing of music in public buses announcing crackdown on pubs and gambling dens despite the fact that there were pubs in the province etc 18 alongside these official moves came rise in vigilantestyle campaigns against obscenity in peshawar and other major cities many of these vigilante islamists had lowlevel connections to the youth organizations of the mma parties and while the islamist government occasionally criticized these incidents it did not vigorously investigate them 19 thrust into the spotlight the mma leadership also quickly became frustrated by its inability to expeditiously roll out its islamist agenda the provincial bureaucracy pushed back against number of mma initiatives by and large the bureaucracy considered the mmas early attempts at islamization to be unrealistic outside the jurisdiction of the provincial government or in contravention to existing law many of the most outlandish proposals came from the nifazeshariat council quasigovernmental recommendatory body set up by the mma which debated the establishment of viceandvirtue ministry within the provincial government and issued suggestions on such matters as the proper color of the dupatta head coverings to be worn by schoolgirls for the record white 20 almost without exception the councils recommendations were announced with fanfare featured prominently in the local press and then promptly and studiously ignored even the mmas signature shariat bill which was passed unanimously by the provincial assembly and signed into law by the governor did virtually nothing to advance substantive islamization agenda in the province the chaos of the mmas first foray into governance combined with rampant vigilantism and the specter of new islamization programs had by mid2003 led to severe strains on the islamist alliance concerned about the law and order situation in the frontier the ruling party in islamabad had threatened to impose governors rule and was pressuring the mma to accept the legal framework order lfo which musharraf needed to legitimate an extension of his dual role as president and chief of army staff 21 moreover the international donor community led by the world bank was on the verge of pulling back support from the frontier22 just when it looked as though the mmas tenure would be as fleeting as that of its ideological predecessor mufti mahmud who ruled for mere 10 months the religious alliance stepped back from the brink and slowly began moving toward more pragmatic tack by late 2003 it was evident that the vigilante campaigns had lost momentum the flurry of islamist directives had slowed and the provincial government seemed increasingly interested in orienting its efforts toward develop ment work and securing international donor participation to support its concrete objectives in the sectors of health education and infrastructure 23 this shift was the mmas islamist governance 53 not sudden but it is clear in retrospect that late 2003 represented critical inflec tion point at which the mma leadership began pivoting toward an islamism that was decidedly more populist and more practical the hisbah bill as political drama the most visible of the mmas islamist legal reform initiatives came well after the passage of the mostlysymbolic shariat act in 2003 the hisbah accountability bill was first proposed shortly after the mmas election victory but was not presented in the provincial assembly for almost two and half years the bill in its many iterations came to acquire an iconic status as representing both the failures of the mmas legislative ambitions as well as islamabads intent to thwart the provincial governments push for an islamic political order the hisbah bill played on the themes of islamic justice and accountability some of its less contentious provisions would have discouraged beggary and the employment of underage children prohibited injustices perpetrated against women in the determination of inheritance and banned honor killings most of these initiatives however were redundant with existing legislation at the provincial or federal levels at the heart of the bill was more controversial initiative the bill would establish the office of mohtasib qualified religious scholar serving as an ombudsman to which citizens could refer complaints about the presence of unislamic behavior in the province 24 the mohtasib would be given subpoenalike powers to requisition documents and compel witnesses and under some early readings of the language would have separate police force at his disposal the jamaat liked the idea of mohtasib because they saw it as an avenue by which the islamist parties could gain permanent entrée into the workings of the legal system t the juif on the other hand the hisbah bills promise to employ nearly hundred scholars throughout the province represented an ingenious jobscreation scheme for the partys madrassaheducated cadres and an avenue by which the party could mobilize its constituents for future elections much to the mmas disappointment the international community was deeply skeptical about the legislation aware of this growing concern the islamist leader ship sought to reassure those who saw hisbah as an attempt to recreate mullah omars afghanistan we are not provincial minister objected doing the kind of childish things the t aliban did 25 the mma not for the first time found itself in the awkward position of defending the importance of its islamization agenda to its elec torate while at the same time downplaying the implications of that agenda to wider domestic and international audiences neither audience was particularly assuaged by the mmas implicit suggestion that the hisbah legislation was innocuous 26 in the end the hisbah bill was passed twice by the provincial assembly and each time was referred to the supreme court where it was struck down on grounds of being vague overbroad unreasonable based on excessive delegation of jurisdiction denying the right of access to justice to the citizens and attempting to set up parallel judicial system 27 even though the bill never became law it came to symbol ize the imbalance of power between the nwfp and the ruling party in islamabad 54 pakistans islamist frontier the difficulty of crafting islamic legislation that does not run afoul of existing law and the ways in which the islamists own legal inexperience doomed piece of legislation which somewhat more narrowly tailored might have stood reasonable chance of implementation 28 even so many observers suspected that both the islamists and the ruling gov ernment in islamabad were happy to keep the hisbah issue alive throughout the mmas tenure president musharraf used the legislation to summon the specter of t alibanization in the frontier presenting his government of enlightened moderation as the only bulwark standing against an imminent islamist onslaught and the repeated rejection of the hisbah bill both created and nourished the islamists own rhetoric allowing the mma to keep alive the claim that true shariah law was just around the corner 29 in this way the drawnout dispute provided political advantages to both sides and it is surprise that the mma leadership time and time again turned to discussion of the hisbah bill when it found its political fortunes waning 30 informal islamization it was clear after the mmas tumultuous first year in office that the substance of its islamization agenda had largely stalled even so the alliance continued to promote its program through informal channels at the most basic level the mma did this through its use of islamic rhetoric which it used to shore up its credentials among the electorate deflect attention from local problems and generally distinguish itself from the mainstream and nationalist opposition both of which were afraid of appearing unislamic in comparison to the ulema such was the mmas use of religious language that even political rivals in the anp and ppp were often forced in provincial assembly sessions to show their support for islamicized resolutions with which they disagreed in substance for fear that they would be politically outmaneuvered by the mma 31 outside the bounds of formal politics the mma used more subtle channels for furthering its agenda some of the most interesting and complex sociopolitical dynamics of the islamists tenure came here at the intersection of official and informal action where islamization from above met islamization from below the mma leadership would for example occasionally turn blind eye to vigi lante action carried out in the name of islam or would quietly signal to business proprietors such as owners of wedding halls managers of video stores and local musicians that certain behaviors were longer appreciated in the province 32 this was usually done discretely but most often it did not need to be done at all the public took its social cues from the presence of an mma government regard less of the islamists formal actions in this way the religious government quite apart from the mechanism of lawmaking was able to influence the behavior of the population through its use of rhetoric and social signaling the inherent opacity of the provincial governance process and the weak tradition of investigative reporting among the journalistic corps meant that most people in fact had way of distinguishing rumor from regulation number of bills for example were introduced unsuccessfully into the provincial assembly but only their presentation received press attention these included measures such as the prohibition of the mmas islamist governance 55 dancing and music act 2005 and the prohibition of use of women photographs act 2005 which would have outlawed the commercial use of images of women which may amount to any incentive to sensuality or excitement of impure thoughts in the mind of an ordinary man of normal temperament 33 the mma except when speaking with foreign observers did little in public to dispel the impression that many activities had been restricted often they themselves did not know precisely what had been prohibited even senior bureaucrats and cabinet officials in the nwfp government often had idea whether given restriction say on dancing or on music in public transportation or regarding headcoverings for female students was merely campaign promise bill tabled in the assembly bill passed by the assembly nonbinding recommendation of the quasigovernmental nifazeshariat council chief ministers directive publiclyannounced cabinet directive cabinet directive kept under seal an administrative regulation or simply rumor 34 the mmas strategy of governance by perception of encouraging the mass to take their cues from the religious leadership without having to be instructed through any medium so explicit as actual legislation was in the end perhaps more significant channel of islamization than any of the alliances formal initiatives it speaks moreover to the power of social bandwagoning in the frontier and the ways in which islamist groups whether elected like the mma or unelected like the neot aliban are able to actively shape social norms in the absence of formal legislative or regulatory authority security militancy and inaction one of the most salient criticisms of the religious government in peshawar had less to do with its islamization program than with the ways in which the mmas stated agenda and constituent politics affected its ability to carry out its law enforcement obligations opponents claimed that the mma leadership was often reluctant to take action against insurgent groups or even against clerics who were causing trouble for local authorities by and large this was true the islamists frequently found themselves boxed in by their own religious rhetoric such that they could not afford to confront any individual or group which carried out activities in the name of religion lest they be seen as undermining their own message provincial bureaucrats who worked closely with the mma government described how the islamists own rhetoric made them hesitant to act against even those clerics who were not formally part of their religious alliance this dynamic was most problematic during the first year of the mmas rule in which religious party cadres engaged in vigilantism and in the last two years of the mmas tenure in which new insurgent groups began challenging the writ of the state ironically as described below number of senior mma leaders were in fact quite upset at the bombing of girls schools and the rise of tnsmbacked militancy in swat and took pains to differentiate themselves from that activity and though they spoke out in general terms against vigilantism and violence they usually would not do so in specific cases or against specific troublemakers 3556 pakistans islamist frontier for most of the mmas tenure this remained relatively minor problem the law and order situation in the frontier between mid2003 and mid2005 was quite good relative to the other provinces and disturbances by religious groups were relatively few in number but with the rise of the tnsm and neot alibanlinked bombings in 2006 and 2007 the mmas hesitance in confronting religious insur gents began to have tangible and adverse implications for the province by the spring and early summer of 2007 the religious parties were coming under severe criticism for their indecisive response to the tnsms militancy in swat and to wave of bombings which had penetrated into the settled areas of the province 36 politicians from the religious parties unconvincingly blamed the federal government and its security services rather than the t aliban groups for fomenting instability in the frontier to destabilize the mma government though in private they acknowledged the spread of dangerous militant organizations into the settled areas 37 the situation in nwfp further deteriorated in the summer of 2007 following retaliations by militant groups after the siege of the lal masjid red mosque in islamabad the mma government put off any kind of action against the tnsm until the final weeks of its rule when the juif chief minister quietly agreed to an expanded security presence in the swat valley 38 even then the juif did so reluctantly and in the face of internal opposition by the jamaat and later denied that it had ever acceded to allowing military action in swat 39 it is an overstatement to suggest as some observers have that the rise in mili tancy in 2006 and 2007 in nwfp was result of the mma provincial government as is noted below the religious parties were often at odds with the new insurgent movements and upset about their expanding influence at the same time however the mma clearly played an indirect role in facilitating the spread of the insurgency by virtue of its inaction while the alliance performed decently well in carrying out its law and order obligations under relatively peaceful conditions the rising tide of insurgency eventually exposed the mmas political limitations in being able to take action against other selfdescribed religious movements islam as d in the islami zation agenda writ large the leadership of the mma saw its islamization agenda as one which extended beyond the bounds of law and formal politics apart from its support for an explicit shariah agenda the islamist alliance also sought to integrate religious values into oth er aspects of its governance and to advocate view of islam as din faith which had bearing on all sectors of society and the state patronizing the madaris there continues to be widespread anxiety in the west about the pakistani madrassah system particularly the deobandi institutions in karachi balochistan and the nwfp this apprehension is not with reason although by most accounts the vast majority of madaris are engaged simply in teaching the memorization of quran and serve an important function as social safety net for poor families and the mmas islamist governance 57 their children very small percentage are used as intentional recruiting platforms or even training camps for extremist organizations anecdotal evidence sug gests that the most problematic aspect of the madrassah system is not its curriculum as such but its narrow pedagogy and openness to itinerant recruiters affiliated with sectarian or militant organizations one of the largely unexamined questions of the mmas tenure in nwfp is the degree to which the islamist parties in general and the juif in particular leveraged their position in government to benefit the madaris not since the afghan jihad had the deobandi parties been granted such extensive access to state resources and it was clear that for the juif as one upandcoming party leader noted the madaris are our numberone priorities 40 given their important social welfare func tion the flow of government resources to religious organizations is not prima facie cause for concern still there are legitimate fears that some of these madaris may have had linkages with the neot aliban movements now active in the frontier it was surprising to some observers that the mma did not use its political influ ence in nwfp to more forcefully institutionalize the governments role in fund ing the madrassah system spending for mosques and seminaries under the official auqaf framework program which provides regular provincial grants to reli gious institutions did in fact increase but only modestly 41 but the jui and the fazlur rehman faction in particular have long history of opposing outside inter ference in religious schools and of avoiding direct government funding of their institutions lest they be coopted by the state 42 the mmas tenure did little to lessen this suspicion of state encroachment as result instead of authorizing direct state funding of the madaris the jui chose to utilize development channels and other discretionary funds to provide benefits to the madrassah system these grants tended to be oneoff concessions rather than the sort of systematic restructuring of the governmentmadaris relationship that would have in the mind of the jui threatened the longterm independence of the religious institutions interviews with jui party members and provincial bureaucrats suggest that the discretionary funds granted to the partys mpas and mnas between 5 and 10 million rupees per member per year were often channeled to the madaris occasionally these payments took the form of outright grants but were more commonly structured as development initiatives eg providing electricity tube wells road access and repairs to constituent institutions 43 review of provincial development documents indicates that several discretion ary pools of money were tapped to provide benefit to these institutions the district development funds chief ministers special package and the t amiresarhad building frontier program all recorded significant and repeated grants to various madaris 44 not surprisingly most of the madaris which received these benefits were located in the southern districts which constituted the juifs political heartland bannu t ank and dera ismail khan by way of funds channeled to ji senior minister siraj ulhaq seminaries in dir and swat were also patronized 45 in comparison with the size of the provincial budget the individual grants to the madaris in the south ern districts were relatively small usually less than 20000 these grants often made without public notification were commonly authorized at the discretion of the 58 pakistans islamist frontier chief minister who shrewdly altered the provincial budgeting process in order to vest the ruling party with greater powers to direct discretionary funds to areas and institutions which represented its core constituency 46 in addition to channeling funds to the madaris the juif became adept at chan neling funds through the madrassah system as an indirect means by which to solicit bribes multiple sources including some with close links to the juif described the ways in which party workers who held government positions would request that charitable donations be made to their madrassah in exchange for contracts or other public services sometimes written receipts were even issued for these transactions the effect of this innovation was to channel monies toward the madaris while keep ing the assets at least on paper out of the hands of the politicians the juif with its extensive network of madaris most of whose books were outside the scope of government oversight used this arrangement extensively 47 it is impossible to reliably assess the net impact of the mmas patronage of the madaris it is clear that substantial funds were channeled to religious institu tions during the islamists tenure but it is also clear that many of these funds were provided inkind and to institutions which served important social as well as religious functions education and health the mmas policies on education and health deserve an entire study of their own48 without question the islamist alliance brought its religious values to the table when making policy on social development issues but it often did so to lesser extent than outsiders predicted or in ways which differed markedly from public expectations after the mma came to power the international donor community anticipated possible rollback of educational access for women in the nwfp playing against expectations the mma leadership decided instead to focus specifically on increas ing female primary enrollment and to petition the world bank for funds in that regard statements by mma leaders seemed to indicate that this emphasis on female education was due in part to desire to quash western propaganda that islam did not guarantee womens rights 49 regardless of the rationale however the mma did eventually convince skeptical donors that they were serious about educating women 50 i do believe now said one world bank education advisor in 2007 that they want womens education i dont question that anymore female enrollment figures reflected the provinces investment in girls education with some of the most striking gains coming from the most conservative areas dominated by the mma over two years bannu saw 38 increase in female primary enrollment in dir 22 in buner 40 and in dera ismail khan 85 51 middle and secondary school female enrollments also increased sometimes dramatically in poor districts like buner and hangu girls enrollments were up over 50 in dir 39 and in shangla mahsehra and lakki marwat over 20 52 overall between 200102 and 200607 the gross female enrollment ratio in public primary schools increased from 48 to 57 53the mmas islamist governance 59 in general the mmas education policies at the primary and secondary levels were singled out for praise by the donor community including its programs of pro viding free education and free textbooks throughout the province54 other decisions like the plan to build dozens of new postsecondary institutions were criticized as being little more than patronage schemes for senior mma officials construction contracts provided one of the most lucrative channels of corruption for provincial officials many of whom had informal or familial links with contractors what surprised many observers was that mma party members ended up being so supportive of female education and saw it as serving their own interests as well as those of the outside community 55 critics were quick to point out however that they were much less supportive of expanding opportunities for womens employment which might absorb the newlyeducated female population compared to its emphasis on primary education the mmas higher education agenda was much more modest the two major initiatives of the government at the higher education level were the establishment of the khyber girls medical college in peshawar and the university of science and t echnology bannu ustb the fact that the juif leadership chose to open femaleonly medical college in the most cosmopolitan city of the province which some critics argued was unnecessary and redundant while establishing coeducational university in one of nwfps most conservative regions which happened to be the home of the chief minister speaks to the complex ideological and political impulses which lay behind the mmas thinking on gender and education issues the only major occasion in which the mma pursued formal islamization effort with respect to the public school system was in 2005 when the federal government reduced the number of ayats of quran and hadith in the islamiyat and urdu curri cula 56 the mma objected strenuously and after much backandforth the matter was resolved to the mutual satisfaction of both the province and the central government 57 the fact that it was the gross number of ayats and not the content of the curriculum as such that the mma took as its metric by which the reforms were to be judged indicates the ulemas sensitivity to perceived federal interference in local curricular issues seen however in the overall context of the alliances islamization agenda it is striking that the mmas most serious attempt to bring its religiopolitical agenda to bear on public school curriculum amounted to little more than rousing defense of the status quo the mma governments record on health and social welfare issues was much the same the alliance lacking clear agenda tying health to its islamization mandate deferred almost entirely to the advice of the provincial bureaucracy and the international donors most outside experts agree that the islamist government adopted responsible health policies which differed little from those of previous governments and interacted in professional manner with domestic and foreign institutions the more interesting story in this sector is what the mma did not do aside from some disputes with international donors about the priority given to condom distribution the religious parties did very little to bring their islamism to bear on the health sector 58 the government generally continued with previous plans and even increased budgets for the population welfare department expanded the lady 60 pakistans islamist frontier health worker program and opened new family planning centers it also made tained effort to carry out polio vaccination programs in malakand division against the opposition of local groups like the tnsm59 there were hopes early in the mmas tenure that the islamists might be able to leverage their unique grassroots linkages at mosques and madaris in order to pursue social mobilization and promote health and welfare goals at the community level by and large however that did not happen as the mmas health and welfare policy far from advocating dramatic islamist reforms mostly reflected the status quo the gender agenda it was widely expected that the rise of the mma would lead to the imposition of strict gender norms even by the conservative standards of the frontier both major constituent parties tailored their gender discourse to appeal to conservative local values and to fears of loss of pashtun honor the appeal to pashtunwali was often framed in islamic terms but there was rarely any question as to which standard was ultimately normative on questions of gender as anita weiss has observed mma members would acknowledge that widow remarriage was condoned in islam but would not support it for fear of opposing pashtun tradition 60 on those occasions in which the religious parties did oppose local traditions such as the practice of swara honor killings their opposition was mostly rhetorical and included little in the way of enforcement 61 in spite of the mmas views on the role of women in public life its impact on the gender policies of the province and on the norms of the society at large were relatively modest aside from few abortive attempts to mandate the wearing of head coverings for female students the alliances education and health policies basically supported the status quo on gender issues any greater ambitions to institutionalize enforcement of gender norms died with the repeated failure of the hisbah bill on social level the mma did exert informal influence eg people noticed more women observing purdah in local markets but even here the change was not dramatic opposition to the mma by womens advocacy groups moderated somewhat over the course of the provincial governments tenure as the religious parties became more realistic about their policy options and the advocacy groups cali brated their expectations accordingly the alliances gender policies nonetheless continued to attract criticism on two fronts first there were charges that the religious parties were interfering with genderoriented programs mma leaders for example campaigned against the aurat foundation which they saw as advancing western notion of female empowerment 62 they even demanded at one point that the organization which takes its name from the urdu word for woman change its name 63 and second perhaps the most substantive complaint about the mmas approach to gender issues was its consistent opposition to legal reforms on issues which affected women the religious parties opposed any change to the notorious hudood ordinances in 2004 and strongly resisted the womens protection bill in 2006 their strategy was to label any changes to the legal status quo as unislamic and capitulation to western values 64the mmas islamist governance 61 there is question that the mma leadership was uncomfortable with gender reforms deep down admitted party advisor in the frontier the jui does not want to give free role to women they think that free mixing is not islamic 65 this did not mean however that the religious parties tacitly supported t alibanlike agenda on gender issues 66 in reality many of the most troubling and highprofile actions which set back womens rights in the nwfp such as the forcible closing of girls schools were not sanctioned by the alliances leadership and actually ran counter to the mmas political and institutional interests the religious parties for example received great deal of criticism for the closing of girls schools in the northern districts of nwfp beginning in 2007 when in fact that activity was carried out almost entirely by the tnsm and affiliated neot aliban groups in contravention to the mmas own program of expanding female primary education 67 the religious leadership was frequently torn between its own commitment to conservative gender norms and political realities faced with local constituent opposition to womens participation in politics especially in rural areas but also with the desire to fill the seats which were reserved for women the islamist leadership split the difference mma women were given tickets to run for seats at the district and provincial levels while at the same time the religious parties occasionally went along with local agreements at the union council and tehsil levels to exclude women from voting after writ petition was filed following the 2001 local body elections citing written evidence of prohibitions against women voting these sorts of arrangements tended to be oral rather than written and conducted in such way as to retain plausible deniability for mid and seniorlevel party leadership 68 religious minorities and sectarianism the nwfp has historically experienced less conflict between muslim and non muslim communities than neighboring punjab in part it is suggested this reflects egalitarian pashtun values and traditions of local hospitality it is also due to simple economics and demographics the minority communities in the frontier are either small poor or both 69 unlike parts of the punjab in which the christian community has become source of economic competition to the sunni majority the religious minorities in the frontier are by and large economically and politically marginalized nonetheless minority groups in nwfp were uniformly concerned about the mmas victory in 2002 christians worried about being tarred as western by the antiamerican religious parties ahmedis about being subjected to further legal discrimination hindus and sikhs about the potential for antiindian demagoguery kalash small nonmonotheistic faith community which lives in three isolated valleys in chitral district about the growing tensions surrounding conversions to islam and shia about the strong deobandi character of the religious alliance and its ties to sectarian groups such as sipahesahaba the mmas impact on minority communities as on so many other issues proved to be mixed contrary to early expectations the religious parties did not seek to further marginalize minority groups in fact the mma leadership concerned about its collective reputation and by the suggestion that it might act irresponsibly toward 62 pakistans islamist frontier religious minorities tried to overcome this negative optic by reaching out to minor ity leaders particularly those from the christian hindu and sikh communities the islamists policy of minority engagement was not necessarily disingenuous but was clearly calculated move to bolster the alliances electoral and reputational prospects in the frontier 70 these outreach efforts included mutually awkward visit by senior minister siraj ulhaq to christmas service in peshawar regular statements by chief minister akram khan durrani about tolerance and shared religious history especially during times of interreligious tension participation in interfaith events including the faith friends initiative organized by several leading scholars and clerics provision of funds for reconstruction of churches and visible protection of churches temples and gurudwaras during holy days 71 these actions were largely symbolic but nonetheless important in setting the overall tone of the mmas interaction with the minority communities the chief minister for example laid foundation stone for the reconstruction of church building on the campus of peshawar university in late 2006 as christmas gift of the mma government to the local christian community when students at the university later filed writ petition with the peshawar high court claiming that the reconstruction of the church would trigger sectarianism and violate majority sentiment on the campus the high court pointedly referenced the chief ministers own actions in dismissing the case adding rhetorically why did the head of reli gious partys government allocate funds and attend the reconstruction ceremony as chief guest if the churchs construction were unislamic in cases such as these outreach by the mma leadership was helpful in signaling to other party cadres and even the courts the alliances image as tolerant and democratic islamists 72 these outreach efforts did not make the mma immune from criticism some christian leaders objected to the mmas oftrepeated assertion that they would protect the minorities living under their rule arguing that the language of dhim mitude was patronizing and cast the minorities as somehow less than full pakistani citizens 73 other leaders noted that the mma leadership often dismissed the minor ity groups claims of discrimination and did little to provide economic opportunities to the poorest communities 74 other minority leaders complained that the gracious words of the mma leadership were sometimes at odds with the actions of lowerlevel party cadres when for example an mma cleric in charsadda began broadcasting antichristian propaganda on an illegal fm station the provincial government provided extra police to the local christian community along with special provision of small arms to be used in selfdefense but for political reasons would not take action against the cleric himself 75 there is remarkably little to note about the mmas track record on sectarian issues on the whole the alliance adopted moderate rhetoric toward the shia minority and also did its best to stay out of the middle of intrasunni disputes between deobandis and barelvis which arose in nearby khyber agency some observers noted that the participation in the mma alliance of parties which were ideologically at odds such as the shia islami t ehrikepakistan itp and the wahhabi jamiat ahlehadith jah and the barelvi jamiat ulemaepakistan jup and the deobandi jamiat ulemaeislam jui helped to moderate the public the mmas islamist governance 63 statements of the senior tier of islamist leadership and put pressure on the parties to rein in sectarian activities which might reflect poorly on the alliances governance on balance the minority communities in the frontier were relieved that the mmas tenure was not as problematic as they had feared and expressed satisfaction with the official efforts at outreach on the part of the islamist leadership but they also were frustrated over the actions of lowerlevel islamist cadres which the leadership did not or could not control and over the trend toward more conservative values under the mma which increased the social pressures on communities which did not conform to the deobandi sunni norm 76 the rise of islamic populism beyond the explicitly religious content of the mmas agenda the islamists also brought with them unique style of governance and distinctive political culture these remain important even in the postmma era as they shaped the political landscape of the frontier and helped to redefine the boundaries of pashtun nationalist discourse echoes of the mmas islamic populism can be seen in the style of the anpled government which followed and also in the ad hoc forms of islamist gover nance established by the neot aliban in both the settled and tribal areas unlike any previous ruling party in the frontier the mma brought to its exercise of governance unique lower and middleclass sensibility the juif drew its base of support predominantly from the underdeveloped southern districts and the jamaat relied on support from the socalled devout middle classes in the peshawar valley and the poor districts in the north appealing to these constituents mma parliamentarians often spoke at length about wanting to help small farmers shopkeepers transport work ers and the young berozgar unemployed class including madrassah graduates party workers from the pmln anp and ppp by contrast would often begin their criti cism of the mma by critiquing the islamists ineffective industrial policy or their lack of commitment to largescale irrigation projects of the kind favored by the landed elites 77 the class and educational background of the mma politicians shaped their political discourse and more directly their exercise of governance some of the provincial ministers hailing from madrassah background were wholly unequipped to run large ministries and relate with international donors and since most of the alliances mpas and mnas were unschooled in english the mma government insisted that the provincial bureaucracy switch its language of everyday operation from english into urdu 78 the situation in the provincial assembly in which some mpas were not wholly conversant in urdu their nations lingua franca was even more complex one advisor in the provincial assembly explained wearily the directives from the secretariats come to the assembly in english have to be translated into urdu and then explained in pashto 79 ultimately the hallmark of the mmas populist governance style was not its use of vernacular language but its use of vernacular pashtun cultural motifs even fierce critics of the provincial government generally acknowledged that in the words of one bureaucrat the mma has been the most accessible government in pakistans history 80 drawing on the pashtun inclination for egalitarian politics the mma 64 pakistans islamist frontier instituted something of hujra culture modeling its interaction with the people on that of the tribal elders daily audience in the village courtyard compared to previous governments the mma made more of an effort to be accessible to lowerclass petitioners seeking patronage and petty favors and took care to emphasize the relatively modest means of its own politicians 81 the juif mpas many of whom delivered the weekly khutbah at their local mosques were particularly accessible the people see us every friday one alim noted with hint of resignation how can we hide82 more tangibly the mmas populism was reflected in the ways in which it altered the established patronage patterns of the frontier whereas previous governments had directed funds largely to the peshawar valley and the eastern hazara division the islamists allocated state monies disproportionately to their own political bases areas which had been relatively ignored for decades 83 while full accounting of such spending is not available it is clear from analysis of provincial development records that several districts benefited disproportionately from the mma governments largesse bannu buner dir and dera ismail khan were overrepresented in almost all categories of discretionary spending 84 these districts represented the hometowns of respectively the chief minister juif the speaker of the assembly ji the senior minister ji and maulana fazlur rehman juif the mma defended these lopsided allocations on both historical and moral grounds why should we widen road in peshawar ar gued one juif advisor when in bannu there is road at all 85 the mmas realignment of patronage within the province had both negative and positive effects the religious leadership took advantage of an alreadypoliticized system of development planning to divert resources to its own client base this simply reinforced the fundamentally inequitable process by which development funds were allocated at the provincial level t aking more positive view however the mmas tenure unquestionably channeled assistance to the longneglected southern districts and to underdeveloped jamaatdominated areas of malakand division in the north in the south the chief minister directed massive development monies to dera ismail khan and to bannu mostly in the form of infrastructure projects but also education bannu was given new access road from the indus highway new road projects within the city proper new university and new bridges districts buner and dir also saw great deal of development in the health education and utility sectors 86 even leading opposition members in parliament conceded that the mmas focus on previouslyneglected districts was not entirely without merit87 the infusion of funds into these districts particularly in the south had impact both substantively and politically apart from the direct effects on commerce education and health the realignment of clientelist politics had politically integrative effect as well informal interviews conducted during the mmas tenure revealed for example feeling in the southern districts that people there had been politically reenfranchised and that it was in their interest to take note of what happened in peshawar some local experts argued that the present situation in southern districts like bannu as bad as it is would be noticeably worse today had the mma not invested there the mmas style of islamic populism was undoubtedly form of political postur ing but it also points to the way in which the islamists sought to articulate vision of an islamic welfare state which equated religious values with populist reforms likely to the mmas islamist governance 65 appeal to lowerclass voters it is for example remarkable to note the extent to which the mmas published manifesto focused not on the enactment of shariah legislation or the curbing of unislamic acts but on promises to curb corruption ensure provision of bread clothes shelter education jobs and marriage expenses an effective play on zulfikar ali bhuttos famous promise of roti kapra aur makan ensure speedy justice promote literacy through free education and take care of backward areas and classes 88 in this sense the language of islamic populism was rhetorical bridge which joined the mmas concern for islamization and religious symbolism with its efforts to expand patronage base among its lowerclass constituency one way in which the mma did this was to blend lowerclass values with dose of popular religious wisdom in late 2006 for example the chief minister expressed his displeasure at the increase in crime and kidnapping in the province in addition to issuing formal directives on the matter he also advised that corrupt police officers be sent for four months to the t ablighi markaz the headquarters of the islamic missionary group t ablighi jamaat so that they could learn proper islamic values before returning to their posts newspaper commentator opined that this was fine idea but suggested dryly that in keeping with the chief ministers approach perhaps the government should send the most serious offenders straight to mecca for hajj 89 the mma leadership also sought to link islam with good governance directing in 2003 that all senior officers shall persuade their officials to attend prayers regularlyand encourage regular motivation sessions for their employees to enable them to become practicing muslims this will enable honest transparent and humane dealings thereby ensuring good governance 90 not surprisingly the mmas islamic populism did not come close in reality to fulfilling its early promises of creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs91 but it had notable effect in helping the religious parties to carve out political space in frontier politics which not only the islamists but also the other mainstream parties would be forced to contest even after the anp victory in february 2008 observers noted that the mma had been able in part to coopt the anps traditional rhetoric and reframe pashtun nationalism in religious and class terms 92 this shift though subtle is consistent with broader post911 trendline in frontier politics in which histor ic transdurand line notions of pashtun nationalism have slowly been displaced by nationalism that is both more focused on affiliation to the pakistani state and to religious identity as the mma was in many ways very pashtun phenomenon it was able to tap into an ethnic nationalist counternarrative and align it with its own reli gious and political agenda constraints on i slami zation the portrait which emerges above is that of the mma as rightofcenter but essentially status quo political force and indeed as early as 2004 it had become obvious that the islamist parties would not be radical t alibanizing influence in the frontier while their policies and rhetoric continued to trouble many observers the religious parties were clearly unwilling or unable to press for dramatic islamist reforms it is easy to forget that this trendline toward moderate politics while apparent in retrospect was 66 pakistans islamist frontier not at all obvious even in 2003 what then accounts for the relatively limited scope of the mmas program of islamization there are four major factors described below presented in roughly increasing order of importance which serve to explain how and why the mma did not govern as many had expected internal alliance politics from its earliest days the mma was an alliance fraught with internal divisions these fractures played out differently at the local provincial and national levels at the local level the differences between the two dominant parties were not related to strategic objectives so much as jostling for influence both parties operatives in given district sought to take advantage of the political environment for their own ends it was to the benefit of the mma as an alliance that such tensions were in 2002 somewhat obviated by the nwfps political geography the power bases of the juif and the ji were largely geographically disjoint with the former dominant in the southern districts and the latter in the northern malakand division the major parties did not altogether avoid electoral tension but the historic weakness of religious parties in the province made it such that neither party had strong bench of experienced candidates particularly for those regions outside their traditional spheres of influence at the provincial level disputes predictably centered around the distribution of patronage including cabinet positions in which the ji and especially the smaller parties in the alliance felt excluded 93 somewhat less expected was that the pace of the mmas islamization agenda would also prove to be point of provinciallevel contention within the alliance the mma faced nearly constant tension between those leaders who were in governing role such as members of the provincial cabinet and those who were not such as party workers and activists the former group had strong incentive to demonstrate the governments credentials as responsible party committed to the rule of law while the latter remained primarily focused on appeasing their partys constituent base when for example jamaat cadres were publicly linked to vigilante action in the summer of 2003 defacing billboards and burning music shops the chief minister spoke out against the action precipitating feud within the alliance it was but one of many the governing leadership of the mma consistently demonstrated greater concern for procedure for the public reputation of the alliance and for gradual reform path than did those without such obligations this ongoing internal tension made it difficult for the alliance to put forward common approach to islamization efforts 94 at the national level the forces acting upon the constituent parties were in some sense reversed from those at the local level here the juif and ji shared relatively little in the way of overall objectives and saw the relationship between the mma and the state through starkly different lenses while the juif sought to establish itself as dominant status quo political force in the pashtun areas of nwfp and balochistan even if that meant compromising with the musharraf government the jamaat sought to act on broader agenda that included structural reforms changes which necessitated opposition to musharraf s regime and its philosophy of enlightened moderation the mmas islamist governance 67 ultimately the juifs more pragmatic orientation toward the center prevailed qazi hussain threatened frequently to resign from the national assembly in protest of martial rule but the juif seeing large downside in the potential loss of the frontier government and an uncertain upside at the national level refused to go along qazi hussain resigned only in august 2007 long after it had ceased to mat ter this internal fragmentation which was felt at all levels of the mmas governance proved to be constant source of stress on the alliances ability to pursue its agenda and constant inroad by which the military and bureaucracy could exert pressure on the provincial government constituent pressures one of the most salient factors which limited the mmas ability to implement its islamist agenda was the lack of enthusiasm for real reform within sectors of the mmas own constituency an overwhelming majority of pakistanis when surveyed express support for implementing strict shariah law in pakistan 95 actual imple mentation of strict regulations ostensibly deriving from the shariah is decidedly less popular96 even the relatively modest changes implemented by the mma in nwfp provoked grumbling and not just among liberalminded pashtuns prohibitions on traditional music and dance were widely though quietly lamented and the obscuring of womens faces on billboards ridiculed proposals to close down dance halls music stores and cinemas caused stir among the urban merchant class campaigns to ensure that stores were closed during prayer hours met with discontent by shopkeepers and purveyors of imported clothing and technology were frequently nervous that the religious parties would in politically charged situations call for boycott of such goods given that the pet ty merchant class in nwfp constituted key base of support for the jamaat in particular the mma was forced to tread lightly so as not to alienate important domestic constituencies the mma was also forced to backtrack on its promise to shutter cable television in the province and there is reason to believe that the governments foray into more dramatic prohibitions would have been politically devastating 97 although many of the ulema for example considered smoking to be unislamic once in government they rallied in support of tobacco farmers who constituted key electoral constituency in swabi district where the mma had made major inroads in 2002 the mma later boasted about the aid it had given to help the tobacco industry the alliance discovered that promises of islamization carry with them certain political benefits but also risks as the spreading neot aliban insurgency in the southern districts amply demonstrated the appeal of t alibanism often far out weighed the appeal of t aliban presence itself t lesser extent the mma found particularly in places such as the peshawar valley that promises to get rid of vice made for popular electoral politics but not necessarily popular governance although this dynamic is difficult to quantify it is safe to conclude that at least one reason behind the mmas stalled islamization agenda was internal resistance by the very electorate that had brought the islamists to power the gulf between 68 pakistans islamist frontier expressed preferences and revealed preferences on the part of the electorate creat ed limited field of action within which the religious parties could actually imple ment an islamization agenda interaction with the international community the mma ran on an agenda of opposition to foreign interference in the affairs of the frontier western ngos foreign governments and international organizations were all deemed suspect by religious party candidates the islamists rhetoric on these issues changed very little during their tenure in power but as practical matter the mmas governance was shaped by its interaction with the international community perhaps the most significant interaction in this regard took place on issues of finance and development the world bank and the asian development bank adb both had long history of partnering with the government of nwfp and the mma leadership realized very quickly into its tenure that without the financing of the international donor community its religious government would stand little chance of fulfilling its electoral agenda just two weeks into his job as senior minister and minister of finance siraj ulhaq of the ji acknowledged that all planning is dependent on foreign assistance all our projects are waiting for foreign financial assistanceno work is possible in the present state of affairs 98 the provincial governments first year of governance however did little to assuage the concerns of the international donor community highprofile vigilantism statements against the west and the war on terror driven largely by the buildup to the iraq war chaotic legislative agenda standoff between the province and the district nazimeen over powersharing and host of ridiculous efforts by the mma government all made the world bank seriously rethink its strategy toward the frontier by late 2003 the bank was considering suspending its giving to the province 99 with its government under fire and desperate for world bank support the mma leadership made surprising pitch siraj ulhaq in meeting with the mission director in islamabad laid out passionate plea for bank involvement in the nwfp and as noted above proposed that the mmas top priority would be female education coming just weeks after midlevel cadres from siraj ulhaqs own party had destroyed billboards portraying women in peshawar it was striking tactic the mmas proposal incongruous as it seemed hit at the banks soft spot and siraj ulhaq assiduously courted both the bank staff and the political and bureaucratic leadership in peshawar 100 eventually the bank decided in june 2004 to authorize second structural adjustment credit for 90 million which not only proved to be financial boon to the mma government but also signaled to other major donors such as the british dfid that the provincial government was prepared to accommodate the interests of the donor community 101 looking back on its interaction with the mma bank officials acknowledged that the islamists engaged in very professional dialogue with the donor community the adbs experience in interacting with the mma government was not dissimi lar from that of the world bank adb staff found the mma to be pretty shrewd and their performance more or less in line with that of previous governments they know what they want noted senior official in islamabad and if anyone thought the the mmas islamist governance 69 mma government would be an underdog they have proved them wrong relations between the adb and the mma were nonetheless strained at times the islamists most significant disagreement with any international donor agency arose over small adb gender reform action programme grap which constituted required component of the 300 million nationwide decentralization support program dsp 102 when the dsp proposal was submitted to the mma cabinet it refused to approve the grap arguing that gender reform was simply not one of its priorities and that it should not be imposed upon them opposition to the grap implementation by the mma endangered the entire second tranche of dsp funds from the adb throughout pakistan it was delicate political situation for the mma leadership which faced strong internal opposition to the gender program but also intense pressure from the international community and the other provincial governments in pakistan the solution to the grap standoff eventually came by way of bureaucratic sleightofhand on the part of both the bank and the mma the adb voted to give waiver allowing the tranche to proceed without the mmas acceptance of the grap 103 and the mma chief minister after almost two years of delays eventually approved the program though he did so by submitting notification directly to the chief secretary without putting the issue before the cabinet for discussion the british dfid and german gtz development agencies held less financial sway over the provincial government than the world bank or adb but sought to leverage their relational and technical influence to help bring mma leaders into the mainstream in doing so these agencies created space for sustained political interaction that often exceeded both in scope and productivity the more formal political relationships with the mma initiated by their respective governments dfid officials were initially quite scared by the mmas agenda but decided to press ahead with strategy that extended technical support to all levels of the provincial government focusing on government reform health and economic development and sought to initiate dia logue on the alliances islamization agenda its interaction with the mma government was therefore quite deep and dfid officials commented later that the relationship was remarkably constructive and frank 104 the germans took similar approach quietly partnering with the mma at all levels to pursue joint objectives in education and health it was by all accounts successful strategy provincial ministers bureaucrats and ngo leaders in peshawar spoke in glowing terms about the germans technical assistance with one former madrassah leader noting that they have agenda and didnt impose their orders on us they gave us logical framework 105 gtzs nonconfrontational ap proach with the mma served in number of ways to moderate aspects of the islamists agenda the agency invested heavily in building relationships with mma officials including the education minister whom gtz brought to germany for discussions on modern education policy gtz also used these relationships to initiate dialogue with the mma on the issue of the madaris although management of the madaris fell outside the formal portfo lio of the provincial minister of education the ministers background as madras sah leader meant that the germans were eventually able to leverage their position 70 pakistans islamist frontier as trusted advisors in order to broach sensitive issues of religious education by 2006 gtz noted some breakthroughs in this dialogue and was able to build relationships among the juif leaders which could prove to be valuable for future joint madaris reform efforts the juif noted someone in gtz who worked closely with them held very narrow vision of the world but their experience in government has helped them to understand some of the issues that exposure does trickle down through the party ranks and it also has an effect at the leadership level 106 the mmas relationship with nongovernmental organizations proved to be com plex foreign ngo leaders were relieved that the islamists strong antingo campaign rhetoric did not translate into harsh action against their organizations in the frontier the religious parties by most accounts came to realize that many organizations in the ngo sector were in fact contributing to the mmas own health and education priorities and providing significant avenues for local patronage even the ngo work which took place in nwfp following the october 2005 earthquake elicited only mild reaction from the mma leadership and on several occasions the religious government even qui etly partnered with american ngos on health projects in the province 107 at the same time however the ngo communitys relationship with the islamists was quite strained senior mma leaders often spoke out in public against foreignfunded organizations which spread obscenity and argued that they undermined the cultural and religious identity of muslims in the frontier 108 in parts of the southern tribal districts the term ngo imported into the urdu lexicon had gained such stigma that organizations began labeling themselves as ghair sarkari tanzim non governmental organization in order to be seen more positively as an indigenous institution the kind of work undertaken by ngos was also an important factor in the mmas response organizations conducting health construction and education programs were given far more latitude by the provincial government than ngos working to promote genderoriented reforms at the end of the day the religious parties and the donors both had strong incentives to find modus vivendi that would meet the requirements of the inter national community and placate the religious parties rankandfile membership it helped that with the notable exception of gender issues the basic agenda of the donors aligned nicely with the mmas own populist rhetoric and interest in enhancing service delivery the very slogans on which the religious alliance had run this alignment of interests if anything served to enhance the influence of the international community in mainstreaming the religious parties during their fiveyear tenure in the frontier federalism and the martial state the mild character of the mmas islamism is often explained with reference to single factor its manipulation and cooption by state elites of all of the variables which constrained the mmas islamist agenda this was arguably the most critical beginning with the mmas victory in the nwfp in which the state itself had hand there were profound pressures on the provincial islamist government to comply with the interests of the martial regime in islamabadthe mmas islamist governance 71 politically the central government held several key levers of control over the mma it appointed the provinces chief secretary and inspector general of police and its approval was required for large development projects islamabad was also able to hold out the prospect of governors rule if the religious alliance did not comply with the central governments wishes and most notably in the 2005 local body elections the central government spent great sums of money to ensure the election of local politicians who would be friendly to the pmlq thus putting pressure on the mma from below the musharraf government also exerted pressure on the religious alliance at the federal level the quid pro quos were considerable the mmas support for the legal framework order lfo in late 2003 which strengthened the powers of the presidency and gave legal cover to musharraf s continued rule as both president and chief of army staff was effectively precondition for its continued rule in the nwfp 109 in 2006 the religious government again legitimized musharraf s rule under pressure by participating in the national security council meetings over the objection of many mma figures and in the legal sphere the military regimes effective control of the federal courts allowed musharraf to contain the mmas shariah agenda 110 moreover the central government retained enormous financial leverage over the mma government over 90 of the nwfp provincial budget is derived from fiscal transfers from islamabad which are divided between the national finance commission nfc award the hydroelectric royalties known as net hydel pay ments and other transfers such as the tobacco tax the province itself has very weak tax base as its economy is heavily dependent on transit and other services which operate informally or for historical reasons are not subject to tax 111 the nfc award to nwfp did increase during the mmas tenure and the provincial government was also able to win longstanding dispute with the central government over the net hydel royalties but for political reasons islamabad delayed the back payments 112 in the end the federal structure of pakistan the central governments fiscal and bureaucratic leverage the ability of the security services to fragment the religious alliance and the mmas unique role as loyal opposition to the musharraf gov ernment kept the islamists in peshawar vulnerable to manipulation by the state 113 the mma did not have wide berth to pursue rigorous islamization agenda even if it had wanted to and nor did it have the autonomy to pursue policies which ran counter to significant state interests that said it is too simplistic to dismiss the mma as nothing more than pup pets of the central government like all political blocs in pakistan the mma found itself constrained by the interests of the ruling elite and by system which limited the ability of any one party to significantly change the balance of power between civil and military institutions but musharraf s ruling party also had its own political imperatives virtually devoid of allies in the nwfp it needed the mma governments support and benefited both from the perception of democratic order and from fears in the west of resurgent islamism in the frontier72 pakistans islamist frontier in summary the limits and lessons f islamist moderation the virtues of disillusionment the mma contrary to expectations governed for the most part as status quo politi cal force most close observers judged the provincial government to be moderately com petent and its islamization agenda constrained by both internal and structural factors there are few commentators outside of the islamist sector itself who regard the mmas tenure to have been on balance positive for the frontier the alliance proposed number of troubling initiatives contributed to the further islamization of political discourse opposed the participation of women in public life channeled support to the madaris and was hesitant to take action against new islamist insurgent groups even so there is reason to believe that the islamists governance experience was not entirely negative in the first place five years of mma rule deflated the mul lah mystique which surrounded the religious parties and brought about healthy disillusionment with islamist governance for the first time in pakistans history the religious parties were forced to seriously contend with the victorvictim problem their religious rhetoric had helped them come to power but did not prepare them to govern by 2007 most political analysts in the frontier agreed that the myth is gone and that religious parties would have to be more realistic in the future both in their campaigning and in their interaction with the institutions of the state several religious leaders from minority communities also raised an interesting counterfactual if in the religiously and politicallycharged context following 911 the religious parties in the frontier had not assumed governance role but had instead kept away from the formal political space either by their own choice or because of state interference the islamists might then have caused even more problems for the minority communities that is some saw the religious parties participation in provincial governance as welcome check on their behavior and secondbest solution to dealing with the problematic extrapolitical activities of the parties and their allies modeling islamist moderation there is great deal of interest in the policy community today in the ways in which islamist movements are apt to change when they are forced to govern although observers in the west are likely to continue to be skeptical about the democratic credentials and more to the point the liberal credentials of movements like the mma the challenge of how to respond to islamic politics is likely to grow more salient with time movements like qaeda ultimately have very little to offer local communi ties while democratic islamist movements such as those in egypt the palestinian territories turkey indonesia pakistan and elsewhere are able to bring together their islamic discourse and values with credible programs of local governance one could argue that the mma in the nwfp constitutes poor case study of islamist moderation because it was hemmed in by such great number of political legal and fiscal constraints but in fact these constraints are precisely what make the mmas islamist governance 73 the case of the mma realistic and valuable in the pakistani context it is exceedingly unlikely that islamist parties will take power in islamabad in the foreseeable future there is simply mass constituency for such radical shift it is however quite likely that islamist parties will once again play significant role at the margins either in the nwfp or balochistan or as part of coalition in islamabad in such scenario the mmas case and its limitations become instructive it is easy to imagine scenario in which the juif serves as minor coalition partner at the federal level with the ppp 114 or the ji and the juif both with the pmln the juif has demonstrated its ability to partner with virtually anyone there are moreover number of ways in which the mma constituent parties could again participate in governance at the provincial level in the frontier and in none of these cases do the parties need to form majority in order to advance their respective agendas the current state of the party system in pakistan is such that ethnic and religious parties serve as swing blocs and can garner significant influence by bargaining with the two or three mainstream parties none of which can form parliamentary majority outright given the importance of federal constraints on provincial activity policymakers would be right to be more concerned about the judicial political and bureaucratic checks imposed by islamabad than by the composition of the nwfp government itself the participation of the jamaat as minor coalition partner in nwfp under pmln government at the center for example might well be more problematic than scenario in which an mmalike alliance ruled outright in the frontier under ppp government at the center in either case internal constituency politics and international donor engagement will exert moderating influence on islamic political behavior but given the state of pakistans federalist system the disposition of the ruling coalition in islamabad is likely to be the decisive factor specifically this analysis makes strong case for engaging the mainstream pmln the nawaz leagues rightofcenter politics emphasizing islamic values economic growth and national sovereignty is likely to be increasingly resonant with the pakistani public history suggests that pmln government in islamabad would be less apt to constrain islamization efforts by religious parties at the provincial level and may even turn to such efforts itself in bid to bolster its standing visàvis its leftofcenter rivals the pmln also has very close ties to the jamaat particularly in urban punjab which further suggests that if and when the religious parties are to exert substantive political or legal influence it may well be facilitated by mainstream rightofcenter political forces 115 lessons from the frontier as the narrative below argues the mma as formal alliance has for now been sidelined in the frontier overtaken electorally by pashtun nationalist politics and rhetorically by new insurgent islamist movements some of the lessons which can be drawn from the mmas five year tenure may nevertheless have enduring relevance the mechanisms by which the islamists adapted to governance role the ways in which interaction with the pakistani state and the international community exerted leverage on religious politics the divergence between islamist rhetoric which 74 pakistans islamist frontier moderated little and actual political behavior which moderated great deal the role that religious parties can play in bringing backward areas into the provincial mainstream and the ways in which religious or sectarian politics can complicate the administration of local governance on the level of mass politics the mmas use of islamic populist themes may have continuing implications for the mainstream parties in the frontier which are now more vulnerable to being outflanked on the right by islamic discourse parties like the ppp and anp have learned that they cannot afford to allow the islamist parties to coopt religious language and support for the shariah they may as result be pres sured to play up their islamic credentials in order to forestall return by the islamist bloc although the mma as formal alliance is currently moribund it could easily be resurrected now that musharraf s presence in the government longer drives wedge between the juif and the ji the religious parties and the deobandis in particular can revert to form as swing blocs between centerleft and centerright politics juijamaat partnership in the nwfp is somewhat less complementary than it was in 2002 but the geographic bases of the parties are still sufficiently disjoint as to make electoral alliances attractive in future contests finally as will be argued below it is worth noting lesson that should not be drawn from the decline of the mma religious politics is not going away in the frontier if anything it is more relevant than ever there is striking resonance between the rhetoric promises complaints and hotbutton issues of the mma in 2002 and the language of neot aliban groups in the frontier today injustice corruption obscenity government inaction and foreign intervention to name few the locus of this discussion to be sure has gradually moved outside the bounds of formal electoral politics and into the realm of vigilantism militancy and insurgency but it may yet come back if and when it does the religious parties are likely to again play an important role and the lessons from the mmas tenure may again be relevant in responding to the religious politics of the frontier notes

exclusion in the alliances decisionmaking perhaps the most bitter and longstanding internal dispute involving the minor parties revolved around maulana sami ulhaq and his faction of the jui not long after the 2002 elections sami threatened to leave the alliance on account of its slow implementation of the shariah program his party was frequently at odds with the juif accusing it of being too accommodating toward the martial government in islamabad for its part the juif resented sami ulhaqs demands for greater participation in the alliances decisionmaking on account of the fact that his electoral constituency and votebank demonstrably paled in comparison to that of the major parties they also voiced discontent apparently without irony over the supposed ease with which he was manipulated by the security services in islamabad in the last several years the juif and juis have adopted diverging positions toward the neot aliban with the juis taking more sympathetic linesee the

also has close ties to the saudibacked jamiat ahlehadith jah party which has been weak electorally but influential in the education sector in nwfp iii new islamists and the r eturn of pashtun nationalism concomitant with the political decline of the mma came the rise of new islamist actors in the frontier commonly known as the neot aliban along with the return of pashtun nationalism this chapter covers in brief some of the dynamics from 2006 through 2008 during which time the political landscape of the frontier changed in important ways and the focus of islamist activity shifted from mainstream religious politics to movements more firmly opposed to the state the rise f the neo taliban markers of an entrepreneurial insurgency it is still far too early to present robust history of the frontiers new insurgent movements and their relation to the islamist political establishment what began circa mid2006 as spillover of militancy from the troubled waziristan tribal agencies into nwfps southern settled districts precipitated in part by the failed peace deals between the government and the waziri t aliban became within about years time movement which threatened the political stability of the entire frontier 1 this new movement known as the neot aliban is distinct from both the afghan t aliban and from mainstream pakistani islamists such as the mma though it has critical linkages with both groups 2 neot aliban is itself term of convenience and refers not to coherent operational entity but rather to loose collection of selfdefined t aliban groups which share number of common features t the extent that one can generalize about this new form of insurgent islamism it can be seen to have several distinguishing characteristics first the movement is politically rejectionist unlike the mainstream islamist par ties neot aliban groups tend to dismiss the legitimacy of the pakistani state either for ideological reasons or on account of the states ostensible failure to live up to its islamic political commitments on this point however the movement is far from 86 pakistans islamist frontier monolithic groups with close ties to qaeda such as some t aliban organizations in waziristan and bajaur are more likely to have transnational islamist outlook and clear ideological reasons for rejecting the legitimacy of the pakistani state other more locallyoriented movements such those which emerged in swat district and khyber agency tend toward language of vigilante islamism in which they accept the states role in theory but legitimize violence on the basis of its ostensible failings needless to say the latter groups are more amenable to political compromise or cooption provided that they do not fall under the sway of the former second the neot aliban tend to be somewhat more takfiri in their ideol ogy than the mainstream islamists 3 that is they are more willing to sanction jihad against other muslims who reject their sectarian or ideological position4 mainstream islamist parties do frequently operate along sectarian lines but are inclined to outsource sectarian violence to affiliate groups in order to retain their democratic credentials this ideological split is also deeply political the religious parties in the frontier recognize that takfiri ideology can easily boomerang back upon the more mainstream islamists they have as result tried to preempt this ideological and political move against them by repeatedly rejecting the legitimacy of suicide bombing within pakistan though their position with respect to other locales is less clear cut 5 third the movement is often linked to criminal networks and the illegal econo my this was and remains true for the afghan t aliban which is intimately linked to the opium trade in the pakistani context it is becoming increasingly clear even to the public at large that the groups which call themselves t aliban are often more than armed gangs which use religious symbolism to gain foothold in local communities 6 whereas mainstream religious parties such as the juif historically maintained side interests in local transport networks the neot aliban groups have explicitly sought to dominate local services and industries particularly in fata and pata regions the timber mafia in swat was reportedly key backer of the tnsm insurgency and local leaders in khyber agency such as mangal bagh rose to prominence through their control of transport networks used for smuggling goods across the durand line 7 some observers have suggested that the neot aliban may eventu ally go the way of the farc in colombia becoming over time less ideological and more criminal in nature fourth these groups are highly entrepreneurial the creation of t ehrike t alibanepakistan ttp in late 2007 merely formalized what had become franchiseoriented model of insurgency and while the t ehrik eventually took on coordinating role among the various t aliban groups it succeeded as brand more than as an organization ttps branding strategy sought to portray the movement as cohesive and affiliate it with simple platform of religious and po litical values this aggregation function served the ttp leadership in waziristan by amplifying its voice and reach but also served the local affiliates by provid ing them with access to resources and by discouraging local communities from pushing back against outsiders who claimed to be part of the umbrella organization despite this strategy the ttp remains loose alliance of convenience local commanders still play critical role in the decisionmaking of these groups and new islamists and the return of pashtun nationalism 87 some localized movements like that of mangal bagh in khyber have sought to triangulate their position visàvis the state by staying out of ttp and instead pursuing parallel t alibanlike agenda fifth the t aliban groups have proven to be adept at coopting the state at the local level their expansion has often followed predictable pattern wellarmed groups of young men enter an area with kalashnikovs and white pickup trucks calling themselves t aliban they win the favor of the community by taking on local criminal elements and prohibiting certain unislamic behaviors they estab lish qazi courts for the quick adjudication of disputes and having garnered some measure of local support they set about solidifying their control by marginalizing or killing local notables and government officials enacting even stricter islamist measures and establishing environments conducive to their own criminal net works 8 by playing off of local discontentment with the judicial system policing and other state services the insurgents are able to gain foothold which they then use to reinforce their local position and finally this new movement is increasingly in tension with traditional pashtun norms at macro level the neot aliban movement is indisputably pashtundominated insurgency disputes within the movement often fall along predictable tribal lines and just as often local tribal blocs leverage t aliban influence in order to compete against traditional rivals but at the same time the insurgents are threatening established norms by killing tribal elders carrying out suicide bombings and attacking jirgas other aspects of pashtun culture particularly those which have come under conservative deobandi influence over the last several decades are amplified perversely by the militants the destruction of girls schools barber shops and music stores sit uncomfortably with most pashtuns living in the conservative southern districts of the nwfp vigilante islamism and the mainstreammilitant divide the nature of the relationship between this new insurgent islamism and the main stream religious parties is not well understood from distance commentators in the west have tended to assume that the similar rhetoric of the two groups reflects commonality of objectives tactics and even organizational structures it is true that the political discourse of neot aliban insurgents is often very close to that of parties like the juif and the jamaat particularly when it comes to regional and global affairs it is also the case that just as the religious parties during the mma era retained linkages to militant islamist groups so they continue to interact informally with the neot aliban movement most commonly by way of lowerlevel cadres who move freely between party and insurgent structures nonetheless these commonalities belie very impor tant differences in reality the religious parties are often deeply ambivalent about the neot aliban program and threatened both directly and indirectly by its expansion into areas which were traditionally dominated by religious politics these faultlines began surfacing in 2006 but only came to the forefront in 2007 when neot aliban groups began challenging the state in places such as swat bannu and even islamabad it was in fact the lal masjid red mosque crisis in the summer 88 pakistans islamist frontier of 2007 that exposed the deepening rifts between the religious parties and the vigi lante islamism of the new t aliban groups9 the jamaat for example was outspoken in its support for the lal masjid leadership but somewhat to its shock found itself disowned by the madrassah students who were challenging the governments writ in islamabad the juif tried to serve in mediating role between the state and the militants but ended up receiving criticism from its own ranks for not supporting the madrassah against interference by the state more significantly rift formed within the juif and more broadly within the deobandi wafaq ulmadaris alarabia the sects madrassah board regarding the proper response to vigilante islamism of the kind carried out by abdul rashid ghazi and his students at the lal masjid even before the governments operation against the madrassah students in july dissenters within the juif many of whom were from the balochistan wing of the party had argued that they needed to come out strongly in favor of the t aliban groups 10 fazlur rehman and most senior juif party members from the nwfp murred in part because they were more dependent upon the state for patronage in the frontier but also because they were more directly threatened by the insurgent expansion in the southern part of the province after the operation the conflict burst into the open and the juif leadership wrestled for several months with internal dissenters who insisted that the party was obligated to support the madaris and the islamization agenda of the neot aliban links between the juif and t aliban groups have been well documented par ticularly in the southern part of the province where deobandi politics is strong 11 but the rise of the insurgency in 2006 and the aftermath of the lal masjid crisis in 2007 fur ther complicated the nature of juif interaction with the neot aliban and other vigi lante islamist groups by early 2008 this relationship had become extremely complex the general elections in february held in district bannu traditional juif strong hold bordering north waziristan in which maulana fazlur rehman was contesting the national assembly seat served as window into the partys internal turmoil 12 on the one hand fazlur rehman was concerned about his partys declining influ ence in the southern settled districts and adjacent tribal agencies including north and south waziristan the neot aliban had established strong presence in the area and on more than one occasion had instructed people not to vote based upon the premise that democracy is unislamic 13 fazlur rehman sought to counter this politically rejection ist message by dismissing t aliban concerns in public while lobbying in private for them to remain neutral he reportedly requested nonobjection certificate noc from t aliban commanders in the bannu area as result of which he was able to minimize militant opposition to the election process 14 while fazlur rehman clearly required at least tacit support from t aliban groups he was also wary of siding too closely with the militants particularly since the relatively liberal ppp seemed poised to do well in the upcoming election he could not afford to alienate potential coalition partner if anything the election revealed the complexity of the relationship between for mal religious politics and islamist insurgency prior to the polls the juif had fragmented into at least two factions over what to do about the t aliban and in sense the t aliban had fragmented into at least two factions over what to do about the juif fazlur rehman avoided campaigning in bannu out of concerns for his own safety but new islamists and the return of pashtun nationalism 89 eventually won the seat due to the support of neot aliban from the nearby frontier region bannu who commandeered polling stations with rocket launchers and sent election observers packing 15 the relationship between religious parties and insurgent groups in swat proved to be even more complicated as the tnsm was originally founded by local jamaat party cadres the ji was inclined to support the movement in swat including the young maulana radio fazlullah 16 the jamaats leadership in punjab saw the swat case and the central governments military response to be winning issue by which to mobilize its political base the juifs response was more tepid as its leadership position in the government made it wary of disruptions which might reflect poorly upon its management of provincial affairs in reality all rhetoric aside neither major party of the mma was pleased to see the return of the tnsm in the swat valley its politically rejectionist message ran counter to the religious parties electoral interests the tnsm and its waziri allies came to develop similarly bleak view of the religious parties the tnsm leadership including maulana fazlullah had close ties with the jamaat but also with jui ulema from the swat valley several of these ulema went to fazlullah with the intent of persuading him to moderate his opposition to polio prevention campaigns and girls schools but ultimately failed 17 fazlullah did not strongly oppose the mma particularly so long as the alliance took handsoff approach to the tnsm but his supporters from waziristan reportedly pushed the movement into more hardline posture 18 as the ttp patrons from waziristan be came more and more dominant over their tnsm clients in swat in 2008 the movement eventually took harder line against the state and against politicallyactive religious elements the new islamist moderates the rise of new islamist groups over the last several years has served to marginal ize the religious parties but also change their role many religious party leaders are now moderates within their own islamist context in the frontier although they share some of the same objectives as the new insurgent groups their inclination to reject vigilantism and to support the democratic political order marks them as being more similar to mainstream political actors than to militant groups although the religious parties have been weakened they continue to occupy an important political space between islamist militancy and relatively liberal democratic norms even secular observers interviewed in peshawar in 2007 and 2008 expressed concern that the religious political establishment leaders like fazlur rehman and qazi hussain might lose their ability to draw young activists into the formal political space rather than see them join militant organizations the juif has in making its case to foreigners also framed its role in this way arguing that it is wall holding back the tide of militant influence in the tribal areas 19 the religious parties relish the opportunity to play the part of intermediaries between the militants and the state and will likely continue to do so their views on the legitimacy of violence and vigilantism are also apt to prove important means by which they distinguish themselves from more militant islamist efforts90 pakistans islamist frontier ultimately the marginalization of the religious parties is likely to induce two dictory responses on the one hand the parties will be pressured to distance themselves from the rising tide of islamist militancy both as means of retaining their democratic legitimacy and protecting themselves from new and violent forms of political competition on the other hand the religious parties will face pressure to compensate for their diminished stature by moving further to the right in an attempt to motivate their political base and insulate themselves from takfiri accusations coming from the islamist fringe these contradictory impulses are difficult to finesse the juif for example has allied itself rhetorically with neot aliban groups by strongly opposing military action in the fata while at the same time speaking out against insurgent tactics and continuing to give tacit support to the civilian government 20 this kind of balancing act rightly troubles observers in the united states but also comes with silver lining religious parties which can retain their islamist credibility in areas such as the frontier stand better chance over the longterm of being able to coopt local populations into the formal political process and away from antistate insurgent movements assessing state response the darra case by and large the government of pakistan has been slow to respond to the gradual expansion of neot aliban influence in the frontier in waziristan it undertook deals in 2004 and again in 2006 both of which failed to quell local violence and resulted in an increase in crossborder attacks on coalition forces in afghanistan 21 in swat the provincial government responded haltingly to the return of the tnsm under maulana fazlullah after considerable delay it carried out relatively successful army operations in october 2007 which appear to have been spurred by attacks on military targets in the area capture by insurgents of tactically important sites such as the saidu sharif airport and growing embarrassment that the militant groups were operating openly in defiance of the state following the collapse of the may 2008 peace deals the army again took on the tnsm and their waziri patrons in swat prompted in part by concern over the compromise of critical lines of communication including the shangla pass in northern nwfp 22 the military also carried out limited and mostly cosmetic operations under the aegis of the frontier corps in khyber agency in the summer of 2008 ostensibly to disrupt the activity of mangal baghs lashkareislami and largescale campaign in bajaur and mohmand agencies which included both ground and air operations and resulted in the displacement of several hundred thousand refugees into the settled areas of the nwfp 23 while recent actions such as those in bajaur suggest the adoption of more aggressive posture by the military in the frontier the overall pattern of the states response has been quite tentative in the past years the case of darra adam khel is broadly illustrative of the ways in which the government has attempted to deal with the emergence of the neot aliban and serves as microcosm for understanding the interaction between insurgents and the state darra adam khel commonly known as darra belongs to frontier region kohat situated about 20 miles south of peshawar it sits along the indus highway the vital road link between the provincial capital and the southern settled districts t the south is new islamists and the return of pashtun nationalism 91 kohat from which darra is separated by the japanesebuilt friendship tunnel the citys bazaar is infamous for its gun markets which produce an array of handcrafted small arms it has also historically been center for drug smuggling and other illicit trades the emergence of the neot aliban in darra can be traced to mid2005 or early 2006 when group of young boys began attacking fuel convoys destined for coalition forces in afghanistan later this group began calling itself the t aliban initiated programs to curtail vice and obscenity and threatened girls schools in the area 24 the government did nothing when the militants began targeting local khassadars in early 2007 and by the summer of that year the neot aliban group was patrolling roads and enforcing its own brand of justice against local criminals 25 following wave of vigilante action against antisocial elements there were number of failed attempts to negotiate with the militants by the local mna and senator as well as both the juif and the banned sectarian group sipahesahaba 26 finally the government in peshawar decided to convene jirga which convinced the neot aliban to withdraw on the condition that the members of the jirga would continue the fight against unislamic activity and with the understanding that both sides retained the right to use force if needed 27 not surprisingly the agreement broke down and by september 2007 the neot aliban had again taken control of most of darra second jirga was convened in december to exchange prisoners but the gov ernment made major effort to challenge the status quo the situation changed dramatically in late january 2008 when militants seized four ammunition trucks in surprise attack captured frontier corps personnel and took control of the kohat fc fort 28 after jirgas failed to secure the return of the trucks and the soldiers the fc launched robust attack with helicopter gunships and ground forces 29 the militants attempted to cut off fc supply lines at the kohat tunnel but were eventually rebuffed30 the fc also had to deal with attacks in darra emanating from khyber agency in the north31 local tribesmen in nearby kohat were known to be supportive of the government but would not speak out openly in favor of the operation for fear of being targeted by neot aliban groups 32 number of the militants retreated after several days reportedly leaving for more hospitable areas in bajaur33 the neot aliban however retained presence in and around darra in february an underground antit aliban organization formed in an attempt to spur local action against the militants 34 and in march cal leaders convened peace jirga of over 1000 tribesmen to discuss the growing threat t ragically the jirga was attacked by suicide bomber killing 42 people35 throughout the spring of 2008 the neot aliban groups continued to press their position in darra when the military pulled back in late april the militants returned to the area retook control of the indus highway and began exacting taxes on local vehicles 36 officials attempted yet another round of negotiations in late may revealingly the outlines of the governments demands were exceptionally narrow the military would cease its operations in exchange for cessation of t aliban activities on the stretch of indus highway passing through darra 37 by early june the militants put forward more comprehensive set of demands to the government not only the withdrawal of security forces but also the provision of health and education facili92 pakistans islamist frontier ties special quotas in engineering and medical colleges payment of royalty for the kohat tunnel establishment of medical college construction of small dams and the exemption from several fees and taxes 38 the negotiators for the t aliban side in fact included local maliks and former politicians suggesting that the movement had gained real support among local influentials or at the very least that political leaders were pressured into opposing the government these negotiations also broke down and in midaugust militant leaders in darra brazenly established their headquarters in the residences of senior politicians former mna and sitting senator and threatened local khassadar forces 39 when the government arrested prominent t aliban leader in late august the darrabased militants once again retook the kohat tunnel spurring yet another military action this time the army claimed that 50 militants had been killed and hundreds of other foreign militants had fled 40 after being closed for nearly month the tunnel finally reopened in late september the rise of militant influence in darra illustrates number of the neot aliban characteristics described above the local militant movement by most accounts emerged in an ad hoc way and only later established linkages with other networks in the frontier it built goodwill by targeting local criminals but soon engendered resentment for its own criminality and brutality it took advantage of the poor gov ernmental oversight of the fr areas and coopted elected officials into its camp thus allowing it to frame its agenda in terms of local development and not simply islamization or power politics 41 it used religious parties and local tribesmen as in termediaries while recognizing that the government lacked the capacity and the will to follow through with sustained paramilitary or military operations and it fostered relationships with outside groups including lashkarejhangvi punjabi sectarian organizations whose members reportedly established militant training camps near darra 42 the response of the state to the violence in darra was also illustrative of the broader challenges it faces in the frontier the government repeatedly negotiated with neot aliban militants usually through jirgas and these negotiations repeatedly failed one basic problem was the lack of credible state capacity to enforce its agreements the system of managing the fr areas relies heavily on indirect rule by the political agent through the tribal leaders and is illequipped to deal with robust militant movement like that of the neot aliban the state was able to displace the militants for short while but had robust system of local governance through which to maintain order compounding the problem the government often waited to take action until the point at which it became nearly too late or did so only reactively in response to provocative action on the part of the militants perhaps most significantly the gov ernment consistently took very narrow view of its objectives its goal was to keep the strategic indus highway open between peshawar and kohat not to dismantle militant infrastructure in darra as result the military operations in fr kohat were undertaken with shortterm focus on preserving key lines of communication rather than bringing any semblance of longterm stability to strategic region of the frontier t its credit the military began to move beyond this minimalist approach new islamists and the return of pashtun nationalism 93 in the second half of 2008 with its operations in swat and bajaur which appear to have been less narrowly tactical than those undertaken in darra it remains to be seen whether the army will continue this trend or revert to minimalist objectives in and around the fata the return f pashtun nationalism the 2008 frontier elections despite an array of problems the february 2008 general elections were widely acknowledged as being the fairest since 197043 postponed following the assassi nation of benazir bhutto in december 2007 the polls were held amidst growing anger at the musharraf government and growing fears about the spread of extremist influence into the pakistani heartland the voters delivered resounding defeat to the pmlq and at the national level clear narrative emerged tying the election results to rejection of musharraf s rule and an embrace of the mainstream demo cratic politics of the ppp and the pmln in the frontier the results appeared to tell different but related story the mma was defeated soundly by its rivals garnering only 10 of provincial assembly seats down from about 50 in 2002 the pashtun nationalist anp delivered the strongest showing with 32 of seats followed by independent candidates with 23 and the ppp with 18 44 the ppps pmln and pmlq each polled about 5 despite widespread fears of terrorism overall turnout appeared to be comparable to that of the 2002 election participation was somewhat depressed in malakand division due to fears about t aliban presence and somewhat inflated in the areas around bannu due to t aliban ballotstuffing 45 overall the contests were more competitive than in the previous general election the average margin of victory was just under 10 compared with 15 in 2002 the performance of the leading parties was even more striking the mmas average margin in 2002 was over 20 while the anps margin in 2008 was about 9 the overall trend toward more competitive races in 2008 can largely be accounted for by the presence of more competitive contests in the central areas of the province the peshawar valley mardan division and malakand division where the mma had made surprising inroads in 2002 rather than in the southern or eastern districts where the average margins were virtually unchanged 46 on the strength of their combined showing the anp and ppp formed govern ing coalition which was supported by the ppps and the independents the anp selected amir haider khan hoti nephew of party chief asfandyar wali khan as the new nwfp chief minister and the cabinet positions were divided between anp and ppp politicians 47 the juif chose not to participate in the coalition government in peshawar but its partys participation in the pppled coalition at the national level meant that its role in the frontier assembly was essentially that of loyal opposition 94 pakistans islamist frontier explaining the mmas defeat the electoral success of the anp and ppp brought about flood of news reports hailing the rise of secularism and the rejection of religious politics and t alibanization in the frontier while this narrative captured one important dynamic of the poll results it did not tell the entire story the religious parties defeat was due to number of factors public anger over american action in afghanistan was longer driving force as it had been in the 2002 elections and antiwestern sentiment was longer the province only of the religious parties moreover the mmas standing had been weakened by rifts within the alliance over the extent of its cooperation with musharraf s military government and following the imposition of the emergency in late 2007 the ji had decided to boycott the elections while it is doubtful that the jamaat would have returned strong showing in the polls its participation might have cut somewhat into the anps success in urban ar eas and districts such as upper and lower dir the mainstream and nationalist parties were also given much wider latitude to contest the elections than in 2002 and there was by all accounts significantly less government interference in the election process at more granular level the february 2008 results can be seen as the product of four separate trends in voter behavior each of which played role in shaping the outcome of the nwfp elections the first trend was one of specific opposition to the mma part of the antimma vote was clearly tied to concerns about the alliances ineffectual response to the creeping militancy in the nwfp many voters felt that the religious government was too sympathetic to the new t aliban movements to be able to respond decisively to security threats in the province at the same time mma also lost credibility with its conservative religious constituency which was upset that the alliance had not done enough to implement program of shariah in the province the second trend was one of general opposition to the mma antiincumbency has traditionally been very powerful determinant of voter behavior in the frontier it is fact that the ruling party nearly always loses in the nwfp in part this is attributable to voter frustrations about corruption and ineffective governance but in part it reflects systemic problem the provincial governments role in the pakistani federation is such that it does not have sufficient autonomy or resources to allow incumbents to deliver on most of their promises in this case the mmas undoing was in large part its perceived failure to deliver on education health and clean government the same things that brought down many of its predecessors that the islamists raised expectations by promising to be righteous and incorruptible simply reinforced voter disenchantment with their rule the third trend was one of specific support to the anp and ppp both of these par ties ran on platforms promising to deal with the rising militancy in the frontier and the anp in particular was able to draw on its heritage of nonviolence and its reputation for relatively competent governance the anp had rebuilt its party operations after years of internal strife and was able to mobilize strong patronage networks especially in the peshawar valleynew islamists and the return of pashtun nationalism 95 the fourth and final trend was one of general support to the anp and ppp as andrew wilder has argued voting behavior in pakistan is often driven less by policy considerations than by public perceptions about which candidate or party is most likely to win 48 since voters rely on their representatives for political favors and pa tronage it is in their interest to vote for winners rather than simply for those who share their political outlook in the runup to the 2008 elections there were widespread expectations voiced in the media that the anp and ppp would return strong showings in the nwfp polls and the ppp would be the leading party at the national level this incentivized local voters to cast their lots in with these parties in the hope that they would have the best access to state resources while none of these factors can easily be quantified one can make case that the general trends described above carry with them more robust explanatory power than any specific antimma or proanpppp sentiments the historical salience of antiincumbency voting patterns combined with the strong trend toward voter bandwagoning with expected winners should give pause to those who would see the 2008 elections as resounding defeat for religious politics or an embrace of secular pashtun nationalism t aking the long view the mmas defeat in 2008 is best seen as return toward the mean in which political fragmentation in the nwfp is the norm rather than the exception what does this mean for the religious parties in the frontier both the juif and the ji used their fiveyear tenure to gain valuable experience into the workings of government and are likely to remain significant but not dominant players in the nwfp political scene an mmalike alliance may prove useful to these parties in the future as means of amplifying their collective influence in the national political debate but that being the case the trend toward party system in pakistan with two dominant mainstream parties and number of smaller religious and ethnonationalist parties makes it likely that the ji and the juif will each prefer to adopt more flexible and independent electoral strategy so that they can remain free to bargain their way into mainstream alliance after voting has taken place the place of pashtun nationalism largely absent from the above historical narrative has been the pashtun national ist movement this movement which operated mostly on the margins of frontier politics between 2001 and 2007 has nonetheless historically played much more significant role in the nwfp than any religious party or alliance as the nationalists are today leading electoral force in the province it is worth understanding their role and their political objectives in the frontier the movement traces its roots to the khudai khidmatgars servants of god who led by khan abdul ghaffar khan launched nonviolent campaign against the british in 1929 known as the red shirts these pashtuns later later allied themselves with the indian national congress with khan dubbed the frontier gandhi on account of their affiliation with the congress the red shirts were sidelined after the creation of pakistan in 1947 and intermittently banned until the early 1970s the movement nominally continued during this period under the leadership of khans 96 pakistans islamist frontier wali khan who joined the leftist national awami party nap the nap as not ed above formed coalition government in nwfp in 1972 with mufti mahmud of the jui but this alliance was shortlived 49 wali khans nap was banned during the latter years of bhuttos rule and he eventually took up the leadership of the national democratic party ndp in 1984 which in turn merged into the awami national party anp in 1986 50 the anp participated in several coalition governments between 1988 and 1999 it briefly joined ppp coalition in 1988 then decided to side with nawaz sharif and joined frontier coalition with his party after the 1990 elections in 1993 it again formed an alliance with the pml but was forced out when the ppp regained power in nwfp in 1994 it formed yet another coalition with nawaz sharif after the 1997 polls but the partnership broke up in 1998 over dispute regarding the renaming of the province as pakhtunkhwa 51 in each of these coalitions the anp took ministerial positions rather than the chief ministership the recent 2008 elections were therefore the first time that the anp had chosen to formally lead coalition in the frontier in leading the current frontier government the party brings with it number of strengths it can draw on the legacy of the khudai khidmatgar movement by using jirgas and other traditional mechanisms to bring together pashtun traditions with an ideology of peace and nonviolence it can call upon strong base of well educated and politically astute supporters who are active in key professional sectors such as education health and development it is willing to be pragmatic in its dealings with the central government and the military and it can serve as bridge to the karzai government in kabul with which it has close relations the party also brings with it notable weaknesses it does not have significant influ ence in many of the areas which have come under insurgent threat such as the southern settled districts or fata agencies outside of khyber and parts of mohmand and bajaur it has history of vicious infighting manifested in ongoing disputes between asfandyar wali khan of wali khan and uncle of the current chief minister and the bilours longestablished hindkospeaking political family from peshawar its leadership is often uncomfortable and ineffective in using islamic language that appeals to the religiously conservative population particularly outside of the peshawar valley although in its efforts to promote the nizameadl act in malakand division it has been more proactive in enacting religious legislation than the mma government and its prokarzai policy is deeply unpopular throughout the frontier where karzai is widely ridiculed to as fake pashtun 52 the pashtun nationalism of the anp is frequently thought to be more ambi tious and consequential than it actually is it remains the case that the anp like the government of afghanistan does not recognize the durand line considering it an artificial boundary which unjustly divides the ethnic pashtun population 53 and on the domestic front the party has continued to insist on renaming the nwfp in accordance with its ethnic pashtun majority demanding greater provincial autonomy and arguing for the inclusion of fata into the frontier province 54 but despite these farreaching demands there is very little motivation even among most anp party members to pursue broader pakhtunkhwa state which incorporates pashtun areas of pakistan and afghanistan and contrary to hyperbolic predictions new islamists and the return of pashtun nationalism 97 that pakistan is in danger of coming apart under the strain of ethnonationalism re gional parties such as the anp are arguably more interested in gaining concessions at the margins than pursuing radical political restructuring of the region 55 the anps nationalist agenda while generally consonant with us interests in the nearterm is therefore more complex than it is often portrayed the party has spoken out strongly against american strikes in the fata and has pushed against us pressure for peace deals in swat t aking the long view the anps enthusiasm for western military intervention in afghanistan is also likely to be contingent this support as one party leader has argued is based on the premise that the us and nato in afghanistan are not as dangerous as persians and punjabis 56 t the anp the american support for karzai is on the one hand check on t ajik ie darispeaking afghan influence and on the other check on pakistani state hegemony over the pakafghan frontier areas this perspective suggests that the anp will continue to be viewed with suspicion by the militarybureaucratic elites in islamabad it also suggests that any substantive attempt by the international community together with the government of pakistan to negotiate with the t aliban in afghanistan may put the party in the awkward position of having to weigh its its support for pashtun

herald tribune january 31 2008author interview with senior anp leader july 2007 peshawar 56 apart from the substantial american contribution in support of the afghan jihad in the 1980s the united states has appeared only on the margins of the preced ing narrative that reflects not an intentional omission but political and historical reality until recently the frontier was simply not major focus of attention by washington policymakers this inattention however is clearly beginning to change 2007 us national intelligence estimate which corroborated speculation that qaeda had regenerated itself in the pakistani tribal areas has focused us attention as never before on the problems and challenges of the pakafghan border areas and on their integral relation to overall us interests 1 the following sections examine the history of us policy toward the frontier with particular emphasis on american political engagement and various forms of assistance provided to the government after september 11 2001 pre2002 historical context us presence in the frontier has historically been oriented toward the situation in afghanistan rather than toward the settled areas of the pakistani frontier itself t the extent that the us had pre911 policy pertaining to the nwfp proper it was focused largely on counternarcotics and on dealing with the afghan refugee crisis the 1980s narcotics refugees and afghanistan us strategic interest in the frontier dates back principally to the early 1980s when it channeled assistance through the pakistani intelligence services to the mujahidin in support of their antisoviet operations in afghanistan the activity of the consulate in peshawar during this period was focused almost exclusively on support to the afghan operations along with counternarcotics programming at the height of the afghan jihad in the late 1980s peshawar fielded us reconiv us policy t oward the frontier102 pakistans islamist frontier naissance aircraft and served as listening post for us intelligence activity into afghanistan and central asia the consulate in peshawar scaled up dramatically as did the presence of the international community which arrived masse to deal with the flow of several million afghan refugees into the settled areas of the pakistani frontier even after the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghan territory in 1989 us efforts in the frontier continued to be focused on both the humanitarian and security aspects of the refugee crisis dozens of ngos set up operations in peshawar to serve the refugee community and usaid provided funds for education and health initiatives in support of these efforts 2 the other major thrust of us activity in the frontier was its counternarcotics efforts these in retrospect are widely seen as being among the most successful programs ever implemented by the united states in the frontier throughout the 1980s the us funded efforts in both the settled and tribal areas to promote alternative livelihoods these included direct counternarcotics activity such as the spraying of poppy crops in the northern settled districts and the tribal areas and indirect activity such as the building of roads to allow farmers to bring licit produce to market the 1990s scaling back us engagement with the frontier took dramatic turn following the october 1990 decertification of pakistan under the pressler amendment which imposed sanctions on pakistan on account of its nuclear program with the end of the afghan war and the collapse of the soviet union the us felt that it had less incentive to turn blind eye toward pakistans nuclear ambitions the implications of the decertification were dramatic and the bulk of us aid assistance to pakistan was suspended for over decade throughout the decade of turbulent civilian rule that followed the death of zia ulhaq in 1988 the us continued to fund some education and health programs indirectly in nwfp and sindh provinces through new pakistan ngo initiative but did so at muchreduced level of expenditure 3 the consul ate in peshawar continued to operate as hub of antinarcotics programming and humanitarian efforts to serve the swelling refugee population which was exacer bated by afghanistans descent into decade of warlordism and civil war following the retreat of the soviets the victory of the t aliban in afghanistan in 1996 shifted the focus of us frontier policy even further away from the nwfp proper from 1999 to 2002 the us principal officer in peshawar devoted less than 10 of his time to issues relating to the nwfp 4 once again the consulate became engrossed in dealing with eastern afghanistan mullah mohammad omars regime in kabul posed not only human rights concerns but by refusing to give up osama bin laden growing strategic concerns as well for understandable reasons the us policy focus in peshawar was oriented almost entirely outside the pakistani frontier itself and toward the t aliban government in kabulus policy toward the frontier 103 post911 reengagement after september 11 2001 the focus on afghanistan only intensified the war in support of the northern alliance drove t aliban and qaeda militants from eastern afghanistan into the tribal areas of pakistan where they settled beyond the immediate reach of us or pakistani forces with the establishment of the hamid karzai government in kabul the us began to pour resources into afghan reconstruction projects refugees slowly began to return from the pakistani frontier to afghanistan and scores of international aid workers based in peshawar began relocating to kabul ironically this exodus of aid workers from peshawar came at the very time that the us was beginning to orient for the first time in decades significant portion of its frontier policy toward the pakistani frontier itself the reopening of the usaid mission in pakistan in 2002 resulted in the rolling out of several small projects in the frontier each of which was centrally managed from islamabad and the october 2002 general elections which brought the mma to power drew fresh attention to the possibility that absent countervailing efforts the settled areas of the nwfp might become the sort of repressive t aliban enclave that the us had just worked to dismantle in afghanistan political engagement in keeping with its post911 privileging of the militarybureaucratic elite the us interacted regularly but very selectively with both mainstream and islamist political elites in the frontier this policy of narrow engagement which continued until approximately mid2007 was counterproductive in that it hampered public diplomacy efforts resulted in missed opportunities for substantive interaction with influential religious elites and handicapped later attempts to encourage broader basis of political legitimacy in pakistan early responses to the 2002 elections the us was surprised and concerned by the strong showing returned by the islamist parties in the october 2002 general elections particularly in the frontier initially the response of the state department was muted spokesman in washington noted that the pakistani people and the government have already demonstrated their strong opposition to terrorism and extremism their desire to move their society in more moderate and stable direction and expressed the hope that all the parties will be committed to moving in that direction 5 on the whole the early american response to the mma was predictably mixed the us refrained from criticizing the alliance directly fearing that criti cism would simply buttress its popularity but the us also kept distance from the mma leadership at least in public assistant secretary of state christina rocca in december 2002 visit to pakistan pointedly declined to meet with the mma leadership including chief minister durrani in peshawar 6 the cautious 104 pakistans islamist frontier us stance in many ways mirrored the mmas own ambivalence about how to adopt conciliatory approach toward the international community without alienating its electorate the us posture toward the mma hardened somewhat during the tumultuous first year of the islamists tenure which saw surge of vigilante violence and occasionally fierce antiamerican statements by party members outside the senior tier of leadership for example november 2002 fateha in the nwfp provincial assembly which included prayer that god destroy the united states 7 assistant secretary rocca when asked in july 2003 whether she considered the mma to be the t aliban of pakistan responded diplomatically but with evident concern im not sure that the exact thing can carry from one country to the other every country has its own peculiarities but certainly situation where women are kept from working kept from school and kept in the home is something that we would like to not see happen to pakistan 8 it is telling that even after the first tumultuous year of the mmas governance the us showed signs of trying to engage with the islamist leadership ambassador nancy powell visited peshawar in october 2003 and met with the mma leadership prompting speculation that the us was trying to coopt the religious leadership into more pragmatic governance 9 in reality that transformation was already underway the alliance as argued above had turned corner after the crisis over federalism and internal opposition to vigilantism and the us engagement with the mma was never substantial enough to have influenced its political direction engagement with mainstream and nationalist parties despite frequent diplomatic protestations to the contrary there is ample evi dence to suggest that us engagement with pakistani political actors during the first eight years of musharraf s rule was focused overwhelmingly on the ruling par ty to the exclusion of other mainstream nationalist and religious political blocs the stated american policy was to support democratization in pakistan but the facto policy of the bush administration was to bolster musharraf s rule at the expense of pakistans democratic parties and institutions 10 senator joseph bidens oftquoted quip that the us was pursuing musharraf policy and not pakistan policy while simplistic ably captured the basic dynamic of us political engagement in post911 pakistan the fruits of this policy of narrow political engagement are now well known at least in general terms the precipitous decline in pakistani state legitimacy under the musharraf government the perception that american talk about democracy was rhetoric of convenience and not conviction and the further entrenchment of the military into pakistans political and economic life as well as the uspakistani bilateral relationship itself 11 this policy not only had farreaching consequences for the overall american relationship with pakistan but it brought about unique implications for the frontier which was the only province in which musharraf s ruling pmlq party us policy toward the frontier 105 or its close ally the mqm did not have significant parliamentary or public sup port the pmlq as noted above was quite unpopular in the frontier and gar nered close to support in the pashtundominated areas of the province us political engagement was therefore focused on the other mainstream and nationalist parties which operated in the nwfp but this interaction too was limited american diplomats were wary of developing close contacts with the ppp and pmln both of whose leaders were effectively exiled by the martial government the us had traditionally enjoyed warm relations with aftab sherpao who broke from benazir bhuttos ppp in 1999 contested the 2002 elections under the banner of his own ppp sherpao group ppps and later allied his party with the pmlq coalition in islamabad but sherpaos political base in the nwfp was confined mostly to his native charsadda and nearby districts and did not extend substantially to the areas abutting the tribal belt along with the ppp and ppps the awami national party was in many ways the most natural ally of the united states in the frontier despite its irredentist dismissal of the durand line it was prowest prokarzai and wary of religious politics ever since the end of the cold war had made irrelevant its former affiliations with communists the anp had found favor in washington as potential bulwark against the spread of religiousinspired militancy in the frontier even so us interaction with the nationalists remained cautious for one the anps devastating loss in 2002 and its history political infighting did little to inspire confidence in its ability to project moderate pashtun politics in the nwfp moreover us officials were skeptical about its potential for gaining political traction in the conservative areas of the southern pashtun belt and finally the anps strong federalist stance on provincial autonomy often set it in fierce opposition to the ruling elites in islamabad which further put damper on us engagement with the party following asfandyar wali khans consolidation of the nationalist movement in 2005 under the anp banner he visited washington in 2006 along with afrasiab khattak they were received for meetings at the state department and the office of the vice president but later became disappointed that the communication channels with washington did not develop as they had hoped 12 us officials remained quietly supportive of the anps efforts but cognizant of the partys limits asfandyar traveled again to the united states shortly after the 2008 elections for discussions in washington and with centcom in florida 13 engagement with islamist parties if the us was cautious in its engagement with the mainstream and nationalist parties it was even more reticent toward the islamists us diplomatic interaction with the mma while more or less consistent from 2002 through the end of their term in 2007 was selective and shallow the us principal officer in peshawar called on the nwfp chief minister on regular basis and ambassadors powell and crocker paid visits during the course of their tenures in islamabad and lahore the us maintained contacts with mma figures particularly senior ji leaders 14 there was much more limited official interaction however with other important 106 pakistans islamist frontier mma figures including provincial ministers in peshawar mpas and mnas from the ulema class and senior figures in the juif most notably its leader maulana fazlur rehman the choice of us interlocutors reflected in part the post911 orientation toward focused political engagement with the militarybureaucratic elite and its pmlq ruling party all the same the narrow pattern of us interactions with the islamist parties was striking usaid projects were structured in such way as to require minimal interaction with the nwfp provincial government point not lost on mma officials 15 and interaction with mma members of the provincial and national assemblies was similarly limited many such members interviewed in the summer of 2007 including several who led key provincial ministries had not met an american representative in the previous three years us officials acknowledged that the american consulate in peshawar had very little contact with mma members as the majority of its efforts were focused on the problems of the fata and not on the nwfp as such 16 although the provincial and national assemblies were arguably institutions of little consequence in the militarydominated pakistani political system the same was not true of their constituent members many of the assembly members while new to politics were important religious figures in the frontier most of the juif assembly members for example were senior madrassah teachers or administrators often from the most influential and religiously conservative institutions in the prov ince seen from the structural perspective of their role in the formal institutions of governance these politicians were not particularly important but their informal political influence was undeniable the us made little apparent attempt to take advantage of the presence of so many influential religious leaders in the assemblies in peshawar and islamabad most of whom lived in parliament lodges just minutes from the us consulate and embassy the us choice of interlocutors among the mma leadership was occasionally puzzling embassy officials had for example regular interaction with liaqat baloch an outspoken senior ji leader known to be something of showman and figure who lacked strong constituency within the movement but it chose not to deal with maulana fazlur rehman who while equally outspoken in his opposition to us military action in afghanistan was much more pragmatic politician with considerable constituency in the southern pashtun districts and tribal areas us interaction with both leaders presented similar political difficulties liaqat came from the jamaats sometimesviolent student wing islami jamiatet alaba ijt and the jamaat itself historically had close ties with the kashmiri militant groups and indirectly with qaeda 17 fazlur rehman who chaired the senate foreign relations committee under benazir bhutto had multivalent links to the original t aliban movement and retained questionable ties to libya and financiers in the gulf emirates 18 rightly or wrongly the us refusal to meet with fazlur rehman exemplified to many leaders in the mma the extent to which the us sought to avoid interaction with the islamist political elite 19 in spite of fazlur rehmans status as the leader of the opposition in the pakistani national assembly and rather docent opposition us policy toward the frontier 107 figure at that playing the part of the loyal opposition the us went to great lengths to avoid the encounter when pressed repeatedly by pakistani reporters as to why he would not be meeting with leader of the opposition fazlur rehman on his visit to islamabad in 2006 assistant secretary boucher unconvincingly demurred there are several hundred million pakistanis that i am not going to see and i dont want to have to explain why i am not seeing each one 20 limitations on islamist interaction there are several explanations for the american reluctance to interact with elect ed islamist leaders particularly in the frontier t begin with engagement with the islamists posed problem of political optics both the jui and the ji have long history of antiamerican statements and of support at times direct and at times indirect for islamist insurgent groups in kashmir afghanistan and the tribal areas their social agenda was less controversial particularly following 911 when the t aliban became declared enemy of the united states it became politically awkward for us officials to meet with members of the deobandi parties other events such as the leadup to the iraq war and us predator drone strikes in the tribal areas ratcheted up islamist rhetoric in ways that complicated attempts at political engagement second there was an evident though not unexpected gulf in relational norms between american diplomats and members of the islamist parties several for mer us officials recalled specific inflammatory statements made by fazlur rehman against the united states or instances in which he misrepresented pri vate conversations in public fora in order to show up his american interlocutors 21 american diplomats came to believe that engagement with the islamists was too risky and often counterproductive senior members of the juif on the other hand repeatedly expressed confusion as to why the americans would be so upset about statements which were merely political in nature and intended only for public consumption finally and perhaps most fundamentally the hesitancy on the part of american officials to interact with the mma in the frontier is attributable to simple policy calculus for the first eight years of the musharraf government the bush adminis tration saw few compelling reasons to engage islamist parties this was especially true beginning in roughly 2004 when it became clear that the mma government in the frontier would not pose strategic threat to us interests in the region ambassador ryan crocker whose tenure began in november of that year brought with him policy which reinforced this outlook more so than his predecessor nancy powell crocker developed reputation in diplomatic circles for focusing us attention on musharraf and his political allies and restricting diplomatic contact with other political parties this policy orientation continued until roughly 2007 when both political realities and personnel changes began to bring about more open strategy of political engagement by early 2007 us policymakers were aware that the general elections scheduled for later that year might result in political realignment musharraf s popularity was slipping and there was pressure to allow the return of benazir bhutto and nawaz 108 pakistans islamist frontier sharif in advance of the polls22 american officials served as brokers between bhutto and musharraf seeking to arrange deal by which bhutto might stand for elections and come to postelection modus vivendi with musharraf23 at the same time there was growing realization among us officials during the summer of 2007 that the islamist parties and particularly the juif might constitute key electoral swing bloc in the forthcoming polls and could longer be ignored 24 crockers successor ambassador anne patterson was sworn in during july 2007 and shortly thereafter began set of highprofile meetings with wide array of oppo sition politicians including maulana fazlur rehman25 the shift in approach toward engaging the full spectrum of opposition parties was in part precipitated by political expediency and the pakistani election timetable and in part by more open diplo matic approach brought by the new ambassador evaluating us political engagement those who defend the musharraforiented policy have argued that the us had little to gain from dealing with the mainstream and nationalist parties in nwfp which were weak or with the islamists whose interests were sharply at odds with us policies on spectrum of key issues indeed the shortterm returns on broader engagement may well have been limited the mainstream and nationalist parties were in disarray during the musharraf era and the mma government even as it was gradually moving toward mainstream politics proposed number of troubling islamization initiatives about which washington was rightly concerned t aking the longer view however broadbased interaction could have proved fruitful on several levels two of ambassador powells six highlevel priorities during her tenure included antiterrorism programs and preventing islamist political dominance in pakistan 26 on both counts engaging with political elites outside the ruling party could have been of value deeper engagement with opposition parties would at minimum have insulated the us from the widespread charges that american policy was focused solely on supporting the pakistani military and that musharraf was fighting americas war the us policy of avoiding contact with opposition political figures of whom the musharraf regime might disapprove opened the us to charges of hypocrisy and severely undermined support for pakistani state action in the nwfp second american engagement with the nationalist bloc in the frontier was inconsistent and overly cautious the nationalist movement emerged from the 2002 elections fragmented and politically weak and took three years to get its house in order despite its impressive showing in 2008 the party still has number of internal fault lines and lacks capacity to serve as an effective counterweight to the islamization trends in the frontier more robust indirect support to the anp for capacity building within the party funding of anpmanaged initiatives on education and development and leveraging anpaffiliated professional networks to devise practical test beds of reform within the fata could have set up the nationalist movement to be in stronger position following its electoral victoryus policy toward the frontier 109 third broader us engagement with the islamist parties could have served american strategic objectives in the midtolongterm critics of us interac tion with islamists like the mma argue that such encounters serve only to buttress islamist political legitimacy that such engagement ignores the lessons of the 1980s in which the united states supported islamist movements only to have them boomerang back with tragic consequences and that islamist parties essentially represent fronts for militant organizations these are all legitimate concerns but fundamentally misread both the political history of the mma in the frontier and the ways in which current political realities have created space for constructive interaction what could the us have gained from such engagement in the first place deeper engagement would almost surely have accelerated the moderating effects associated with the islamists interaction with the international community the experience of the british and german aid agencies in the nwfp was that islamist figures in the government benefited from and welcomed foreign interaction and that the benefits of that interac tion occasionally spilled over into areas outside their official portfolios representatives from dfid and gtz engaged the mma leadership on host of sensitive issues such as vaccinations for women and children birth control and madrassah curriculum 27 regular us interaction with mma members of parliament at the provincial and national levels could have provided an opening for constructive dialogue on issues surrounding the madaris particularly given that the jui leaders were deeply concerned over the government of pakistans proposed madaris reform plans and deeply suspicious of us intentions toward religious education in pakistan this would not necessarily have been fools errand in contrast to the conventional wisdom deobandi madrassah leaders have in recent years become increasingly willing to discuss in private fora the negative perceptions of madaris education in both pakistan and the west and the problems associated with educating clerical class for which there are few legitimate job opportunities 28 by their own admis sion however us officials had little contact with these mma members and thus little impact on this front perhaps the most compelling argument for engaging substantively and regularly with islamist elites is that it is difficult to predict when interests will converge the shortsightedness of the us approach toward the religious parties became apparent only when ground realities began to shift in the frontier highlevel interaction with parties like the juif would likely have made little difference in the first two or three years of the mmas tenure but by 2005 the strategic landscape had shifted and there was increasingly convergence of interests if only at first at the margins between islamist political leaders and broader us and pakistani objectives by 2005 the juif increasingly threatened by the spread of decentralized violence in the settled areas was eager to expand its interaction with the west and felt rebuffed 29 the us having failed to regularize its relationships with the full spectrum of opposition politicians in pakistan did not have the relationships in place or the credibility to be able to respond politically one would suggest that the us would have found broad areas of common ground with the jui leadership the point rather is that by initiating political contacts with opposition parties only in advance of elections american diplomacy be110 pakistans islamist frontier comes reactive and appears exploitative few observers could have predicted that by 2007 many analysts would become deeply worried about the juis declining influence in the frontier not because they were amenable to islamist politics but because the party however unpalatable had come to occupy an important centrist ground in the islamist political space and an important role in restraining more militant deobandi activity by regularizing its contact with parties such as the juif the us might have been better prepared to take advantage of these kind of strategic realignments in frontier politics us assistance to the frontier development assistance it is by now widely known that american assistance to pakistan since september 11 2001 has been heavily skewed toward security assistance and budget sup port rather than development programming the most comprehensive review to date generously estimated that about 11 of overt us aid between fy2002 and fy2007 went to development assistance 30 the us government is only now beginning to make up for seven years of underinvestment in key areas such as education health and livelihoods all of which have bearing not only on devel opment indicators but also on local security and government legitimacy usaid restarted its programs in pakistan in july 2002 after nearly decade of absence it chose initially to undertake work in four sectors education the economy health and democratic governance 31 it chose also to focus many of its efforts on the provinces of sindh and balochistan so as to complement the work of its british counterpart dfid which was active in the nwfp and punjab 32 usaid efforts in the nwfp have therefore been relatively limited particularly in the education sector 33 neither usaids previous flagship education initiative the education sector reform action program nor its current one links to learning edlinks focus on the nwfp 34 usaid devoted somewhat more attention to health programs in the province particularly reproductive and child health initiatives it also carried out small governance programs including legislative strengthening project and local governance capacity building initiative which recently expanded its scope from one district mansehra to seven 35 us aid officials focused somewhat more attention on the fata usaid launched school rehabilitation and construction program in the tribal areas in 2004 which in partnership with the japanese set out to build total of 130 schools in the fata and fr areas the us also funded several health teacher training and microenterprise initiatives in the tribal areas unfortunately these programs strug gled to meet their objectives the school construction project was hampered by poor security lack of oversight and questionable buyin by local leaders 36 us officials found it so difficult to gain access to the fata that they discussed at one point the possibility of using unmanned aerial drones to monitor the project sites37 health projects ran into similar roadblocks and the microenterprise initiative ended up disbursing only 4 of the targeted number of loans38us policy toward the frontier 111 in retrospect it is apparent that the united states was slow to align its devel opment programming with comprehensive strategy for countering extremism in the region not only were development expenditures small relative to military outlays but it was not until 2006 that the frontier began to figure prominently in us development planning 39 efforts were also plagued with implementation challenges full three and half years after the usaid mission reopened wellplaced us officials and ngo leaders in pakistan were lamenting that american development programs in the nwfp and fata remained chaotic and woefully understaffed they also had trouble catching the attention of the bureaucracy complained one official everyone in islamabad is spending their time tracking the helicopters and other securityrelated initiatives 40 in addition usaids ef forts in the frontier suffered from shortage of office space at the embassy and consulates lack of capacity both within usaid and within the ngo community high turnover in personnel and security threats which severely limited staff travel and oversight 41 while number of these problems were eventually taken up by senior us officials in 2006 they could do little to make up for nearly five years of lost time 42 security assistance the united states took number of steps after 911 to solidify its defense relationship with pakistan43 it made pakistan eligible for coalition support funds which ostensibly constituted direct reimbursements for antiterrorist mili tary operations but which also served as an important political mechanism for incentivizing cooperation with us security objectives 44 recent gao report on us government policy toward the frontier revealed that about 96 of funds expended for efforts in the fata and border region from 2002 through 2007 went toward these reimbursements 45 the united states also recognized pakistan in 2004 as major nonnato ally and made available for purchase sophisti cated and politicallysensitive military equipment46 it restarted the international military education and t raining imet program which was popular among pakistani army officers and expanded military liaisons apart from military support us security assistance to pakistan since 2001 has focused on border control buttressing the governments investigative capacity and pursuing counternarcotics objectives 47 most of these programs are run by the department of state or the department of justice they have included inter alia efforts to improve international visitor processing train pakistani police in fo rensic sciences and civil disorder management construct outposts along the pakafghan border promote eradication and alternative livelihood programs in poppygrowing areas of the fata and teach courses in counterterrorism and swat techniques 48 over the last year centcom has taken the lead in formulating fata security development plan aimed at building counterinsurgency capacity for the frontier corps and improving internal and bilateral coordination on border issues 49 this plan received an initial appropriation of 75 million for fy2008 112 pakistans islamist frontier along with the formal authorization from the congress to provide

testimony before the senate committee on foreign relations may 20 2008 51 the sections which follow provide recommendations as to how the united states working with the government of pakistan might respond intelligently to the changing political social and security dynamics in the frontier following brief summary of the strategic context the first two sections discuss political engagement and suggest path forward for american diplomacy the third sec tion examines security policy and provides recommendations as to the options available for supporting counterinsurgency strategies which target the drivers of political instability and militancy the fourth and fifth sections look at gover nance and structural reform in the frontier including the fata and review the ways in which structural reforms might contribute to more stable politics in the frontier and the sixth section highlights the challenges and opportunities avail able through aid and development there is already widespread perception that america wields outsized influ ence in the pakistani political process this perception is based in part on long history of us influence in pakistan and in part on persistent myth of americas hidden hand regardless of the reasons this perception is detrimental to the development of strong democratic political culture in pakistan and to constructive uspakistani bilateral ties none of the recommendations which follow are meant to suggest that the us take unilateral action in pakistan or seek to micro manage pakistani decisionmaking rather these recommendations cover areas in which the us is already heavily invested such as aid security cooperation and political engagement and are meant to focus attention on policies which contribute to joint us and pakistani objectives while they are framed in terms of us actions in bilateral or multilateral context many of these recommenda tions are also equally relevant to pakistani policymakers looking to address the structural weaknesses of the statev policy recommendations118 pakistans islamist frontier strategic context although this report focuses specifically on one region of pakistan it is clear that the frontier cannot be understood apart from its wider domestic and regional strategic contexts many of the policy recommendations which follow should they be implemented would succeed or fail based not on their policy minutiae but on the macro political environment on pakistani political will and state structures of civilmilitary cooperation on american military political and economic leverage on regional cooperation and on the situation in afghanistan these extant political and structural realities doubt limit the effective scope of both pakistani and us policy toward the frontier but they also serve to highlight the importance of macro political factors in the future stability of the region domestic factors successful frontier policy requires at minimum state legitimacy political will and civilmilitary coordination in the first place state legitimacy is prerequisite for any successful and humane counterinsurgency program the government must be able to convince the public at large that its actions are carried out for the good of the country and constitute just and proportionate response to insurgent activity there is substantial evidence particularly in the frontier that the transition to civilian gov ernance following the february 2008 elections created just such political opening the fragmentation or even collapse of coalition politics at the national level in pakistan could however quickly erode the legitimacy of civilian rule and make it difficult for both pakistan and the united states to carry out coherent policies toward the frontier second challenge is the problem of political will on the part of state elites pakistans willingness to deal seriously with security challenges in the frontier has been subject of much debate in washington many have suggested that the pakistani military has tolerated and at times supported militant groups in the pakafghan borderlands in an attempt to destabilize afghanistan counter indian influence on their western border and make the case for expanded us aid the pakistan armys ambivalent contacts with t aliban leaders such as jalaluddin haqqani and baitullah mehsud have raised questions about its commitment to acting against those insurgent leaders who have close ties to the pakistani state 1 american officials have also suggested that the militarys objectives are often more attuned to displacing militant activity from pakistans settled areas into the fata or afghanistan than to eliminating militant networks outright the nature of coalitional politics at the federal level has also created few incen tives for leading political figures to formulate coherent policies toward the frontier most political elites from punjab and sindh are thoroughly unfamiliar with and often dismissive of the cultural and political dynamics of the frontier and are faced with few electoral incentives to focus attention on the problems of the region the pppled civilian government in islamabad for example has demonstrated inconsistent political will in addressing the most pressing security and governance challenges in the nwfp and the fata and has instead become mired in political maneuverings infighting and dealings unrelated to the pressing security issues facing the statepolicy recommendations 119 third the success or failure of pakistans frontier policy and by extension that of the us will turn on the ability of state elites to coordinate civil and mili tary action scholars have written at length about the dysfunctions of the pakistani state and the troubled history of civilmilitary relations2 successful counterin surgency operations of the kind that are now clearly needed in the frontier require level of civilmilitary cooperation that is infrequently seen in the pakistani political context this cooperation is important for both policy formulation and execution unless the state can coordinate districtlevel government and police responses with military planning it will be ineffective at dismantling insurgent influence at the local level in light of these three factors which are largely structural in nature the united states has only limited leverage by which to influence the underlying drivers of pakistans frontier policy the us should as argued below maintain strong support for civilian governance and use its financial and political clout to encourage holistic and structural reforms in the frontier in addition american officials should strongly encourage the formation of regular visible and functioning forum for civilmilitary interaction in pakistan the national security council which was formalized by president musharraf in 2004 as tool to bolster his democratic legitimacy and coopt opposition politicians including those in the frontier was never institutionalized as decisionmaking forum 3 but it might nonetheless serve as template for an institution which brings together key leaders the prime minister chief of army staff chief ministers of the provinces and senior bureaucrats in the shortrun the optics of such forum could be just as important as the substance by presenting to the public visible focalpoint for highlevel discussion and coordination the nsc could do great deal to bolster the legitimacy of state action against militants and improve accountability by highlighting the role of elected political leaders regional factors this study with its focus on political islam in the pakistani frontier addresses in only peripheral way the security nexus between the pakistani and afghan frontier areas but clearly stable and constructive pakafghan relationship is fundamental to the success of any us frontier policy 4 the state of this bilateral relationship which reached its nadir in the summer of 2008 with accusations by the government of afghanistan of isi complicity in the attempted assassination of hamid karzai is of tremendous import to the united states 5 in the first place american concerns about the pakistani governments contacts with t aliban groups in afghanistan and about its overall policy orientation toward the afghan regime have been well documented 6 that great many pakistanis in cluding some in the security services remain deeply skeptical about the longevity and credibility of the karzai government in kabul should come as surprise there remains widespread perception throughout the frontier that karzai is politically impotent that his government is overwhelmingly dominated by t ajik figures loyal to the northern alliance and that the afghan t aliban are representing the exploited pashtun majority 7120 pakistans islamist frontier pakistani security planners scoff at the suggestion that the military still sees afghanistan through the lens of policy of strategic depth but that policy undeni ably figures into pakistani defensive calculations and for obvious reasons the nuclear standoff with india in 2002 which began with an indian troop buildup in response to the militant attack on its parliament in december 2001 and more recently indias pro posed cold start doctrine have not diminished the concerns of pakistani defense planners over the implications of confrontation with india 8 in this context close indian ties to the karzai government pose real challenge for the united states due to their secondorder effects on pakistans strategic orientation toward its western border 9 american policymakers have to date been frustrated by pakistans dismissive at titude toward the karzai government and its apparent unwillingness to sever institutional ties with islamic militant groups operating in connection with the afghan t aliban at the same time the united states has done remarkably poor job of addressing the geopolitical realities which drive pakistani strategic behavior until american policymakers do more to engage pakistani concerns about the growing indian influence in afghanistan they are unlikely to see the pakistani state elite change its strategic posture visàvis the karzai government 10 there is also need for much more active and direct engagement by the us in dealing with the dysfunctional pakafghannato tripartite relationship highlevel military contacts among the three parties have been intermittent and focused largely on tactical crossborder problems 11 senior us envoy devoted to addressing issues on both sides of the durand line would help to improve coordination on broader set of issues than simply crossborder militancy ultimately the situation in the pakistani frontier is linked with the success or fail ure of the us and nato project in afghanistan the pakistani insurgency is funded in part by the burgeoning narcotics trade in afghanistan and the afghan t aliban movement is in turn being supported by pakistani militant groups and the presence of safe haven in the fata however distinct the political contexts may be on either side of the durand line these linkages are such that us policy cannot afford to focus on the pakistani frontier alone political engagement us policy has evolved considerably since 2006 with musharrafcentric polit ical engagement giving way to more balanced and broadbased policy of interac tion with pakistani political leaders as part of this continuing shift the us should adopt the following policies which pertain to pakistan at large but particularly to frontier politics signal longterm support for civilian governance the single most important thing that the united states can do to deal construc tively with the challenges posed by islamist groups in the frontier is to support civilian governance in pakistan the preeminence of the army in pakistans political order virtually guarantees that militarytomilitary interaction will and ought to remain policy recommendations 121 critical part of the bilateral relationship but american support for democratic in stitutions ultimately furthers us interests by contributing to the legitimacy of the central government in islamabad and enhancing the credibility with which the state takes action against extremist groups within its territory 12 the continuation of civil ian governance is especially important in the frontier where opposition to military action runs high and the mainstream parties lack strong political bases the us should signal its longterm support for civilian governance by condi tioning expanded us aid assistance on the continuation of civilian rule while conditionsbased aid programming usually runs the risk of undermining pakistani confidence in the longevity of american commitment this case is different as it represents an alignment of longterm american and pakistani strategic interests and coincides with public support for democratization the bidenlugar legislation is positive first step in this direction in that it institutionalizes the us commitment and preempts policymakers from allowing shortterm considerations to override the longterm us interest in legitimate democratic rule in pakistan 13 the us must make both shortterm and longterm investments in civilian governance in pakistan most immediately this means finding ways to signal on routine basis american support for civilian rule high level militarytomilitary contact which excludes elected civilian leaders or senior bureaucrats such as the secret meeting conducted aboard the uss abraham lincoln in august 2008 gives the strong impression that civilian governance remains secondary concern of us policymakers 14 similarly american diplomats should make efforts to interact with civilian institutions such as the elected cabinet rather than bypassing them in favor of one or two senior leaders over the longterm the us can increase its support for programs which will foster an informed civilianled issueoriented polit ical culture both the polling programs run by the international republican institute iri and the work by the national democratic institute ndi to strengthen policy development capacity among parties are very important and should be scaled up in islamabad and the provincial capitals institutionalize indirect support to the anp the pashtun nationalist awami national party is the political bloc in the frontier whose interests are most closely aligned with those of the united states despite concerns over the partys irredentist policies with respect to afghanistan and its ethnic nationalist rhetoric the anp in fact supports rather mild form of nationalism seeking only marginally greater autonomy for the frontier province and closer ties with the karzai regime in afghanistan the party has received intermit tent and indirect capacity building support from the united states especially in the leadup to elections the us should institutionalize its political support for the anp in way that is not dependent upon the pakistani election cycle specifically the us should support longterm capacity building programs which would benefit the party encourage the extension of the political parties act to the fata which would benefit the anp in the northern tribal areas and consider providing funds to the partys affiliated devel122 pakistans islamist frontier opment organizations such as the baacha khan t rust for their efforts in promot ing moderate education in the nwfp given that anp cadres have relatively rich expertise in law and governance the us should explore ways to support reform efforts which would benefit both the party and the province at large engage with the rightofcenter pmln one of the surprises of the february 2008 general elections was the unusu ally strong showing by nawaz sharif s rightofcenter pmln in urban punjab if history is any guide the current coalition in islamabad led by the ppp is unlikely to serve out its full term by joining the governing coalition but staying out of the federal cabinet nawaz sharif has positioned his party to take advantage of political turmoil the deteriorating economic situation and missteps by the current government the pmln favored by the pakistani military and by the saudi royal family is well positioned to make return to power within several years if not sooner the us should take steps to engage the pmln while it is still in the minority in particular further engagement with the nawaz league may help to forestall the party from adopting strident antiwestern positions in its attempt to outflank the ppp on nationalist and islamic grounds nawaz sharif is aware that he is viewed with suspicion by the majority of american policymakers but also recognizes that financial and political support from both the us and saudi arabia are essential to pakistans economic stability and to his own future political success pmln government in islamabad would undoubtedly be troubling to the united states but it could bring with it silver lining the party has tremendous street credibility and if it were so disposed and so incentivized could take firm action against extremist groups while eliciting relatively minimal public backlash in addition us engagement with the pmln is means by which to indirectly mitigate the potential influence of the jamaateislami the pmln would be likely to bring jamaat ideologues into its governing coalition and introduce islamist measures as means of shoring up its own political standing the prospect of the jamaat as minor coalition partner at the central level is one which has historically caused far more concern among us diplomats than the more farfetched possibility of an islamist takeover of the government 15 the ji by virtue of its bureaucratic organiza tion is often quite accessible to american diplomats and adept at interacting with the international community it is also however quite ideologically rigid and us engagement with the party is not likely to be particularly constructive over the longterm substantive engagement with its mainstream patron the pmln might therefore constitute more productive approach regularize interaction with the juif the limited nature of us engagement with islamist parties during the mma era resulted in number of missed opportunities for substantive dialogue regarding the parties islamist agenda and its role in religious education and for acting as modpolicy recommendations 123 erating influence on the behavior of the deobandi political leadership the us was also left unprepared for the political shifts brought about by the rise of the neot aliban which forced the juif toward the political center the us should gradually regularize its interaction with the juif and adopt policy of more consistent diplomatic engagement such policy while likely to be unpopular in some quarters is vital part of wider policy of consistent interaction with pakistans opposition parties and an important avenue for dialogue with influential religious figures in the frontier in particular us interaction with the juif could focus on areas of common agreement such as programs to discourage suicide bombings and vigilantism on issues of interfaith and sectarian harmony in punjab and the frontier on provid ing pedagogical training to madrassah instructors and skills training to madrassah students on promoting greater juif participation in parliamentary and civil so ciety training programs and broadly on encouraging the party to play responsible role in democratic politics and foreign policy 16 an american policy of regular consistent engagement would also serve ironically to normalize and depoliticize interaction with parties such as the juif and would allow the us to be better prepared for strategic political realignments in the frontier which may bring about unexpected convergence of interests retool the us bureaucracy for longterm engagement in spite of the growing importance of pakistan to us foreign policy the american bureaucracy remains underequipped to engage pakistan over the longterm this has little to do with individual government servants many of whom are capable and impressive but the tight security restrictions imposed after the 2002 bombing against an expatriate church in islamabad and more recently against the marriott hotel have severely handicapped the ability of the united states to carry out its mission in pakistan most foreign service officers and many military and aid officials spend only one year posted incountry as former state department official has noted with respect to the foreign service the standard practice of per sonnel rotation is inappropriate to the mission in pakistan and afghanistan 17 it should not be surprising that there is today notable lack of regional expertise and institutional memory this is beginning to change but only at the margins despite the poor secu rity environment the us now more than ever needs to focus bureaucratic resources on the pakafghan region in the pakistani theater this means taking the difficult step of extending diplomatic tours in pakistan in order to foster cadre that has the expertise and relationships necessary to carry out american policy objectives 18 t raining for foreign service officers area experts and aid work ers should also be expanded to include more substantive focus on religious issues pakistani political figures have noted that american diplomats are often uncomfortable discussing religion and its role in international relations sub jects which are likely to be of increasing relevance in the pakistaniamerican bilateral relationship124 pakistans islamist frontier in washington the us needs to establish new coordinating mechanisms fo cused on the pakafghan region the state department has taken initial steps in this direction by creating posts devoted to crossborder issues but the most press ing challenge remains interagency cooperation although coordinating mecha nisms may exist on paper the interagency process has lacked consistent highlevel forum for integrating political military and development strategy with respect to the frontier public diplomacy implementing an effective public diplomacy strategy in pakistan is major challenge for the united states the global media environment is such that segment ed messaging that is targeting message narrowly to pakistani audience is increasingly unrealistic security constraints on public diplomacy officers also limit the reach and depth of american diplomatic initiatives the us has taken some positive steps in the last two years to hone its messaging strategy but much more can be done americas public diplomacy strategy in pakistan should not be geared primarily toward reducing antiamericanism as such that is worthwhile secondary goal the focal objective of the us strategy should rather be that the pakistani public sees it to be in pakistans own interest to partner with the united states and other allies against militancy and extremism the hearts and minds language of us public diplomacy efforts is often overly focused on increasing americas standing among pakistanis rather than on increasing the standing of the pakistani government visàvis its own population this latter metric is ultimately more critical component of counterinsurgency planning than pakistani views of america at large adopt language of common interests and common threats it would seem to be obvious that us diplomats should seek to frame american engagement with pakistan through the lens of common interests and common threats and while many american diplomats do present messages which resonate with the pakistani public highlevel statements in the years following 911 were strikingly tone deaf to pakistani sensibilities the war on terror remained the rhetorical focal point of american discourse toward pakistan long after most pakistanis even those sympathetic to the united states had rejected it as inimical to their countrys own strategic interests in light of this experience the us should continue the trend begun under ambassador patterson of framing bilateral relations in terms of wide set of common interests to include not only cooperation against extremism and terrorism which pose common threat to both countries but also stable and prosperous afghanistan the prevention of nuclear war with india expanded regional trade improved health and education indicators and democratization in country in which nearly every american statement is parsed and debated in the local papers the diplomatic tone set by the ambassador and other senior officials has an extraor policy recommendations 125 dinarily broad impact on public opinion president bushs rhetoric while slow to adapt to the postelection environment in the spring of 2008 eventually underwent transformation and effectively struck balanced tone during the july 2008 visit of prime minister gillani to washington 19 even so american officials must make greater efforts to avoid language which reinforces the perception of pakistani dependence on or subservience to the united states comments from the white house for example suggesting that president zardari is going to have to do what he thinks is right for his country regardless of public opinion serve only to drive wedge between the pakistani civilian leadership and the public at large rather than contribute to pakistani ownership of the problem of militancy 20 similarly while us officials may be frustrated by the activities of the pakistani intelligence services it is plainly counterproductive to press for reform of the isi by way of public statements as this only reinforces the perception that the united states manages the internal workings of the pakistani state 21 use rhetoric that isolates islamist insurgent groups the pakistani press is exceptionally attentive to statements made by americans not only diplomats but also us policymakers and members of congress in washington it is not uncommon for statement by junior congressman to make the front page of pakistani newspapers 22 american rhetoric on pakistan from all quarters therefore plays an important role in framing common interests and common threats the us should take care to follow the recommendations recently given by the national counterterrorism center to avoid labeling islamic insurgent groups as jihadists mujahidin or islamofascists 23 outside of relatively narrow liberal elite class many moderate pashtuns in the frontier retain positive associations with the term jihadi and many continue to associate the idea of the t aliban with that of morally upright antiimperialist movement in afghanistan in the 1990s these terms should be avoided in reference to militants instead the us should follow the lead of the government of pakistan which has wisely chosen to label insurgents in the frontier as extremists terrorists and criminals in an attempt to isolate these groups from the islamic mainstream 24 american officials also need to be careful in speaking about the role of religion in public life many pakistanis believe that the us intends to undermine pakistans religious character and advance westernized and secular vision of the nation state pakistans religious parties effectively play on this rhetoric to create per ceived gulf between pakistani and american interests the us can work to debunk the perceived secularization agenda by taking care to affirm that the us has intention of changing pakistans religious character and by avoiding the use of the word secular particularly in reference to the pakistani educational system the concept of secularism is often translated pejoratively as ladiniyat which roughly translates as without religion as religious education is integrated into the public school system of pakistan reference to secular education is read as an assault on the religious character of the state itself 25 early versions of the bill hr 1 introduced in january 2007 in 126 pakistans islamist frontier the us house of representatives called for building effective government insti tutions especially secular public schools in pakistan26 although the language of the legislation was later changed to refer simply to public education the earlier version referencing secular education was widely commented upon in the pakistani press american officials should for similar reasons also refrain from publicly referring to parties such as the ppp and anp as secular label which sometimes tarnishes their credentials in the public square highlight the bleak realities of t aliban governance the paradox of t aliban governance in both the settled and the tribal areas of the frontier is that t alibanism is often popular as an idea but deeply unpopular as reality t aliban insurgents are frequently brutal killing tribal elders disrupting commerce closing schools and bringing with them reign of fear both pakistan and the us need to make greater efforts to highlight the disjuncture between islamic values and the harsh methods employed by the t aliban us officials are obviously not well suited to deliver this message but the united states can partner with the government of pakistan to fund local programs which publicize unislamic behavior by insurgent groups and encour age respected clerics to speak out even obliquely against militancy and vigi lante islamization the us has done particularly poor job in highlighting the brutality of the afghan t aliban press reports in the frontier focus overwhelming on us and coalitioninflicted collateral damage to afghan civilians and only marginally on the ways in which t aliban fighters violate both islamic and pashtun norms 27 assist in shutting down insurgent propaganda illegal fm radio stations continue to act as vehicles by which islamist insur gent groups rally support both in the tribal areas and in provincial districts such as swabi swat and charsadda 28 the lowpower stations which likely number over hundred have proven popular with women and have helped clerics to mo bilize local communities in favor of strict shariah laws29 the us should provide technical assistance in radio jamming to the government of pakistan which has struggled to suppress the proliferation of banned stations moreover the us should encourage and incentivize pakistan to set up countermessaging programs on fm frequencies this approach was proposed by us officials in pakistan as early as 2005 but received little traction within the us bureaucracy due to concerns over american involvement in religious programming 30 while the us must of course take care not to have direct hand in religious programming there is reason why the us cannot promote joint programs with the government which both disrupt and counter primary channel of insur gent mobilization in the frontierpolicy recommendations 127 encourage exchanges between people of faith it is not only the islamists in the frontier who believe that the conflict between the muslim world and the west is fundamentally religious in nature this belief is widespread throughout the nwfp and the tribal areas31 ironically many muslims in the frontier have an inverted view of american religion they tend to believe that the american government operates in large part from religious motiva tions while the american public is for the most part secular 32 this perception is problematic on two levels it reinforces the tendency in the words of anna simons for muslims to look at america and see religion pretending to be an ideology 33 and it ignores the value of muslims coming to understand americans as religious people and america as country uniquely accepting of religious practice in such context people of faith can play an important track two role in shifting public perceptions both pakistani perceptions about america and american percep tions about pakistan the us should promote track two dialogues along several fronts first american policymakers should scale up lecture and exchange programs which bring american muslims into dialogue with pakistanis there is intense interest in the frontier about the muslim experience in america 34 such dialogues create public space in which to debunk clash of civilizations rhetoric and also provide compelling framework in which to discuss states obligation toward religious minorities 35 second the us should encourage dialogues between american and pakistani faith leaders even very conservative muslims in the frontier including those who supported the t aliban in afghanistan and advocate for expansion of shariah are often eager for both religious and political reasons to interact with christians from the west 36 these dialogues can provide indirect channels through which to discuss cultural and even political issues and particularly when ampli fied by the media can serve to disarm the rhetoric which frames the ongoing conflict in religious and civilizational terms 37 more broadly american public diplomacy needs to move beyond its narrow preference for interacting with moderate muslims the existing programs while not without value too often fail to engage those leaders who actually exert social and political influence 38 as anna simons cogently argues while moderates may vote they cannot seize attention let alone galvanize youth or sway public opinion unless they are willing to speak or act with as much passion as partisans and by definition they dont 39 rather than selecting islamic leaders who are likely to perform well on interfaith panels in washington that is those who are moderate by the standards of american liberalism the us should engage with those leaders who are moderate within their own spheres of influence although these interlocutors often bring with them great deal of baggage antiamericanism support for troubling islamist agendas dubious linkages with more radical groups etc americans should reject the trope that such interaction legitimizes islamist ac tors and instead find creative ways to bring them into contact with wider array of religious and political leaders 128 pakistans islamist frontier meet tangible needs the us response to the october 2005 earthquake which devastated parts of both the nwfp and pakistaniheld kashmir was arguably its most successful public diplomacy effort in the region following 911 the relief efforts resulted in an uptick in favorable opinion toward america and may have had lasting positive impact on local perceptions of both domestic and foreign ngos 40 more recently the us pro vided over 115 million in food assistance to relieve the pressures of dramatic food inflation caused primarily by supplyside shocks 41 and it gave token amount of emergency assistance funding with more promised from the international community to support those who had been displaced by the military operations in bajaur and mohmand agencies 42 the us should broaden its assistance programs in pakistan to meet perceived needs particularly in the energy sector highly visible infrastructure projects such hydroelectric generation and roads should be an important part of the us aid portfolio 43 the american experience in iraq demonstrated the value of providing dis cretionary funds to political officials on the ground so that they are able to respond rapidly and effectively to changing needs security and counterinsurgency much of the talk about us support for counterinsurgency efforts in the frontier has focused on american provision of equipment and training in irregular military tactics for the frontier corps in the fat this support is worthwhile and should continue since the fc constitutes key part of pakistans border defense policy and necessary vehicle through which to conduct joint counterterrorism activities most actions undertaken by the fc however should not be confused with actual counterinsurgency activities any review of the literature on insurgency will suggest that successful counterinsurgency efforts are fundamentally about political contestation over the legitimacy of given government absent stra tegic program of coordinated political reforms in the fata there is essential ly government in the tribal areas to contest fc activities while useful are maneuveroriented and tactical rather than politicallyoriented and strategic counterinsurgency activity in the fata whether by the fc or the army will not achieve overall political objectives until and unless the government begins to conduct such activities in the context of coordinated program of governance reform such as the one outlined below in the meantime the us should direct some attention to the settled areas of the frontier region in which there is government whose legitimacy can be contested and in which insurgent groups have sought to expand their writ at the expense of the state focus on the settled areas is complementary to fata poli cy in that it focuses on helping pakistan to contain the insurgent threat and prevent its spillover into areas which might threaten the stability of the state itself policy recommendations 129 facilitate counterinsurgency planning in the settled areas any counterinsurgency plan in the settled areas must grapple with basic ques tion what should the state do in the first 24 48 and 72 hours following move ment by t aliban into village or threat against government or civilian target response by the state needs to be unpredictable enough that the militants cannot easily thwart it but also predictable enough that locals will choose to bandwagon with the state and not the outsiders such response also requires close coordination between local government police paramilitary and military leaders faced with rising tide of insurgent activity in swat the southern settled dis tricts and parts of the peshawar valley the pakistani government has in large part responded slowly and ineffectively in the swat valley in 2007 the state responded to an increasinglyconfident islamist movement with long periods of indecision followed by dramatic military escalation involving helicopter gunships and ground troops although the military operations proved to be impressive and moderately successful the striking gap between tepid government inaction on the one hand and highly kinetic military response on the other highlights the need for more graduated and coordinated state response that brings both political and military pressures to bear in manner that leverages the legitimacy of the state t oward this end the us should work with the government of pakistan to duct needsassessment on the ways in which american support could aid the development of robust counterinsurgency response in the settled areas such program could include per the below police and judicial measures targeted political efforts and structural reforms these changes must be locallyowned and developed with input from political military bureaucratic and religious stakeholders but insofar as the us takes an interest in containing the spread of neot aliban groups in the settled areas of the frontier it can and should assist in building the capacity of the pakistani state to carry out these kinds of reforms fund rapidresponse police units police forces constitute the first line of defense against militancy in the nwfp unfortunately police in the frontier have been underequipped undertrained and understaffed to respond to the growing t alibanization most often police forces simply capitulate when militants enter into village the police are scared lamented former interior minister aftab sherpao they dont want to get involved 44 so long as local populations believe that police forces will not take timely and decisive action against insurgents public support will continue to work against government efforts at controlling state territory the anpled government in the nwfp has put forward proposals to create an elite police force of 7500 which could be deployed on short notice to secure areas which had come under the influence of miscreants or militants 45 building this capacity is long overdue earlier in 2008 the outgoing provincial police chief noted that the lessons from the swat insurgency were that we have to respond to emerging situations at an earlier stage and should not delay action 46 130 pakistans islamist frontier such delays have facilitated stunning expansion of militant influence in only two months in 2008 the underequipped police forces in nwfp seized nearly two thousand small arms eight rocket launchers three thousand detonators over hundred kilograms of explosives and more than 200000 rounds of ammunition 47 us efforts to date in support of policing in the frontier have been piecemeal and focused predominantly on the pakafghan border rather than on the threats within the nwfp itself 48 in light of the current environment the us should take steps to fund equip and support perhaps in cooperation with other international donors new rapidresponse police force which would be tasked with responding to militant threats within the first 24 or 48 hours of an incident the force should also be given authority to operate in the provincially administered tribal areas at the direction of the appropriate political officer further the us should consider supporting an innovative program which has been put forward by the government of nwfp to raise volunteer youth forces labeled special police force which would be deputized at the local level to report on militant activity and take basic preventative action 49 these kinds of programs are particularly important in areas such swat in which the government must eventually backfill policing capabilities when the military forces withdraw to their barracks 50 more generally the government of pakistan should focus on supporting local communities if and when they choose to mobilize against the insurgents this community mobilization is beginning to happen sporadically in places such as dir buner and peshawar 51 citizen mobilization programs which raise lashkars against local mil itants might represent very effective counterinsurgency model in the frontier since most communities have both the legitimating mechanisms jirgas and means small arms to mobilize quickly almost by definition the state cannot direct these lashkars but it can encourage and support them in some areas and in some cases consistent and timely state support of lashkars has the potential to induce cascading effect in encouraging other communities to take up arms against militant organizations 52 establish joint justice working group neot aliban groups which have established foothold in the frontier have of ten proven to be unpopular on account of their brutality and their seizure of local assets one key area however in which these insurgents have effectively played on local discontent is on matters of justice the judicial system in the frontier inherited from the british comes under nearly constant criticism for its partiality corrup tion and slow processing of cases 53 t aliban groups have proven adept at exploiting frustration over the judicial process by establishing qazi courts which adjudicate disputes and award punitive judgments on the spot these courts have blossomed in almost every pashtunmajority part of the frontier including the tribal agencies pata regions the swat valley and even in peshawar district itself according to reliable reports the t aliban have been campaigning in the tribal areas and asking locals to submit their complaints in the qazi courts rather than the countrys courts if they want quick and easy justice 54 the use of qazi courts by islamist movements policy recommendations 131 as means by which to bypass or challenge the writ of the state is longestablished in the frontier particularly in areas such as swat55 there are two compelling reasons why the us should focus on justice issues in the frontier first these issues constitute powerful means by which t aliban groups win hearts and minds and encourage local populations to bandwagon against the state counterinsurgency is competition for constituent loyalty and without targeted reforms to the judicial process insurgents are bound to find the populations amenable to ad hoc islamist justice and not to that of the state second an orientation toward justice issues could contribute to public diplomacy strategy that resonates with the islamic mainstream while american rhetoric tends to emphasize freedom the concept of justice is in fact much more stirring idea among muslims in the frontier and arguably in the muslim world as whole 56 the us should work with the government of pakistan to establish joint justice working group which would explore tangible and immediate ways in which to deal with the competition in judicial services which is threatening to undermine the legitimacy of the state specifically the group could identify highrisk areas at the district or tehsil level in which discontent over the local judiciary has reached critical levels provide expanded resources to the judicial system to expedite caseloads and support voluntary alternativedispute mechanisms perhaps framed in islamic terms but adjudicated by stateregulated clerics which could supplant the ad hoc qazi courts of the t aliban 57 while there are inevitable tradeoffs between considerations of due process and judicial expediency the pakistani government should be aggressive in experimenting with new judicial frameworks which might address the dangerous and widening gap between public expectations and state services selectively support peace negotiations pakistans peace deals with taliban groups in the frontier have been widely ridiculed by foreign observers for proving to be more advantageous to the insurgents than to the state in some instances this has clearly been the case the deals in waziristan in 2006 resulted in an increase in crossborder activity into afghanistan and simply served to provide the militants with breathing space in which to reestablish tactical advantage the government has often negotiated from position of weakness or cut deals when it needed breathing space for political objectives of its own such as prior to the february 2008 elections 58 taken by themselves these deals have amounted to little and justly invite skepticism by american officials 59 that said while peace negotiations are plainly insufficient to deal with the growing islamist insurgency in the frontier they can nonetheless be necessary on political level these deals reflect deepseated cultural norm among the pashtun population which expects that the government will and must engage in one or more rounds of negotiated agreements before resorting to more direct police or military action the jirga culture of the frontier is such that the government is often under intense pressure to engage in talks even if the resulting agreements are bound to fail132 pakistans islamist frontier more strategically however negotiations can serve to bolster the credibility of the state and pave the way for more effective and kinetic action counterinsurgency operations work best when they cultivate the perception of state legitimacy and simultaneously diminish the profile of the insurgent as unreasonable unreliable and ignoble whatever tactical concessions negotiation process might provide to insurgents and often those concessions are not insubstantial the government can gain the upper hand by demonstrating its forbearance and then leveraging that gained legitimacy to take targeted measures against the insurgents at its best this strategy requires certain conditions none of which are politi cally infeasible but which together demand level of politicalmilitary coordi nation which to date the government of pakistan has not demonstrated these conditions include first that the agreements be made public and are publicly intelligible such that it is clear when and how the insurgents violate the terms second that the state respond in some way to the political demands made by the insurgents even if those demands are not the underlying drivers of the insur gency in this case demands for more just islamic system of governance and third that the state be prepared to break off the cycle of negotiations once it has demonstrated its good faith and bring police and military pressure to bear against antistate forces 60 the us should also recognize that not all peace deals are created equal as the narrative above argues there are important historical and political differences between various islamist movements in the frontier although for example insurgents in swat established an alliance of convenience with militants in waziristan the two cases require responses which while coordinated sit at two ends of spectrum even though swat has history of small islamist uprisings led by charismatic leaders it is an area which is basically not amenable to strict islamist rule and one in which negotiated peace deals coordinated with targeted military and police action stand good chance of being successful over the longrun in fact while the peace deals negotiated by the anpled government in swat in the spring of 2008 lasted more than few months the governments negotiating strategy served to buttress its own legitimacy with the population in the frontier and pave the way for stronger state action against the militants that summer 61 further along the spectrum provincially administered tribal areas such as darra adam khel and some fata regions such as khyber agency present more challenging case in which the government has to rely on tribal leaders to enforce agreements and must contend with t aliban tactics which have disrupted traditional social norms in these areas the government can still gain from negotiations and from coopting insurgent demands but is more likely to find peace deals to be of tactical rather than strategic value in areas such as waziristan the state is presented with different situation altogether faced with longstanding governance void and systematic program by insurgents to debilitate traditional structures of social and political accountability the tactical downsides of peace deals are often likely to outweigh strategic gains in terms of government legitimacy the us while remaining skeptical of pakistans negotiations with neot aliban insurgents should nonetheless balance shortterm tactical concerns over these policy recommendations 133 peace deals against the importance of longterm political solutions if the state is to succeed in politically isolating insurgent islamist movements particularly in the settled areas and northern tribal areas it will have to use negotiations to its advantage and account for regional variation in devising strategies which target local movements and local demands curtail american operations in the fata air strikes by american predator drones in the fata are often viewed as classic tradeoff between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency objectives this is largely true as the gains which accrue from the killing of senior qaeda operatives come at the expense of further inflaming local opinion 62 these targeted killings are viewed by residents of the frontier as particularly unjust not only because they technically violate pakistani sovereignty but because they are seen by pashtuns as cowardly and dishonorable form of retaliation 63 the attack at damadola in january 2006 in bajaur agency killed over dozen civilians and elicited wave of protests against pakistani cooperation with the united states 64 subsequent strike in bajaur in october of that year which killed an estimated 80 people also garnered strong reaction in large part because the religious parties in the nwfp chose to exploit it as political issue 65 beginning in late 2006 the strikes while still not formally acknowledged by the us government slowly became an accepted part of the political landscape protests against the attacks generally waned and during periods when the religious parties were distracted by other political activity such as the runup to the february 2008 elections the strikes received only modest attention at the same time the predator program became increasingly important for us policy objectives and seen as vital element of american counterterrorism capability against both qaeda and waziri t aliban networks in early 2008 the rules of engagement were reportedly relaxed permitting us agencies wider rein in conducting the drone operations inside pakistani territory 66 in the late summer of 2008 the us began escalating the frequency of drone at tacks in the fata this increased pressure on the civilian government in islamabad which was forced to account for growing domestic discontent with the covert strikes in spite of this discontent it is expected that the united states in accordance with its legitimate counterterrorism objectives will continue to conduct these operations in the tribal areas and although it longer appears likely that an individual drone attack will spark widespread political disruption in the frontier these strikes do set back americas broader efforts to slow militant recruitment and mobilization and should therefore be limited 67 ground incursions introduce much more dangerous dynamic the american special forces operations in waziristan in early september 2008 generated wave of protests from senior political and military leaders followed by spate of reports which alleged that frontier corps soldiers fired on us aircraft in the tribal areas 68 it is clear whether the pakistani militarys vocal opposition to the ground incursions was in fact genuine or staged for domestic consumption it is equally unclear whether the american actions were conducted primarily for their counterterrorism value or to 134 pakistans islamist frontier send signal to the pakistani government about the seriousness with which the united states views the crossborder incursions69 in any case such actions serve to weaken the civilian government strengthen the hand of rightofcenter and religious parties which often leverage external events for domestic political gain and complicate efforts to bolster progovernment tribal elders throughout the fata governance r eform in the nw fp observers who trace the rise of extremism in the frontier tend to focus on exoge nous factors such as the afghan jihad and the american war in afghanistan following 911 these are of course critical events but comparatively less attention has been paid to the internal structural weaknesses of the state which have facilitated the rise of radical islamist movements this section and the one which follows examine these weaknesses and the crises of governance in the settled and tribal areas respectively 70 encourage pakistan to revisit devolution reforms one contributing factor to the lackluster response by the government of nwfp to the rising tide of t alibanization has been former president musharraf s overhaul of the local government system in 2001 the local government ordinance lgo commonly known as the devolution plan devolved powers from class of elite deputy commissioners each of whom oversaw several administrative districts and wielded broad discretionary authority to class of local elected officials the reforms were intended to encourage local ownership and decisionmaking boost delivery of health education and other government services buttress the militarys democratic credentials and bypass the provincial government so that elites in islamabad could exert direct political influence on local government 71 devolution did to some extent further each of these substantive and political goals but by dramatically remapping the relationships among civil authority the police and elected politicians it also created real challenges to social and political stability as state authority under devolution became simultaneously more rigid and more diffuse the government was increasingly unable to deal effectively with emerging threats to law and order elected local leaders particularly those with ties to religious parties succumbed to political pressures and refused to take ac tion against islamists to whom they were sympathetic local government officers stripped of their discretionary powers had to wait days or even weeks for authoriza tion from peshawar to act against new threats furthermore police forces emerged unconstrained by clear civilian chains of command and became increasingly independent and often politicized 72 musharraf s hand in formulating the devolution plan made it politically infeasible to revisit the reforms while he held power now that the civilian leadership is exercising greater authority both the federal and pro vincial governments have begun critical reexamination of the lgo and have taken preliminary steps to reestablish the authority of the civil officers 73 amendment of the devolution plan is ultimately matter for the pakistani gov ernment to resolve but it has broader implications which concern the international policy recommendations 135 community both in terms of maximizing the effectiveness of development mon ies and in building the capacity of the state to respond to movements which threat pakistan and its neighbors the provincial governments initial steps in reforming the local government system in the frontier have been positive but the true test of the revised system lies in the details the us along with the world bank adb and other international stakeholders with experience in structural reform should work closely with the pakistani government to encourage amendments to the governance system which reestablish decisive chain of command and provide reasonable dis cretionary authority to local officials who need to be able to respond quickly in the face of insurgent activity 74 support coordination across settledtribal boundaries the frontier today is complex patchwork of governance systems of settled districts provincially administered tribal areas frontier regions and federally adminis tered tribal areas each of these has its own unique history and logic but the amalgam of frameworks has also made it difficult to manage anything resembling coordinated counterinsurgency response to the growing radicalization of the frontier prior to the devolution system the provincial home secretary in peshawar served as the link between the settled areas the pata and the fata this critical link was broken in 2002 when following the promulgation of the lgo the government began transferring ad ministrative oversight of the fata from special cell in the provincial government to new fata secretariat in peshawar although the establishment of the fata secretariat was justified not unreasonably on the grounds that it would improve the states management of the tribal areas in both the security and development sectors this seeming lyobscure bureaucratic reorganization in fact handicapped the governments ability to deal with insurgent groups which crossed freely between settled and tribal regions 75 in the area around bannu in southern nwfp for example neot aliban groups moved frequently between bannu city governed under the lgo with elected representatives from both mainstream and religious parties the buffer areas of the frontier region bannu territory nominally managed by the district coordination officer on behalf of the governor and north waziristan agency part of the fata administered by the fata secretariat by many accounts this fragmentation of authority contrib uted to an environment which was conducive to the entrenchment of local insurgent groups particularly in the border areas stretching from peshawar in the north to dera ismail khan in the south 76 the state has begun taking steps to address this coordination failure but much more aggressive actions are required in january 2008 nwfp governor owais ahmad ghani announced the establishment of regional coordination officers rcos who would be tasked with overseeing the governments law and order ini tiatives in both the settled and tribal areas 77 and in october 2008 the provincial government announced its intention to restore the post of deputy commissioner dc and revive aspects of the former system of governance 78 these new civilian offices are welcome development but their authority needs to be strengthened and their functions need to be integrated even more broadly with joint border man136 pakistans islamist frontier agement programs such as the usfunded border coordination centers and the commandandcontrol authority for the frontier constabulary which patrols the international border encouraging this kind of deep coordination extending from the heart of the settled districts to the durand line and beyond needs to be at the forefront of us planning as both governments partner to integrate political and military counterinsurgency activities throughout the frontier given that the neot aliban groups regularly disregard both internal and international boundaries it is in the us interest to see that the government of pakistan has robust capability to deal with insurgent movement across internal administrative lines as well as international ones discourage substantive shariah expansion faced with demands by islamist groups for implementation of shariah the gov ernment of nwfp has historically sought to accommodate the spirit of these demands without unduly carving out substantive exceptions to the states established judicial process this approach is wise insofar as most pashtuns express strong support for shariah yet reject the extreme interpretations of islamic law associated with the afghan t aliban t most pashtuns shariah simply means good governance car ried out by leaders who share their religious values not as those in the west might expect draconian theocratic state there are both advantages and dangers to accommodating demands by islamist groups for the expansion of shariah in the frontier given the reality that even most conservative pashtuns support shariah but not theocracy the state can sometimes co opt islamist movements by recommitting itself to islamic values and making modest concessions on nomenclature although for example the 1999 shariah nizameadl act in malakand division instituted after the tnsm uprising of 1994 was not without its flaws it did not fundamentally reorder the system of justice civil magistrates were dubbed qazis and litigants under the qazi system still had recourse to the high court in peshawar even mostlysymbolic government concessions in this domain can sometimes be enough to drive wedge between the population at large and the hardcore islamists paving the way for reestablishment of the writ of the state at the same time the us ought to be wary of any changes which create islands of shariah regulation that are detached from established judicial processes which offer pre emptive concessions in areas which have not seen significant islamist agitation or have history of alternative islamic judicial systems or which might adversely affect the judicial recourse available to women and minority groups while modest shariah cessions may at times simply reflect pragmatic policy by the state in its negotiations with islamist insurgents they also set troubling precedent by reinforcing the belief that the civil system of justice is neither sufficiently islamic nor sufficiently legitimate weighing these considerations both us and pakistani observers were right to criticize the shariah nizameadl amendment which was proposed in early 2008 by the caretaker government of nwfp for application in the malakand division as originally drafted it would have delinked the qazi courts from high court oversight extended shariah regulations to districts such as chitral in which there was little depolicy recommendations 137 mand for such changes and may have empowered local clerics serving as muavin eqazi helper to qazi to press for judgments inconsistent with pakistans com mitments on gender and minority rights79 the amendment was ultimately revised by the new provincial government following the february elections and finalized in late september 2008 but retains several troubling features 80 governance r eform in the f ata following the february 2008 elections there have increasingly been calls for regularizing the system of governance in the tribal areas which continues to be ruled under the frontier crimes regulation fcr 81 there are four reasons be hind the advocacy for fata reform first the region is rightly seen by security planners as an ungoverned space conducive to the development and perpetuation of insurgent and terrorist safe havens 82 following the reestablishment of qaeda operations from fata this has become preeminent national security issue for the united states second the pakistan armys failed intervention in waziristan in 2004 combined with actions taken by the neot aliban insurgents targeting po litical agents and tribal maliks has resulted in the collapse of the political agent system in several of the southern tribal agencies 83 there is recognition among some military and civilian leaders that it may be more profitable to move forward with fcr reforms than to attempt reinvigoration of the nowdiscredited political agent system third civil society advocates have proposed fcr reforms in order to bring fata governance into conformity with international civil and human rights norms 84 the fcr system lacks basic civil protections allows for collective punishment of indi vidual crimes and places extraordinary discretionary powers in the hands of the political agent who often faces perverse incentives to collude with tribal elders for their mutual financial gain 85 and finally there are political pressures behind the cur rent agitation for reform the anp would like to see the fata integrated into the nwfp as it believes that integration will serve both its ideological aspirations for panpashtunism and electoral prospects fata reform is highly complex subject and variety of proposals have been put forward to bring the region into the governance mainstream 86 us officials were slow to recognize the importance of fata governance reform to overall us security and development objectives in the tribal areas but to the credit of both the us and pakistani bureaucracies the subject began to be seriously raised in late 2007 and early 2008 in bilateral fora 87 governance reform ought to be at the center of us po litical security and development strategy with respect to the fata and american officials would be wise to take keen interest in several of the current proposals and their implications support extension of the political parties act universal suffrage was extended to the fata in 1997 and residents of the trib areas now elect members to the national assembly in islamabad political par138 pakistans islamist frontier ties however are officially banned in the tribal areas candidates for the national assembly therefore campaign on nonparty basis even though their implicit party affiliations are widely known the us should support extension of the political parties act to the fata this legal change would be largely symbolic but nonetheless politically meaningful the current political environment in which party activity is formally suppressed favors parties such as the juif which can mobilize via madrassah networks allowing for mal party activity would send an important signal to residents of the fata about their political rights and their place in the larger pakistani polity and would provide incremental benefits to mainstream and nationalist parties seeking to compete for votes in the tribal areas promote institutionbuilding paradigms much of the discussion over fata reforms has focused on repeal of the most egre gious sections of the fcr which violate universal norms of civil and human rights repeal of these outmoded regulations should be high on pakistans reform agenda but the most critical reforms are those which focus on institutions of governance aside from the office of the political agent and the relatively moribund agency councils the fata lacks institutions through which political power and state resources can be channeled absent institutional development fata reforms will have little effect in integrating the tribal areas into the pakistani mainstream or addressing the governance vacuum which has proven to be so advantageous to neot aliban groups the us should strongly promote the development of institutionoriented reform plans these might include the establishment of local government structures directly or indirectly elected which feed into fata council on the model of provincial assembly courts which establish right of appeal to peshawar or islamabad and modest civil institutions through which to coordinate development programs 88 of these local elected government is perhaps the most important such system need not mirror the local government system in the settled areas but at the very least the state should begin process by which to establish baseline set of government functions and build up insti tutions which over time can constitute legitimate alternative centers of local power both pakistani and american officials have repeatedly raised objections to pursu ing robust institutionoriented reform path in the fata in the first place they have argued that such reforms are at odds with the riwaj custom of the tribal areas and inconsistent with pashtunwali social norms it is true that the long history of indirect governance of the tribal areas first by the british and today by islamabad has cultivated an aversion among the fata population to interference in tribal matters but rather than reflecting an unchanging pashtunwali the preference in the fata for local tradition and noninterference is historically conditioned and constantly in flux millions of pashtuns live today under modern systems of governance not only in the nwfp but in karachi and the gulf states the cultural reductionists contribute an important word of caution to the debate over fata reforms but ultimately fail to account for the dynamism and adaptability which pashtun society has demonstrated over the last three decades 89policy recommendations 139 second some officials fear that institutions of local government would end up be ing dominated by the religious parties or even representatives of the t aliban these fears are not without merit but they ignore the significant potential for local institutions to serve as mechanisms by which the state can exert political and financial leverage the history of the mma government in the nwfp demonstrates the ways in which the state can coopt and in some instances moderate religious party participation in governance even local government system which for time was dominated in areas by the religious parties would be preferable to the present governance void in the fata in that it would help to channel religious energies into the formal process rather than into militancy would incrementally expand the footprint of the state in the tribal areas and would create avenues through which new politicallyminded groups could obtain state patronage institutionoriented reform in short has its risks but it is considerably less risky than trying to counteract an islamist insurgency in the context of practically institutions whatsoever the creation of wellbounded culturallyadapted rep resentative political institutions would send signal to the local population that the governance status quo in the fata can and must change and would lay the ground work for meaningfully integrating the tribal areas into the political and economic life of the state encourage gradual reform path the only governance policy worse than continuing the status quo would be one of abrupt change even in light of the current instability in the tribal areas officials in the fata secretariat are right to worry about the potentially destabilizing effects of reform surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that there is desire for political change in the fata but as yet clear sentiment on precisely what kind of change should be implemented 90 any reform plan should therefore pursue gradualist approach taking local leaders into confidence and phasingin changes based on conditions on the ground the us should encourage two kinds of gradualism first it should use its lever age with the pakistani government to promote geographically phased program of reform some areas of the fata such as waziristan are simply not amenable at the present time to major political reforms particularly institutionbuilding other tribal agencies such as orakzai mohmand kurram and even khyber while not without their own security problems are better candidates for reform beginning governance reforms in several small regions and coordinating that reform with development and security incentives would create positive demonstration effect which could then be extended to the fata at large 91 additionally the us should discourage the government from implementing comprehensive reforms which might further destabilize the fata in the nearterm in particular some observers have proposed reforms which would essentially repeat the mistakes of the devolution plan in the settled areas that is devolv ing powers to local elected representatives while simultaneously weakening the discretionary authorities of government officers program for example which 140 pakistans islamist frontier transferred powers to local elected councils while at the same time curtailing the powers of the political agent would likely result in dysfunctional system even less equipped to deal with the rising tide of militancy instead the state should pursue gradualist approach focused on longterm in vestment in political institutions while in the shortterm retaining some important discretionary powers of the civil authority 92 one possible approach would be to establish an intermediate state structure between the fcr and the settled system modeled in part on areas of the provincially administered tribal areas malakand district in the nwfp for example was once under the fcr but later was adapted in the 1970s into pata region as such it retained political agent and system of levied police but was also given system of courts and eventually an elected district council hybrid system such as this one would not be without its own challenges but it represents one possible intermediate path which both defers to local sensibilities and incrementally advances the reach of the state and the set of shared interests between the tribal region and the country at large account for local sensibilities when prime minister gillani announced in his inaugural address in march 2008 that his government would abolish the fcr the response from the fata was decidedly mixed while some tribal leaders celebrated the announcement others concerned perhaps about their own continued access to state patronage expressed reservations some of those reservations were expressed in islamic terms as tribal leaders suggested that the fcr should be replaced by some form of islamic law 93 clearly there will be pressure on the state to ensure that whatever succeeds the fcr conforms with local custom and with islamic sensibilities 94 it is quite possible that the government will choose to frame the revised system of governance in the fata in islamic terms this should not necessarily trouble us observers as again there is often wide gap between the rhetoric and the substance of shariah regulations the us should recognize that it is the substance of fata reforms which are critical and that if nascent state institutions are to compete politically with insurgent institutions such as qazi courts which have the sheen of religiosity they may need to appeal to religious legitimacy as well that said american observers would rightly be troubled by shariah systems which pre clude or replace existing systems of civil law which give clerics from religious parties substantial influence over social policy or matters relating to law and order or which disadvantage women or minority communities aid and develo pment president bush announced in march 2006 an ambitious us commitment to support multiyear development program for the fata this program was designed to address the poor developmental status of the tribal areas and support strategic us objectives by making the fata less amenable to terrorist and insurgent activity the fata plan budgeted at 750 million over five years policy recommendations 141 complements other usaid programs which have been ongoing in pakistan since the mission reopened in the summer of 2002 it is too early to say whether the us fata development program will be suc cessful in its objectives which include enhancing the government of pakistans legitimacy and writ in fata improving economic and social conditions for local communities and supporting sustainable development 95 the program faces number of challenges including highly restrictive security environment insufficient indigenous development capacity and the challenge of scaling up huge program on short notice remarkably there were usaid staff based in peshawar until mid2006 96 structure aid for the longterm at the bilateral level it is imperative that the us structure its aid commitment for the longterm given the vagaries of the congressional appropriations process this is easier said than done but us aid efforts particularly in the frontier are hampered by the perception that america is an unreliable partner the withdrawal of us aid to pakistan under the pressler amendment is seen in the frontier to the present day as betrayal of the friendship between the two nations and is taken as evidence of supposed double standard in the us treatment of india and pakistan many senior bureaucrats in the nwfp have expressed skepticism over the serious ness of us aid efforts and tell stories of usfunded projects left uncompleted in the early 1990s 97 the fiveyear fata commitment is positive step in demonstrating us com mitment to the frontier moreover the bipartisan bidenlugar plan to authorize 75 billion in development assistance over five years as democracy dividend and to advocate for another five years of assistance at the same level demonstrates to the pakistani public and bureaucracy that america intends to provide more than simply shortterm assistance longterm sustainable development will however require investment in cal capacity on account of the weakness of local development capacity for the tribal areas the stillsmall us staffing presence in the frontier and the pressure which usaid is under to produce results in the nearterm contracts for the fata development program have gone to established american and international firms rather than the pakistani bureaucracy or local organizations 98 usaid is working to build capacity so that future projects can be disaggregated into smaller pieces for local contracting or provided to the fata secretariat for direct implementa tion 99 this process of localization is critical to overall us development and secu rity objectives in the frontier and ought to be focus of continued oversight by the congress 100 lastly the us should consider ways to bring pakistans allies into the fata development efforts specifically the multilateral friends of pakistan initiative inaugurated in september 2008 to assist pakistan in staving off balance of pay ments crisis should be extended into fullfledged consortium which would become the public face of us and allied development efforts in the fata 101 visible 142 pakistans islamist frontier public participation in the consortium by saudis turks and emiratis would help to cast the fata initiatives as global program and not simply an american initia tive while the united states would undoubtedly provide bulk of the funding and the operational programming such consortium could over time help to over come the impression that aid efforts in the fata are designed to subvert muslim values and interests align aid policies with structural changes until very recently us officials have been wary of pressing the government of pakistan to address the governance void in the fata addressing this void as argued above is key component of any robust counterinsurgency program but it is also critical to the success and sustainability of us development efforts in the frontier there is little evidence to suggest that either pakistan or the united states has seriously and systematically considered the interaction effects between governance reform and development policy in the fata 102 the government of pakistans fata sustainable development plan for example acknowledged the importance of governance in framing the fata development goals but demurred on any substantive discussion of that nexus 103 and us policymakers chose until recently to keep governance reform off the table in deference to the prefebruary 2008 pakistani status quo on the fcr the governancedevelopment nexus is important for the simple reason that massive influx of funds will inevitably bring about profound facto changes to the governance and power structures of the frontier aid can easily be destabilizing as local players compete for foreign funds and it is therefore imperative that the development programs are designed to reinforce governance objectives 104 if the governance objective for example involves doubling down on the traditional system of tribal maliks and political agents in the fat it is worth asking whether us aid delivery is reinforcing or undermining that objective if on the other hand the objective is to build up local institutions of gov ernance such as agency councils modeled on jirgas the question should be whether us is aid institutionalizing and incentivizing such structures as practical matter the effects of us aid cannot be neutral on these matters already the us aid programs in the fata are having an ad hoc political impact in some pata regions the government is now consulting local councils in developing priorities for development projects and in those areas in which us funds are being distributed the office of the political agent and its subordinate institutions are by some accounts being strengthened while the maliks even those participating in local councils are finding their influence diminished 105 the us should press the government of pakistan to develop in consultation with stakeholders in the nwfp and fat revised sustainable development plan which addresses this lacuna by thoroughly integrating governance issues with aid planning in the meantime congress ought to exercise its oversight role to examine the political impact of the ongoing us development efforts the degree to which aid programs are properly incentivizing governance objectives and the extent of both interagency and bilateral coordination in addressing this critical governancedevelopment nexuspolicy recommendations 143 leverage settledtribal boundary areas following president bushs public commitment in 2006 to 750 million pro gram of aid for the fata us efforts have focused on scaling up usaid program ming in the tribal areas now that this effort is underway the us should also begin examining the benefits of programming aid in the nearby settled areas in such way as to benefit american objectives in the fata the us administration and congress moving forward should consider au thorizing portion of fatadesignated aid to be used in areas of the nwfp which sit adjacent to the tribal areas several of these settled areas stretching from kohat district in the north to dera ismail khan in the south have emerged as frontline regions in the governments contest with islamist insurgent groups the us gov ernment could for example authorize trial program under which portion of fata development funds could be used in settled areas which are within 15 or 20 kilometers of the settledtribal boundary line provided that these projects serve and employ the tribal population such an approach would have several advantages projects in the settled areas are generally easier to monitor than those in the fata pakistani businesses are more likely to establish jobcreating industries in regions which fall under the civil code rather than the fcr and on social level there is already great deal of transit back and forth by extended families on either side of the boundary some kinds of projects such as health and primary education initiatives clearly need to be cated within the fata itself but others such as employmentgeneration programs designed to deal with the problem of mass unemployment among the fata youth population might be more successful were they situated nearby the fata rather than within the tribal areas themselves 106 unlike the funds committed to the fata the proposed reconstruction opportunity zones rozs do provide the us with wide discretion to promote employmentgeneration programs in the fata nwfp or parts of earthquakeaffected kashmir 107 the rozs while they may prove to be worthwhile are not in their current form targeted narrowly enough to significantly benefit the fata population the tarifffree zones are likely to be placed in the peshawar valley or even the nonpashtun areas in the eastern part of nwfp where they will struggle to attract residents of the fata 108 focus more aid on the nwfp proper after the usaid mission to pakistan reopened in 2002 american aid officials made decision to focus on sindh and balochistan provinces as way of complementing the ongoing development work by other international partners in punjab and the nwfp the focus by usaid on the nwfp was and remains relatively small in light of the strategic significance of the frontier province us officials should step up development programming in the districts of the nwfp not only those which border the fata but also areas of the peshawar and swat valleys which have seen rise in extremism 109 fairly or not the us has reputation for undertak 144 pakistans islamist frontier ing development work in pakistan without thoroughly coordinating its efforts with international or local government institutions and objectives110 development in nwfp is an area in which the us can and should work closely with the provincial government and other international donors to align aid spending with the governments own objectives in education health and other sectors there are also opportunities to fund highimpact work outside of the core velopment sectors as noted above the pakistan legislative strengthening program funded by usaid from 20052008 was well received in the nwfp by both mainstream and religious party mpas and should be considered for renewal 111 the us in consultation with international lending organizations should also explore supporting and financing small and mediumscale hydroelectric projects 112 these proj ects would provide highvisibility opportunities to demonstrate the us aid commitment would help pakistan meet its growing energy needs and would provide revenue to the frontier province which would in turn likely be invested in the health and education sectors 113 as the us prepares for possibly dramatic increase of nonmilitary aid to pakistan it should also consider creative and nontraditional projects which might complement efforts in nwfp and the fata the us could expand funding for innovative interagency approaches such as the state departments economic empowerment in strategic regions which seeks to encourage entrepreneurship in the pakafghan border areas and serve as clearinghouse for linking opportunities with public and private partners both donors and investors in the us 114 american aid officials could also explore the possibility of funding on trial basis skills training centers in cooperation with select madaris number of clerics in nwfp have expressed interest in providing marketable skills to their madrassah graduates and it would not be infeasible to design vetting process which satisfies us grantee certification requirements and also incentivizes madrassah leaders to work more closely with pakistani and international donors and finally the us should seek out ways to leverage the universities in southern nwfp to further longterm economic development objectives t aking advantage of pool of students from the settled and tribal areas now studying at the university of peshawar est 1950 gomal university in dera ismail khan est 1974 kohat university of science and t echnology est 2001 and university of science and t echnology bannu est 2005 the us could fund skills courses on accounting project management and economic development which would help to build local capacity for aid programs in the frontier and could sponsor entrepreneurship competitions for business students focused on local small and medium enterprise conclusion toward political mainstreaming us policymakers dealing with the frontier are routinely torn between short term objectives which are primarily oriented around preventing attacks on us forces in afghanistan and americas longterm interest in seeing stable frontier which denies islamist insurgent groups the physical and sociopolitical space to carry policy recommendations 145 out operations against pakistan and its allies this mismatch unavoidably entails cer tain tradeoffs between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency objectives ground incursions by us troops into the fata for example may disrupt key terrorist networks but also undermine longterm efforts to stabilize the frontier in general though these tradeoffs are far from absolute despite widespread militancy and growing concerns about pakistans strategic ambivalence regarding the neot aliban insurgency there is reason why the us cannot pursue twotrack approach that addresses the shortterm terrorist threat and at the same time lays the groundwork even incrementally for more comprehensive counterinsurgency efforts this approach is critical because solutions to the problems posed by illiberal or insurgent islamism ultimately require political mainstreaming this in turn calls for legitimate and capable state institutions both civilian and military which can set the political boundaries for islamist participation and respond effectively to new and unexpected forms of religious insurgency 115 t begin with successful counterinsurgency track will be one that is able to leverage political and social fragmentation in the frontier the pakistani government has long history of taking advantage of cleavages within and among tribal structures 116 in the wake of the anbar awakening in iraq american policymakers have discussed whether similar strategies might be successful in pakistan carrying out tribeoriented anbar model in and around the fata would pose real challenges on account of the internally fragmented egalitarian and increasingly entrepreneurial nature of the pashtun tribal system although tribal lashkars may prove to be useful in pushing back neot aliban advances in some areas and should be supported by the state when they do so these ad hoc alliances are likely to disintegrate quickly or even turn against the government 117 any effort to take advantage of fragmentation in the frontier must integrate political strategy with tactical approaches from the outset and should be oriented around concerted program to incentivize tribal communities and relatively moderate islamist groups to integrate into the political mainstream ultimately the kinds of cleavages that matter most are those that divide politically accommodationist groups which accept the authority of the state from politically rejectionist groups which contest it this is true within tribal communities as well as within ideologicallydriven islamist movements and here again the united states can play significant but indirect role by supporting policies which help to delegitimize and isolate rejectionist groups and encourage local populations and relatively moderate islamist leaders such as those who supported the old t aliban but are threatened by the neot aliban movement to throw in their lot with the state rather than the insurgents this requires the use of soft power initiatives particularly in the area of fata development but it also requires that such initiatives be more thoroughly integrated with security efforts and robust governance reforms integrated approaches even if they are at first implemented only in small demonstration areas such as the mrz concept outlined below are likely to be the only effective means of translating development assistance into support for state authority these policies will obviously take time but their potential impact is not confined to the longrun they can also have immediate relevance as means of assisting the 146 pakistans islamist frontier government of pakistan in solidifying its nearterm military gains in the frontier recent campaigns in swat bajaur and mohmand for example will prove fruitless unless the state is able to use the operations to drive wedge between the insurgents and the local populations and implement governance structures which can provide security and development after the army returns to its barracks there are signs that both the security establishment and the political leadership within pakistan increasingly see the spreading militancy as an internal challenge and not simply regional problem which can be externalized their resolve in dealing with this challenge may yet grow so long as the insurgents continue to target government interests and civilian populations while american officials are for good reason likely to remain skeptical about the capacity and the will of the pakistani government to deal with these problems the united states as practical matter has choice but to work with pakistan in addressing the

of pakistan over the next two years to deny space to neot aliban insurgent groups in the frontier the account is intentionally optimistic and brackets substantial questions about the situation in afghanistan the nature of interagency coordination within the us the stability of the pakistani coalition government and the state of uspakistani bilateral relations all the same the picture it paints is not farfetched in fact it presents but one of many possible policy approaches to the frontier the particulars of which are far less important than the overall strategic framework which attempts to integrate governance development and security initiatives in geographically focused and politically coordinated manner the narrative first addresses the nwfp region of the frontier and then the fata although these two areas are increasingly interconnected they nonetheless require somewhat different strategies particularly in the nearterm addressing the nw fp new security coo peration it is 2010 two years ago the situation in nwfp was nearly intolerable t ehrik et alibanepakistan militants were clashing with pakistan army forces in swat insurgents were threatening peshawar from nearby khyber agency the spillover from military operations in bajaur had brought hundreds of thousands of residents from the fata into the settled areas and nwfp provincial government officials were regularly being targeted by militant groups in spite of steppedup military action by the pakistan army the united states remained worried that the insurgency was metastasizing and that its spread to the settled areas of the frontier had the potential to seriously destabilize the new co alition government in islamabad review of the us policy portfolio by the new administration revealed that washington had traditionally focused relatively little 158 pakistans islamist frontier attention on the nwfp itself with most of the programs oriented around anti narcotics and few modest development and civil society initiatives in early 2009 us officials in consultation with the provincial government and islamabad identified two major factors facilitating the insurgency in the settled areas frustration with the local justice system which t aliban groups exploited by establishing qazi courts and profoundly low expectations by the public of timely govern ment response to insurgent advances which caused local populations to bandwagon with the militants seeking to assist in addressing the first problem the us began needsassess ment on local nwfp justice issues carried out in cooperation with the provincial government and managed under usaids democracy and governance programming field surveys identified four highrisk districts in which discontent threatened to create openings for the neot aliban the research also underscored that while most local communities wanted shariah they did not want to be governed by clerics or subjected to harsh and arbitrary punishments in the style of the afghan t aliban in second phase of the project building on this research the us funded provincial government programs aimed at speeding the caseload at the district court level and also initiatives which helped to set up alternative dispute resolution mechanisms consistent with local norms and traditions attempts to deal with the bandwagoning problem in the settled areas focused on the critical role of police forces operating in vulnerable areas here the problem was fairly clear local police were the first line of defense but had insufficient resources or incentives to push back against insurgent advances the pakistani military meanwhile had the capabilities but was often unwelcome in these areas local security officials argued that the province needed to develop rapidresponse police force that could deploy quickly to build confidence in the government and encourage local populations to side with the state acting both in response to insurgent activities and preemptively to shore up areas which were coming under increased threat although it recognized the need the us bureaucracy was not well organized to support police programs in the frontier resources expertise and authorities were spread out among the departments of state justice and defense eventually however the us embassy coordinated joint plan to assist the pakistani government in equipping funding and training the force on three year trial basis and the program was rolled out in five highrisk districts bordering conflict zones buner lower dir kohat mardan and peshawar joint uspakistani working group was set up to monitor the program and conduct regular needsassessments operationally this rapidresponse force was overseen by special committee led by the nwfp chief minister along with the inspector general of the frontier corps inspector general of police and representative from the armys xi corps in peshawar the goal of the program was to do more than simply add one additional type of security force it was rather to facilitate robust security coordination at the provincial level and provide capacity for the state to implement graduated response to new threats rather than waiting until situations required fullscale military intervention one critical aspect of the program was that each regional coordination officer rco was given the authority to deploy subsets of the force in his area on short epilogue frontier 2010 159 notice without going up the chain of command provincial police officials recogniz ing that the objectives of this new force were 80 optical designed to shift perceptions and only 20 kinetic designed to physically displace insurgents also mapped out an outreach plan to local politicians bureaucrats police officers and religious leaders to assure them that the rapidresponse force would provide ground support within 24 hours and could be called upon in support of local community lashkars raised against the insurgents the program got off to slow start it took nearly year for the provincial govern ment to induct personnel most of whom were recruited from areas outside of the five focus districts set up the new coordination mechanisms and determine the best way to divide the force within the districts the first training programs moreover were only barely adequate to prepare the force for its new duties by early 2010 however the program was beginning to have noticeable impact local communities dissatisfied with t aliban influence in their areas were increasingly calling on the rapidresponse force for assistance and the provision by centcom of several helicopters to facilitate the insertion of police forces into remote areas further strengthened perceptions that the provincial government was committed to standing with local communities the special police force also took on another important role in mid2010 when at the request of the pakistan army it was expanded to backfill stability operations in the swat valley following the militarys formal departure by late 2010 the forces area of operations had been expanded to 10 of the nwfps 24 districts and had contributed to significant diminution of insurgent influence in the settled areas concomitant with these programs focused on justice and policing the us state department had in early 2009 initiated more broadbased strategy of engagement at both the federal and provincial levels with rightofcenter and religious parties while these parties rhetoric about american involvement in the region continued to be just as heated as ever behind the scenes us officials found the party leaders to be quite pragmatic and interested for their own reasons in seeing the neot aliban insurgency wane in the frontier and in finding new vocational avenues for their madrassah graduates by the time that the pmln engineered surprise return to power in mid2010 bringing with it greater participation by the religious parties in the nwfp the us had built measure of trust with these groups working together with officials from the british german saudi and emirati governments american diplomats had begun dialogue with madrassah leaders about practical ways to support programs that would drain support from the most extreme neot aliban activities and provide new vocational training opportunities for their graduates addressing the f ata counterinsurgency and mr zs it is 2010 two years ago it was clear that the security situation in the fata was rapidly deteriorating localized insurgencies from bajaur to south waziristan and practically everywhere in between were increasingly interconnected american security officials were consumed with targeting not only ttp but also 160 pakistans islamist frontier the haqqanis crossborder network based in waziristan distrust between the us and pakistani governments had increased steadily over the years and had come to flash point following the american ground incursions from across the border in afghanistan in september 2008 as part of thenpresident bushs 750 million aid pledge usaid had begun im plementing development programs in the fata number of these projects were seen as innovative but the collapsing security situation and the lack of any real governance framework in the tribal areas through which to implement meaningful political and economic change produced growing skepticism in washington that the funds would contribute to us security objectives the new government in islamabad appeared at first to be open to substantive fata reforms which might begin to integrate the tribal areas with the pakistani mainstream but lacking political will eventually fell back on plans which implemented reforms only at the margins us military officials were similarly at crossroads focus on the insurgency in afghanistan was intensifying and policy reviews of the situation in the pakistani tribal areas made it clear that the lack of access and more fundamentally the lack of real government in the tribal areas made any kind of anbar model from iraq almost impossible in the fata the egalitarian tribal structure of the pashtuns also made it difficult to imagine sustaining ad hoc alliances in the absence of broader political framework realizing that the security development and governance challenges were in creasingly interconnected us officials settled on new approach which adapted existing counterinsurgency models to the unique circumstances of the tribal areas they would focus aid and stability efforts on select number of model reform zones mrzs in the fata each of which would also be given new system of local governance and representation sponsored by an international consortium which grew out of the friends of pakistan initiative and which was given strong public backing by saudi arabia turkey and the united arab emirates these zones would concentrate the effects of pakistani development efforts plant the seeds for political activity and sustainable governance frameworks and create demonstration effect throughout the tribal areas the mrz effort required sustained negotiations and buyin at the highest lev els the pppled government in islamabad although initially skeptical eventually realized that the political gains from targeted highly visible development efforts could be substantial they also welcomed the excuse to put off major fatawide reforms which might be politically unpalatable the anp leadership in peshawar saw the plan as first step toward integrating the fata with the nwfp an idea that they had long called for the religious parties saw opportunities for expanding their political presence in the tribal areas and the pakistan military agreed to the plan in exchange for us commitments to provide special equipment for use in the mrz areas in addition to increased access for pakistani military officials to us military training abroad the army leadership was somewhat ambivalent about undertak ing counterinsurgency programs in the fata even in relatively peaceful areas but pressure from the new centcom commander along with deteriorating security situation which put nearly all of the 750 million in usaid projects at risk convinced the military that the mrz program was worth supportingepilogue frontier 2010 161 the program began with five mrzs one in each of the five tribal agencies out side of waziristan each zone encompassed approximately one tehsil subagency administrative unit the program was essentially optin tribal communities in particular area were presented with deal if they agreed to the establishment of an mrz in their area they would benefit from windfall of development projects as well as increased security assistance from the frontier corps in return they would come under redesigned governance framework which while respecting local customs and traditions would establish new institutions and rules for politi cal competition the details of this plan contained number of compelling political incentives the government and the international consortium focused development projects in the mrzs and fielded extra personnel and resources respectively for the fc units who operated there the military agreed not to operate regular army troops in the zones except under narrowly defined conditions the office of the political agent retained its robust discretionary powers but was stripped of the authorities granted under the antiquated frontier crimes regulation to exact collective punishment the government agreed to preserve riwaj custom to extend right of judicial appeal to the peshawar high court and to allow qazi courts under the oversight of the political agent the government also set up new wing within the frontier corps which under the direction of the rcos acted analogously to the rapidresponse police force in the settled areas the mrz framework also established for the first time substantive system of local governance in the fata elected councils were set up at the tehsil and union council subtehsil levels and elections were held on party basis parallel struc ture of youth councils was also established in each tehsil in order to encourage politi cal participation by the younger generation these councils were given broad authority to propose local development initiatives though the final approval rested with the bureaucracy in peshawar and each council member was given discretionary funds for development in his own constituency the framework also provided for an interface between elected councils and local jirgas with the latter being given formal role in proposing development projects handling complaints and resolving disputes under the oversight of the political agent the plan included an array of efforts to obtain and sustain buyin by local leaders t ehsillevel elected leaders were granted observer status in the nwfp provincial assembly in peshawar and were afforded some of the privileges formerly retained by the maliks such as the ability to distribute foreign work permits local maliks who had long been the recipients of generous subventions by the state were for the most part coopted into the new system by the prospect of participating in the new and lucrative elected councils of directing development projects to tribal clients and of taking advantage of special transition fund which continued to provide subventions at current levels for five years the political objective of the mrzs was to gradually incentivize an expansion of the states writ in the tribal areas and institutionalize that expansion by cultivat ing new forms of political legitimacy the reality at least initially proved to be more complicated there were disputes and legal hurdles over the new administrative 162 pakistans islamist frontier frameworks it took time to raise new frontier corps levies which would operate in the mrz areas the first set of elections was marred by neot aliban attacks and us officials became concerned when some of the religious parties came to hold sizeable number of seats in the governing councils t aliban groups targeted several of the reform zones during the first year but only twice did the government have to bring in the regular army to clear the area and drive out insurgents by late 2009 however the dynamic was beginning to change it had become clear that the state was committed to securing these areas and to undertaking visible and communitydriven development work usaid capacitybuilding efforts were being extended to include training for ngos and recent university graduates from nearby areas such as peshawar kohat bannu and dera ismail khan once the security situation in the mrzs stabilized the zones became draw for ngos construction companies and young people seeking work there was even talk of situating tarifffree reconstruction opportunity zone roz in the area with support from punjabi textile magnate at the outset the mrzs were criticized for simply displacing insurgent activity into other areas of the fata and indeed that was the shortterm effect but by the middle of 2010 it was increasingly obvious that the mrzs were having broader impact other tribal leaders were clamoring to see the program expanded to their regions the government of pakistan was able to point to tangible progress in local livelihoods development indicators and job creation the state had learned by trial and error great deal about coordinating security and development activities at the local level new leaders were beginning to emerge in the mrzs who had stake in local institutions and development the religious parties were competing fiercely with the pashtun nationalist politicians to demonstrate who could build the greatest number of basic health units and perhaps most importantly the program had introduced muchneeded change dynamic to the fata the mrz elected leaders meanwhile had begun insisting that their observer sta in the nwfp provincial assembly be converted into full membership and there was growing sense in the fata that some kind of gradual administrative integration of the tribal areas into the nwfp would not necessarily come at the expense of riwaj or the special privileges which the tribes historically enjoyed the debate over fata reform had noticeably shifted and although the situation in waziristan was still very poor there appeared to be growing consensus about the need to bring institutionoriented reform to the tribal areas at large from security perspective the mrz experiment had done little to directly disrupt the hardcore neot aliban networks in the fata but combined with counterinsurgencyoriented programs in the nwfp us and pakistani officials were cautiously optimistic that the mrzs had begun to isolate the insurgents to smaller and smaller areas of the fata create momentum for key structural reforms and increase the reach and credibility of the state into areas which had previously been all but ungoverned
