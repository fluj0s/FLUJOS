affairs defense and trade division summary many believe that the department of defense dod including the air force must transform itself to ensure future us military effectiveness the air force has transformation plan that includes advanced technologies concept development and organizational innovation issues for congress include the efficacy of this plan its feasibility and the attendant costs this report will be updated introduction beginning in the 1990s observers have discussed the need for dod to transform in light of rapidly changing international circumstances1 both the clinton and george w bush administrations argued that the united states must embark on transformation path today to meet range of future security challenges2 while the united states is todays dominant military power past dominant powers have been surprised by changing circumstances and unforeseen threats3 further the need for dod to confront nonstate actors eg terrorists insurgents international organized crime narco traffickers very different challenge than confronting nationstates may grow in the future in may 1996 the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff published joint vision 2010 conceptual template for how americas armed forces may exploit technological opportunities to achieve new levels of effectiveness in joint military operations this transformation guide was updated expanded and republished in may 2000 dods 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr described six critical goals to focus transformation efforts 1 protecting critical bases of operations and defeating 1 the 1997

and 6 leveraging information technology and innovative concepts to develop an interoperable joint command control communications and surveillance architecture4 in november 2001 dod established new office to manage its transformation efforts it is generally accepted that transformation will require new technologies new operational concepts and organizational innovation transformation will likely require more emphasis on service and joint concept development and experiments science and technology efforts tied closely to warfighters processes that identify and quickly operationalize promising concepts and interoperability efforts critical for effective coalition operations5 dod and the military services have developed transformation plans and to varying degrees embarked upon them yet questions remain about cost schedule and the need to balance transformation objectives with near term modernization needs transformation is not modernization which aims at improving existing capabilities thus transformation and modernization may diverge and can compete for funds and priority the need to reset equipment wornout in the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq also competes with transformation air force transformation activities the air forces transformation process is encapsulated in its transformation flight plan aftfp first published in 2003 and updated in 2004 the aftfp documents ongoing air force transformation efforts and ties them to the 2001 qdrs six operational transformation goals the aftfp describes the air forces core competencies efforts to adapt the air force culture and organizational structure six concepts of operations which are under development and eight transformational capabilities that will enable them the 2004 aftfp departs from the 2003 version by combining some of the concepts of operation conops being pursued and articulating new efforts in business transformation unlike the 2003 version the 2004 aftfp also discusses the role of battlefield airmen and helping us allies to transform the air force defines transformation as process by which the military achieves and maintains asymmetric advantage through changes in operational concepts organizational structure andor technologies that significantly improve warfighting capabilities or ability to meet the demands of changing security environment6 by this definition air force leaders say that the air force has been engaged in military transformation for decades and that current activities are continuation of this process7 4 us department of defense quadrennial defense

2001 p 5 crs3 air force officials contend that in the 1991 war with iraq the air force demonstrated two of the three required elements of military transformation the use of new technologies stealth and precision guided munitions to enable novel operational concepts effectsbased planning and parallel warfare and leapahead capabilities the total destruction of iraqs air power capabilities following this war the air force launched organizational changes joining the strategic and tactical air commands and introducing the expeditionary aerospace force eaf that represented the final piece of this first phase of air force transformation whether the air force view on its state of transformation is accurate or not it appears that the air force has taken steps aimed at transformation and has established processes designed to guide these efforts the air force has established six functional battle labs to develop new ideas and concepts the air force also annually conducts wargames and experiments such as the expeditionary force experiments an innovation steering group was established to guide transformation activities and ensure warfighter inputs and feedback into the process the air force has also made changes to weapon acquisition and budget development and allocation processes for example the air force resource allocation process initiated in october 2000 is designed to give the major commands eg air combat command space command and air mobility command greater voice in the budgeting process this increase in the major commands voice in budgeting has been reflected at higher levels within dod8 according to the 2004 aftfp the air forces goal is to shift from threat and platformcentric planning and programming to adaptive and capabilitiesand effectsbased planning and programming9 while air force officials express satisfaction with achievements to date they say that air force transformation is not complete the air force is continuing the process by pursuing advanced technology new operational concepts and organizational innovation the air force is pursuing technologies that it believes could engender new operational concepts to dominate air space and cyberspace these include high performance stealthy aircraft the f22 and joint strike fighter jsf unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucavs directed energy weapons such as the airborne laser miniaturized munitions and advanced command control communications computers and intelligence c4i the air forces spacerelated programs are in varying states of maturity and include spacebased radars spacebased lasers micro satellites next generation missile defense and space operations vehicles air force efforts in the area of cyberspace include computer network attack computer network defense and information assurance activities both space and cyberspace capabilities are expected to become increasingly important as the air force and the other services leverage us information technology assets in numerous warfighting applications the impact of new technologies is limited if they do not create new warfighting approaches the air force says it is developing new operational concepts designed to exploit emerging technologies and enable new capabilities these operational concepts 8 amy butler combat commanders to direct unprecedented spending at pentagon defense daily feb 11 2004 9 us air force the us air force transformation flight plan 2004 hq usafxpxc p 3 crs4 are in varying stages of maturity and they often overlap between 2003 and 2004 the air force has made changes to the conops it says are transformational and now say that developing these conops global mobility persistent attack global strike homeland security nuclear response and space c4isr are an expression of capabilities based planning and programming the final facet of the air forces ongoing transformation effort is organizational innovation organizational changes can be the most difficult and most important piece of the transformation puzzle organizational change is difficult because it involves human factors nonquantifiable social and psychological issues such as tradition culture and mind set however organizational change is central to transformation because it codifies and institutionalizes new capabilities and ways of doing business refining the eaf is the air forces main effort in the area of organizational change the purpose of the eaf is to provide structure and schedule to effectively meet contingency demands the eaf organizes much of the air force into 10 aerospace expeditionary forces aefs that include combat mobility and combat support forces that rotate on 15month training and deployment cycle each aef includes approximately 175 aircraft and 20000 active and reserve personnel aefs and two rapid reaction aerospace expeditionary wings form the heart of the eaf but strategic mobility forces and socalled low densityhigh demand ldhd forces such as u2s and jstars are also key elements the air force hopes to deploy an aef in 48 hours and up to five aefs within 15 days each aef is tailored to the regional commanders needs the air force completed its first full aef rotation and began its second in december 2000 the air force learned some lessons from this first cycle and refined the concept it created additional ldhd crews and linked them to the aefs although this does not reduce the burden high deployment rates place on aircraft it does help reduce the stress on people the air force conducted another review following september 11th this review spurred more changes to the aef such as more evenly distributing reserve and guard personnel throughout the 10 aefs to meet military requirements in afghanistan iraq and korea the air force deployed several units outside the normal 90 day aef rotation between january and july 2003 starting in july 2004 120day aef rotations began while the air force reported in early 2004 that the aef had returned to its 90day schedule thousands of troops remained on extended deployments10 in 2006 the air force reported that the number of airmen deployed beyond 120 days was increasing11 issues for congress the 110th congress may as part of its defense oversight function assess the merits of the air forces transformation program is it aggressive enough is it feasible will it achieve the desired effect are transformation goals balanced with modernization needs the debate over the f22 and jsf offers an example of how transformation questions intersect and may increasingly vie for congressional attention evident in this 10 gordon trowbridge aef schedule back on track air force times feb 23 2004 11 john tirpak expeditionary and seriously extended air force magazine apr 2006 crs5 debate are contrasting views on technologies to pursue how aggressively to pursue them and the difference between transformation and modernization critics of usaf plans to acquire f22s and jsfs argue that these aircraft are modernization programs and that the air forces requirement for new fighters would be adequately satisfied in the near term by upgrading and procuring f15s and f16s they argue that the effectiveness of todays fighter and attack aircraft can be maintained through upgrades to their radars command and control systems and weapons future adversaries they argue will increasingly employ mobile cruise ballistic and surfaceto air missiles that will jeopardize the forward operating bases that shorter range military aircraft such as the f22 and jsf will require to generate significant sortie rates by cancelling or truncating the f22 and jsf critics argue the air force can free substantial funds that can be used to more aggressively pursue programs such as spacebased assets directed energy weapons ucavs or long range bombers such programs are more likely to overcome tomorrows antiaccess threats and offer more transformation potential supporters of the air forces transformation plan counter that while the f22 and jsf do modernize todays fighter and attack aircraft force they will also transform air operations their combination of stealth and high aeronautical performance eg maneuverability speed and endurance will enable radical capabilities and operational concepts further they argue along with longrange bombers stealthy highperformance aircraft offer the best potential for overcoming tomorrows antiaccess threats air force supporters also contend that f15s and f16s are nearing the end of their useful lifetimes spending todays money perpetuating 1970sera technology they argue is not wise finally supporters note that the air force is already pursuing spacebased assets cyberspace operations directed energy weapons and ucavs the air forces current budget makes it difficult to spend more on these programs given other pressing priorities an issue implicit in the debate described above is the pace and aggressiveness with which the air force should pursue potentially highpayoff technologies such as space based assets and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and ucavs many analysts argue that exporting air force operations from the atmosphere to outer space could increase their effectiveness and survivability and should therefore be pursued aggressively perhaps at the expense of other programs others strongly support increased use of uavs to engender new warfighting capabilities and to reduce the risk of us casualties in addition to setting aggressive goals for fielding uavs advocates also find fault with the decision not to accelerate procurement of the global hawk uav the air forces next generation airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr platform this perspective argues that the air force is prone to sacrificing transformation opportunities for modernization needs and that balance between the two must be found balance may also need to be struck between supporting current operations and investing in transformation many fear that the costs of the ongoing war in iraq will consume transformation funding some dod officials argue however that the war in iraq is not shortchanging transformation in fact they say the war in iraq is actually accelerating transformation efforts12 air force officials argue that they are pursuing transformation programs as aggressively as is prudent within projected budgets current readiness shortfalls make air 12 jefferson morris iraq operations accelerating transformation cebrowski says aerospace daily defense report aug 4 2004 crs6 force modernization tangible and high priority that should not be sacrificed for transformation programs that may or may not pay off years hence also senior air force leaders have said that transformation very much depends on another round of base closures13 if the air force is asked to more aggressively lead dods efforts in these transformation areas they argue this effort should be funded in addition to modernization perhaps reexamination of the traditional division of dods budget among the services is appropriate they argue air force organizational activities are also an issue the air force believes that refining and implementing the eaf will have transformational effect air force officials say that the eaf compels the air force to organize and think about itself in terms of composite teams not along functional stove pipes it also ensures that the units deployed to conduct mission are at the peak of their training and readiness furthermore air force officials believe that the eaf creates an expeditionary mind set and provides an effective mechanism for reducing personnel tempo which in turn could ameliorate recruitment and retention problems finally the air force believes that the eaf provides basis for additional organizational innovation as an example air force officials cite the gstf which will be composed of the first two or three aefs deployed to theater critics suggest that while useful force management tool the eaf concept is not transformational the eaf they argue is more modest organizational change like changes instituted by the navy many years ago that simply facilitates rotational forward deployments of forces to transform the air forces warfighting capabilities the eaf or other organizations must inherently leverage new technologies and enable new operational concepts these characteristics are not evident in the eaf they argue furthermore the recent fluctuations in the 90day aef deployment cycle shows detractors argue that this concept is still work in progress great debate also revolves around some of the air forces transformation operational concepts such as rapid halt operations14 while many in the air force believe that air power alone can defeat or at least stalemate enemy ground forces many other analysts maintain that only ground forces can capture and control enemy territory and forces do the 2004 aftfp conops suggest similar go it alone mindset many studies say that another issue for congress may be its own role in transformation15 some argue that transformation faces powerful status quo opposition and will be infeasible without congressional support they advocate new working arrangements between the services and congress these studies assert that to achieve transformation congress should consider modifications to current budgetary oversight mechanisms such as biannual budget authority giving dod managers more flexibility to shift funds between accounts and removing statutory barriers to greater private role in areas such as defense depot maintenance 13 air force transformation depends on base closing round jumper says aerospace daily defense report june 28 2004 14 rapid halt operations did not appear as conop in the 2004
