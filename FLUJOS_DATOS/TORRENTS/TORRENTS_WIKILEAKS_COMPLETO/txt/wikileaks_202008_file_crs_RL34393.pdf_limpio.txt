innovations have increased credit availability for us households over the last two decades for households with collateral assets financial innovations specifically those in the mortgage market have allowed households to leverage their balance sheets and finance large expenditures they might otherwise have had to forgo such developments can be advantageous because they make some households less sensitive to temporary disruptions in income or cash flow financial innovations however also make consumers more vulnerable to unexpected changes in asset prices sudden increase in the value of underlying collateral assets used to secure consumer borrowing such as house prices may entice some households to increase their borrowing sudden decrease may translate into financial distress 1 financial innovations similarly facilitated greater borrower access to revolving credit or credit card loans although all types of lending may reduce sensitivity to cash flow disruptions unsecured lending can be used by borrowers who hold few if any collateral assets to draw upon to avoid financial crisis furthermore credit card borrowers may be less affected than those with collateralized or secured loans when asset values fall credit card borrowers however generally pay higher rates relative to secured credit borrowers the relatively higher borrowing costs fees and repricing practices therefore may undermine or offset the financial benefit of being detached from decline in collateral asset values which adds to borrower financial distress rising consumer indebtedness and increased reliance on credit cards over the last two decades have generated concerns in congress and among the general public that cardholders may be paying excessive credit card rates and fees specifically some borrowers have reportedly been unaware of assessed penalty fees and interest rate increases 2 because of this and other issues legislation such as hr 1461 the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2007 introduced by representative mark udall with 39 cosponsors hr 5244 the credit cardholders bill of rights act of 2008 introduced by representative carolyn b

bankcard profitability study and annual report is useful for getting some understanding of industry profitability trends3 according to this study credit card issuers aftertax return on assets was 1808 billion in 2007 which was down from 1837 billion in 2006 total revenue for visa and mastercard issuers increased from 11499 billion to 11776 billion over this period penaltyfee revenue increased to 754 billion in 2007 compared with 644 billion in 2006 expenses however increased by 4 in part due to 17 increase in chargeoffs or account receivables deemed uncollectible due to missed payments the survey of consumer finances scf is useful for tracking consumer usage trends the scf which is conducted triannually by the federal reserve board asks approximately 4000 households to provide information about their income assets and debts the discussion below follows observations reported by economists from the federal reserve from 1989 to 2001 and 2001 to 2004 paying special attention to credit card usage 4 scf findings indicate that the number of households having at least one credit card rose from 70 in 1989 to 76 of households by 2001 this increase was attributed to several factors first households with riskier financial characteristics were granted increased access to revolving credit 5 greater proportion of lowincome households and households with lower liquid asset levels became new cardholders although riskbased pricing the practice of charging riskier borrowers higher rates to reflect the credit or default risk may have increased borrowing costs for some borrowers there is evidence to suggest that it allowed for increased participation in consumer credit markets and fewer credit denials6 second households over the 19892001 period increased their use of credit cards as convenient way to make payments7 third the scf also indicates greater use of variable rate credit cards which fluctuate with market rates given more frequent usage of credit cards for making convenience transactions it is arguable that 3 see credit card issuers collective aftertax return on assets drops 158 cardspayments annual bankcard profitability study reveals at

preferred cards that would allow them to benefit from market rate declines on the other hand it is at least equally likely that lenders may have offered more variable rate cards to borrowers to benefit from market rate increases hence these developments suggest increases in both the supply and demand for revolving credit resulting in growth of the revolving credit market the most recent 2004 survey suggests the following changes from 20018 approximately 749 of the us families surveyed in 2004 had credit cards and 58 of those families carried balance in 2001 762 of families had credit cards and 55 of those families carried balance these findings over threeyear period do not indicate substantial change in credit card holding or borrowing rates scf data however do i ndicate that borrowing levels increased simultaneously as households had greater access to revolving credit at lower rates in 2004 the median credit limit was 13500 which represents 262 increase from 2001 the median interest rate on the household credit card with the largest balance was 115 down by 35 from 2001 the median outstanding debt level for households carrying balance was 2200 rise in real inflationadjusted terms of 10 from 2001 9 despite higher credit limits and lower interest rates by 2004 the median outstanding debt level relative to the median credit card limit declined the use of credit cards at levels below card limits suggests that borrowers have access to amount s of revolving credit to sufficiently cover their borrowing needs the proportion of the median householdbalance relative to the median level of credit available was 163 in 2004 which is 24 lower than 2001 given that overall consumer indebtedness rose during this period one possible interpretation of this result is that households relied more on other types of loans such as mortgage or home equity loans where the interest costs often are lower and tax deductible in fact the share of mortgage debt relative to other us household liabilities rose by 86 while the share of other types of consumer lending declined by 171 between 1990 and 2006 10 despite smaller increase in revolving debt relative to mortgage debt credit card delinquency rates have risen federal reserve statistical release shows that as of november 2007 the percentage of delinquent credit card loans has been greater than the delinquency percentages of any other type of bank loans since the fourth quarter of 1995 11 the delinquency rate averaged about 44 over this period compared to 20 for residential mortgage including multifamily and home equity loans and 18 for commercial real estate loans although credit card delinquency rates began to decline after the first quarter in 2002 they have been rising since the first quarter of 2006 credit card delinquency rates for commercial banks however are not representative of the delinquency experience for the entire revolving credit industry since only approximately 40 of 8 see brian

difficult to identify single numerical measure to evaluate the health of this sector given the dramatic increase in credit card receivables that are now funded or financed via securitization in modern financial markets12 despite measurement issues higher delinquency rates ultimately translate into higher borrowing costs in this sector the next section provides the institutional background to illustrate why this relationship may exist

issued by department stores in the 1950s as more efficient way to increase customer convenience and manage their accounts 13 stores selling big ticket items such as major appliances eventually allowed customers to decide whether to pay in full or in installments subject to finance charge once commercial banks recognized the profit potential from providing openended unsecured financing to consumers the generalpurpose credit card became more popular towards the late 1960s 14 of course since this occurred prior to the rise of securitization which will be discussed in more detail below local banks set the rates on the credit cards they issued during the late 1970s and early 1980s the rise in inflation made unsecured lending unprofitable especially since state regulations limited the interest rates banks could charge credit card lenders responded by charging annual fees and restricting the number of credit cards issued to supplement the income loss banks also began moving their cr edit card operations to states with high or interest rate ceilings 15 inflation diminished towards the end of the 1980s this development along with less restrictive interest rate caps reduced the need to charge annual fees in addition to falling inflation rates the growth of banking on national scale resulted in increased competition which contributed to drop in revolving credit interest rates below the 18 to 19 levels maintained through most of the 1980s and early 1990s 16 whenever the federal reserve decided to lower the federal funds rate cardissuing banks also had the option to pass their lower borrowing costs onto cardholders which woul d translate into lower credit card rates the funding of revolving credit through securitization which first began in 1987 also helped reduce the cost of credit17 securitization occurs when financial institutions that originate credit card loans choose not to retain the loans on their balance sheets18 loans originated in the primary market where the credit card purchaser and the loan originator conduct business are often sold in 12 see mark furletti measuring credit card industry chargeoffs review of sources and methods payment cards center

specifically the timing of the receivables may not match perfectly the terms of the liabilities deposits that must be repaid depository institutions therefore are required to hold certain amounts of capital reserves against such timing mismatches and in the event the assets do not perform as expected an opportunity cost however is incurred when capital held for regulatory safety reasons is not used for other more profitable lending activities or investments moreover nonbank or nondepository institutions may enjoy competitive funding cost advantage since they are not subject to the same regulatory capital requirements as depository institutions even if greater capital requirements were not an issue as in the case of nonbank institutions originators would still incur servicing and monitoring costs if loans are funded from balance sheet activities hence securitization allows for the offbalancesheet funding of loans which may lead to reduction of funding costs and an elimination to the depository institution of risks associated with onbalancesheet funding these cost savings may or may not be passed on to cardholders in the form of lower credit card rates credit card interest rates however have become more responsive to issuers costs of funds in recent years 21 the modern securitization process begins with credit card issuer or loan originator who after approving and making loans with unsecured lines of credit for specified amount to numerous applicants decides to securitize these assets 22 next the assets which in this case are the loan receivables or repayment streams from the credit card loans are sold to trust that will be referred to as special purpose entity spe23 spes are created as trusts typically by financial institutions with large amount of credit card originations for two reasons first originators may sell assets to trusts without paying taxes on the sale of those assets second the investors rights to cash flows generated from the underlying assets are protected if the originator were to become 19 for more detailed explanation of the securitization pro cess see mark furletti overview of credit card asset backed securities payment cards

remote given the associated tax and legal advantages spes may not carry out any other activities unrelated to the specific purpose for which they were created the spes specific purpose is typically to transform individual receivables into new financial securities with specific risk and return characteristics the next step of the securitization process24 securities backed by credit card loans can be created for any desired maturity since new receivables are continually added to the pool as older receivables are paid off by borrowers when transforming the individual credit card loans into new issues of assetbacked securities abss spes may subdivide them into various tranches or groups of securities with specific risk and return characteristics the ultimate lenders or purchasers of such assets are typically large investors such as hedge funds pension funds or other financial institutions who purchase securities from the different tranches common tranche arrangement for example is senior junior tranching structure the senior tranche may be designated as the one that pays its investors first but the yield may be lower than the junior tranche which is designated to pay its investors last when the securitizer decides to sell the tranches in the secondary market the senior tranche will appeal to investors that prefer lower risk quick paying investments while the junior tranche will appeal to investors that prefer to take higher risks for the possibility of earning higher yield the seniorjunior tranching structure is only one of the numerous disbursement structures securitizers use to entice investors this particular tranching structure however is used throughout this report for the sake of illustration 25 the tranching structure is used to satisfy the specific risk return and investment grade needs of investors in the secondary market when the spe can effectively identify and create abs tranches satisfying specific needs it can appeal to more investors and attract more credit to fund credit card loan originations in the primary market for example suppose the spe is currently using the seniorjunior tranching structure described above the junior tranche would consist of the cash flow remaining after both the principal and yield to senior tranche holders and any losses associated with default were paid the holder of the junior tranche therefore keeps whatever cash remains this repayment structure reduces the credit risk for senior tranche holders since junior tranche holders incur most of the credit risk the senior tranche receives payment first followed by the junior tranche conversely the junior tranche initially suffers the losses first followed by the senior tranche of course the junior tranche holder receives higher yield or rate of return in exchange for assuming higher risk the investors in the senior tranche would be adversely affected only if default costs exceed the value of payments that would have accrued to the junior tranche investors 26 hence tranching structure may also serve as credit 24 in many cases two spes may be involved in the securitization process the first spe receiving the assets from the originator subsequently transfers these receivables to second spe that does the actual repackaging and creates the new creditcard backed securities which are then sold to investors each spe would be created in response to an accounting andor legal issue that would make it difficult fo r cash inflows and outflows to occur without financial andor legal consequences impacting the ability to issue sell and reinvest the securities 25 note that only the loan receivables are collected and s ecuritized hence the sum of all cash payments received is disbursed according to spe tranching guidelines but individual loans do not have to be assigned to any particular tranches 26 the liquidity crisis of august 2007 was triggered by senior tranche holders reassessing the riskiness of their exposure to financial problems that exceeded expectations see crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter et rather than rely solely upon tranching structure investors may also choose to purchase bond insurance which may serve as additional credit enhancement

which may attract more investors in particular those restricted to purchasing high quality investment grade securities rather than sell all of the abs tranches to third party investors the loan originator may also want to act as an investor in its own assetbacked curities whenever the originator chooses to keep one or more tranches in its own portfolio the retained tranche is referred to as excess spread suppose an originator retains junior tranche which now is subsequently referred to as the excess spread then the originator is also providing credit enhancement to senior tranches issued by the spe again the junior tranche consists of the cash flow remaining after the principal and yield to senior tranche holders and any losses associated with default are paid holder of the excess spread tranche therefore has strong financial incentive to effectively minimize defaults which translates into lower funding costs or more investors as explained below

from credit card receivables is dependent upon whether borrowers make minimum payments or pay off their balances every month consumers have the option during each billing cycle to pay the minimum balance pay off the entire loan or pay something in between when credit cards are used for convenien ce transactions rather than for borrowing this does not generate any investor yield in addition early amortization which occurs when the outstanding balance of credit card account is suddenly paid off also reduces yield early amortization also occurs when credit card is paid off and the balance is transferred to another card issued by competing card issuer reduction in yield ultimately makes investing in credit card receivables less appealing to investors development which itself increases the funding costs to provide these loans in the future g6g142g143g138g158g149g157g561g20g146g156g148g561 revolving credit loan is higher in credit or default risk relative to other forms of bank lending for credit card receivables that have not been securitized these types of loans involve much higher operating costs and greater risks of default per dollar of receivables than do other types of lending27 for securitized credit card receivables the default risk of these loans generates uncertainty surrounding the cash flowing into the excess spread in both cases defaults increase future

first the loan is unsecured which means the card holder has put forth collateral assets that can be used to repay the loan in the event of default second the card holder has the option to use the card when unemployed or lacking sufficient cash flow to cover routine expenses and payment obligations the borrower may suddenly become highly leveraged up to the credit card limit without any prior notice without knowing whether or not the cardholder intends to pay off the balance at the end of the billing cycle every transaction made with credit card is potentially new loan and the outstanding principal balance can change at any time next credit card is also far more susceptible to fraud than other types of loan should unauthorized charges be made on lost or stolen card the fair credit billing act limits the liability for cardholders to 50 28 hence unrecoverable fraudulent charges may translate into sizeable losses for originators or investors delinquencies may eventually turn into defaults which are defined as 180 days delinquent when borrowers initially fail to make timely credit card payments the servicer attempts to contact the borrower within several days of delinquency to arrange payment the servicer and not necessarily the loan originator is the designated collector of credit card payments and forwards them to the spe if the payment streams are being securitized after 30 days which is considered one complete billing cycle the servicer must decide whether to cut off credit to the borrower and send the account to collections financial institutions may adopt various different policies for dealing with delinquencies if however accounts are sent to collections the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa prohibits abusive deceptive and improper collection practices of third party debt collectors 29 the collections process is regulated by federal guidelines30 if the credit card issuer owns the loans contractual chargeoffs which are account receivables deemed uncollectible due to missed payments must be written off the issuers books after 6 billing cycles or 180 days of nonpayment according to guidances issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 31 when borrower files for bankruptcy accounts must be charged off 60 days after receipt of notification of the filing from the bankruptcy court one expert estimated that 60 of chargeoffs result from 180 days or six billing cycles of missed payments and 40 of chargeoffs are the result of bankruptcy32 if the loans are securitized delinquency and default costs generated from the accounts may be subtracted from the proceeds paid to the spe which may translate into losses to the excess spread tranche when revolving credit is securitized issuers may find it difficult to attract investors to fund revolving credit loans without implicit recourse implicit recourse refers to perception among investors that credit card originators will repurchase nonperforming loans from abspools and absorb default losses which may seem to negate the benefits of securitization 33 removal of 28 pl 93495 as codified at 15 usc 1666j see httpfdicgovregulationslawsrules6500500html 29 pl

card securitization agreements that allows issuers to remove linquent accounts or accounts with fraudulent charges from an abs pool may be exercised exercising this option too often however may still imply that the tranches should receive lower credit ratings which could make it more difficult to attract some abs investors

yield on credit card abss the impact on yield may be even more significant should all of these risks materialize simultaneously slightly more consumers however are carrying balance and the median balance has increased as discussed earlier in this report consequently the payoff risk associated with an increase in convenience users has seen some decline on the other hand defaults are rising should defaults continue to accelerate the increase in funding costs may encourage some lenders to reevaluate the profitability of providing revolving credit one option may be to curtail revolving lending activities and pursue more profitable business strategies another option may be to employ various repricing practices g20g142g153g155g146g140g146g151g144g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561 the previous historical discussion noted that fee income component of the total cost of borrower credit was used to help cover the increasing costs to supply credit during the late 1970s and early 1980s the securitization discussion shows how particular funding method that minimizes the liquidity and default risk for credit card originators may translate into lower rates for cardholders interest rate charges and fees therefore change when costs change for example when borrower is delinquent exceeds credit limits or bounces payment checks the borrower may now be viewed as greater cred it risk at that point lenders may consider the borrower as candidate for being repriced for the credit repricing is an extension of riskbased pricing in that higher risk borrowers shoulder more of the costs associated with having access to borrowing services penalties increased fees and increased loan rates are all tools available to credit suppliers to reprice the increased risk to yield if cardholders are sensitive to increasing charges then repricing may be used to encourage delinquent cardholders to repay their obligations faster and discourage them from further borrowing repricing however can be initiated without any delinquency incident when this happens borrower may shop for other card issuers that are willing to provide them with credit cards at lower prices or accept balance transfers hence the lenders decision to charge higher interest and fees whether to compensate for rising default risk or simply to increase profit margins is likely to be affected by an assessment of the borrowers willingness to shop for and find other lowerpriced credit continued allow issuers to absorb losses for example by removing early amortization accounts to enhance the performance of securitized tranches for more details on this point see charles w calomiris and joseph r mason credit card securitization and regulatory arbitrage working paper 037 federal reserve bank of

universal default and in some cases doublecycle billing practices may have the same effect34 hairtrigger repricing refers to imposing fees and higher finance ch arges on cardholders almost immediately after payment is late without any grace period universal default occurs when borrower defaults on loan serviced by lender and other revolving creditors respond by increasing the lending rates on the loans they are servicing for that particular borrower even if the borrower has not defaulted on those loans doublecycle billing is the practice of calculating interest over twomonth billing cycle period as opposed to onemonth billing cycle that may result in higher finance charges although doublecycle billing may not often be descri bed as repricing practice in particular if this billing method is universally applied to all customers the economic impact on cardholders can be similar to standard repricing strategies if the consumer misses payment or switches from being convenience user to revolver the typical grace period or specified time period payments can be made without incurring any finance charge is retroactively eliminated under doublecycle billing forfeiture of interestfree grace periods results in higher finance charges therefore riskbased repricing has automatically been captured by the billing method

credit terms that were not part of the original agreement when the card was issued it is also possible that borrowers unknowingly agreed to such terms that were very difficult to understand 35 loan originators however are concerned primarily with the cash flow necessary to maintain lower funding costs in particular at time while defaults are rising moreover maintaining cash flows sufficient to cover losses accr uing to the lower tranche is also important if the subordinate tranche is being used as credit enhancement for more senior tranches one response might be to eliminate repricing practices possible consequence of this response however could result in reduction in cash flow and possible increase in bank chargeoffs or excess spread tranches with insufficient returns to make this type of lending attractive to future investors economic theory specifically the law of supply suggests that firms are less willing to supply products to the marketplace at lower prices hence credit card issuers could respond in variety of ways to pricing restrictions to recapture the fee income issuers may increase loan rates across the board on all borrowers making it more expensive for both good and delinquent 34 for definitions of terms see the following references credit cards increased complexity in rates and fees heightens need for more effective disclosures to consumers gao06929

increasing minimum monthly payments reducing credit limits or reducing the number of credit cards issued to people with impaired credit36 on the other hand credit card issuers may choose not to respond by increasing the costs or limiting the availability of credit to borrowers some financial institutions have recently stated that they will longer use pricing practices such as doublecycle billing and universal default37 when these announcements were made there was indication that subsequent increases in minimum payments or reductions in credit card issu would occur hence it may be possible for other institutions to manage their cash flows and delinquencies without relying upon these more controversial pricing practices38 response by regulators might be to enhance disclosures to borrowers so they are not taken by surprise when repricing occurs the federal reserve has been engaged in studies that could lead to revision of regulation z concerning the disclosure of consumer credit39 these consist of using consumer focus groups and individuals to determine what types of disclosures are effective with helping them understand the possible charges they could face upon completion of the interviews the federal reserve expects to propose format that may be considered more transparent for consumers to evaluate the credit terms and facilitate their usage of credit cards on may 2 2008 the board of governors of the federal reserve announced proposed rules regarding credit card pricing practices40 the proposals would amend regulation aa unfair acts or practices regulation z truth in lending and regulation dd truth in savings the purpose of the proposals are to prohibit unfair or deceptive bank practices in connection with credit card accounts and overdraft services for deposit accounts for example one proposed amendment to regulation aa would prohibit banks from treating payment as late until the consumer has been given reasonable amount of to make that payment and safe harbor would be given to banks that send periodic statements at least 21 days prior to the payment due date given that the doublecycle billing method eliminates an interestfree grace
