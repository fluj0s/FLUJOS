legislative body in the traditional sense the ep cannot initiate legislation that ri ght rests solely with the commission which functions as the eus executive and guarantor of the eu treaties the council the eus main decisionmaking body composed of minis ters from the national governments enacts legislation based on commission proposals af ter it consults with the parliament legislative process the role of the european parliament in the legislative process has expanded steadily over time as the scope of eu policy has grown as more decisions within the council of ministers have become subject to qualified majority voting rather than unanimity to allow for greater speed and efficiency of decisionmaking the parliament has come to be viewed as an increasingly important

process the lisbon treaty by kristin archickthe codecision procedure the eus codecision procedure can be summarized as follows 1 if parliament and the council of ministers agree on commission proposal it is approved 2 if they disagree the council forms common position the ep can then either accept the councils common position or reject or amend it by an absolute majority of its members 3 if the council cannot accept the eps amendments conciliation meeting is convened after which the ep and the council approve an agreement if one can be reached if they are unable to agree the proposal is not adoptedcounterweight at the european level to the commission and council the amsterdam treaty of 1997 which entered into for ce in may 1999 extended the codecision procedure to many additiona l policy areas ranging from the environment to social policy in the codecision procedure th ep and the council share legislative power and must both approve commission proposal for it to become eu law reportedly the ep currently has say in about 80 of the legislation passed in the eu1 tax matters and foreign policy however are among the areas to which the codecision procedure does not apply the par liament may give nonbinding opinion in december 2007 eu leaders signed new reform treaty the lisbon treaty that would roughly double the parliaments right of co decision to 80 policy areas including agriculture and home affairs issues such as asylum and immigration the future of the lisbon treaty however has been thrown into doubt following its rejection by irish voters in june 2008 eu leaders continue to hope that the new lisbon treaty will be ratified and enter into force before the next ep elections in the spring of 20092 budget the ep and the council exercise joint powers in determining the eus annual budget of roughly 165 billion the budgetary procedure begins with the commission proposing preliminary draft budget to the council the council prepares another draft which the ep ma approve or modify in its first reading on compulsory expenditures mainly agriculture the counc il currently has the final say but the ep has the last word on noncompulsory expe nditures such as structural funds and development aid the council may amend the ep s draft and send it back to the ep for second reading the ep can reamend thes council changes and must then adopt or reject the budget the new lisbon treaty if ratified would eliminate the distinction between compulsory and non compulsory expenditures and would thus give the ep more control over agricultural spending the eps budgetary power is considerably greater than that exercised by most parliaments in eu member states other responsibilities the parliament also plays supervisory role over the european commission and the council of mini sters the ep votes on the commissions program and monitors the mana gement of eu policies in particular through oral and written questions to the commission and the counc il the ep has the right to dismiss the entire commission through vote of censure although the ep has never exercised this power in march 1999 the commission opted to re sign rather than face formal censure by the ep over alleged corruption chargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21998crs3 3 george parker euphoric mood in strasbourg financial times october 28 2004 4 prior to direct elections meps were appointed by

parliamentary and committee debates is provided in the eus 23 official languages all parlia mentary documents are translated into and published in these languages challenges the european parliament faces several challenges chief among these is the issue of the eps legitimacy despite being direc tly elected body skeptics contend that the parliament is largely ineffective actor impeded by an overly complex legislative process high mep turnover rate and absenteeism and limited public intere st and understanding to them it symbolizes the democratic deficit and lack of transparency within the eu on the other hand ep champions suggest that codecision has enhan ced the parliaments influence and as the only di rectly elected eu institution the ep increasingly plays an important checksandbalances role as seen for example by its recent insistence on changes in the composition of the incoming commission moreover supporters claim that the eps influence is growing even in strictly consultative areas such as the eus common foreign policy where the codecision procedure does not apply they assert that the ep has become forum for debate on international issues and uses its power of assent on cooperation accords with third parties as well as parliamentary resolutions to promote human rights yet critics argue that ep views on international relations such as ep opposition to lifting the eu arms embargo on china may have little effect because foreign policy decisions rest with the member states closely related to the question of the eps legitimacy is the issue of whether meps reflect national or european interests the parliament claims to represent the people of europe while the council speaks for the govern ments but some observers contend that meps often promote parochial national interests past examples include italian and spanish meps defending olive growers and british and irish meps joining forces to oppose tax harmonization measures and many meps campaign for the parliament on national rather than european issues ot hers argue that voting behavior in the ep indicates that ideology holds greater influence than nationality with meps voting with their party groups almost 90 of the time8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21998crs6 9 for more information see the european parliaments website on the transatlantic legislators dialogue http wwweuroparleuropa euintcooptlddefault_enhtmanother major concern is costs which the ep has been under public pressure to reduce the fact that meps and their staffs shuttle among three cities leads to travel and hotel bills that in the past have consumed roughly 1520 of the eps budget yet the suggestion that the ep should consolidate its operations in one city has met with opposition in the host countries of france be lgium and luxembourg which fear losing economic benefits and jobs strasbourg was c hosen originally as the seat of the ep to serve as symbol of peace between france and germany and both countries argue it should continue to do so construction of multimillion dollar buildings in brussels and strasbourg in the late 1990s to accommodate the growth in meps following eu enlargement also stirred controversy after many years and seve ral failed attempts meps succeeded in june 2005 in reforming the parliaments salary and expense regime some meps had long complained about pay disparities because they receive the same salary as member s of their respective national parliaments for example italian meps currently earn roughly three times more than their spanish counterparts previous fforts to reform the pay system had foundered on the concerns of some member states about the costs of the reforms under the new deal all meps will be paid th same amount in exchange for instituting reimbursable system for meps business and travel expenses currently meps receive flatrate travel allowance that does not require receipts and contributes to the parliaments gravy train image the new expense regime will not be implemented however until 2009 the european parliament and the us congress ties between the ep and the us congress date back to 1972 when us congressional delegation first visited the ep in brussels and luxembourg since then congressionalep exchanges have taken place at least once year and have provided the opportunity for sustained dialogue the us congressep exchange is the oldest and most prestigious of the eus interparliament ary delegations which seek to develop and maintain close ties with countries outside the eu in 1999 the ep and the us congress launched the transatla ntic legislators dialogue tld as their fficial response to the useu commitment in the 1995 new transatlantic agenda to enhance parliamentary ties between the eu and the united states with the tld the two sides have committed to regular meetings twice year to discuss wide range of topical political and economic issues the ep tld delegation is led by chairman who is elected by the delega tions members and has responsibilities equal to those of committee chair the most recent tld meeting took place in may 2008 in ljubljana slovenia which held the eus ro tating presidency in the first half of 2008 congress and the ep have so conducted video conferences on specific areas of mutual concern past video conferences have focu sed on the exchange of passenger data financial services and us re strictions of steel imports some meps have called for making the tld more operational however by creating formal early warning system to allow each side to weigh in on legislation inprogress that could adversely affect their interests9
