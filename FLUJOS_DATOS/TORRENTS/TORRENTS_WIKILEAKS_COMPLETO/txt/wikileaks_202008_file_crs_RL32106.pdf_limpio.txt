that the projected emissions are consistent with the emissions ceiling established by the sip while some express concern at the potential impact of these conformity determinations in delaying or altering new highway projects others note that the process simply obligates the fe deral government to support rather than undermine the legally adopted stat plans for achieving air quality conformity lapses have occurred in 63 areas in 29 states and puerto rico since 1997 most of these areas have returned to conformity quickly without major effects on their transportation programs according to the general accounting office only 5 areas had to change transportation plans in order to resolve conformity lapse nevertheless the impact of conformity requirements is expected to grow in the next few years for several reasons first the growth of emissions from suvs and other light trucks and greater than expected increases in vehicle miles traveled have made it more difficult to demonstrate confor mity second recent court decisions have tightened the conformity rules making it more difficult to grandfather new projects and third the implementation of more stringent air quality standards for ozone and particulates in 2004 means that additional areas will be subject to conformity many for the first time thus numerous tropolitan areas may face temporary suspension of highway and transit funds unless they impose sharp reductions in vehicle industrial or other emissions this report which will be updated as events warrant provides an explanation of the conformity requirement s discusses the experiences of metropolitan areas that have experienced conformity lapse during the last 10 years and reviews some of the recent proposals for reform among the issues raised have been the frequency with which conformity should be demonstrated whether tr ansportation planning and sip timeframes are misma tched and to what extent projects should be grandfathered if they were once part of conforming transpor tation program the house and senate surface tr ansportation bills hr 3550 and s 1072 the administrations highway and transit funding bill are among the bills discussed as is the

conformity under the clean air act in need of reform introduction this report discusses the transportation conformity provisions under section 176 of the clean air act and various propos als to modify the provisions now under consideration conformity wa s established by congress as means of insuring that federal actions including the provision of federal funds for local projects not under mine air quality in areas that have not attained air quality standards by potentially denying federal funds to such areas conformity serves as an important stimulus for local governments to assess potential air qua lity impacts of projects and if necessary modify them to assure that they not interfere with progress toward or maintenance of clean air the report begins with an explanation of the acts

projects can go forward4 the list includes 20 categories of highway safety projects rehabilitation and reconstruction of transit facilities purchase of replacement buses and rail cars noise attenuation projects and pedestrian and bicycle facilities it does not include most new transit or highway projects however according to epas office of transportation and air quality otaq epa defined the exempt projects as those that are air quality neutral that is they neither improve nor degrade air quality5 in addition according to otaq projects that were already approved and funded in the previous transportation improveme nt program may continue to be funded during conformity lapse if they are in the early planning and preliminary design phases or in the later phase s provided that approval is not sought for new phase of the project these later phases incl ude determination of environmental impacts under the national environmenta l policy act rightofway acquisition final design

state implementation plan are also allowed to proceed during conformity lapse these projects can include programs for improved public transit construction of hov high occupancy vehicle lanes traffic flow improvement programs fringe parking and pedestrian facilities6 states are often reluctant to include tcms in their sips however according to 1999 study of conformity many areas avoid doing so because once such projects are listed any delay in their implementation could cause conformity lapse7 in addition by listing such programs as tcms the commitment to construct or implement them becomes legally enforceable waivers section 176 and the regulations promulgated to implement it do not specifically provide for administrative remedies waivers or grace periods once an area is subject to conformity and it is the agencys view that it lacks authority to provide waiver of the conformity requirements8 experience of areas in conformity lapsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32106crs4 9 alabama

or had its own special set of circumstances leading to the conformity lapse and the transportation agencies and epa have responded in numerous often unique ways many of the areas were allowed to dem onstrate conformity by adopting additional emission reduction measures by changing the models or modeling assumptions used in the conformity demonstrati on or by modifying the list of projects included in their tip in recent survey gao found that over the past 6 years only 5 metropolitan areas had to change transportation plans in order to resolve conformity lapse12 in general until march 1999 court decision13 state and federal transportation agencies followed less stringent interpretation of the acts requirements that allowed numerous projects to be funded and to continue through design and construction on the grounds that they had been approved and thus grandfathered prior to the lapse in march 1999 however the us court of appeals for the dc circuit struck down the grandfather cl ause since then epa and dot have implemented more stringent requirements in part through revised regulations but mostly through guidance documents and memoranda that are posted on the

conformity decision the atlanta metropolitan area was already in the second ear of conformity lapse the lapse began january 17 1998 and lasted until july 26 2000 initially us dot had allowed the continued funding of numerous highway project s in atlanta despite the lapse in conformity on the grounds that th ey were grandfathered in january 1999 the sierra club and two local environmenta l groups filed suit however challenging 61 of the grandfathered project s contending that they s hould not have been allowed to proceed except as part of conforming tip17 in light of the dc circuit opinion the parties reached settlement agreemen t in june 1999 under which many of the grandfathered projects we re halted but 17 were llowed to go forward the heart of the atlanta settlement was new interim transportation improvement program or itip when conformity lapsed in january 1998 the atlanta regional commission arc had veloped and received approval for an itip which included the various grandfathered projects in light of the litigation and dc circuit decision arc developed sec ond and ultimately third itip that the state and federal transportati on departments and epa as well as the environmental groups that had filed suit agreed could go forward during the lapse of conformity because they followed the dc circuit decision and were themselves the product of settlement negotiations in parate suit the sec ond and third atlanta itips are the best examples of what is now allowed during conformity lapse these itips according to the atlanta regional commission included only three kinds of projects projects that were exempt under 40 cfr 93126 discussed above on pages 23 transportation control measures and small group of projects that had received necessary approvals or funding

important result of atlantas conformity lapse was the development of the georgia regional transportation authority whose board includes the heads of six state agencies as well as nine members appointed by the governor the authority is widely cr edited with improving coordination among transportation planning nd environmental officials thus although conformity requirements disrupted tlantas transportation planning they now appear to be rving their intended function forcing transportation and environmental officials to confer regarding the environmental impacts of transportation programs before and during major planning design and construction decision points nd reorienting the areas tran sportation planning to more multimodal approach than the previous one which relied heavily on new highway capacity not all parties are happy with these results of course but it would be hard to argue that they violate the intent of the conformity requirements conformitys growing reach the impact of conformity requirements is expected to grow in the next few years for several reasons first the growth of emissions from sport utility vehicles and other light trucks and greater than expected increases in vehicle miles traveled have made it more difficult to demonstrate conformity sec ond recent court decisions noted above have tightened the conformity rules making it more difficult to grandfather new projects and third the implementation of more stringent air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter pm in 2004 will mean that additiona l areas will be subject to conformity many for the first time thus numerous metropolitan areas will face temporary suspension of highway and transit funds unless they impose sharp reductions in vehicle industrial or ot her emissions in gaos recent survey about onethird of local transportation planners responding ex pected to have difficulty demonstrating conformity in the future20 conformity issues number of issues could be of concern to areas facing potential conformity lapse as noted the clean air act provides authority for waivers or grace periods during lapse and only limited set of exempt projects mostly safetyrelated or replacement and repair of existing transit facilities can be funded in lapsed areas this makes conformity potent tool for forcing air quality considerations into the transportation planning process mpos in areas that are currently cla ssified nonattainment or maintenance are familiar with the conformity process and have worked with epa and the state and federal transportation departments as the re quirements of the pr ocess have evolved the potential impacts of conformity lapse appear to be of special concern however in areas that will be designated nonattain ment for the first time under the new ozone and particulate standards in 2004 epa administration proposals to address these concerns epa and dot have taken or proposed several steps that would ve the effect of delayinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32106crs8 21 the administration proposal s would not formally eliminate conformity requirements for any area but by delaying the designation of nonattainment areas the net effect for some areas could be elimination of the requirement provided that they reach attainment during the early action or transitional period 22 early action compacts are further discu ssed in crs report rs21611 in order to insure continued progress the effective date is defe rred in three stages rather than granting 4 year deferral upon acceptance of the compact the protocol is available at http wwwepagov ttnnaaqsozoneozonetech8hr o3protocol_061902pdf additional information on the implementation schedule for compact areas can be found at http wwwepagov

failed to meet milestone and were removed from the compact program 24 reading the current regulations on this point can be somewhat confusing epas conformity regulations at 40 cfr 93104c3 require that tips obtain new demonstration of conformity less frequently th an every three years but they also state that new or revised tip must demonstrate conformity since dot regulations at 23 cfr continuedor eliminating21 conformity requirements for numerous areas as part of broader relaxation of formal nonattainment standards 1 early action compacts first epa has allowed many areas that expected to be designated nonattainment under the new 8hour ozone standard to avoid being formally designated by committing instead to early action compacts compact areas agree to unde rtake number of voluntary actions intended to reduce emissions in return epa agrees to defer the effective date of their designation until april 15 2008 4 years af ter the april 15 2004 designation of other areas22 on april 15 2004 the agency identified 30 areas mo stly in the southeastern states that are included in this program23 the agency appears to have formal legal authority for this approach but thus far has not had to defend the program from legal challenge 2 transitional area exemptions second in its clear skies bill hr 999 s 485 the administration proposed to allow what it calls transitional areas areas that demonstrate that they will attain the 8 hour ozone and pm25 standards by december 31 2015 to avoid being designat ed nonattainment unless their pollutant concentrations exceed the standards at the end of that period in effect granting them 12year grace period if enacted this proposal would exempt numerous areas from the conformity requirements til at least 2016 for discussion of the transitional area proposal also see crs report rs21611 ozone and particulate air quality should the deadline for ttainment be extended 3 safetea proposals third the administration also proposed to change conformity requirements in its highway and transit reauthorization bill the safe accountable flexible and efficient tr ansportation equity act of 2003 safetea hr 2088 s 1072 as introduced sec tion

bill the tip rather than being standalone document would have consisted of the first 5 years of projects in an areas long range transportation plan lrtp the bill would have shortened the planning horizon over which conformity must be demonstrated in the long range plan to 10 years in most cases instead of the current 20 years the administrations early action compacts and its transitional area proposals have not been the subjects of mu ch controversy even though they might have substantial effects on the conformity requirements the safetea proposals on the other hand are controversial perh aps because they propose changing the transportation planning process as well as the conformity timeframes recent report by the general accoun ting office shows the complexity of reactions to the safetea conformity proposals gao recommended that dot in coordination with epa consider 1 re vising its regulations to extend the current 3year time frame be tween required updates of the l ongrange transportation plan and 2 submitting legislative proposal to revise the conformity provisions of the clean air act so that they similarly extend the time frame between required conformity determinations for the plan25 the report discussed extending the time for tip updates and the re lated conformity determinations but made recommendations on that subject gaos analysis relied on data it gathered through surveys of local mpo transportation planners and statelevel air quality planners as well as information provided by epa and dot the surveys f ound that nearly threequarters of the transportation planners favored extending the frequency between updates of the long range plan and most preferred at least once every 5 years rather than once every 3 years26 but only 45 of the planners fa vored extending the frequency between updates of the tip and only 30 favored combining the tip and the lrtp into single document air quality planners responding to gao were even less disposed to support changes in the tip timeframe only 6 of 43 respondents supported 5year update cycle for the tip with most who specified timeframe preferring 2 or 3 year period27 similar results were found in survey of mpos conducted by the association of metropolitan planning organizations ampo ampo sent surveys to all 341 mpos july 15 2003 and received responses from 115 eightyfive percent of the respondents agreed that the requirement th at the planning cycl requiring long run transportation plans to be upda ted every 3 years is too short but 63 thought the

environmental defense may 8 2003 p 5year tip cycle was just right only 27 favored longer period between updates of the tip also 77 of the ampo respondents opposed the administrations plan to eliminate the tip as standalone document commenters noted that its value as short range planning document could be lost if it were only updated every 5 years and combining it with the lrtp is most troublesome because any amendment to the tip would seem to open up the entire plan for scrutiny as well with the opportun ity for unn ecessarily broad challenges midstream thereby negating longer and presumably more stable planning cycle28 the ampo survey includes several narrative responses that provide d elaboration on the survey results only one of the narrative responses supported the safetea proposal more typical was this response the process seems to be working well now combining the tip and lrtp on fiveyear cycle is bad idea29 from an air quality perspective the proposed changes in the tip might have little impact since revisions to the p would still require new conformity demonstration most large metropolitan areas do revise their tip frequently many annually these areas would continue to undertake conformity demonstrations more frequently than required just as they do now what could be lost in longer tip cycle however would be the need for all areas to incorporate revisions to the da ta on population vehicle miles traveled and emissions on frequent basis if the proj ects listed in 5year tip were unchanged it could be as long as 5 years before the tip would need to be updated to reflect new emissions data as opposed to 2 years now providing additional resources one point on which both transportation planners and environm ental interest groups appear to agree is on the desirability of additional resources for the conformity process gaos re port citing transportation planners contains numerous comments about the need for additional staff and funds to demonstrate conformity particularly in areas that will be subject to its requirements for the first time30 environmental defense while disagreeing with many aspects of the gao report echoe d the comments on the need for more resources the key solution to the problem s noted in the gao report is to set aside more planning training and technical assi stance funding in the transportation bill to help local and state air quality and transportation agencies administer these planning requirements31 changing the sip timeframe gao and others have also focused attention on the sip portion of the conformity process there are two siprelated issues 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32106crs11 32 gao report previously cited p 5 33 ibid p 6 34 ibid highlights unnumbered page 35 ibid p 29whether sips should be subject to more fre quent updates and 2 how to address the mismatch between sip and lrtp timeframes regarding the first of these issues gao noted that while transportation planners are required to regularly update their plans and incorporate the most current data on population vehicle miles travel ed and emissions state air quality planners on the other hand are not required to periodically update their plans the sips and vehicle emissions budgets to reflect the more current data and model32 the net result is that if the transportation models show an incr ease in emissions as result of new transportation project an increase in vehicl miles traveled or increased use of suvs and light trucks the reductions necessary to demonstrate conformity now come entirely from the transportation sector if the sip were required to be updated at the same time and to use the same data the changes in transportation emissions might be offset by reductions in other sectors as gao explained it if st ates periodically updated their air quality plans to incorporate the most current data and mode l they could reassess whether these types of transportation changes were best for an area or whether they have achieved enough or more costeffective reductions from other sources so that they could revise the vehicle emissions budgets nd provide transporta tion planners some flexibility33 thus gao proposed that ep assess the advantages and disadvantages of statutorily requiring that the emissions budgets in air quality plans be regularly updated with new trav data and emissions models34 epa neither agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation according to gao the agency noted that stat already have the flexibility to undertake such updates and are in better position than epa to d ecide whether the cost of doing so is justified35 second sip issue is what is describe d as mismatch between sip and lrtp timeframes lrtps are 20year planning documents whereas sips timeframe varies depending upon the ar eas nonattainment status for areas in nonattainment for the old 1hour ozone standard the si ps planning horizon is the areas required attainment date gene rally 2005 2007 or 2010 areas designated nonattainment for the new 8hour standard generally have 3 5 or 6year deadlines once an area reaches attainment it is requi red to revise its sip to monstrate how it will maintain its status these maintenance sips have 10year horizons as ampo describes it the result of this mismatch is that for the purpose of conforming the long range transportation plans the transportati on emissions budget for the years beyond the sip horizons is presumed projection rather than the result of negotiatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32106crs12 36 im refers to inspection and maintenance

long term ai r quality planning organization but without the authority to implement the types of programs eg im rfg36 needed to substantially reduce mobile source emissions37 there are at least two possible solutions to this mismatch 1 shorten the lrtp planning horizon for conformity purposes eg to 10 years in most cases as the administration proposes in safetea or as ampo suggests to whatever the operative time horizon is for the sip generally less than 6 years or 2 lengthen the sip time horizon to 20 years the latter might be viewed as resourceintensive but it might better preserve the role of conformity as an air quality planning tool the most costly transportation projects often require more than 10 years from planning to completion so the shorter c onformity horizon might have the effect of allowing the largest projects to advance th rough design right of way acquisition and early construction without full consideration of the air quality impacts of the completed project38 for this reason the administrations proposal and presumably ampos as well is opposed by envir onmental groups led by environmental defense and by air quality planning officials represented by the state and territorial air pollution program administrators and ssociation of local air pollution control officials stappaalapco39 the administrations proposal does envisi on that conformity might need to be demonstrated beyond 10 years in some cases it would require that the conformity determination for projects whose constr uction extends beyond the 10year horizon include the year of completion and opening of the project thus 15year project would need to demonstrate conformity for 15 years rather than 10 but the analysis would not include subsequent years when growth and development associated with the project could occur senate and house ac tions on conformity both the senate and house have now passed surface transportation b ills as passed on february 12 s 1072 would require less frequent conformity demonstrations at least every 4 years for both the tip and the long range transportati on plan instead of every 2 years and 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32106crs13 years respectively in current law nd would shorten the planning horizon over which conformity must be demonstrated to 10 years in most cases instead of the current 20 years in line with the administrations proposal the bill would allow replacement of transportation control measures in sips without triggering new conformity determina tions would allow new nonattainme nt areas to use such tests as the administrator may determine in demonstrating conformity until an emissions budget is determined to be adequate and would grant areas two years following approval of new motor vehicle emissi ons budget before they would need to demonstrate conformity with the new budg et the bill also provides additional resources to mpos and state dots for pl anning purposes increasing the resources available for conformity dete rminations the administration proposal to combine the tip and long range transportation plan was not adopted nor were any changes made to the sip time frame as passed by the house hr 3550 cont ains similar provisions except that it would require that the local air pollution c ontrol agency agree if the planning horizon were to be shortened the house bill also establishes 12month grace period following failure to demonstrate conformity before lapse would be declared conclusion conformity is an important but complicated process conformity determinations are means of enforcing state implementation plans for achieving air quality standards once sips have been adopted if federal agencies were not required to conform to sip the plan might not be implemented as intended significantly weakening the clean air acts effectiveness the absence of conformity would put federal agencies in the role of undermining the legally adopted state plan for achieving air quality while much emphasis is placed on the problems potentially caused by areas incurring lapse in conformity the need to make conformity determinations affects transportation decisions in ll nonattainment and ma intenance areas in this respect conformity serves an important tool for ongoing planning and coordination between transportation and air quality officials as well as providing means of enforcing the act the debate regarding proposed changes in conformity requir an understanding of both the transportation planning and the air quality planning processes but it tends to be colored by the camp air quality or transportation to which one belongs those who focus on the need to modify th process generally have concluded that conformity determinations are interfering with or delaying needed transportation improvements those whose primary concern is air quality however tend to view the process as requiring necessary analysis of air quality impacts before the commitment of large sums of public money to specific highway or transit projects
