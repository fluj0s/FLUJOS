congress bills hr 4973 and s 3589 october 12 2006 rawle king analyst in industry economics government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress flood insurance reform analysis and comparison of 109th congress bills hr 4973 and s 3589 summary in 1968 congress established the national flood insurance program nfip as response to mounting flood losses escalating costs of disaster relief to the general taxpayers and as an alternative to ad hoc federal disaster assistance in the wake of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in 2005 the nfip faces unprecedented financial and regulatory strains the nations attention has now focused on disaster impacts and costs as well as both the strengths and weaknesses of the nfip in managing and financing the nations flood risk those concerned about program weaknesses cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury substantial premium cross subsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements questions as to the performance and efficiency of the write your own program and need to put the nfip on sounder financial footing at the behest of the congress fema has from time to time examined the programs contingent liabilities and recommended ways to provide financial stability to the flood insurance program for example the nfips borrowing authority is currently the exclusive financing arrangement for potential catastrophic losses in recent years fema has identified alternative financing arrangements but congress has yet to act on any proposal members of the 109th congress are considering hr 4973 and s 3589 the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2006 which seek to enhance the nfips effectiveness and limit taxpayer liability for claims the main thrust of the reform effort is to have the program satisfy traditional criteria for actuarial soundness by eliminating some or all of the premium subsidy provided to certain properties insured under the nfip the congressional budget office cbo estimates the nfip provides 13 billion annual premium subsidy cbo suggests that eliminating the subsidies on all properties including nonresidential and non primary ie vacation or second home would result in generating sufficient premiums to cover the longterm future obligations of the nfip but not necessarily enough to cover past losses or future catastrophic loss years some stakeholder groups have expressed concerns about making abrupt changes to the nfip without full knowledge of potential unintended adverse effects others argue however that the nfip must be reauthorized by congress in 2008 so any reforms to the program approved now could be revisited during the 110th congress this report provides an overview of the nfip focusing on factors that may affect the nfips actuarial soundness or that may inhibit its ability to provide flood insurance to property owners this is followed by summary and sidebyside comparison of the house and senate versions of the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2006 hr 4973 and s 3589 this report will be updated as events warrant

hurricanes were catastrophic disasters that required substantial federal disaster relief and unusually large claims payouts under the national flood insurance program nfip federal allocations1 for postdisaster assistance now total 109 billion plus more than 8 billion in tax relief2 this 109 billion amount includes 896 billion in postdisaster assistance and 193 billion in insurance claim payments under the nfip as of august 31 2006 the nfip had borrowed 1675 billion from the us treasury an amount that far exceeds the aggregate amount of claims paid in the history of the program3 the 896 billion appropriated by congress includes 115 billion in us department of housing and urban development hud community development block grant cdbg funds for five states alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas affected by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma4 the majority of the cdbg funds will be used to compensate homeowners in louisiana and mississippi for the value of their homes up to their insured value or 150000 whichever is less5 grants are now available to thousands of homeowners outside of special flood hazard areas 1 the term federal allocation is used rather than spending

support the renovation and construction of affordable rental housing in the affected states crs2 commonly known as the flood plain or the flood zone who were not required by federal law to purchase flood insurance6 in addition to federal appropriations in support of short and longerterm needs of the gulf coast legislative efforts are now underway in congress to reform the nfip so as to provide for its fiscal solvency and actuarial soundness while protecting current policyholders and taxpayers some stakeholder groups have expressed concerns about making abrupt changes to the nfip without full knowledge of potential unintended adverse effects that could undermine the program others argue that because the nfip must be reauthorized by congress in 2008 any reforms to the program approved now could be revisited during the 110th congress catastrophic losses and the nfip in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma policymakers have expressed broad concerns about the financial condition of the nfip particularly with respect to potential future catastrophic losses and the programs ability to meet its financial obligations to the treasury and to its policyholders in an attempt to ensure that fema has the financial resources to cover current obligations ie policyholder claims and operational expenses but not debt service congress passed and the president signed into law legislation to increase the nfips borrowing authority to allow the agency to continue to pay flood insurance claims first to 35 billion in september 20 20057 to 185 billion on november 21 20058 and finally to 20775 billion on march 23 20069 fema estimates that the nfip will need about 3 billion in additional borrowing authority in late 2006 and early 2007 to pay the remaining claims from the 2005 hurricanes10 under current law fema must repay any borrowed funds with interest as it collects premiums the congressional budget office calculates that fema is unlikely to repay the funds borrowed to pay 2005 hurricanerelated claims within the next 10 years11 even if fema increased flood insurance rates up to the maximum amount allowed by law 10 per year the program would still not have sufficient funds to cover future obligations for policyholder claims operating expenses and 6 in order to qualify for the 150000 compensation the home must 1 be outside the flood zone established by the federal government 2 be owneroccupied and 3 have had homeowner or similar insurance coverage at the time of katrinas landfall these criteria were established to eliminate the possibility of assistance to homeowners who lived within known flood area and yet did not maintain flood insurance or homeowners who did not maintain standard home insurance 7 pl 10965 110 stat 1998 8 pl 109106 119

forgiveness of nfips treasury borrowing by advocates who point to the avoidance of billions of dollars in flood losses that would otherwise have been paid by the treasury and taxpayers economists observe that debt forgiveness would constitute an explicit subsidy from general taxpayer funds with federal budgetary consequences recognizing the unprecedented financial and regulatory challenges facing the nfip and the exposure of the federal government to future claims from another catastrophic loss year most insurance market analysts and policymakers appear to agree that this 38yearold program is in need of an overhaul those concerned about program weaknesses cite increased need to borrow from the us treasury substantial premium crosssubsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood insurance rate maps that will form the basis for making decisions about where and how to rebuild the gulf coast allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements questions as to performance and efficiency of the write your own program and general need to put the program on sounder financial footing this report provides an overview of the nfip focusing on those factors that might undermine the nfips fiscal and actuarial soundness or that may inhibit its ability to provide flood insurance to property owners this is followed by summary and sidebyside comparison of the house and senate versions of the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2006 hr 4973 and s 3589 the national flood insurance program after several decades of massive investments in area flood control facilities like dams levees and floodway improvements with the aim of modifying natures flood hazard areas congress established the national flood insurance program nfip with the 1968 passage of the national flood insurance act13 the availability of federally subsidized flood insurance signaled shift in federal policy towards flood plain avoidance and public policy response to three forces continued development of the nations floodplains lack of private insurance options for flood insurance on reasonable terms and conditions and escalating cost of ad hoc federal disaster assistance14 12 ibid 13 pl 90448 82 stat 572 14 ibid section 1302b crs4 policymakers envisioned the use of insurance to facilitate longrange flood mitigation land use policies despite extensive flood management efforts and spending however the number of floods and floodrelated damage continues to increase15 some disaster experts have speculated that the trend is the result of climate change while others say population growth and development and federal policy are to blame organization and structure the nfip consists of threepronged strategy flood risk assessment and mapping financing flood risk through insurance and land use and building construction measures that constrict the development of land exposed to flood hazard taken together this strategy allows for residential construction in known floodplains but with the proviso that the property must be constructed according to building code regulation that incorporates floodproofing requirements the nfip was broadened and modified with the passage of the flood disaster protection act of 197316 and other major reform legislation in 197717 199418 and 200419 today federal flood insurance is currently available in 20118 participating communities to help individuals and small businesses recover following flood fema officials point out that the nfip has realized significant savings both to itself and property owners by reducing the cost of disaster relief the basic requirement of the flood management program and access to federal flood insurance is that communities adopt and enforce minimum land use and building code regulation to prevent new development from increasing the flood threat and to protect new and existing buildings from anticipated flood events in practical terms new residential construction in special flood hazard areas sfha must be elevated to or above the level water would reach in flood that occurs with 1 annual chance this water level is called the base flood elevation bfe the nfip also requires that existing residential structures that are below bfe be raised to that level if they are substantially damaged or improved ie cost of the improvement or damage equals or exceeds 50 of the market value of the building before construction starts on the improvement the nfips standard flood insurance policy sfip which includes the general property and dwelling forms covers 1 direct physical losses caused by flood 2 losses resulting from floodrelated erosion caused by waves or currents of water activity exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or 3 losses caused by severe storm 15 ra pielke jr mw

actuarial soundness since 1978 the nfip has grown from 14 million policyholders and 50 billion in risk exposure to 49 million policyholders and approximately 900 billion in risk exposure with 23 billion in annual premiums23 participation in the nfip increased sharply during the 1970s and 1980s after congress passed the flood disaster protection act of 197324 to require known floodprone communities to participate in the program expand the program by substantially increasing limits of coverage and the total amount of insurance authorized to be outstanding and restrict the use of federal funds in floodplain areas unless the property was protected by flood insurance25 premium subsidies the 1973 act also explicitly authorized subsidized premiums on preflood insurance rate map firm structures to encourage communities to join the program26 in addition prefirm structures are not required to comply with existing construction requirements after the firm is completed however newly constructed structures in the community are required to be built according to the nfips building standards ie the lowest floor of newly constructed structure must be elevated to or above the base flood level bfe 20 the dwelling form is used to insure single family dwellings twotofour family residential buildings residential condominium units and onetofour family buildings under

purpose actual cash value is the replacement cost minus any depreciation it represents the cost to replace with like kind and quality less depreciation 23 fema uses 1978 as the starting date for

substantial improvement of which the secretary determines has been started after december 31 1974 or the effective date of the initial rate map published by the secretary under paragraph 2 of section 1360 for the area in which such property is located whichever is later shall not be less than the applicable estimated risk premium rate for such are or subdivision thereof under section 13071127 about 12 million of the 49 million policyholders 244 pay premiums that do not cover the full risk of insuring their properties the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the policy of subsidizing prefirm properties produces revenue shortfall of about 13 billion each year28 fema would have to raise annual average premiums from about 710 to 1800 to cover the revenue shortfall29 even with this higher pricing the nfip would still not generate premium income sufficient to build reserves for potential catastrophic losses actuarial soundness by design the nfip does not conform to traditional insurance industry criteria for actuarial soundness in that the program does not collect sufficient premium income to build reserves fully to meet longterm future expected losses femas flood insurance pricing strategy and financial goal are instead designed to generate premiums sufficient at least to cover expected losses and expenses relative to what is called the historical average loss year which approximates the average annual losses experienced since 197830 the nfip typically generates premium surpluses in lessthanaverage loss years and uses this surplus to pay claims in higher loss years according to fema between 1978 and july 2006 the nfip experienced many heavyloss years but catastrophic flood event until hurricanes katrina rita and wilma31 fema defines catastrophe loss year as one which the program incurs claims losses greater than 55 billion 27 pl 93234 82 stat 576 section 103 28 see letter from donald b marron acting director of congressional

million fema had substantially repaid the 225 million borrowed when hurricanes katrina rita and wilma struck resulting in 1675 billion in borrowing crs8 repetitive loss properties another factor that affects the nfips actuarial soundness has been the cost of insuring repetitive loss properties rlps fema defines an rlp as property that is covered by nfip insurance policy and that has been the subject of two or more flood claims of at least 1000 over rolling 10year period although rlps comprise only about 1 of all insured properties they account for 25 of all claims paid32 fema reports that properties that have received multiple insurance claim payments account for an average of 200 million in claims each year additionally some 25 of all current nfip policies do not pay actuarial rates for their coverage and thus are subsidized by the 75 of other policyholders33 most insurance market experts agree that repetitive flood claims and very large claims payouts will likely result in increased cost of flood insurance for everyone and accounts for significant factor affecting the stability of the nfip the 2004 flood reform act established pilot program requiring owners of rlps to elevate relocate or demolish houses34 the repetitive flood claims rfc grant program was created under this act with the aim of reducing the longterm risk of flood damage caused by rlps congress appropriated 10 million to support activities under the rfc program rfc funds may be used for activities that reduce floodrelated property damages to structures that are located within communities that cannot meet the requirements of the flood mitigation assistance fma program for either cost share or capacity to manage the activities35 the fy2006 rfc funding priority is to fund the acquisition of severe repetitive loss properties srlps which are defined as residential properties that have at least four nfip claim payments over 5000 each at least two of which have occurred within any 10year period and with cumulative claims payments exceeding 20000 in addition at least two separate claims payments would have to have been made with the cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the value of the property nonresidential properties that meet the same claims thresholds as residential severe repetitive loss properties are also eligible for rfc grants mandatory purchase requirement among the nfip reforms being considered in congress is one that would more broadly spread the risk by increasing the policyholder base through both mandatory 32 see association of state floodplain managers

purchase and voluntary purchase36 currently property owners who obtain loans from federally regulated lending institutions or who receive federal financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes in special flood hazard areas sfhas in communities that participate in the nfip are required to purchase flood insurance for their outstanding mortgage balance up to maximum of 250000 in coverage for single family homes37 in order to increase the policyholder base some observers have gone as far as to suggest that all homes and businesses in designated flood plains purchase federal flood insurance and not just homes with mortgages owned or serviced by federally regulated institutions fema estimates that such an effort could add an estimated 4 to 6 million properties located in areas of lower risk of flooding ie 250year or 500year floodplain including properties protected by structural flood controls like dams and levees currently the mandatory purchase requirement applies only to properties in the 1 or 100year floodplain flood map modernization fema is charged with identifying and mapping the nations flood hazards38 flood maps have been used for 35 years under the nfip by insurance agents and companies lenders property owners flood zone determination firms real estate professionals floodplain managers community planners engineers and disaster and emergency response officials to determine the flood risk of individual properties or to make local land use decisions in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes some disaster experts and policymakers have expressed concerns about the accuracy of flood maps that might not incorporate the latest engineering analyses or reflect changes caused by development and natural factors that alter the terrain this situation is of concern to policymakers because the 1994 reform act mandated that firms for each community be reevaluated at least once every five years but this has not happened in 1997 fema began multiyear map modernization program to improve and update the nations flood maps congress first appropriated funds for map modernization in fy2003 with additional funding provided in fy2004 fy2005 and fy2006 in response to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes however fema had to undertake midcourse review of the flood map modernization plan this review and recommendations reflected the concerns of stakeholder groups

mapping floodplain boundaries and an increase in the level of engineering analysis for communities at greater risk of flooding nfip multiyear comprehensive evaluation at the behest of the congress fema has from time to time examined the flood insurance programs contingent liabilities and recommended ways to provide financial stability to the program the nfips borrowing authority is the exclusive financing arrangement for the potential catastrophic losses fema has in recent years identified alternative financing arrangements but congress has yet to act on any proposal these approaches include annual appropriations commercial bank financing when losses exceed premium income plus some dollar retention level and the use of financial reinsurance and catastrophe bonds to smooth out the nfips cash flow section 578 of the national flood insurance reform act of 1994 required fema to conduct study of the economic effects that would result from increasing the premium rates for flood insurance coverage made available under the national flood insurance program nfip for prefirm structures to the full actuarial risk based premium39 this study of the impact of imposing actuarial rate for prefirm structures was performed by pricewaterhouse coopers40 there were three major findings first flood insurance premiums would rise substantially for prefirm structures exposed to considerable flood risk as result of subsidy elimination second national participation rates for all sfha structures would grow from 28 in 1997 to 40 in 2022 in the absence of subsidy elimination but if the subsidy were eliminated immediately the participation rate would drop from 26 in 1997 to about 20 in 1998 therefore the subsidy should be phased out over time third the property values of prefirm structures would decline by 4 in 1998 if there were an immediate subsidy elimination it would appear that these findings might have influenced policy shift in congress and the administration towards reducing or eliminating the subsidy on nonprimary and nonresidential properties several years ago fema began the first major evaluation of the programs performance and goals since its inception41 according to fema the purpose of the overall program evaluation was to perform research and to develop data and other information needed to support longterm planning and policymaking the evaluation sought to assess the nfip in the following six areas 1 occupancy and use of floodplain 2 cost and consequences of flooding 3 insurance rating and indemnification function 4 floodplain

identification and risk assessment and 6 marketing and communications this multiyear evaluation which is being managed under contract by the american institute for research is ongoing and will likely take several more years to complete most disaster experts appear to agree that demands on the nfip are not likely to decline as weatherrelated disasters particularly hurricanes are said by some to be worsening in frequency and severity population continues to grow in floodprone areas and property values continue to rise in this environment of uncertainty public policy attention has focused on finding ways to address the financial needs of the program for the next anticipated catastrophic flood event major legislative proposals in 109th congress table 2 provides sidebyside comparison of the major provisions of hr 4973 and s 3589 the house and senate versions respectively of the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2006 which propose to modify the nfip to make the program financially solvent and enhance its effectiveness while limiting taxpayer liability for claims both bills were placed on the senate legislative calender on june 28 2006 making them eligible for floor action at any time hr 4973 on june 27 2006 the house passed hr 4973 the flood insurance reform and modernization act which would modify the nfip by implementing changes to bring more consumers into the system and gradually reduce subsidies for properties built before flood insurance rate maps firms were developed hr 4973 would increase the nfips borrowing authority from the us treasury from 185 billion to 25 billion to cover claims from the 2005 hurricane season and increase the dollar limits on the amounts of coverage available for residential property from 250000 structure and 100000 contents to 335000 and 135000 for any singlefamily dwelling and from 500000 to 670000 for structures and related contents of nonresidential property hr 4973 includes provisions aimed at moving the program to actuarial rates for certain properties and updating the nations flood maps under hr 4973 fema would be required to review the nations flood maps and for the first time map the nations 500year floodplain the bill would authorize the appropriation of 300 million year over the 20072012 period for updating flood maps to include the 500year floodplain and areas that would be flooded if dam or levee failed and require fema to maintain and publish an inventory of us levees hr 4973 would increase enforcement tools made available to bank regulators at both the federal and state levels lenders would face higher penalties for noncompliance with the nfips mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement the current level of 350 per violation would increase to 2000 per violation with 1 million per institution cap on penalties in any given year the 1 million cap however would not apply to institutions for calendar year if in any three of the last five calender years the institution was assessed penalty of at least 1 million in crs12 addition lenders would be required to notify borrowers of requirements that flood insurance is available to all homeowners and not just those in 100year floodplain as part of the real estate settlement act respa requirements42 the house bill would also phase in actuarial rates for commercial and non primary residences and create new categories of optional coverage such as business interruption coverage necessary increase in living expenses basement improvements and replacement cost of contents actuarial rates would be phased in after fema

coverage limits and require fema claims adjusters to participate in statesponsored mediation at the request of state insurance commissioner44 the administration also raised constitutional concerns involving separation of powers between the branches of the federal government and between the states and the federal government the issue of concern is that the congress would be conferring on state officials the authority to compel agents of the federal executive into the states service it is unlikely that either bill will be taken up during the lame duck session of the 109th congress but they
