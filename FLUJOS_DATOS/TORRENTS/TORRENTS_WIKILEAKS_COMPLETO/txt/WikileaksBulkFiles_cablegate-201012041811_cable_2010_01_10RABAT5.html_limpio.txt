signing ceremony aqim 7 s turning to regional issues general ward asked general bennani how he saw the regional threat from quaida in the lands of the islamic maghreb aqim and narcotics traffickers bennani responded that narcotics were not making their way into morocco however aqim posed serious threat to countries like mauritania and mali that could not counter the terrorists general bennani explained that he was intimately familiar with mauritanias geography and topography and that the country was not capable of controlling its territory brigadier general abdellah hamdoun the director of military intelligence offered that mali lacked the means to counter aqim general ward then briefed general bennani air force commander major general ahmed boutaleb and other general officers on the us plan to gather intelligence about aqim in mali and mauritania and requested overflight clearance for us ep3 aircraft general bennani responded positively saying it was important to box in aqim general boutaleb added that the air force and the general staff would study the overflight request and respond quickly guinea 8 s general ward next noted that morocco was hosting some important guests general bennani asked if he was referring to president sarkozy or former president chirac general ward replied he was referring to guinean junta leader dadis camara and guinean minister of national defense sekouba konate asking about their conditions surprisingly bennani had information about either and did not even know that general konate was in morocco although he had attended the moroccan military academy and had strong ties to moroccan leaders general ward strongly urged that morocco keep dadis camara as long as possible general bennani noted that camara was in morocco on humanitarian terms and responded only that many african leaders come to the mohammed v military hospital in rabat for free medical care general hamdoun suggested that konate was weak and might not be fit to serve as head of state for an extended period comment 9 c general bennani who can be very prickly appeared upbeat throughout the ceremony and related discussions the cismoa brings level of us scrutiny and procedure to the control and dissemination of the cryptographic and keying material associated with us weapons systems that can appear intrusive to sovereign nation however the general seemed thoughtful as he digested the discussion of the upcoming implementation and programmatic activities that would take place in the coming months and years he and the rest of the senior military leadership seemed totally uninformed about patients at the military hospital moreover general bennanis comments about narcotics transiting morocco were at odds with comments from key civilian leaders who express significant concern about this matter 10 c in sum general wards visit accomplished the necessary act of signing the document integral to full and timely implementation of the f16 program in morocco and reinforced the already strong relationship between the us and moroccan militaries the upcoming year will see full slate of security cooperation activities between the two militaries building to the delivery of the first f16 in july 2011 end comment 11 u general ward has cleared this message 12 u tripoli minimize considered rabat 00000005 0032 of 003 visit embassy rabats
