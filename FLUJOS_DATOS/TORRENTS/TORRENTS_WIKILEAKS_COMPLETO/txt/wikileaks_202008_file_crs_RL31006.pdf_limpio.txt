administration effective january 20 2001 those regulations authorized the blm to deny mining operations in certain instances and made mining operators more responsible for reclaiming mined land the housepassed language was advocated as maintaining necessary nvironmental protections but opposed as precluding the administration from reviewing regulations that were amended too extensively by the clinton administration on march 23 2001 the bush administrati on proposed suspending the hardrock mining regulations on october 30 2001 th bush administration issued final hardrock mining rule effective decembe r 31 2001 that retained the requirements for mining operators to reclaim mined nd but dropped the authority for the blm to deny mining operations in certain instances on october 30

remove the backlog of listing and its continuing failure to do so in light of its assertion of 120 million need 3 the restriction was onesided since delistings and down listings would have such cap

payment levels have been cont roversial since the small additions of land to the national wildlife refuge system over the last several years mean that dollars already reduced by inflation must be

to whether tribes othe r financial resources are taken into account first much if not most bia funding even while serving tribal needs is not required to be dist ributed on nationwide per capita or other formula basis second tribes own nonbi resources especia lly business revenues are not always required to be take n into account 1998 gao study of tpa distribution found that twothirds of fy 1998 tpa funds were distributed based on historical levels and onethird was di stributed based on formulas that tpa distribution per capita varied widely acro ss bia areas and that tribal governments reporting of their revenues we re inconsistent in includi ng or excluding nonfederal revenues supporters of tpa funding redistributi on based on meanstesting of tribes claim that bia funding is inequitably di stributed that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding that tribal tpa funds received per capita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need that only 30 per cent of tpa funding is based on formulas and that some rich tribes got more tpa funds in fy1998 than tribes with outside revenues opponents respond th at almost all tribes are in poverty that bia funding is insufficient to meet tribal needs and that meanstesting tpa funding would penalize tribes who still have severe needs would violate the federal trust responsibility to tribes and would be unfair since it is not required of state or local governments receiving federal assistance congress debated veral proposals for reallocating tpa funding during its consideration of the fy1998fy2001 ppropriation bills for fy1998fy1999 congress authorized tribalfederal work group on tpa allocations and tribal needs assessment required that each tribe recei ve certain minimum amount of funding and directed the bia to develop tpa r eallocation proposals the biatribal workgroups report in july 1999 concluded that variation in tribes circumstances made formula distribution problematic that tpa funding resulted from history geography and policies that current funding did not meet identified needs and thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31006crs32 measures of tribal need and revenue we re not fully available the

increased this funding by 40 milli on to 288 million in response to the administrations request the increased funding for contract support costs reflects the fact that more tribes and tribal organizations are participating in new and expanded selfdetermina tion contracts and selfgove rning compacts however the house was concerned that while both th bureau of indian affairs bia and ihs have similar programs the ihs in fy2002 will pay 55 million in direct contract support operating costs while the bia will pay nothing in consequence the house inserted bill language that would have prevented ihs s funding of any new andor expanded contracts or compacts the conference committee removed that bill language but agreed with house report lang uage asking ihs to justify the need for

result of dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal government for reserva tion in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act lands were partitioned between the two tribes members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribes land were to be relocated onhir classifi families as relocated when they occupy their replacement home most relocatees are navajo large majority of the estimated 3477 navajo families formerly on the nd partitioned to the hopi have already relocated under the act but the house appropriations committee estimates that about 300 families almost all navajo have ye t to complete relocation including about 33 navajo families still on hopi par titioned land some of whom refuse to relocate the remaining families are not on hopi partitioned land but are in various stages of ac quiring replacement housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31006crs48 for fy2001 onhir received appropriations of 150 million for fy2002 the administration proposed 151

on hopi partitioned nd and the federal government on number of issues especia lly regarding hopi tribe claims against the united states in 1995 the united stat and the hopi tribe reached proposed settlement agreement on hopi claims attached to the settlement agreement was separate accommodation agreement between the hopi tribe and the navajo families which provided for 75year leases for na vajo families on hopi partitioned land the navajohopi land dispute settlement act of 1996 pl 104 301 approved the settlement agreement between the united states and the hopi tribe not all issues have been resolved by these agreemen ts however and opposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the navajo families navajo families with homesites on hopi partitione d land faced march 31 1997 deadline for signing the leases accommodation agreem ents according to onhir 70 of the 73 families on hopipartitioned land had signed accomm odation agreements by the end of september 1999 the hopi tribe called for enforcement of relocation against navajo families without leases like the fy1997fy2001 in terior appropriations acts the fy2002 law forbids onhir from evicting any nava jo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home is provided th is language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating nava jo families since onhir has large backlog of other families that need homes the settleme nt agreement approved by pl 104301 however allows the hopi tribe under certain circumstances to begin quiet possession actions against the united stat after feb 1 2000 if navajo families on hopi partitioned land have not either relocated or entered into leases with the hopi tribe the hopi tribe has agreed to let the federal government pursue the matter in court but feels evictions should have started already in the past congress has been concerne d by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees apparent low level of interest in moving to the new lands acquired for the navajo reservation for relocatee use appropriations committees from time to time have considered termination of the relocation program but committee reports have not discussed this option since fy1999 other related agencies one of the perennial issues addressed by congress concerning the programs and agencies delineated below is whether federal government support for the arts

greater private support or state support would be encour aged each program has its own unique relationship to this overarching issue smithsonian the smithsonian institution si is museum education and

was established in 1963 to develop information to assist in the preservation of museum objects the crc facility was established 26 years ago on 3150 acres in front royal to support endangered species propagation conservation training and research the smithsonian contended that although its effort to breed endangered species for reintroduction into the wild has been important for international conservation and research efforts it does not have sufficient funds to continue to keep this property as world class fac ility funds were to be redirected to public program activity at the zoos rock creek location number of biologists who worked with the crc objected stating that the kind of work done at the crc is dependent on the natural habitat in front royal virginia the fy2002 budget outlined policy that the smithsonian cannot continue to be the scientific artistic and historic smorgasbord of past decades and is prepared to pare back certain activities and programs that do not fall with the institutions sphere of excellence on may 6 2001 after the initial submission of the fy2002 budget the smithsonian in response to scientists reversed its policy with regard to the crc and

opponents of arts support argue that nea nd neh should be abolished altogether contending that the federa l government should not be in the business of supporting arts and humanities other opponents argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the federal government has long tradition of support for culture beginning as early as 1817 with congressi onal appropriations for works of art to adorn the us capitol some spokesmen for the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts some argue that abolishing nea and neh would curtail or eliminate the programs that have national signif icance and purpose such as touring theater and dance companies radio and television shows traveling museum exhibitions etc the presidents clinton committee on the arts released publication in 1997 creative america that recommended that

resource protection activities includi ng federal land acquisition one approach was free standing legislation known as cara cons ervation and reinves tment act hr 701 that would have fully funded the lwcf for federal and state land acquisition for 15 years versions of cara would have addressed the role of the annual appropriations process in f unding federal acquisitions in different ways some versions would have made lwcf funding mandatory while other versions would have continued the current requirement of making lwcf funding subject to annual appropriations in the 106th congress hr 701

the second approach was in the clinton administrations lands legacy initiative which consisted of requests for substantial increases in appropriations to more than 2 dozen programs including the fund while the 106 th congress did not enact cara it did provide increased funding for land acquisition as part of separate titles for the lands legacy initiative in ppropriations legislation in both fy2000 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31006crs56 fy2001 it also provided framework for funding these programs for each of the subsequent 5 years subject to appropria tions the house and senate appropriations committees included these programs in separate category called the conservation spending category in both interior nd commerce appropriati ons laws starting in fy2001 for fy2002 both chambers provided 132 billion for fy2002 in interior appropriations an increase from 123 billi on in fy2001 but allocated the funds in somewhat different ways as shown in table 12 in some recent years congress appropr iated funds from the lwcf for purposes in addition to land acquisition this first occurred when congress provided 72 million for other purposes in the fy1998 ppropriations funding in fy1999 was entirely for land acquisition funding in fy2000 included 15 million for other purposes and funding in fy2001 included 456 million for other purposes according to the doi the amounts listed in table 9 include these funds for other purposes the appropriations for other pur poses were primarily applied to other programs funded as part of the lands legacy initiative during fy2000 and fy2001 in fy 2000 for example included were 10 million for the elwha river ecosystem restoration and 5 million to address maintenance backlogs this entire amount was credited to the nps these additional uses of the fund ar important because it means that funding levels for the lwcf are becoming less synonymous with funding for land acquisition see di scussion of fish and wildlife service appropriations for more detail on many of these proposals for fy2001 and fy2002 the bush administration proposed to fully fund the lwcf at 900 million in fy2002 fund experts at the doi believe that this is the first time any president has called for full funding the request sought to divide funding qually between federal agencies 450 million and the state gr ant program 450 million which may be used by the states and localities for acquisition and development the federal portion for land acquisition 390 million would be divided among the agencies as shown in table 9 only 390 million would be used for fede ral land acquisition because the fws requested that 60 million of its portion be earmarked for fwss incentive grant program of the 60 million 50 million w ould provide technical and financial assistance to landowners as incentives to help them protect and manage habitat while continuing to engage in traditional land use practices the remaining 10 million would provide stewardship grants to support individuals and groups engaged in voluntary land and wildlife conservation efforts this is the first time that an administration requested in its budget submission that portion of the lwcf funding be used for purposes other than land acquisition previously nonacquisition uses of lwcf originated in congress or by the administration after the appropriations pro cess had started for grants to states the administra tion proposed distri bution formula that makes 35 of the total available equally and the remainder based 30 on land area and 70 on population by contrast in r ecent years the administrations decisions for allocating the funds among states has not been fully known even by the end of the appropriations process the proposed allocations would range from more than 29 million for california to 45 million for 4 states neither the house nor the senate addressed how these funds should be distributed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31006crs57 the total funding for lwcf in the house bill was 709 million and in the senate bill was 730 million both are less than the presidents 900 million request the house supported the 390 million that th bush administration requested for federal land acquisition with changes to the amounts for each agency while the senate bill increased th total by 16 million to 406 million primarily for the national park service however both chambers reduced the stateside grants request from 450 million and in addition 60 million for certain fws activities the house reduced the amount to 319 million for state and other grants which would include 154 million for nps stateside grants 100 million for state wildlife grants 5 million for competitive grants for indian tribes for wildlife programs and 60 million to the fws for activities other than land acquisition under the proposed incentive grant program discussed in th fish and wildlife service section the senate concurred except that it provided an additional 10 million for stateside grants and did not fund grants for i ndian tribes it also added as part of an bloc senate amendment detailed instructions on how state wildlife grants are to be distributed in the same amendment the senate adopted sense of congress provision which states the intent to pr ovide significant portion of federal revenues from offshore oil and gas to those states that have supported those activities but does not identify any specific program such as the lwcf which is funded by offshore oil and gas revenues the fy2002 appropriations law contai ns total of 708 million for lwcf significantly less than the presidents request and somewhat less than the house and senate levels that figure include s 429 million for federal land acquisitionmore than the presidents request and the h ouse and senate leve ls and 279 million for state and other grantsless than the pres idents request and the house and senate levels the law retains the distribution formula for state wildlife grants that was included by the senate rather than the formula proposed by the house the law drops the senate language expressing the sense of congress regarding coastal impact assistance for complete summary of the conservation
