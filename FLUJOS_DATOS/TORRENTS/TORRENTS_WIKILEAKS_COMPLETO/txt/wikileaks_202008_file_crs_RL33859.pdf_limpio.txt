effectiveness formula developed by the ffice for grants and training renamed the office of grant programs in january 2007 in conjunction with other dhs and federal entities distributi on of shsgp letpp and uas i funding will be based on this risk and effectiveness formula the specific formula however is not publicly available at this time and may not be available in the future due to its possible security classification more generally dhs has indicated that risk calculations are based upon the following threat the likelihood of an attack occurring and vulnerability and consequence the relative exposure and expected impact of an attack13 the risk model dhs intends to use to allocate shsgp letpp and uasi funds will incorporate the potential risk of terrorism to people critical infrastructure and economic sectors for these risk assessm ents dhs will use population in geographic areas at possible risk population density and specific location characteristics that might

by formula states then received an additional allocation based on potential risk and effectiveness the effectiveness as judged by peer review of each jurisdictions risk mitigation strategy was used to adjust the amount of the riskbased portion of the total allocation thus some states rece ived more or less than they would have under the fy2005 formula which was based only on population an admittedly imperfect indicator of risk for fy2007 however dhs has decided to allocate grants first on the basis of risk and effectiveness and then to adjust the subminimum grants upwards as of this writing the department had not identifie d its method for reducing grants greater than the minimum so as not to exceed the appropriated amount 23 this is but one option for making the estimates other approaches may yield other resultsestimating shsgp and letpp grant allocations for fy2007 under hr 1 and s 4 the previous sections of this repor t described the dhs programs and the departments methods for allocating grants in fy2006 and fy2007 for the shsgp and letpp programs grants that are not to be less than statutorily set minimums22 moreover hr 1 as passed by the house and s 4 as passed by the senate would both lower the minimums that are currently in effect for those two programs question that immediately arises is how those changes would affect total shsgp and letpp grant amounts that the st ates the district of columbia puerto rico and the insular areas can expect to receive answering that question precisely however is not feasible because dhs does not disclose the risk and effectiveness scores it assigns to the applications it evaluates accordingly any effort to calculate rough estimates of grant amounts for fy 2007 under the current statutory minimum as interpreted by dhs program guidan ce and under hr 1 or s 4 proposed minimums must make three fundamental assumptions23 assumption 1 dhs risk and effectiveness scores for each applicant for fy2007 and under hr 1 and s 4 will equal those for fy2006 this assumption is valid only to the extent that the dete rminants of risk and effectiveness that pertain to each applicant and the dhs scoring system do not significantly vary from one year to the next assumption 2 proxy for each grant recipients undisclosed risk and effectiveness score in fy2006 can be found in the ratio of the amount of the recipients fy2006 total grant that was base d on risk and effectiveness to b the sum of risk and effectiveness amounts for all recipients in other words if one assumes that if recipient received 5 of the total funds available for allocation on the basis of risk and effectiveness in fy2006 then that recipient will receive 5 of the total funds available for allocation on the basis of risk and effectiveness in fy2007 and under hr 1 and s 4 assumption 3 the total appropriation fo r fy2007 for the shsgp and letpp programs was 900 million in order to estimate grants under the provisions of hr 1 one assumes the same total appropriation of 900 million for whatever fiscal year congressionally enacted and presidentially approved hr 1 were to go into effecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33859crs13 24 the precise amounts were 914975000 368277000 and 546919000 respectively 25 table 2 presents the fy2006 actual statebystate distributions for the shsgp and letpp programs the table also shows the portion of the total allocation distributed to each state in fy2006 by the risk and effectiveness meter for the amounts for all dhs programs from fy2003 through fy2006 see crs report rl 33770 department of homeland security grants to state and cal governments fy2003 to fy2006 by steven maguire and shawn reesecaveat as with all assumptionbased estimates the estimates that are presented in the following discussion should be interpreted carefully and used with great caution actual grant allocations will almost certainly differ from the estimates presented here calculating the estimates estimating grants for each eligible recipient involves the following steps the results of which are shown in tables 2 3 4 and 5 1 establish the proxies for ri sk and effectiveness table 2 col g 2 allocate the total available 900 million 913180500 for s 4 in proportion to the proxies 3 when recipients risk and effectiveness allocation is less than the statutory minimum allocate an additional amount to reach the minimum tables 3 4 and 5 col c recipients of additional amount are shown in italics 4 because this results in total greater than 900 million proportionally reduce the grants of all recipients in excess of the minimum to prevent exceeding the appropriation of 900 million tables 3 4 and 5 col d 5 display the resulting adjusted estimated allocations tables 3 4 and 5 col each of these steps is discussed below establishing proxies for risk and effectiveness scores in fy2006 congress appropriated to tal of 912 million for the sh sgp and letpp programs of that total 40 365 milli on was required to satisfy the minimum allocation for every eligible recipient the remainin g 60 547 million was allocated based on risk and effectiveness24 examination of column g in table 2 shows for example that california received 1518 of th 547 million new york 852 texas 805 and florida 68225 these percentages and the corresponding percentage for each grant recipient serve as proxy fo r each jurisdictions riskandeffectiveness score for the crs estimated allocations for fy2007 and as proposed under hr 1 estimating risk and effectiveness the dhs guidance for fy2007 hr 1 and s 4 would allocate total shsgp nd letpp amounts by risk and assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33859crs14 26 the base for the adjustment percentage is the sum of all riskandeffectiveness allocations that exceed the minimum the denominator in the ratio is the sum of amounts required to bring all grants up to the minimum in the case of fy2007 allocations the ratio is 96558345 636558345 or 0151688 in the case of estimates under hr 1 the ratio is 24109768 747720000 or 00312372 s 4 the ratio is 44470354 741044440 subject to statutory minimums generally lower under hr 1 and s 4 than under existing law in order to estimate the risk and effectiveness allocations for each eligible jurisdiction we multip ly the proxy percentage di scussed above by the total appropriation of 900 million for fy2007 unde r dhs guidance this unadjusted amount is shown in column c of table 3 the corresponding amounts under hr 1 and s 4 are shown in column c of table 4 and table 5 respectively meeting the minimums as noted earlier existing law sets two minimum amounts based on the total appr opriation 075 per state th district of columbia and puerto rico 025 for other us insu lar areas given an appropriation of 900 million these minimums are 6750000 and 2250000 per state or insular area respectively under hr 1 however th ere would be three minimum amounts based on the total appropriation 045 for inte rnational border states 18 states 025 for states without an international border 32 states the district of columbia and puerto rico and 008 for the other us insular areas with an appropriation of 900 million these minimums would be 4050000 2250000 for the two categories of state respectivel and 720000 for insular areas the riskandeffectiveness proxies give some jurisdictions less than the required minimum
