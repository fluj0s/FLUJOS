the us census bureaus current population survey indicate that the unauthorized resident alien population commonly referred to as illegal aliens has risen from 32 million in 1986 to 111 million in 2005 the estimated number of unauthorized aliens had dropped to 19 million in 1988 following passage of 1986 law that legalized several million unauthorized aliens about twothirds of the unauthorized population in 2005 were estimated to have entered the united states in the past decade similarly the department of homeland securitys office of immigration statistics ois reported an estimated 116 million unauthorized alien residents as of january 2006 up from 85 million in january 2000 the ois based its estimates on estimates from the us census bureaus american community survey the ois estimated that the unauthorized immigrant population in the united states increased by 37 with an annual average increase of 515000 unauthorized aliens over the past six years research suggests that various factors have contributed to the increase in unauthorized resident aliens in recent years and that the rise is often attributed to the pushpull of prosperityfueled job opportunities in the united states in contrast to limited or nonexistent job opportunities in the sending countries some observers maintain that lax enforcement of employer sanctions for hiring unauthorized aliens has facilitated this pushpull but it is difficult to demonstrate this element empirically some researchers are now suggesting that the increased unauthorized resident population is an inadvertent consequence of border enforcement and immigration control policies they posit that strengthened border security has curbed the fluid movement of seasonal workers they also cite the backlog in processing immigrant petitions which some argue lead aliens to risk residing without legal status with their family in the united states while they wait for the petitions to be processed or visas to become available some observers point to more elusive factors when assessing the increase of unauthorized resident alienssuch as shifts in immigration enforcement priorities away from illegal entry to removing suspected terrorists and criminal aliens or discussions of possible amnesty legislation others argue that border security measures enacted in recent years have not received adequate funding to be effective against unauthorized migration this report does not track legislation and will be updated as needed

foreignborn people reside in the united states in recent years the united states typically admitted or adjusted 600000 to 1 million aliens annually giving them the status of legal permanent resident lpr term synonymous with the term immigrant in addition to those foreign nationals who permanently reside legally in the united states millions each year come temporarily on nonimmigrant visas and some of these nonimmigrants eg foreign students and intracompany business transfers may reside legally in the united states for several years it is also estimated that each year hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas 1 the three main components of the unauthorized resident alien population are 1 aliens who overstay their nonimmigrant visas 2 aliens who enter the country surreptitiously without inspection and 3 aliens who are admitted on the basis of fraudulent documents in all three instances the aliens are in violation of the immigration and nationality act ina and subject to removal the last major law that allowed unauthorized aliens living in the united states to legalize their status was the immigration reform and control act irca of 1986 pl 99603 generally legislation such as irca is referred to as an amnesty or legalization program because it provides lpr status to aliens who are otherwise residing illegally in the united states among ircas main provisions was timelimited legalization program codified at 245a of the immigration and nationality act that enabled certain illegal aliens who entered the united states before january 1 1982 to become lprs 2 it also had provision that permitted aliens working illegally as special agricultural workers to become lprs3 nearly 27 million aliens established legal status through the provisions of irca continued high levels of unauthorized migration to the united states have in part prompted the current discussion of guest worker programs as well as major proposals that would permit legalization under specified conditions there are also proposals aimed at reducing unauthorized migration by tightening up enforcement of immigration laws4 the report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission stated that more than 9 million people are in the united states outside the legal immigration system as one of the reasons for the commissions recommendations to improve immigration services and strengthen enforcement of immigration laws5 this crs report presents data estimating the number of unauthorized aliens who have been living in the united states since 1986 there have been variety of estimates of the unauthorized resident alien population over this period sometimes with substantially different results this report is

resident aliens in 1986 calculated by demographers karen woodrow and jeffrey passel who worked for the us census bureau at that time as expected after the passage of irca the estimate for 1988 dropped to 19 million 7 according to demographer robert warren of the former immigration and naturalization service ins the estimated unauthorized resident alien population grew to 34 million in 1992 and to 50 million in 19968 by the close of the decade the estimated number of unauthorized alien residents had more than doubled passel now at the pew hispanic center estimated the unauthorized population in 2000 at 85 million but this latter estimate included aliens who had petitions pending or relief from deportation 9 6 the demographers who conducted these analyses used some variant of residual methodology to estimate the population ie the estimated population remaining after citizens and authorized aliens are accounted for another reason they were selected for this comparison demographers at the us census bureau also have used similar methodology to estimate the residual foreign born population in the 2000 decennial census and they reported the following according to our calculations the estimated re sidual foreignborn population counted in the 2000 census was 8705419 assuming 15percent undercount rate yields population of 10241669 in 2000 they point out that the category of residual foreign born includes quasi legal liens ie aliens without gal status who have petitions pending or court cases underway that potentially would give them lpr status as well as unauthorized aliens and thus should not be considered an official estimate of unauthorized resident aliens us census bureau population division working paper 61 evaluating components of international migration the

cited published estimate based upon the march 2006 cps is that 111 million unauthorized aliens were residing in the united states according to this analysis by passel mexicans made up more than half of undocumented immigrants56 of the total or about 62 million he estimated that 25 million 22 were from other latin american countries about 13 were from asia 6 from europe nd canada and 3 from the rest of the world13 as figure 2 illustrates the 2005 distribution by region of origin was similar to woodrow and passels analysis of the 1986 data despite the growth in overall numbers from 32 million in 1986 to 111 million in 2005 in 1986 69 of the unauthorized aliens residing in the united states were estimated to be from mexico compared with 56 in 2005 asias share of the unauthorized alien residents appeared to have grown over this period from 6 to 13 as did the portion from the other parts of the world note that canada is grouped with north and south america excluding mexico in 1986 and with europe in 2005 14 passel estimated the number of persons living in families in which the head of the household or the spouse is an unauthorized alien was 146 million as of march 2005 passel also reported that in 2005 there were an estimated 18 million children who were unauthorized and an estimated 31 million children who were us citizens by birth living in families in which the head of the family or spouse was unauthorized he projected that unauthorized aliens accounted for about 49 of the civilian labor force in march 2005 or about 72 million workers out of labor force of 148 million 15 13 pew hispanic center size and characteristics of the unauthorized migrant population in the us estimates based on the march 2005 current population survey by jeffrey passel march 7 2006

that have contributed to the increase in unauthorized resident aliens historically unauthorized migration is generally attributed to the pushpull of prosperityfueled job opportunities in the united states in contrast to limited or nonexistent job opportunities in the sending countries 20 some observers maintain that lax enforcement of employer sanctions for hiring unauthorized aliens has facilitated this pushpull but it is difficult to demonstrate this element empirically political instability or civil unrest at home is another element that traditionally has induced people to risk unauthorized migration but the motives for such migrations are sometimes mixed with the economic hardships often correlated with political upheaval 21 although most policy makers have assumed that tighter border enforcement would reduce unauthorized migration some researchers are now suggesting that the strengthening of the immigration enforcement provisions most notably by the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira may have inadvertently increased the population of unauthorized resident aliens22 this perspective argues that iiriras increased penalties for illegal entry coupled with increased resources for border enforcement stymied what had been rather fluid movement of migratory workers along the southern border this in turn raised the stakes in crossing the border illegally and created an incentive for those who succeed in entering the united states to stay 23 another contributing factorbest represented by the quasilegal aliens discussed aboveis the waittimes for immigrant petitions to be processed and visas to become available to legally come to the united states there are statutory ceilings that limit the number of immigrant visas issued each year there are also significant backlogs in processing petitions because of the high volume of aliens eligible to immigrate to the united stat and the large number eligible to become us 19 op cit for alternative analyses see pew hispanic center estimates of the unauthoriz ed migrant population for states based on the march 2005 cps by jeffrey passel april 26 2006 20 for

relative and family preference petitions24 many observe that these family members sometimes risk residing without legal status with their family in the united states while they wait for the petitions to be processed or visas to become available some observers point to more elusive factorssuch as shifts in immigration enforcement priorities away from illegal entry to removing suspected terrorists and criminal aliens or discussions of possible amnesty legislationwhen they assess the increase of unauthorized resident aliens others argue that border security measures enacted in recent years have not received adequate funding to be effective against unauthorized migration and some maintain that state and local law enforcement officers have not been sufficiently involved in apprehending illegal aliens some would make illegal presence an aggravated felony 25 still others assert that there has not been sufficient funding and staffing for enforcement of immigration laws in the interior of the country26 it is difficult to measure whether or to what extent these other phenomena have contributed to the increase in unauthorized resident aliens
