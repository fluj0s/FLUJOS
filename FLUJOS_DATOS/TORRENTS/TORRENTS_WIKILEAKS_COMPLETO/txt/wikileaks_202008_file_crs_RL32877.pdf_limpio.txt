assistance to iraq and afghanistan run by the state department plus about 1 b illion for tsunami relief activities2 it is also possible that congress will provide additional money to cover costs of

relatively modest pace comes after several years of substantially higher growth between fy2000 the last budget controlled wholly by the clinton administration and fy2006 the regular nonwar dod budget has grown by about 45 in nominal terms or about 22 after inflation the increases of the last few years have boosted defense spending excluding funding for iraq and afghanistan to level above the peacetime average during the cold war and about equal to the peaks of the vi etnam war and the bu ildup of th 1980s figure 1 shows the trend in nati onal defense funding adjusted for inflation since fy1950 even with the recent increases however defense spending as share of the economy has continued to decline over time figure 2 shows national defense outlays as share of gdp since fy1950 in more recent years the decline reflects in part real reductions in the defense budget between fy1986 and fy1998 for the most part however the trend is due simply to continuing growth in the us economy that progressively reduced the economic burden of maintaining the cold war and postcold war military establishment some defense advocates argue that the nation can easily afford substantially greater defense spending since it sustained measurably larger burden in the past the issue is not only matter of economics however but also of evolving federal budget pressures and priorities as figure 3 shows overall federal spending has remained fairly steady at about 20 of gdp for the past 40 years within the budget mandatory programs mainly entitlement programs like social security medicare and medicaid plus interest on the debt ve grown substantially both as share ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32877crs4 3 the 1997 deficit control measures expired after fy2002 in 2002 congress did not extend

fy1962fy2010the budget and as share of the economy meanwhile nondefense discretionary spending has remained quite stable as share of gdp while the decline in the defense share of the budget has offset the increase in mandatory spending to increase defense spending substantially as share of gdp therefore would require either increasing total federal spending above historical norms or imposing offsetting cuts in other parts of the budget increased spending would require either hi gher taxes or greater borrowing growth in mandatory budget accounts may put even more pressure on other parts of the budget including defense after 2010 as members of the baby boom generation reach retirement age moreover defense spending may be cons trained for the foreseeable future as it has been in the past by pressures to reduce the federal budget deficit for most of the past 25 years congressional bate about both defe nse and nondefense federal spending has been dominated by pparently intractable budget deficits in november 1985 in an effort to cope with budget deficits that reached peak of 6 of gdp in fy1983 congress passed the gr ammrudmanhollings deficit control act pl 99177 the grammrudmanhollin gs law set annual ta rgets for reducing the deficit to zero in five years and imposed automatic cuts in spending if congressional action fe ll short with 50 of the cuts in defense and 50 in non defense expenditures congress amended the law in 1987 1990 1993 and 1997 each time pushing out the date for balancing the budget3 in each of the 13 years from fy1986 through fy1998 defense spending declined in inflationadjusted dollars initially driven by deficit concerns the decline in defense spending continued with the end of the cold war and the subsequent reduction of almost onethird in the size of the force throughout the period pressures to reduce the deficit remained major factor shaping the debate over defense spending the defense budget began to turn up again in fy1999 once the budget situation began to ease and increas accelerated during the first four years of the bush administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32877crs5 4 for similar analysis and discussion

past is guide current plans to reduce budget deficits may prove more difficult to implement than official projections anticipate as the congressional budget office and others have pointed out administration estimates do not take into account additional war costs the effects of extending tax cuts after fy2009 or the costs of indexing or repealing the alternative minimum tax the administration plan also assumes cuts in spending that have not yet been identified or enacted and it includes contingency for potential costs of changes in social security table 2 based on cbo

interaction estimated by crs as proportion of the cost of tax extensions should further increases in military pay and benefits be restrained within the defense budget when budgets are declining or growing only slowly there are necessary tradeoffs between on the one hand costs of paying personnel and operating the force and on the other hand investments in modernizing the force by developing and procuring new weapons as rule the most variable part of the budget has been the amount spent to procure new weapons figure 4 illustrates the point funding for weapons procurement has varied dr amatically climbing rapidl when overall budgets were growing but also plunging dispropor tionately when budgets declined in contrast military pers onnel and operation and main tenance costs have been considerably more stable though ther are some noteworthy trends militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32877crs7 personnel funding fell in the 1990s as the size of the force declined following the end of the cold war but then began to climb operation and maintenance costs leveled off for several year s after the mid1980s again as the size of the force declined but then also began to climb the leap in military personnel costs between fy2000 and fy2005 is particularly dramatic beginning with the fy2000 defense authorization bill congress approved substantial pay and benefits increases partly with administration concurrence and partly over its obj ections the increases include six years of pay raises of ½ pe rcent above the employment cost index an economywide measure of wage costs three rounds of pay table reform that gave much larger pay raises in middle grades to improve retention of sk illed personnel multiyear plan to eliminate diffe rences in onbase and offbase housing costs approval of phasedin plan to allow military retirees with aveterans disability ratin g of 50 or greater to receive both retired pay and veterans administration disability benefits program known as tricare for life under which 65 and older military retirees will have access to dod provided health care in addition to medicare repeal of the 1986 redux retirem ent program which gave lower pensions to those recruited after that time and repeal of measure that lowered benefits to survivors of militaryretirees once they qualified for social security benefits at age 62 taken together as figure 5 illustrates these changes have driven up active duty personnel costs by more than 30 after adjusting for inflation since 1999 the rate of increase in personnel costs may slow over the next few years though starting from higher base than just few years ago provided congress does not authorize additional major increases in personnel benefits but that proviso has become matter of some controversy in january david chu the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness argued against further boos ts in benefits for military retirees saying the amounts have gotten to the point where they are

ability to defend itself5 that judgment provoked some harsh recriminations from veterans organizations and some members of congress6 the problem for defense planners is that many of the recent large benefit increases such as tricare for life conc urrent receipt of va disability benefits and retired pay redux repeal and increas ed survivor benef its do not necessarily promote recruitment and re tention of high quality military personnel they are however costly for the defense departme nt which is required to contribute the actuarially determined cost of future be nefits for current personnel into the military retirement fund in order to captu re the full costs of personnel7 from the pentagons point of view if recruitment and retention falter it would be much cheaper to expand enlistment and reenlistment bonuses as u nder secretary chu commented id like to believe 19yearolds pa id attention to their annuity package but nineteenyearolds want cash to buy pickup truck8 for veterans groups and for many legislators however the question has been whether military retirees and their survivors are being treated equitably in view of their contributions to the nation and congress has approved be nefit increases for reasons qu ite apart from their effects on recruitment and retentionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32877crs9 9 congressional budget office the effects of aging on th costs of

longstanding phenomenon as figure 6 illustrates om funding per troop has increased at an average annual rate of 26 above inflation ever since the end of the korean war many things explain the trend 1 the steadily growing cost of operating and maintaining new generations of more capable and sophisticated weapons 2 efforts to improve the extent and quality of military training 3 efforts to ensure that the quality of life in the military keeps up with the quality of life in the civ ilian sector as the military has shifted to an all volunteer older more commonly married and more skilled force 4 the growth in health care costs for military personnel nd their dependents 5 requirements that the defense department like other federa l agencies and private organizations reduce pollution and clean up earlier contamin ation and 6 modest but steady real growth in the compensation of dod civilian personnel most of whom are paid with om funds the cost of maintaining aging equipment in recent years does not appear to be major factor9 the growth in military personnel costs after 1999 together with ongoing increases in operation and maintenance co sts account for the largest share of the fairly substantial increases in military spending in the first years of the bush administration as table 3 shows under the administration plan the overall department of defense for fy2006 not incl uding war costs is about 45 greater than the fy2000 budget it is about 22 hi gher after adjusting for inflation much of the increase however has gone not to buy or develop new weapons but simply to pay the cost

portion of the budget 77 billi on almost 60 is in the military personnel nd operation and maintenance accounts see table 4 in effect this is the cost of maintainin g the current force without significantly increasing the pace of weapons modernization the remaining 40 of the increase has still permitted substantial increases in weapons procurement and par ticularly in research and development in which the growth rate though from smaller startin g point far outstrippe d any other category of the defense budget in the future howev er assuming that defe nse spending levels off as the administration is projecting increases in personnel and operating accounts may leave relatively little room for new in itiatives in weapons acquisition trade offs between major weapons programs ma become more contentious increased funding for army programs for example may come only at the expense of funding for navy and air force programs in add ition cost growth in major programs will drain funds for other priorities an nvironment in which growing budget allows new priorities to be funded without cutting something is very different from one in which any new initiative may be seen as

office of management and budget bow waves train wrecks and ship wrecks are longterm weapons plans affordable perennial issue in defense policy is whether future weapons acquisition budgets will be large enough to finance all of the programs that are in the pipeline there are couple of va riations on the theme one issue is whether bow wave of acquisition costs will become unsustainable at some point in the future the term bow wave technically refers to the normal funding profile of major program funding is small in the early stages of development climbs during engineering development peaks during full rate procurement and then declines again as production winds down when several weapons programs appear likely to grow in concert then large collective bow wave may appear to be looming in the future second issue is whether projected weapons procurement budgets are large enough to replace aging wea pons as they r each the ends of their nominal service lives 1999 report by the center for stra tegic and international studies csis entitled the coming defense train wreck argued that projected procurement budgets would fall as much as 50 year s hort of the amount needed to maintain modernized force10 that study evoked considerable controversy very different estimates of the amounts needed to finan ce the weapons inventory would result from minor changes in assumed rates of cost growth from one generation of weapons to the next in assumptions about possible ex tensions of nominal service lives with upgrades and in assumptions about whethe r some elements of the force such as

root of the problem in testimony before the senate armed services committee on february 10 2005 the outgoing chief of naval opera tions admiral vernon clark said that costs of the major types of ships had gr own by as much as 400 beyond inflation over the past thirty years that greater capabilities explain only part of the increase that so few ships are being built that overhead costs are spread too narrowly and that the navy cannot afford more than 250 ship s in the long run unless costs are brought under control14 in his prepared statement for the hearing admiral clark said

announced major restructuring of the program wh ich will delay major components for at least two years and increase total program costs by 25 to 30 billion20 year ago estimated procurement costs not

weapons acquisition plans the program cuts imposed in pbd753 in decem ber may very well turn out to be only the first in number of fairly substantial changes needed to keep acquisition costs within bounds what are the implications of changes in military strategy for budget priorities final longterm question is how change s in the international environment and in us perceptions of it will affect defense budget priorities currently the defense department is engaged in cong ressionallymandated q uadrennial defense review qdr which is required to be completed later than february 2006 but which may well be reported before then this qdr is the fifth such reassessment of us defense policy in the postcold war era the others were the base forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32877crs16 23 the white

department and restricted as for official use only but available online at httpwwwfasorgirpagencydodframeworkpdf the briefing was first discussed in thomas ricks shift from tr aditional war seen at pentagon washington post september 3 2004 p 1analysis of 1990 the clinton administra tions bottomup review of 1993 and two previous qdrs in 1997 and 2001 while the 2001 qdr was released after th terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 specifically on september 30 it wa s prepared very early in the bush administration and it did not reflect the full weight of developments in the post911 period significantly it also preceded the bush administrations first statement of the national security strategy of the united states which the white house issued in september 200223 and which among other things called for the united states to act preemptively to prevent potentially unacceptable threats to us security from arising and of course it preceded the wars in afghanistan and iraq so the 20052006 qdr will be the first to reflect fully the lessons the defense department has drawn from its post911 experiences and it will be the first to reflect as well the full imprint of chan ges in pentagon organization and procedures that have been instituted under secret ary of defense donald rumsfeld perhaps the key issue in the qdr is to what extent defense department priorities may be reshaped in view of new assessments of long term challenges to us security over the past yearandahalf or so senior defens officials have laid out what they call new strategic framework that identifies four challenges to us security24 priorities among the four challenges in turn are based on the likelihood that threats will appear and on the perceived vulnera bility of the united states to such dangers traditional challenges from re gional competitors like iraq under saddam are seen as unlikely and us forces are seen as fully capable of coping with them so vulnerability is low irregular challenges of unconven tional warfare are highly likely but the vulnerability of the us homeland is seen as lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32877crs17 25 john t bennett clark qdr likely will endorse shift

but vulnerability is seen as high and catastrophic threats from st ates or nonstate actors with weapons of mass destruction are s een as likely and us vulnerability as high it is possible to read into this list of priorities some farr eaching implications for future us defense programs the fa22 and the navy ships that the pentagon cut from its plan in december 2004 for example might well be classified as forces for traditional challenges an obvious questi on then is whether the reductions imposed by pbd753 are harbingers of deeper contr actions in major programs yet to come for their part navy officials have said th at they are redesigning forces to be more relevant to future challenges so conflict in the littorals ie in coastal areas and the concept of seabasing of forces to project power ashore are being emphasized25 army officials similarly have cast the current wholesale reorganization of the army as an attempt to make the army more deployable in order cope with irregular threats that in dods view are highly likely26 it remains to be seen however how disruptive and catastrophic challenges will be reflected in future budget tradeoffs meanwhile in congress and elsewhere chinas potential to pose military challenge to the united states has become matter of increasing discussion particularly since china passed an antisecession law threatening military action if taiwan declares independence27 recent assessments from the defense department28 and the intelligence community29 have stressed chinese investments in military capabilities including air and naval fo rces that might challenge us naval predominance in east asia30 potential future threat from china may be cited as rationale for more and more substa ntial shares of us defense budgets
