from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to tom wigley wigleyucaredu subject re help date tue 22 sep 2009 110028 0400 cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk caspar ammann ammannucaredu hey tom thanks for checking w on this re moberg yes in fact we phil tim keith caspar etc submitted comment to nature about the problem w the variance scaling used by moberg it can easily be shown to inflate the low frequency variance in synthetic experiments ive attached both the original comment which they judged to be too technical to merit publication and also j climate paper where we discussed the same result see figure 5 and associated discussion re von storch et yes the paper you have in mind is osborn et climate dynamics 06 i only seem to have the preprint though attached please let know if i can be of any further help w an of this mike ps you can delete the uva email addresshavent been there for 4 years on sep 22 2009 at 1031 am tom wigley wrote dear all apologies mike for email address confusion one of them will get you i hope i need some help to finish report ive had to write for epri which is due in few days hence the questions below 1 the moberg paper 2005 nature is used by the skeptics as evidence that most of recent warming could still be natural has anyone published critiquecriticism of this it seems to take this work is fundamentally flawed first variance scaling is crap statistics as it produces results with far less explained variance than normal leastsquares regression second the paper seems to have independent validation third what happens if one just takes his lowfrequency numbered in his fig 1 points and calculates the area average surely this will have much greater variability than the full global mean if noone has done this please let know i can do it very easily myself but perhaps his scaling method circumvents this problem 2 what is the paper of caspars with doug nychka that shows that mcintyre is wrong are there other papers i should seecite in this regard 3 what are the papers that explain what is wrong with the von storch echo simulation i think tim osborn did something on this many thanks for your help tom michael mann professor director earth system science center
