administration after four hundred and fifty years of colonial rule to become special administrative region sar of the peoples republic of china prc macau has technically been chinese sovereign territory since 1979 when china and portuga l established formal diplomatic relations and the two countries decided that macau was chinese territory under portuguese administration on decembe r 20 the prc takes over administration of the territory at prese nt policymakers are examining the us stance towards the futur sar on the b asis of the prcs promise of autonomy for the sar in all respect s except foreign relations and defense granted by the basic law of the macau sar representative bereuter and senator thomas have proposed the uni ted statesmacau policy act of 1999 hr 825 s 1430 patterned after the model of the unite d stateshong kong policy act of 1992 s 1731pl 102383 the two basic laws governing hong kong and macau after their reversion to china are effectively very similar granting largely the same degree of autonomy to the two sars significant differences exist howev er particularly in the commercial and economic foundations of the two terr itories the economy of macau is based mainly on large gambling industry and other leisure sectors general weakness of this economy as well as significant crime problem in macau will present the chinese government with problems very different from those which it faced with hong kong in 1997 in the reversion of macau china may well face economic and socia l problems the potential exists that china may act in such way towards macau that i t could be judged as infringing on the autonomy of the sar or as denying consula r protection to foreign nationals especially in the case of macanese residents who have chosen portuguese citizenship furthermore the way the united states forms it s policy towards macau and hong kong as sa rs may be judged by some observers as reflecting how it w ould relate to taiwan if taiwan were to

significance in the relatio n between the reversions of h ong kong and macau to chinese administration and the possibility of taiwans eventual reunification with china itself as an sar us relations with both sars are likely to be scrutinized as forecasting the united states likely relationship with taiwan if taiwan were ever to reunite with china under the same one country two systems model the purpose of this report is therefore to outline the circumstances of macaus reunification with china raise issues with which the prc must deal when it assumes control over macau and draw implications

there some problems that may occur there and some implications for the united states the background to reunification when macau becomes an sar of mainland china on december 20 1999 it will do so under circumstances similar to the reversion of hong kong to chines sovereignty in 1997 the same one country two systems formula is being followed the joint declarations under which they revert are in many respects similar and the basic laws under which they are to be governed are also similar in many key aspects1 significant differences exist however both in terms of the history of wester

territories and also in terms of their economic bases such that the exam ple of hong kong cannot simply be assumed to hold for the case f macau as well hong kong came under foreign rule much later than macau the postopium war treaty of nanking in 1840 was followed shortly by the addition to hong kong2 of kowloon and the new territories in 1860 and 1898 respectively macau on the other hand was f irst settled by portuguese merchants who began official trade with china in 1553 in 1557 the portuguese acqui red permission for permanent residency and then acquired the facto rights to govern macau beginning in 1573 in 1887 with china weakened by the opium wars po rtugal concluded treaty granting it the right to perpetual j urisdiction over macau for much of its history until the british3 colony of hong kong gained significance in the mid 19 century and came t oth dominate trade in the ar ea macau served as the principal entrepôt for trade between the west and china and japan thus macaus association with portuguese governm ent and culture significantly antedates hong kongs with great britain moreover the prospect of the return of macau to chinese gov ernment was raised much earlier than was the case with hong kong twice portugal offere d to return macau to china in 196667 after the pro china riots in hong ko ng and macau and subsequently in 1974 following the coup détat in portugal during the period when portugal relinquished its othe r coloniessuch as timor mozamb ique and angola in 1974 china in the midst of4 the cultural revolution declined to undertake the administration of macau technical ly macau became chinese sovereign territory in 1979 when portuga l established formal diplomatic relationships with the prc at that time the tw countries agreed that macau was chinese territory although the agreemen t provided for it to remain under portuguese administration 5 in june 1986 after discussio ns concerning the return of hong kong had begun china and portugal began negotiations for the return of macau to chines administration this resulted in the sinoportuguese joint declaration of 1987 in many respects the sinoportuguese joint declaration res embles the sinobritish joint declarati on over the return of hong kong the most significant difference in th e6 context under which the two joint declarations were conceived is that while there was question of which country ought to have sovereignty over macau portugal having been willing to relinquish sovereignty in 1974 sinobritish negotiations had temporarily stalled over the possibility of great britains retaining sovereignty overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30289crs3 asia inc august 1997 statistics for other years availab from the autoridade monetária7 cambial macau amcm for comparison the

administration which was subsequentl rejected the future macaus economy the scale nd basis of the economy compared to the economy of hon g kong that of macau is relatively tiny moreover where hong kong is established internationally both as trading center of east asia and also as financial center macau has become increasingly ma rginal in these respects since the mid 19 centuryth it is only in very limited field viz gambling and leisure that it is of majo r significance throughout the region this small scale may be seen both from the gross domestic product gdp of macau and also its volume of trade with the outsid world shown in table 1 its gdp of 73 billion is roughly the same size as that of angola jordan or bolivia although on per capita basis macaus volume of trade and gdp are relatively high th is is tempered by the small population of the territory which has approximately 450000 inhabitants table 1 gdp and volume of trade for macau millions of us dollars year imports

after december 20 1999 china will face the dilemma of how to preserve the profitability of the gambling industry in order to retain this significant source of revenue gambling and crime there exist three potential complications for china s handling of the economy and of the gambling industry in macau after decembe r 1999 first the monopoly held by stdm over macaus casinos expires in 2001 second extensive organized crime exists in macau both in vari ous macanese criminal organizations and also in volving mainland chinese gangs from guangzhou province these gangs are currently fighting largely to control the vip rooms of macau s casinos thirdly there is the weakness of an economy based on tourism and gambling in the face of volatile asian economic environment where fewer people currently have the disposable income to expend on gambling concerning the issue of the expiration in 2001 of stdms mono poly dating back to 1962 china has th basic options of renewing the monopoly either under stdm although the chairman stanley ho is already 78 years old or under anothe r company or of dispersing control of macau s nine casinos among several companies in 1997 when previously renewing stdms monopoly stanley ho argued to th sinoportuguese joint liaison group that to pre serve gambling as monopoly would be in the governments best interest on the grounds that given macaus relativel small population overall casino profits and hence gaming tax revenues for th government would be maximized this is likely to be relevant when the question10 of renewal comes up in 2001 it cannot be over stated how much gambling under the auspices of stdm contributes to the macau economy according to governmen t statistics in 1996 tourism and gambling contributed 43 of the territorys gd p11 and according to stdm officials over three quarters of that years 81 millio n visitors came primarily for gambling if china were to take measures to reduc e12 gambling macaus economy would be severely weakened the second question concerns the rise of organized crime in macau both as it relates to the economy and also as problem in its own right crime levels in macau have been extremely high since 1997 with gang warfare between two rival macau13 triad organizations the 14k and the sui fong escalating over control over vip rooms in macaus top casinos these vip rooms according to stdm officials

stanley ho in far eastern economic review september 26 199620generate more than half of all gambling revenue s recently criminal elements from14 mainland china particularly the socalled dai huen or big circle gangs fro m guangzhou province have also begun activities in macau the high level tha t organized crime has reached in macau is evidenced not only by the recent period of violence but also by the high profile of some of this violence on november 26 1996 the deputy head of the gambling inspectorate lieutenantcolonel manue l antonio apolinario survived being s hot twice in the head while on march 24 1998 the third in command of the gambling inspectorate francisco xavier pinto d admiral was shot dead near the lisboa hotel there are indications that this level15 of violence in macau has had very negative effect on tourism in the territory including on casino attendance which in turn impacts gdp and governmen t revenue since the upsurge of crime in 19967 in city of some 43000 016 inhabitants nearly 100 murders have occurred the majority triadrelated at th same time tourist arrivals fell to 69 million in 1998 down 16 from 199617 the prc may therefore choose to take tougher stance on crime it has been widely anticipated within macau that return to chine authority will bring greater level of law and order what remains to be seen is whether this can be done without18 major negative effect on casino rev enues which could cripple macaus economy as it is currently structured this might be the result of for example an allout ban on gambling as an anticrime measure it must also be seen whether china can reduce triad crime without incurring criticism for the use of improper measures some19 have expressed the concern for example that pla troops sche duled to be garrisoned in macau after december 20 might be used in an improper lawenforcement role infringing on the judicial autonomy granted macau by the basic law the third problem is the effect of regional financial pr oblems on an economy that depends so heavily on the leisure industry the prc may well encourage th diversification of macaus economy into industries less reliant on the disposable leisure income of the regions inhabitants20 although tourism and gaming comprise t he major proportion of macaus gdp nonetheless foreign trade remains second area in which macau receives revenue this income is currently waning in macaus economy revenue from tourism s exceeded the value of exported goods since 1992 the average rate of growth f which dropped from 10 between 1982 and 1987 to 2 in the following years furthermore employment in the industrial sector has decreased as well while halfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30289crs6 from dsec statistics21 macaus visitors come primarily from hong kong and china

the industrial sector as of 1998 21 in order to provide some boost to the economy major infrastructure project s have been undertaken in recent years in which stdm has also played major role these include the new kaho container port the lotus flower bridge being built to link taipa and coloane two of macaus outlying islands with mountain island in china s cheduled to be finished in november 1999 and the new maca u international airport this is of course significant as an aid to increasing tourism in macau including tourism not strictly relating to gambling especially given the rise in visitors from mainland china projects like the kaho container port however22 can only be explained in the context of desire to boost an exportbased economic sector which is clear ly consistent with the desire to reduce dependency on gambling as source of revenue it is unclear however whether macaus location at the mouth of the pearl river delta and its proximity to the prcs zhuhai special economic zone will ultimately prove to be beneficial to macaus export sector for example garmen t manufacturing once major industry in macau has shifted to chi na and other regions of asia where labor costs are lower what seems evident however is that th e23 current situation is not id eal government revenues from gambling fell 154 to five billion patacas 630 million dollars in 1998 from their 1997 level of 597 billio n patacas 750 million dollars after december 1999 the prc may well take steps24 to increase revenues from gambling probably by attempting to reduce crime in th colony and thus make macau safer place for touristgamblers to visit and also to diversify the economy of macau perhaps by increasing the emphasis on th manufacturing and export sector the political future of macau one country two systems the principle of one country two systems is to be applied to macau after reversion this will allow macau to retain its curren t lifestyle and legal social and economic system s for at least fifty years it was also the basis for the reversion of hong kong this is presumably the approach throug h which prc leaders would contemplate reunification with taiwa n the political future of macau depends on how this princi ple is in fact implemented moreover taiwans willingness to unify w ith china may depend in part on the successful implementation of unification in hong kong and

of macau basic law27 the national p eoples congress authorizes the macau special administrative region to exercise high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive legislative and independent judicial power including that of final adjudication article 5 of macau basic law28 the social ist system and policies shall not be practised in the macau specia l administr ative region and the previous

or local rules and regulations shall contravene the constitution article 6 of prc constitution30 the ba sis of the socialist economic system of the peoples republic of china is socialist public ownership of the means of production namely ownership by the whole people and collective ownership the whole peopleunder other systems as well the following discussion examines how this principl might be implemented in macau and some difficulties that might arise the princip of one country two systems which determines the government of sars in china is prov ided for by article 31 of the prc constitution which states that the state may establish special administrative regions where necessary th systems to be instituted in special administrative re gions shall be prescribed by law enacted by the national peoples congress in the light of specific conditions25 on the face of it and given the basic law of 1 993 established for macau on the basis of the sinoportugues joint declaration of 1987 this allows for the macau sar to remain largely unchanged for fifty years after its reversion to china some chin a26 watchers have however expressed reservations as to whether the basic law i n conjunction with article 31 would be likely to provide any protection for the status quo and the autonomy of macau were china not to wish it as matter of policy first contradictions have b een noted between the basic law especially articles 2 and 5 and article 31 of the prc constitution and other articles of the prc s27 28 1982 constitution especially article 5 establishing the uniformity of the socialis t29 legal system and article 6 establishing the uniformity of the socialist economi c30 system thus it is not clear whether the autonomy granted the sars under article 31 would be legally defensible were the prc to wish for any reason to revoke the judicial or economic autonomy of the macau sar moreover article 18 of the basic law of macau while allowing the sar to be largel exempted from chinese national laws also provides for the central peoples government to apply national laws t macau in case of the declaration of state of war or if turmoil should arise within

of china making decisions which might be considered in some respects to violate hong kongs statutory autonomy see economist march 27 1999 pp 434435sar which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of th government of the region31 the case of how the basic law has been followed in hong kong since 1997 may be enlightening especially in the role played by china in hong kong judicial matters according to article 19 of the hong kong basic law the supreme judicial authority in hong kong is to be held by the hong kong judiciary and c hina is not to intervene in fact several cases have arisen which some observers have noted as instances where china has intervened in hong kong aut onomy these include the trial and execution of the kidnapper cheung tzekeung in main land courts and the trial of li yuhai on32 the mainland for crimes comm itted in the hong kong sar more controversial was the recent reinterpretation of an immigration ruling made by hong kongs highes t court by chinas parliament since theoretical judicial autonomy is granted to the33 macau sar wer china similarly to intervene in macaus judicial matters as might be the case in dealing with triad crime in macau sim ilar controversy might arise after december 2034 further possible source of contention lies in the issue of citizenship an d consular protection for macanese residents unlike the british who only conferred on hong ko ng residents the status of british national overseas or britis h depend ent territories citizen btdc which passport serves only as trave l document and does not confer the right of abode in the uni ted kingdom on its bearer portuguese authorities have offered full portugues citizenship to residents of macau china does not however recognize portugals right to grant consular protection t what it perceives as chinese residents of macau thus to chinese authorities portuguese passport held by an ethnic chinese residen t of the macau sar constitutes only travel document held by someone who is in fact chinese national and does not grant its bearer the consular rights of genuine portuguese citizen after35 macaus reversion chinese authorities could attempt to

delivered without extraditio n proceedings across the border to china where he was tried and sentenced to 17 years in main land prison it is clear then that chinese authorities take very seriousl y37 their claim that ethnic chinese holding foreign passports are subject to chinese law without foreign consular protection and we may speculate that similar cases might arise in the case of macanese residents who hold portuguese passports another potential issue is the role of the pla troops to be stationed in macau after the handove r the last portuguese military garrison was removed from macau in late 1975 in september 1998 chi nese vicepremier qian qichen announced that small pla garrison would be stationed in macau after the handover unilatera l decision made without the consent of lisbon this seems largely to have bee n38 welcomed by residents on the grounds that it would lead to decreased crime in the territory worries have however been raised on two counts firstly by passing a39 law to accommodate the garrison in macau something not discussed in the basi c law beijing is seen as setting precedent for future constitutional amendments second since the new law states t hat the pla troops will exercise the same powers as relevant lawenforcement officials when requested by the governor it has bee n argued that the military garrison might become facto auxiliary police force40 such objections notwithstanding the structure of the basic law and of the post 1999 government of the macau sar allows for the theoretical autonomy of the sar in great number of respects section ii of annex ii of the sinoportuguese join t declaration states that the chie f executive of the sar is to be selected by elections or consultations to be held in macau and appointed by the central people s government the candidate selected in this case edmund ho is man wit h significant business experience wh has held positions of authority under the present administr ation of macau edmund ho was

difficulties for china over the relationship between macau and its islands of taipa an d colonne as well as the establishment of an anticorruptio n organization as suggested in article 60 of the macau basic law additionally she anticipates potent ial difficulties stemming from the failure until now t strengthen the independence of the macau civil service and judiciary which had grown reliant on portuguese expertise and guidance by comparison in 1998 us exports to hong kong were valued at 129235 million dollars43 while imports from hong kong came to 105384 million dol lars the major export of macau is textiles according to statistics from the macau amcm between 1991 and 199 6 approximately 75 percent of macaus exports were textiles cited for example in the south china morning post july 28 199944have significant utonomy if however some of the circumstances discussed above come to be realized in the macau sar then it is possible that the autonomy of the macau sar may be viewed as curtailed by chinese influence in key respects42 implications for usmacau relations macau is less likely to be an iss ue for us policy than hong kong was in 1997 first macaus reversion to china and its associated legislation the united states macau policy act of 1 999 has precedent in the case of hong kong and the united stateshong kong policy act of 1992 secondly macau is of less commercia l relevance to the united states than hong kong given the latter economys greater emphasis on trade and international finance although the united states receives large proportion of macaus exports the

of us relations with macau is unlikely to have significan t implications for the us econo my it may still be relevant to consider how the policy on which congress decides will be viewed in the context of the case of taiwan as has already been discussed it seems likely that if taiwan were ever to conside r uniting with china under ar ticle 31 its assessment of us relations with other sars within china would be factor in its decision finally given the commitment made by the united statesmacau policy act of 1999 to the preservation of the autonomy of and of civil rights within macau such46 potential breaches of civil liberties and autonomy as have been discussed were they to occur in macau would become directly rel evant to us foreign policy this might be particularly pertinent if china were to use the pla to crack down on crime in such way as might be viewed as breach of human rights additionally were the prc to deny co nsular protection to an ethnic chinese portuguese national in macau this might be seen as breach of human rights releva nt to the united statesmacau policy act of 1999
