levitte classified by charg daffaires mark pekala reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary in june 3 meeting with as gordon french nsaequivalent jeandavid levitte previewed the agenda for the potuspresident sarkozy bilat at normandy he noted that sarkozy hoped to use the occasion to announce the appointments of two french general officers to highlevel nato positions on russia levitte expressed concern that moscow was trying to whittle away at the commitments it made during the georgia crisis especially the presence of international monitors he noted that russia was testing the europeans through manufactured crises eg the natural gas crisis as it tried to reassert control over its traditional sphere of influence we need to tell them to be careful because your behavior risks changing the relationship between russia and the west said levitte gordon observed that while it was comparatively easy for the us and france to maintain united front in dealing with russia the same was not true for all of our european partners levitte agreed adding that the germans were somewhat divided over how to respond to president medvedevs proposals he emphasized that russia should pay political price if it refuses to allow international observers to remain in abkhazia and south ossetia turning to nagornokarabakh levitte said there was an opportunity to improve the situation which in turn might facilitate improvement in turkisharmenian relations on iran levitte noted that the french would pass two messages to iranian fm mottaki who was due in paris later that same day first that things will end badly if iran presses forward with its nuclear program second that iran faces historic opportunity with the us that it must not miss end summary participants 2 snf jeandavid levitte was accompanied by damien loras french presidency adviser for the americas eur as gordon was accompanied by cda pekala and poloff notetaker potussarkozy bilat 3 snf levitte began by explaining the french decision not to invite the germans to the june 6 dday commemoration its my fault said levitte who said that president sarkozy had initially been keen to invite german chancellor merkel to participate i pointed out to the president that if merkel came then sarkozy would be obligated to invite the heads of state of italy poland and the czech republic as well moreover all of those leaders would have to be given an opportunity to speak as well which would lengthen an already long ceremony the cases of the uk and canada were exceptional he added because both gordon brown and stephen harper were in such political trouble at home that the survival of their governments was at stake 4 snf as for the substance of the potussarkozy bilat levitte previewed the proposed agenda iran the middle east peace process afghanistanpakistan russia and its neighbors and finally broad discussion of economic issues under the rubric of the g20 eg the economic crisis regulation preparation for the next g8 meeting the price of gasoline and climate issues levitte stressed that sarkozy hoped to announce preferably in person to the press but possibly through written bulletin on june 3 the names of the two french general officers the chiefs of staff of the french air force and navy receiving high level nato commands in norfolk and lisbon russiageorgia 5 snf turning to relations with russia levitte suggested that moscow misconstrued us policy on georgia russian officials seemed to interpret us efforts at improving the atmosphere for talks as license to walk away from commitments that sarkozy had extracted from russia at the height of the georgia crisis in specific russian obstructionism indicates moscows opposition to the presence of international monitors in georgia and the breakaway territories while levitte conceded that western relations with russia should not hinge solely on the georgian question he nevertheless pointed to the continued need for firm united western front he noted that russia was testing the europeans through manufactured crises eg the natural gas crisis as it tried to reassert control over its traditional sphere of influence we need to tell them to be careful paris 00000762 002 of 003 because your behavior risks changing the relationship between russia and the west said levitte gordon agreed that useu could not afford to be naive in engaging with russia and stressed the need for the us and europe to draw the same red lines in dealing with moscow he observed that while it was comparatively easy for the us and france to maintain united front the same was not true for all of our european partners levitte concurred he added that the germans were somewhat divided over how to respond to president medvedevs proposals alluding to the differences between fm steinmeier and chancellor merkel levitte said its as if they have two foreign policies he emphasized that russia should pay political price if it refuses to allow international observers eg unomig and osce to remain present in abkhazia and south ossetia namely increased western assistance to georgia 6 snf levitte returned to the question of international observers saying that the west should push russia hard in new york and geneva to let the observers stay they the russians will accept it if we stay strong levitte noted adding that the russians must understand that they will pay price for changing the status quo 7 snf on nato expansion levitte and gordon discussed the relative merits of giving membership action plans map to other balkan countries but not to georgia and ukraine levitte suggested that the russians would see such policy as gift yet he agreed that nato needed to decide whether to continue with map for ukraine and georgia or find an alternative mechanism levitte proposed eliminating the map program altogether as each country arrives at membership through its own unique path anyway nagornokarabakh 8 snf levitte said he saw historic opportunity to make progress on nagornokarabakh and although the two are not formally linked relations between turkey and armenia gordon agreed that progress between the latter two was unlikely without movement on nagornokarabakh reality the armenians understood but had difficulty accepting levitte suggested that the us and france remain in contact on this issue with an eye toward possible meeting on the margins of the informal ministerial at corfu on the question of turkeys admission to the eu levitte said that the turks themselves had signaled that the important thing was for the process to continue levitte said the french fully agreed since the eu membership criteria served as an engine for modernizing turkey iran 9 snf as for the june 3 visit of iranian fm mottaki to paris levitte said that mottaki would be received at the elysee later that same afternoon levitte portrayed mottakis visit as the result of iranian infighting after iranian president ahmadinejad took umbrage that ali akbar velayati supreme leader khameneis diplomatic advisor had been received in the past by sarkozy he noted that the french had already postponed mottakis visit once as result of ahmadinejads antisemitic rant at the durban ii conference in geneva which had prompted the french ambassador and other eu representatives to walk out of the session in protest levitte predicted that mottaki would have nothing meaningful to say whereas the french would deliver two messages to the iranians first that things will end badly if iran presses forward with its nuclear program second that iran faces historic opportunity with the us that it must not miss levitte pledged that france would remain the toughest us ally when it came to imposing sanctions on iran adding that the french had illusions about how difficult it would be to get the russians and chinese to support tougher measures he suggested that october would be the time to begin drumming up international support for new sanctions and acknowledged that the russians would likely try to extract concessions from the west on georgia and missile defense in exchange cubagtmo 10 snf levitte said that the new administrations policy on cuba was great how can we help asked levitte who noted that sarkozy would travel to the caribbean in late june he added that former french culture minister jack lang was serving as sarkozys point man on cuba and met with raul castro during recent visit to havana your openhanded paris 00000762 003 of 003 policy is producing some interesting movement inside the regime levitte summarized 11 snf turning to the fate of the guantanamo gtmo detainees levitte said that frances acceptance of first gtmo returnee was not intended to be one time gesture to the contrary the french saw it as the beginning of process and they were currently evaluating other candidates as well however france would not accept any detainees who posed threat to french security and would only consider taking those with legitimate tie to france levitte noted that congressional opposition to the presidents plan to close gtmo had given french authorities less room for maneuver on this subject as the french public wondered why france should accept detainees who were too dangerous to be transferred to the united states 12 u this cable has been cleared by eur as philip h gordon pekala
