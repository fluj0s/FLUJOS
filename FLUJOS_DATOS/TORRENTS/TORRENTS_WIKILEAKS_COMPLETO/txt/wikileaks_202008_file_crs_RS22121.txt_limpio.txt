gsa 27 other federal agencies have independent landholding and leasing authorities that enable them to acquire or construct specific types of buildings4 gsa is responsible for the design and construction of its buildings and for alterations and repairs to existing facilities one of its primary goals has always been to assure the physical safety of federal employees who work in and the private citizens who visit governmentowned or leased buildings however the federal government had formally established building security standards for either federally owned or leased buildings when the april 1995 domestic terrorist bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building occurred in oklahoma city ok5 the oklahoma city bombing brought new awareness to the potential for violent acts directed at federal buildings as symbolic attacks against the federal government as whole the day following the april 19 1995 bombing president william clinton directed the department of justice doj to assess the vulnerability of federal facilities to acts of terrorism or violence and to develop recommendations for minimum security standards6 because of its expertise in federal courts security the us marshals service httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22121 usms coordinated two working groups to accomplish these tasks standards committee and profile committee the standards committee composed of security specialists and representatives from gsa the federal bureau of investigation the us secret service the social security administration and the departments of defense and state identified and evaluated the various types of security measures that could be used to strengthen potential vulnerabilities the committee compiled list of proposed minimum standards pertaining to secure perimeter buffer zones the security of entrances and exits and related access procedures the identification and admittance of employees and visitors garage and vehicle service entrances the location of day care centers and the use of closedcircuit television monitoring because of the differences among federal buildings and their related security issues the standards committee categorized federal facilities into five different levels with corresponding security standards based on factors such as building size agency mission and function tenant population and volume of public access level i building is defined as having not more than 2500 square feet sq ft of space with 10 or fewer federal employees and little public access level ii building contains between 2500 to 80000 sq ft and has between 11 and 150 federal employees engaged in routine activities with moderate level of public access an example of level ii building is the social security administration office in dorado co level iii

housing between 151 and 450 federal employees with moderate to high volume of public access level iii facilities may house several federal tenants law enforcement agencies or courtrelated or archival agencies level iv facilities are categorized as occupying more than 150000 sq ft of space and housing more than 450 federal employees these level iv facilities are defined as having high volume public contact and include federal courthouses with highrisk court chambers judicial offices and buildings that house highly sensitive government records level v facilities are similar to level iv buildings in size and numbers of federal employees however the missions of level v facilities are considered critical to national security the central intelligence agency headquarters and the pentagon for example are both classified as level v for security purposes the profile committee composed of usms deputies and gsa security specialists conducted inspections at more than 1200 federal facilities to obtain security data on buildings for use in upgrading existing conditions to comply with the proposed minimum standards sixty days later the working groups findings and recommendations were published in june 1995 report entitled vulnerability assessment of federal facilities7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22121 security standards and design criteria the publication of the 1995 vulnerability assessment report was significant in that it represented the first time that broad security standards were applied to federal facilities and they are still in effect in conjunction with publication of the report president clinton directed all executive branch agencies to begin immediately upgrading their facilities to meet the recommended minimum security standards to the extent possible within funding limitations based on the doj recommendations he also required gsa to establish building security committees for all gsa facilities and called upon other landholding agencies to establish programs for upgrading their facilities to appropriate minimum security standards8 four months later on october 19 1995 president clinton issued eo 12977 which established permanent interagency security committee isc within the executive branch to address continuing governmentwide security for federal facilities9 chaired by the gsa administrator the isc was composed of representatives from each of the executive branch agencies the office of management and budget the environmental protection agency and the central intelligence agency other members included the following individuals or their

federal officials appointed by the president the isc was also authorized to consult with other parties including the administrative office of the us courts in order to perform its duties section 5 of eo 12977 required the isc to develop and evaluate existing security policies and to take necessary actions to enhance the quality of security and protection for federal facilities these actions might include encouraging agencies with security responsibilities to share securityrelated intelligence in timely manner evaluating technology and information systems to facilitate costeffective security upgrades developing longterm construction standards for highrisk facilities that require blast resistant structures or have other specialized security requirements evaluating standards for the location and security of day care centers in federal facilities and assisting the gsa administrator in creating and maintaining centralized security database of all federal facilities while the 1995 vulnerability assessment report provided guidance for overall security standards for existing facilities it did not provide criteria for the design and construction of new federal buildings in january 1997 gsa completed its first draft of document entitled gsa security criteria which was revised and issued on october 8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22121 1997 to establish design standards for the protection of federal employees in civilian facilities11 the gsa security document attempted to integrate security standards throughout all functional and design phases of the building process including site and interior space planning as well as structural and electrical design elements building upon gsas 1997 draft security criteria the members of the isc established series of working groups that addressed new technology developments cost considerations the experience of architects and builders in applying gsas design criteria and the need to balance security standards with public access to federal buildings in may 2001 the isc issued its security design criteria for new federal office buildings and major modernization projects based on the five security levels for federal facilities12 new isc security requirements for future construction projects included the use of glazing protection for windows the establishment of distances that buildings should be set back from the street the control of vehicular access to the buildings and the location and securing of air intakes in july 2001 the isc issued second product for federal agencies to implement that set forth minimum standards for federal building access procedures two draft documents one that addressed entry security technology and the second which pertained to preparedness for nuclear biological and chemical

httpwwwocagsagov crs5 the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center heightened concerns about the vulnerability of federal buildings to violence or bombing attacks in response to these events the isc issued revised procedures to respond to potential vehicle bomb attacks by recommending that new federal buildings be constructed at minimum distance of between 20 to 50 feet from the nearest perimeter barrier depending upon the security level13 even though the isc successfully completed its security design criteria and related draft documents 2002 general accounting office gao14 report found that the committee had made little progress in other mandated responsibilities although the isc had established 13 working groups since 1995 only two of the groups were still active as of july 2002 also while gao reported that the isc was successfully disseminating security information to member agencies it also found that the groups effectiveness was hindered by gsas lack of aggressive leadership and support in that the agency failed to issue operating procedures and did not provide sufficient staff support and funding gsa was also unable to provide any documention indicating that the agency or the isc had actually monitored agency compliance with the iscs security recommendations15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22121 recent developments congressional enactment of the homeland security act16 in 2002 and the associated creation of the department of homeland security centralized the federal governments efforts to respond to terrorism including physical security for federal facilities on february 28 2003 the chairmanship of the isc was transferred from the gsa administrator to the secretary of homeland security and representative from gsa was added to the iscs membership17 within dhs the chairmanship of the isc was subsequently delegated to the director of the federal protective service in january 200418 given the challenges that the isc faces to successfully integrate security initiatives encompassing diverse agency needs gao recommended in september 2004 that dhs direct the isc to develop plan that identifies resource needs

dhs is also helping the isc meet its requirement to create and maintain centralized security database of all existing federal facilities the isc issued updated security standards for leased facilities in july 2003 as well as new recommendations to member agencies pertaining to the use of escape hoods the updated version of the isc security design criteria for new federal office buildings and major modernization projects was approved by concurrence of the isc membership on september 29 2004 in addition to its duties to coordinate federal facility security efforts and to develop security standards for the construction of new federal facilities the isc has been assigned responsibilities to review federal agencies physical security plans homeland security presidential directivehspd7 issued on december 17 2003 established requirements for federal agencies to identify and prioritize united states critical infrastructure and key resources and to protect them from terrorist attacks and assigned implementation responsibilities to dhs20 in july 2004 the isc was designated to oversee and review each agencys physical security plan pertaining to protection of the nations infrastructure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22121 and key resources according to gao the iscs successful completion of these new responsibilities relating to homeland security issues would represent major step toward carrying out its existing duties pertaining to compliance and oversight21 fundamental isc objective is to improve the management of security programs by establishing policies and minimum standards for security operations the successful integration of the federal governments facility protection standards is formidable challenge because it involves diverse agencies with varying perspectives on security issues on december 13 2006 the isc issued its 20072008 action plan which included operational procedures for identifying and applying updated security technologies22 current isc projects include the updating of the 1995 vulnerability assessment report to make the document more specific to agencies missions and strategic plans the isc membership is also striving for better formulation of security policies and directives to gain more consensus and compliance within the federal community through greater accountability and oversight the isc hopes to provide one leadership
