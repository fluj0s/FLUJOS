precise definition exists for the role of mber upon election to congress each new member is responsible for deve loping an approach to his or her job that serves wide range of roles and responsibilities one obser ver of congress notes that the first job of member is to come to grips with the dimensions of thei r role and develop personal approach to their tasks given the many challenges the overall conclusion is readily apparent the key to effectiveness in congress is the ability to organize well within framework of carefully selected priorities it is not possible however to construct grand master plan such that priorities and the time devoted to each will neatly mesh for legislative life is subject to sudden and numerous complications5 observers note that after identifying and organizing priorities member typically carries out some of the resulting duties personally and delegates others to congressional staff who act on his or her be half the staff may work in the members individual office on committees to which the member is assigned in offices connected to leadership posts the member may hold and to the separate political and reelection operations the memb er may maintain in th is understanding the member sets broad policies to fulfill his or her duties and the appropriate staff act to carry them out the distribution of responsib ility will vary according to the preferences and priorities of the member at the center of the effort nevertheless the work carried out by staff is typically attr ibuted to the effort of the member6 many scholars of congress see thes member choices and delegation arrangements as dependent in part on thei r goals generally these observers suggest that members pursue three primary goal s making good public policy securing influence within congress and gaining r eelection the relative priority member may assign to these goals can affect wide range of choices regarding congressional career including 1 the empha

surveys suggest that the roles and duties of member of congress can be identified in part as an outgrowth of congressional and public expectations th congressional role s may be described by focusing on some of the underlying ta sks typically required to carry them out because some of the duties are complex and some of the unde rlying tasks often overlap some of the roles may overlap the roles desc ribed below are derived from congressional duties mentioned in the constitution responses to the house surveys of members and the general public and scholarly studies representation broadly system of representative government assumes that the will of the people is consulted and accommodated when making public policies that affect them consequently representational activity is present in all of the roles of member of congress representational activity is seen in the legislative process constituent service oversight and investigation dutie s that members carry out in congress members are elected to represent the interests of the people in their congressional district or state in addition they repr esent regional and nationa l interests in matters which might come before congress on the local level members of the h ouse represent congressional districts of populations ranging approximate ly from 500000 to 900000 constituents12 senators represent states that range in population from 509000 wyoming to more than 361 million california13 in the nations capital members serve as advocates for the views and needs of their constituents as well as stewards of national interests representational work may involve legisl ative activity such as analyzing the provisions of proposed legislation for thei r potential impact on the area represented or constituent service activity such as assisting individuals local governments and organizations in obtaining fe deral grants and benefits styles of representation differ some members might view themselves as responding to

members mind constituent views however may vary in intensity from issue to issue or fall on several sides of an issue and the member would typically take in to account opinions from other sources as well consequently most members typically balance or reconcile these competing viewpoints with their own judgement when casting their votes providing constituent service or conducting oversight14 another facet of representation invol ves presenting view of government activity to constituents and the broader american public members of congress regularly draw attention to policy issues and federal government activities in order to educate constituents and other citizens and to encourage more robust citizen participation in public affairs this educational function is typically performed through newsletters and special mailings sent to residents in the district or state or through variety of media outlets wh ich may include member website and appearances and interviews on local television and radio programs legislation in developing and debatin g legislative proposals mbers may take different approaches to learn how best to represent the interests of their district or state together with the interests of the nation this may require iden tifying local national and international issues or problems which need legisl ative action and proposing or supporting legislation which addresses them throughout the legislative process members of congress routinely attend committee hearings and briefings hold meetings and conversations with executiv branch officials and with lobbyists representing various interested groups and have discussions with congressional colleagues in addition many members receive staff briefings based on broad range of sources including congressional support agencies local and national media outlets specialized policyor iented literature and backgr ound material on legislative issues among others an important venue for congressional activities is the committee through which much of the work of congress is organized committees typically are the first place in which legislative policy proposals receive substantive consideration members of congress are assigned to number of committees and subcommittees simultaneously and are expected to develop issue expertise in the policy areas that come before these panels typically each senator is assigned to three committees and at least eight subcommittees with the exception of members who serve on committees that their party has designated as exclusive each representative is typically assigned to twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33686crs8 15 discussions of the debate and informal negotiating process in congress can be found in joseph bessette deliberation in american lawmaking

congressional committees on matters of interest to their district or state or on matters in which the member has developed expertise in addition to these duties senate committee membership involves review of executive and judicial nominations and may include consider ation of treaties some members generally those with more seniority also participate in conference committees conference co mmittees are convened to work out differences when the house and senate pass different versions of the same bill members of conference committees participate in the final resolution of policy disputes legislativeexecutive bargaini ng and significant policy decisions members generally participate in floor debate most fully when measures of importance to their home distri ct or state are involved or when matters reported from their legislative committees are under consideration floor activity might include preparing statements conducting research to defend or deter provisions of bill and offering amendments it may also mean debating other members in an effort to persuade the undecided and engaging in extensive informal political negotiations to advance legislative goals15 constituency service the constituency service role is closely related to the representative and educational roles of member of congress frequently when constituents or local firms or organizations need assistance from the federal government they contact their representative or senators members th act as representatives ombudsmen or facilitators and sometime s as advocates in discussions with the federal government the constituency service role may be high ly varied and invol ve several activities provided to individual constituents including outreach in which members introduce themselves and inform constituents of

problems may need to be addressed through formal oversight or legislation18 oversight and investigation in addition to its legislative respons ibilities congress is responsible for seeing that the laws are administered according to congressional intent while some members receive feedback on the success of public policies through constituency service and the experiences of constituents who seek casework assistance most of the oversight and investigation duties of members are carried out through committees committees and members can review the actions taken and regulations formulated by departments and agencies through hearings studies and informal communication with agencies and thos affected by program or policy oversight and investigation can take several forms in addition to casework activity the process of authorizing and appropriating funds for executive branch departments and agencies in committee hearings also affords members and committees the opportunity to review the ad equacy of those agencies organization operations and programs i nvestigatory hearings are of ten conducted in response to an emerging crisis or scandal at vari ous points in the oversight and investigative process of congress individual members can participate in the proceedings for example by questioning executive branch leaders or reporting the experiences constituents have had with particular programs or agencies19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33686crs10 20 in addition senators on the appropriate committees are sometimes asked to advise on the terms of treaty as it is being negotiate

the roles described can be found am ong the duties performed by any senator or representative the degree to which each is carried out differs among members as they pursue the common goals of seeking reelection building influence in congress and making good public policy each memb er may also emphasize different duties during different stages of his or her car eer as other conditions of the members situation change for example some may focus on outreach constituent service and other state or district activ ity others may focus on developing influence in their chamber by developing policy expertise or advancing specific legislation member however is likely to focus on any one role or duty at the exclusion of another because the extent to which member successfully manages all of those roles is the basis on which his or her c onstituents may judge the members success
