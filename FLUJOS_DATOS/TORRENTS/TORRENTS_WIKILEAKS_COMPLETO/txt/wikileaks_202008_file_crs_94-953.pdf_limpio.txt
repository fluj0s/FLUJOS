social security act permanently authorizes the ssbg as capped entitlement to states in other words states are entitled to their share according to formula of nationwide funding ceiling or cap which is specified in the statute although social services for certain welfare recipients have been authorized under various titles of the social security act since 1956 the ssbg in its current form was created in 1981 pl 9735 special ssbg program for enterprise communities and empowerment zones was authorized in 1993 pl 10366 but is not currently funded at the federal level the ssbg is administered by the department of health and human services hhs and legislation amending title xx is reported by the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561

12 billion in funding for the ssbg in fy2009 and an elimination of the ssbg in fy2010 the administration contends that the grants flexibility and lack of state reporting requirements make it difficult to measure its performance and that the broad array of services funded through the ssbg often overlap with other federal programs g8g27g344g342g342g350g561g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the fy2008 appropriations process extended almost full quarter into the fiscal year with continuing resolutions providing temporary funding during the time it took the house senate and president to come to agreement on bill ultimately the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 on december 26 2007 which includes 17 billion for the ssbg 500 million more than the presidents fy2008 request and maintains states authority to transfer up to 10 of their tanf block grants to the ssbg

remainder of fy2007 and maintaining regular ssbg funding at 17 billion this reflected the same amount approved earlier in 2006 by the house and senate appropriations committees hr 5647 and s 3708 respectively the presidents budget for fy2007 proposed to provide 12 billion for the ssbg 500 million decrease from the fy2006 appropriation the administration contended that while ssbg provides state flexibility as the congress intended it fails to ensure that funds are directed towards activities that achieve results in addition it argued that the purposes of ssbg overlap substantially with other categorical and flexible federal social service programs following three continuing resolutions bill hr 3010 making fy2006 appropriations for the departments of labor hhs and education was signed into law pl 109149 on december 30 2005 it included 17 billion for ssbg and maintained states authority to transfer up to 10 of their tanf block grants to the ssbg both the funding and transfer provisions

hhs appropriations bill the fy2006 defense appropriations act pl 109 148 included ssbg funding in the amount of 550 million for use in covering expenses related to the consequences of the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005 the defense appropriations act expanded the potential services for which the additional 550 million could be used to include health services including mental health services and for repair renovation and construction of health facilities factors used to allocate these supplemental funds included the number of fema registrants from hurricanes katrina rita and wilma as well as the percentage of states poor population all states received portion of the funding with louisiana 221 million mississippi 128 million texas 88 million florida 54 million and alabama 28 million receiving the bulk the allocations were announced by hhs in february 8 2006 press release see httpwwwhhsgovnewspress2006pres20060208ahtml on may 25 2007 an fy2007 supplemental appropriations act was signed into law extending the availability of these funds for expenditure through fy2009 according to hhs balance of approximately 135 million remains unspent as of june 4 2008 table 1 shows ssbg funding levels from 1985 on including the high of 28 billion which was provided annually from fy1991fy1995 and the more recent lower level of 17 billion although 28 billion was the originally author ized entitlement ceiling for fy1996 congress reduced funding to 238 billion in that year welfare reform legislation pl 104193 subsequently set the annual ssbg entitlement ceiling at 238 billion in each of fiscal years 1997 through 2002 under the welfare reform law the ceiling was scheduled to return to permanent level of 28 billion in fy2003 after welfare reform was enacted congress passed an appropriations measure for fy1997 pl 104208 that contained 25 billion for the ssbg exceeding the ceiling established in the welfare reform law for fy1998 president clinton requested that the amount authorized by welfare reform 238 billion be appropriated however congress approved an fy1998 appropriations bill pl 10578 containing 2299 billion for the ssbg the senate appropriations committee explained the reduction by stating that funding is provided for social services through other federal programs srept 10558 the house appropriations committee expressed concern that hhs lacks information on the effectiveness of ssbgfunded activities hrept 105205 in 1998 the transportation equity act tea p l 105178 permanently reduced the ssbg entitlement ceiling to 17 billion beginning in fy2001 however the entitlement ceiling has not always reflected the actual appropriation for example the 1725 billion appropriation level for fy2001 hr 4577 exceeded the 17 billion ceiling by 25 million in addition tea provision would have limited the ability of states to transfer tanf funds into ssbg beginning in fy2001 however this was superseded by the fy 2001 consolidated appropriations act hr 4577 table 1 shows ssbg

presented to the president maintained the 10 transfer authority for fy2002 earlier the house had passed its version of laborhhsed appropriations bill hr 3061 proposing to main tain the 10 transfer authority while the senates amended version proposed 57 transfer level the senate appropriations committee had recommended 59 transfer authority level in s 1536 however the full senate in passing an
