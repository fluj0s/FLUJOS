r2 and r3 urgent data lecture given on 5 march 1963 okay here we are on the 5th of march ad 13 and how are all you today we have lecture here saint hill special briefing course and we have bit of news bit of news i was talking to the z unit today i mean part of the z unit has been relegated to the w unit to learn how to do z unit you know and i was talking to the z unit today and theythey didnt really think that you know you get clearthe part that was relegated to the w feeling good because they hadnt had any auditing you know that kind of an approach that sort of nonsense anywayanyway the people in v unit of course are the ones that are getting clear and i suppose thats as it should be the ones that are supposed to get clear you see are in zed unit so the ones in v unit get clear its this type of dispersal that makes this universe interesting and out of the full z unit seven have had goals found six with goals found five of these last are on w unit at presence present and three goals have come out of the v unit thats very very recent figures and that of course refers to just the last few weeks im sure now some of course have come in here with their goals found but doubtful and not checked out so were doing all right were doing all right and i had an interesting remark from sydney which is trying to slide these days into sydney harbor and i had an interesting remark from there that the two auditors that were keeping their head above water and keeping things going and doing very well were of course two auditors who had had their goals found so it makes considerable difference to person to have had his goal found and that of course tells you why the five auditors are from z unit who ought to be in z unit getting clear who havent had their goals found are in w unit at present the gist of this is its awfully easy to get clear these days all you got to do is know how to audit and thats the only thing you have to know how to do and the better you can audit the more probable it is youll have your goal found and thats for sure now i have been taking very very good look at the gpm and ive been taking very very good look at items ive been taking very good look at these various things and i have considerable reality on what the gpm looks like and what the gpm is all about and there are lot of things to know about the gpm but one of the things to know about it is that you can handle it and the other thing to know about it is that its built with tremendous mathematical precision the darnedest mathematical precision you ever wanted to have anything to do with but because it is built exactly as thetan would not asisyou understand thisbecause it is built as thetan would not asis therefore its impossible to confront that is to say the thetan never has confronted it and therefore youre busy flinching but i dont think you are flinching and as i told another unit today its the thetan has trouble confronting it and its an awfully good thing that im not thetan i think thats very fortunate fortunate thats joke thats joke theres person there in the front row that didnt think that was joke they wondered well what is he then well im now you understand that if atheres certain frequency of things that thetan wouldnt naturally see then hed pack one of these things along and hed just add to and add to and add to he runs along on different set of values ill give you an idea of the way one of the things happen this is how one of the things happenone of the things that happen he gets an idea that total meditation and attacking nothing will get him through well thats an interesting idea so you realize that he is opposing opposing things see he cant win he develops this terrific philosophy you see he just knocks his brains out you know walks all over the himalayas climbs mount everest with one fingernail and does all this kind of thing sits there and regards his navel and makes himself petty officer and the whole thing then boils down to the fact that his supermeditation his superpeacefulness his supersuperness has all added up to the fact that he is opposing things thats quite interesting isnt it well that takes that type of philosophy in order to back up one of these banks and so forth so somebody somebody has agreed that he will get through the universe if he opposes nothing and therefore he is opposing things well i think thats marvelous because of course what is he doing hes stacking himself up beautiful gpm if he wont oppose anything hes drawing back from them isnt he well hes still going to have an outflow hes still going to oppose things hes still going to get opposed hes still going to get into groupers hes still going to get things messed up most gorgeously so everything hes tried to think of as solution to the goals problems mass has added to more gpm and it all comes down to the original postulate that any cure eventually has to be cured and the gpms solutions were of course the compounded cures of how you get along for life see the cures of the problems of life became the problems of the gpm its very funny you find some fellow who cant drink he cant drink one of the reasons he cant drink is because it develops terrific backache every time he takes drink he has backache all right whats this well this is gpm action of course but were speaking about drink all right he cant drink because drink gives him backache obviously at one time or another then drink was the cure for backache but now taking drink gives one backache thats interesting isnt it so all solutions result in new problems and the composite of this little axiom all by itself becomes the gpm and the only odd part of it is is the frequency is so constant and the difficulties are so constant but then all thetans here at this time in this place must have something in common or they wouldnt be in this time stream and the thing they have in common is the composition of the bank and the first ten axioms they have these desperately in common actually have all fiftyfive in common fifty six but that set of axioms going full out based on particularly axiom one and two and three given those and recognizing that all solution ever does is develop new problems you get of course the gpm and because people of this same size and stature and length of time on the track are here why you get the same order of frequency so theyve never confronted these problems theyve never confronted these oppositions and theyve developed certain series of agreements about these oppositions at various times and places which winds up in the goals problem mass and it winds up with remarkable similarity i think consider its quite wonderful take the twentyfive rule go twentyfive beyond your last rr or rs yeah well the other day we tried to break that rule we said well look were getting into the second gpm beginning of the third gpmi mean well heavens the pc is putting the rr on the list as item three well why not just pick these things up see its the third item he puts on the list well why not pick these things up and well compromise by going only twelve beyond haha and we goofed and goofed and got some wrong items and things went backwards and went back and checked it over and do you know that if the twentyfive rule had been insisted on and continued every one of those goofs would have been spared isnt that interesting in other words the incomplete list would have been complete list if the twentyfive rule had been obeyed there was never twentyfive items between rrs on continued list when we continued list we never had twentyfive items to the next rryou understand that although you can continue almost any list and get new item thats peculiarity of routine 3 you canif you got slight tick left on your source list or something as you go back and inspect it you already have found an item off the source list and used it well you continue the list which you already did and youll get couple of new rrs or something like that and then youll get twentyfive to blank see youve had twentyfive but then youre asking for new item you can always pick up new item off of any old item that ticks well now you darent do this in routine 2 now routine 2 is the perimeter of the bank this is the technology of the gpms perimeter routine 2 handles the oddities and frequency of lock items which are simply locked up on the actual central items of the gpm you can relieve these and get away with it which is quite interesting in actual fact routine 3m is easier to do than routine 212 because there is one thing you can do with 3m that you cannot do with 212 theres little difference in this the frequency is different youve always got to go fifty items beyond the last rr and rs and you remember last week i was telling you about this staff member down here this staff member that said well wethey should be relegated to prepchecking in their staff auditing becausebecause after all theyitwere in an administrative position couldnt be expected to be professional auditors well you remember i told you something about that this is in confidence of course i wouldnt want them to hear about this but said this see and i asked them just couple of days ago i said now on that pc youre auditing you found this ri and are completing the package and so forth in this routine 2 did you go fifty items beyond and he says well well not really i guess so idididiiso on i said did you count them well i just went few beyond and so forth well what do you know they accidentally found the item he hadnt counted them he didnt think it was necessary to count the items so youd say that the difference between professional auditor and somebody who was merely an administrative scientologist the difference the basic difference is that the professional would count the number of items and he wouldnt make any mistakes and the fellow who wasnt you see he wouldnt count the items you see actually i dont know how look theres just certain targets to be attacked you see here youve got bank perimeter youve got this big bank perimeter one kind or another and then youve got the core of the bank and heres the core of the bank and it obeys very precise laws and in auditing them youll never find any variation in these laws if you do it right see and if you do it right simply means its just following the rules all right heres this core and then its got lot of lock items around on the outside of this thing and in routine 2 you hit the lock items of the first gpm inevitably thats what they are theyre lock items and that gives you an rs when you hit the core it gives you rocket read sometimes you can get brokenbacked rocket read where it goes pssww sswww well its rocket read which at the drop of an eyelash would turn into an rs and you actually can drill some rses and cause them to turn into rrs well thats an item thats out here that is core item but is out on the edge of the fringe thats perfectly all right do that its still rocket reading item but it shows up as an rs and then you put in the big mid ruds in on it and what have you got youve got rocket reading item well about halfway between these two things youll get brokenbacked rocket read and it goes psswwssww and it goes halfwayit doesnt know whether to slam or rocket read actually youll sometimes get half slam somebody out in angeles thought that if first slash of rock slam up went pssw up like that then that was an oppterm and first and if rocket read went down pssww like that then well that was terminal unfortunately its more difficult than that and also unfortunately there are upflashing rocket reads all rocket reads are in the direction of fall they always go to the right and if anything starts up pssww suddenly like that its just the first slash of an rs and you drill it little bit and itll either disappear or become real rs i wish there was something that did that but unfortunately terminal and oppterm look quite alike anyway to go back on this other thing you always have fifty items beyond well why is that well youre not in as fundamental an action but let tell you something let melet tell you something thats quite important to you routine 2 has something about it that is very very dynamity if you take source list or actually an ri list and you pull an itemits less an ri list but its certainly source listand you pull an item out of that and you use it and then you decide that you didnt get anything off of that or it was wrong maybe it was wrong maybe it wasnt the last item maybe the list wasnt complete but youve pulled that rs item off there and youve monkeyed with it little bit and you decide that isnt it and then you continue that same list youll shut off the rs and rr of the pc and if its not untangled youve left him for the next two hundred trillion you got it now thats pretty pretty horrible isnt it we learned that the hard way we did it i did it and i traced it back to find out what this is oddly enough theres something that goes along with this that well call the sad effect the pc has been sad since that is the sad effect the sad effect actually comes from an overwhelm or arc break but this is something is goofed and the pcs had an r2 r3 arc break and then this has been overwhelmed and the pc goes into sadness but you cant find an rs on this pc you cant find an rr you cant find goal you cant find anything you see nothing reads well you go back and you look for list on which something was picked off and then the list was continued neglecting the thing that was picked off now were not interested in whether it was neglected were not interested in whether it was continued or which of these things caused the rs and rr to turn off we dont care whether it was the neglect of the item or the continuance of the list you understand but youre liable to turn the rs and rr off of that pc and nobody will be able to get an rs or rr on in that pc and they we goofed when i issued 212a i had 212 212 was almost perfect i said youd better continue those source lists so that they were complete because we were getting such wild variations on the rules and on every one of those source lists where an item was grabbed prematurely and the pc had it as an item and something was done with the item and then it was abandoned and then the auditor went back and continued that list as in 212a to get complete list some of those rses and rrs diminished or shut off well thats very sad thing 212a as an improvement on 212 is symptom it is symptom its case of my old enemy alexander youve heard of him iskander the great of the two horns chesty chap probably not bad fellow but he went out to injia and of course western civilization western history doesnt realize he conquered india and settled it and gave it an administration that the greek administration of india lasted hewell historys forgotten that they like to tell you that because theyre downgrading such chapsthat he went out there and he got as far as he could go and turned around and came home about all we know about this because its asiatic and we have never been interested in asiatic history was that he said he had more worlds to conquer well even though he was an old enemy of mine im afraid i have to quote him so far as processing as you have known it is concerned lets look at this symptom we had 212 1 got some learninglearned some listing rules out of 212a patted up the listing rules just little bit found out it was always the last rs on aon complete list and so dispensed with nulling but in actual fact beside that discovery of the frequency of the list and on source list it can be any place on the list you understand but on an oppose ri list its always the last rs and wewe were at that point looking at more worlds to conquer as far as ordinary auditing is concerned in other words fantastic thing has happened here we had more perfect process in 212 than in 212a isnt that interesting i find it very interesting i did tremendous amount of research on 212 1 knew about what 212 was all about and just because i discovered the frequency of listing applied the frequency of listing in the gpm by the way and then wentby doing 212a and discovering the frequency of listing on the 2 routine 2 list and applied it to the gpm and found out it was almost the same but that there was frequency of listing aside from thatbeing able to spot itthere wasnt even an improvement there was worsening theres time to come theres time when you are baking cake when you have finished adding ingredients and you add one more cup of flour and one more pint of cloves and one more keg of whisky and it spoils the cake see there is time to stop making cake and start eating it and im afraid thats now well im always the first one to tell you when ive goofed and well im sure thats whythat im friend of yours and youre friend of mine because i wouldnt dare tell people who werent my friends that id goofed you know they make too much out of it but the truth of the matter is that we were there and we are there as far as that process is concerned but because this process is actually harder to do if it is hard to do at all it actually should be relegated to cases you cant get on the road and to rock slammers because its too easy to do routine 3m right after that because i had the data now on listing already had the data of the gpm already had that pretty well neated up id just been looking for the magic auditing commands and i found the frequency of the bank and that was it we were there well it suddenly got easier than routine 2 dont you see and there we were with full clear now you understand that keyedout clear parks you on the near side of the bank and that ot lies through the bank this is horrible thing to have to confront when youve got keyedout clear you still to make an ot have to go all the way through the bank and thats why we havent made any ots you see that so you cant afford keyedout clear if youre going to send the guy all the way or youre not going to actually you dont want any keyedout clears because they dont last theyre like the democratic party in the united states now your keyedout clear still has between himself and ot the whole gpm and hes not going to skirt it and go whenever he tries to do something that is an ot attribute and does it very much hehheh tsk that bank keys in and hes longer keyedout clear hes mess hes not as bad off as he was before but he simply longer has free needle in other words we still had with clear barrier between clear and ot and that barrier was the gpm and the only answer to that is run the thing out well if the frequency is better as far as auditing is concerned when i say frequency its how many items on the list and how sound and solid is it that youre going to find that the last rr on the list fires and all this sort of thing in other words these positive points and if there are less variations in 3m than there are in routine 2 and if you have to know less whats the idea of taking the locks off the gpm if you can take away the gpm all right now that means then that routine 2 should be relegated to type of process or use for cases we cant get whizzing cant find any goals on cant do something with or an outandout rock slammer who of course cant come anywhere near session you know cant get an improvement in session but even an outandout rock slammer could probably be held in place long enough to find his goal and that probably would change him and finding his first few items would probably cure him from being rock slammer i just think its more poetic to run routine 2 on rock slammer thats pure sadism but anyway the upshot of the situation is that routine 3 turns out to be easier than routine 2 but routine 2 is actually easy enough but there was that bug in routine 2 that if you dont complete package and if you continue list which atthe item has already been found on youre very likely going to shut off the rr or rs of the pc you follow that ill give you an idea supposing one day we found great big slamming item called mental science on the list one and then with enthusiasm we abandoned it and completed list one and took it on down and theall ofpretty soon after while we didnt have any more rses and we said the list was complete and we went back and looked for other rses and nothing was rsing and the pc felt very sad well thats liability thats liability its only approximated in routine 3m by neglecting to find the pcs goal if you neglect to find the pcs goal and go on and on and on and on and on down into gpm eventually hell get so jammed up his tone armhis tone arm will be up here at 50 way up to the top of the dial way up here somewhere up here stuck needle stuck more rrs rses how the hell are you going to find somebodys goal well you already found his goal before you get him into this condition it must be somewhere on your auditors reports it must be rather recent thing to have done this to him but you can onthats about the only way i know of that you could shut off an rs or an rr with routine 3m its just utterly neglect to find the pcs goal and drive him all oh twothirds of the way through gpm with goal found that would louse him up but good next thing you know you havent got any rs rr nothing like that nothing fires on the list the old list everything is dead the meters totally flat you getyou get the mess youd be in but then of course thats such wild violation of it that one would hardly look for it but its easier to do this with routine 2 with routine 2 you can goof theres another thing that will happen with routine 2 which gives it liability and itd be less than honest to tell you it wasnt liability you can get the fellows item you know you got ayou found an item on list and it was just little old item and youve heard the thirdofadial rule and it was the only rs that could be found on the pc and you opposed it and he came up with another little rs that didntbut i dont want anything to do with it you know just bum rs it says aw itsskip it now you try to find goals on this poor sod awk you will get the goal of the last terminal thats the only goal you will get inevitably you will get the goal of the last terminal if the last terminal is the enlightened ones you will get the goal to enlighten if the last terminal you found with routine 2these are rock slamming thingsif the last terminal or sometimes oppterm that you get thats slamming as an item even little tiny one youve hung him see hes hung up in the bank at that point and youll getwell ill give you ill give you one out of an r3m action supposing it was success supposing success that you found and you try to do goal and you will only get the goal to succeed you understand youve limited the view of the goal let put this over again so as not to confuse you routine 2 were talking about routine 2 youve taken source listyou found little old item on this source list that didnt amount to hill of beans and you opposed it and then you heard that it had to be thirdofadial rock slam so you left it now you try to find the pcs goal i dont care how many other routine 2 lists you did you try to find the pcs goal and the last item in was the enlightened ones youre going to get goal on this pc that isnt the goal its not going to rocket read its not going to behave like goal either so dont worry about that but the only thing that you could get to stay in and stick and mess up and that reads in any way whatsoever looks promising is this goal to enlighten it might even fire once or rock slam or something its the only goal you get to fire itsyou got theyou got an incomplete package well i wouldnti wouldnt worry much about this when i was doing routine 2 but if i dont readily find goal on pc on whom routine 2 has been run i look for the package that wasnt carried around to four rror ris because 1 you know i couldnt find the goal i dont borrow trouble ever i couldnt find the goal id look back for some routine 2 that wasdidnt have fourway package particularly list on which nice juicy item had been grabbed and it was incomplete and then the list had been continued id look for this and repair that and then go on there actually arent whole lot of other things that go wrong i mean you havent got an unlimited number of things that go wrong but youve done routine 2 youve got twoway package now you cant find the pcs goal let emphasize that you cant find the pcs goal youre just trying and you cant dont borrow trouble because this condition might exist and you still could find the pcs goal look there the old routine 2 and by george what do you see you see something on which they found two packages and neglected the last one or the last item they found on the thing there were two items found and the last of them found didnt match up good so they didnt go on you find that list was incomplete andor you got fourway package the way i saw the other day they got fouritem package except three of the items came off one list sure enough the only goal that the pc could give was the last item the last routine 2 item he gave the goal of that item thats the only thing that fired on the list interesting huh all you have to do is complete it and make sure that you got it all the way around but it has that liability this can happen now if you see pc whos very sad and continuously sad and has gone on being sad for long time then somebody has found an item on list monkeyed with the item and then continued the list but that was the item on the list you understand the item will still be sitting there the item will still have some r is on it even though it was opposed its abandoned or you will find that somebody has found an item on list has opposed it got another item but hasnt completed the package those are about the only two things that can go wrong in routine 2 if you know those things you can get rses back on that have shut off and so forth but life also shuts off rses and fortunately theres another way of picking that all up and thats just give the pc marvelous excellent auditing prepchecking and that sort of thing on and on and you make him feel better but actually this is much longer job and shouldnt be attempted what should be attempted is the repair of the routine 2 its mistake to leave extant any loose items in routine 2 they should be completed the package should be made up with four ris and that way you wont have much trouble finding the pcs goal but unless you complete that such packagethere might be one of them there might be two of them left incomplete unless those are completed on the pc whether now reading or not the pcs rr or rs may shut off and youll not find the goal or you may just be able to find the goal of the last item there and you cant find any other goal because the pcs stuck see that but at the same time this is workable tool because we are not villains in spite of the american mess association thats athats an organization over there that owns the government they operated on so many senators and left their tools in so many congressmens guts they eventually now are able to take the companion tool which they keep in laboratory and electric shock it and the tool left in the stomach of the senator or congressman vibrates you see and they all vote the right way thats the way thats done its whole track magic actually anyway this organization this organization to the contrary things we do in scientology are not evil life can wrap somebodys routine 2 around the corner and thats why you must continue to know your routine 2 youve got that so routine 2 shouldnt exist actually as process on which we would engage enthusiastically unless we couldnt do 3m and weve still got something however we can do called routine 2 thats so similar to 3m that its very easy to know it has different frequency its fifty items instead of twentyfive beyond the last reading item youre not operating against goal few things like that you get package of four in routine 2 you dont get packages of four in routine 3m rrrrrr you get packages of thirty or packages of fifty or however many items there are in the gpm thats the size of the packageis the gpm see and routine 2 when you cant get an rs or an rr to turn on in 3m or routine 2 its been turned off by life so therefore you sure better know what routine 2 is because routine 2 applied against the persons life will turn back on the rock slam and rocket read life being much rougher in south africa than other places none of the offices down there are able to get on any rses i consider this very interesting because all theyd have to do is take some kind of an assessment of somebodys life you know what has your life consisted of haha thats all theyd have to say what has your life consisted of and do list or something like that or what isnt part of your life either one one or the other life has turned off the persons rs and rr when you cant get an rs and rr on person then you must consider that life has turned it off well strangely enough the goal will usually shine through thats weird its almost the last thing to go out so you have good chance that the goal will rocket read anyway so you wouldnt start with routine 2 youd start with 3m and then 3m is now unsuccessful because in listing goals on the meter we see rses rses rrs and we continue to list until we get motionless tone arm we have rses we have rrs we must assume at that point that life has turned this persons rs and rr off to such degree that the goal is not available its there but it wont read what do we do what do we do i know thats prettythats pretty rough assignment thats not going to happen in lots of cases you had better choose some zone or area in that persons life where the persons routine 2 has gone awry and instead of giving you long long number of pat lists just let say that the routine 2 has gone awry what do you mean the routine 2 has gone awry well i dont know he used to fight with his wife and shes dead well isnt that an incomplete series of items hmm he was in the army and there arent any battles anymore and yet he had to be member of the peacetime forces under duress for long time that sort of looks like he had an oppterm and then somebody continued the list well same condition well knowing that and knowing that life is routine 2 in its way and if there are incomplete packages and lot of other things it seems to you could fool around with somebody that you couldnt get an rr on or an rs on and you could get it back on just by going over his life and turning it back on by completing some of the items how would you complete the items well who or what in your life have you would you rather not fight with who in your life have you fought with something like this and all of sudden something starts firing well carry the package on around the line you get some one thing to fire carry it on around four times you get back to the beginning on the thing youll be able to go down this old goals list that you did and just calling it off maybe calling each goal twice or something like that all of sudden just to be sure why one of those goals that didnt read before now rrs simple huh well thats why you should know routine 2 but i would say this if you can do 3m on somebody dont monkey with routine 2 but if you cant do 3m on somebody and nobody can find the goal then youve got to do routine 2 you got that so therefore you have to do routine 2 well so as not to cut off somebodys rr or rs thats about the size of it now the only thing that has to be corrected in 3m that i know of that is anything serious that would cause 3m to go awry is this one now im going to give you this awful fast i told zed unit there and they were all very happy about it but let give you what you have to do never never never never prepcheck never never never never never list as source listyou can list it as an items list when it comes up but not as source listwith anything in it except the exact statement of the goal beginning with to now you got that never list anything else now what do i mean by that dont ever list for source list on the goal oppose list step 2 the formation step there thats got to be changed thats whats changed you dont take those four lines ill tell you why in moment the source list is always on the goal to catch catfishwho or what would to catch catfish oppose i dont care if the pc cant answer it thats all you dare list and you never prepcheck goal in any other way than on to catch catfish has anything been suppressed you see that on to catch catfish has anything 9 you know been 99 you know you never say on the goal to catch catfish you never list the source list for instance who or what would the goal to catch catfish oppose never never never you never list who or what would somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish oppose never never its goof and you never list who or what would catching catfish oppose never never never and you never prepcheck and you never call the goal and you never put the mid ruds in on the goal in any other way than on to catch catfish has anything been suppressed you understand why well i was swimming around the bottom of the gpm the other daythats the third gpm im almost there at the bottom of itand i went twentyfour items deep in it without its goal and i know all about this haha oh bla blob blub see christ dont let it happen to again this was wild awful i never went down so far and came up so i felt like one of these skin divers you know whose flask of air has been filled with chlorine gas not oxygen you know something like that i was down at the bottom of theits something like swimming in the bottom of the philippine deep swimming around down in the bottom of this thing i was struck by something very peculiar and youll find this very very interesting too there are reliable items in i dare say everybodys gpm called the goal to catch catfish whatever the goal is you see interesting isnt it thats an ri its not the goal and theres therell be an item somebody with the goal to catch catfish that will be an item reliable item somewhere down near the bottom of the chain and therell be reliable item catching catfish there will be people who catch catfish but there will also be catching catfish hooooh and way down at the bottom which started the whole thing is just the goal all by itself and thats all you can use to catch catfish that starts the channel youve got that at the bottom but then up just up from it somewhere is somebody somebody with the goal to catch catfish you understand and across from that or up the line little bit further is catching catfish thats another terminal ri and therell be another one pretty horrible to contemplate therell be another one there somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish dont you see and theresin other words anything but the goal is liable to be an ri now the funny part of it is you wont run into this on the firstyou could get away with it almost all the way through perhaps on the first gpm because in the first place the item is so deep that it wont read and isnt even restimulated on the first second gpm something like that its way down the line its maybe item twentythree from the top terrific twenty three ris deep into the gpm you get this item see somebody with the goal to catch catfish or the goal to catch catfish twentythree items deep so you can of course find the goal and prepcheck it you see on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and that will be just fine but you get about halfway down through the bank and youre saying on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed well that didnt read needles getting rather tight on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed well that needle is rather tight and so forth and theres nothing on this has anything been suggested is there anything youve failed to reveal has mistake been made is there anything youve been careless about anything you get theres reads on this anyplace and the goal isnt firing therefore its gone well yeah youre not prepchecking the goal youre prepchecking reliable item the goal to catch catfish hahahaha now if you did clear test not knowing this you would be in trouble because the line for the clear test must be who or what would to catch catfish oppose otherwise youre going to overlist the item by listing who or what would the goal to catch catfish oppose youre now going to overlist the item which is in the bank the goal to catch catfish and of course youre not going to get any reads so youre going to say the guy is clear as bell you hit him and he goes thud you see you see that thing well actually i probably never would have tumbled to this or really found it out or anything else or had anything to do with it or had it get in my road in any way if i hadnt goofed by going twentyfour items deep into the 3rd gpm without goal and then it was getting pretty desperate things were getting very desperate and all of sudden the tone arm went up to 50 and the rs and the rr and everything else turned off and we were looking for the new goal and we listed about two hundred goals and i was going this way and this way and whoa wherewhats this and so forth and nothing moved ta action and then all of sudden i cognited on the fact well that was the goal we found it clear back there only it has since been called the goal hahaha so therefore it wouldnt prepcheck because there is an item in here hahaha which is the same as the auditor is using on the pc to find the goal the pc of course gets this confused with the item when the goal has beenso the goal wont read well you ordinarily wouldnt notice this because i would haveyou had to have gotten into trouble it isnt anything that is catastrophic but nevertheless this could happen that youre trying to clean up the goal to get it to fire and youre two ris away from somebody with the goal to catch catfish and you want list because youve run out of rr and so forth and you want to list this again and you were using somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish or something like that youd restimulate this item actually it has to be very exact well i think thats very interesting its caught by fluke it isnt actually too much of mistake because right at the top the goal to catch catfish is twenty three ris away and it isnt likely to restimulate so you ordinarily wouldnt notice this youd have to get into some kind of jam down at the bottom of the bank without goal and keep running into this foolish item this item you see this item well of course theit was the goal except the goal to read had to have the garbage knocked off of it and then if we just read the goal we were all set dont say the goal so just leave out somebody or something with the goal the goal to all those things because theyre items you talk aboutyou talk about gimmickedup mess you know thetan really gimmicked himself up with this kind of stuff you know man i mean its marvelous the frequency with which he did it but of course were all traveling the same track weve gotten into the same traps were ordinarily playing pretty much the same game and weve fallen for the same swindles and weve perpetrated the same swindles on one another so its wonder that the thing compares as nicely in frequency but this one is really one that if you if i hadnt found it if i hadnt found it some of you guys would get looped around the telephone pole youd feel sad well the gpm isnt composed like this see its all clear theres rr and rs on the pcson the pcs meter so therefore the pc must be clear except the tone arm is at 60 and the needle is stuck in the exact middle of the dial and yet we cant get anything to read youve shut off the pcs rs and rr the goal isnt even cleared up the rule is dont use anything but to when youre designating its always who or what would to catch cat i dont care if the pc cant list it just bully him he says oh you have to say the goal the goal i can read the goal i can read something or somebody that would have this goal i can read that i mean i can answer that but i cant but i can you say im very very sorry and life is sometimes cruel many are called and few are chosen you happen to be chosen because youre sitting in the auditing chair answer the question who or what would to catch catfish oppose oh well you put it that way and hell go ahead and do it otherwise you can collapse the bank see on something like this you probably can restimulate it if you pull this gag as prepcheck halfway down through the bank two items away from that your prepcheck would be beautifully flat your needle would get beautifully stuck and youd all come out all right because youd find it in couple of minutes anyway when you went on down the line but you would be upset for that length of time and the possibility exists that you will sometimes miss goal thats possibility iit wouldnt happen ordinarily but you sometimes will miss goal youre saying all right now were going to check this out now on the goal to catch catfish has anything been hell nothings been suppressed on the goal to catch catfish its twentythree items down the bank how can anything be suppressed on it its just in total concrete so you get read and on the goal to catch catfish ill now read the goal and you say to catch catfish to catch cat you can also make mistake you say well were checking an item were checking an item here and the pcand he thinks the itemwhen the auditor reads the item why it doesnt rocket read but when the pc thinks the item it does rocket read the difference there is the auditor isnt calling the wording of the item theres nothing like this you understand you understand if the auditor calls the item correctly the item will read on the meter but the pc is thinking something else which is what causes the thing hes got word or two tacked onto ithahahaha thats why its reading see the pc thinks the goal to never know my own mind you see and the auditor iscalls off to never know and the pc thinks to himself to never know my own mindrocket read you see and the auditor notices then that when hewhen the auditor calls the goal to never know why the pc gets rr but when the pc thinks the goalthe auditor dubs this in he says well the pc thinks the goal to never know the pc thinks the goal to never know he gets rocket read but when i say the goal to never know i dont get rocket read now what is all this about well what its all about is the pc is thinking whether he knows it or not to never know my own mind all right now the auditor is calling off the goal which has ceased to rocket read because its exhausted and the pc is thinkingthe auditors calling off to catch catfish and the pc is thinking the goal to catch catfish which is rocket reading in other words when the auditor calls something out and it doesnt read but when the pc thinks of it and it rocket reads then the auditor isnt calling what the pc is thinking you got that youll see that phenomenon in lots of cases i dont think you can audit case without running into that once or twice somewhere down the line and just enquire what the pcs thinking thats the one out of that but this other onethis other one you got to lay that in in brass ill get out bulletin and correct the thing theres only one other correction on that particular 3m bulletin that i might as well mention in parting here and that is that it says it only has to read once theres four words missing out of that bulletin it says it in the checkout of the goal it only has to read once you understand thats once in three times said consecutively you see on the original words was once in three times read see its the three times read consecutively once only one of those needs to rocket read in order for checkout to pass well theres various reasons for that it may read twice for the auditor and only once for the checkout person now checkouts in general are best done by the pcs auditor reading the thing to the pc in the auditing placein their auditing placesand seen by an instructor who is not auditing the pc and that will save you great deal of time on checkouts in other words the auditor goes and gets supervisor or an instructor and brings him back sits down straightens up the item and calls it on the pc and the thing is seen to rocket read by the instructor who then reaches over and initials the auditors report to the fact that he has checked it out checked out item soandso suchandsuch hes just seen it see hes seen it read now i probably have mixed you up by talking about routine 2 and routine 3 indiscriminately in actual fact these are simply well theyre theyre cousins their rules are so faintly different that it is almost impossible to differentiate in otherany other way that one is the outside perimeter of the gpm and the others the inside perimeter of the gpm almost everything that you say about 3m is true about routine 2 but theres one thing that isnt you can always extend the 3m list you found an item fishhooks and so you found it and there it sits and whether you did anything with it or not you could extend the goal oppose or the ri list and you can find fishing lines and it rrs and you can put them both on the line plot and the pc is not in the least bit damaged in other words you can find second item if theres tick left on the source you can always find second item you can even take sourcepoint with tick on it and extend the list and very often wind up with another item and it wont jam up the pc and it wont upset him in actual fact you should never do more than one goal oppose list dont do more than one goal oppose list on 3m because you get extra dead ended things but you can always extend 3m lists you cant do that with routine 2 you cant do it one other thing id like to say is when do you find the new goal the new goal must be found at the rocket reading blowdown there is blowdown on the meter complete with rocket reads when you get down to the base of the goal and it goes pswwpswwpswwpsww pswwpswwpswwpsww and it blows itself on down and it blows itself down from maybe 45 and it goes down down down you will see couple of these maybe early on it goes from 45 only to 40 with pswwpswwpsww and youll also see the pc cognite the thing with rocket reads occasional rocket reads but this is real vicious one and it goes right on down to clear read from wherever you were pswwpswwpswwpswwpswwpswwpswwpsww in other words the meters rocket reading all the way and youre bringing it down with the tone arm and you just see that thing firing all by itself the pc isnt thinking anything man its just powpowpow powpowpow pow powpow powpow powpow it looks like the doggonedest bunch of rocket reads you ever saw in your life and its all going off automatically and itll come right down to the pcs clear read or somewhere near it or even below it well at that point you stabilize the item youve just found by just saying thats it and so forth and thats fine and put it on the line plot and that sort of thing and right at that point you find the pcs next goal thats the place to ask the pc for his next goal now thats the place to ask the pc for his next goal because i cant count on you catching the free needle which follows the blowdown itll come immediately afterwards but its sometimes very brief but you want the pcs next goal you ask him for his next goal you do little goals list you dont toss this off you know you actually do little goals list on the meter and watch the thing for rocket reads and all of sudden pssww and thats fine and you go over couple of more and psswwpssww and couple of more rses and so on youve got this little goals list and the pc starts looking very disinterested well truth of the matter youve probably got your goal on the list so you go back over them rapidly and you just read them once and see which one rrs and the one that rrs you give it prepcheck now the funny part of it is that you actually can get the goal of an item if yourif your pc is messed up in any way you can get the goal of an item and the way itll behave is it rocket reads little bit you know it may rocket read half dozen times start rsing and then diminishes and then goes down and disappears its anthats the goal of an item about to be found so theres got to be little prepcheck on this goal you see now the real one just keeps rocket reading it just keeps rocket reading and then itll get suppressed and then itll come back and itll rocket read some more and itll get suppressed and itll come back and rocket read and the more you prepcheck it why the better it rocket reads and so forth and it doesnt go off into an rs you can take an rs and by brief mid rud prepcheck create right in front of you an rr you can always do that but anyway to beto be very precise about this thats when you ought to find the pcs goal with list and with little prepcheck of the new goal and all that sort of thing and then you go right on doing what you were doing you go right on down the same spiral staircase and youll find out that there are various things there to be opposed you dont do new oppose list its just that the next item or two coming up are actually under this new goal theyre not under the old goal and therefore you dont have to stop you just go on down the spiral staircase but look never go more than two items if you can help it and four at the absolute outside into gpm without finding somebodys goal dont go absolutely dont ever go more than four let tell you thats going to be tough enough preferably two is about all you want and preferably find it when the needle goes free and you get free needle afterright after this blowdown theres when you should find your next goal dont carry on into gpm without goal because youre now dragging thing called missed withhold called one goal and thats really miserable now theres nothing more much that i have to communicate to you i communicated it all at once here except this except this just because gpm formed by reason of your never having confronted these problems but only the solutions just because gpm formed because you didnt ever confront it is reason you cant confront it and is reason at all you cant audit it with great ease you hear that thatthats important because an auditor gets the idea because of course the whole gpm is based on the fact that it is unconfrontable because it had to have solutions because one couldnt confront the problems you understand therefore the auditor being ordered to run it starts to get very nervy indeed and he may think its utterly impossible and that it goes by some other rules and goes into terrific dispersal simply because hes asking to be confronted tobeing asked to confront this thing which he never before confronted hes got gpm so hes never confronted it well my answer to that is confront it just because you never have is reason you cant and the auditor as an auditor has simply got to confront it thats all and clear up whoever hes clearing and so forth and then hell have clear on his hands it is not only not impossible to do it is probably the easiest and most rewarding auditing you will ever do because theres actually nothing much there to confront thats probably the biggest trick of all okay i hope that brought you uptodate i always try to give you the latest dope and in particular anyplace i have goofed even slightly i tell you before you tell thats my motto thank you very much and good night
