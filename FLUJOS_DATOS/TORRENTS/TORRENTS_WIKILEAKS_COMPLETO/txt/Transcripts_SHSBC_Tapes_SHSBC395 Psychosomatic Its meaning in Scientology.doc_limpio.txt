psychosomatic its meaning in scientology lecture given on 30 july 1964 thank you thank you all right this is the what audience 30th of july thirtieth of july male voice ad 14 ad 14 thank you all right saint hill special briefing course well were going to haveim of aof divided opinion here with regard to what i should talk about today i was talking about psychosomatic healing and so forth and we were all set to do something that was energetic and proper and line ourselves up with healing and try to and so forth and i saw the snide looks on most of your faces when i was talking about that it is possible to win over medico it is possible to win one over i just got through winning couple over see showing them where this started and end and the argument was very convincing to them and psychosomatic healing could be very interestingvery small but interesting section of this and we have some new breakthroughs on the subject and so forth but i dont think really that the idea of undertaking it in very close cooperation with the medical profession would be very successful thats my candid opinion because i looked over my case histories on the subject of their treatment and their treatment lays in too many what they call psychic traumas psychic trauma to them is something they dont know what it is but its word they use dont go looking for meaning because they really have meaning for it so youre going up against problem here if you deal with the medico of person who monkeys he doesnt have any very precise answers when he immediately gets out of the field of the broken leg when he gets out of the field of putting on tourniquet or some other type of action and he gets into field where he himself does not have very good answers and so he monkeys and they will do some very interesting and wild things they will get some kind of suspicion that there might be growth in somebodys chest and start removing tissue and theyll do exploratories and they will do all kinds of wild things they will go into tumor and take small slice of it and so forth thus activating it and aggravating it so that now the person practically is dying whereas before they werent bad off in other words theres lot of monkey business and i say that very advisedly im not merelyi could think of much more high school words than monkey business but i think it rather fits so forth man descended from monkeys and those that didnt descend much became doctors bitter huh ithis caused methis caused to take very sharp look caused to take very sharp look at possible cooperation and it left it very much in question because time after time after time after time i have treated iatrogenic difficulties now thats nice upstairs word and you should learn that word iatrogenicit means doctorcaused its an illness caused by the doctor in the whole field of psychiatry you have practically nothing but iatrogenic psychosis today if person has been unlucky enough to get into an institution the person is so traumatized in other words so bunged about so shocked and so batted around that one any establishment of communication between person in the realm of helper you see or the person in the role of somebody whos going to help him or treat him is of course immediately broken down its almost shattered that the person just mentions hes going to help psychotic who has been institutionalized is usually enough to produce complete break of affinityand its just out the window right now gone because their idea of help i dont think that the common ordinary gardenvariety legislator senator or representative or some other chapchap is there because the other one is deletedis censored he passes these vast laws vast laws you know youve got to pass laws and so he doesnt know anything about what hes passing laws about so he sets up some kind of machinery where anybody that stumbles across pebble in the street is at once put on some kind of an underground railway that disappears from public view and you go swhooo and you wind up in an institution i mean its the wildest piece of legislative balderdash that has ever existed there is nothing in the constitution that says you have to be sane to be citizen call that to your attention thats the constitution of the united states you dont have to be sane to be citizen and yet these boys have moved it over to point where if you are pronounced insane youre longer citizen and have civil rights of any kind whatsoever so anybody can pronounce anybody insane by the legislative action it doesnt even take doctor and then the next thing you know why the fellow is inside and the moment hes inside he has civil rights so this then opens itself wide open to political balderdash hankypanky political hankypanky you dont like somebody they did it down to somebody down in the southern part of the united states the governor of state not too long ago i think he sacked the whole staff of the hospital and walked out they had forgotten that he still had authority to sack the staff of the hospital but they tried to railroad him you see and this becomes political mechanism anyone whose ideas are antipathetic to us fascists or us communists or us somethingorothers must rule all anybody who saysup and says you know i dont think thats right ii think we ought to keep the constitution so oh hes insane and so forth and they got this machinery all set up and in he goes and he has more political rights you see now you think im exaggerating but im not exaggerating i think youve had few lessons in this before ive told youiti get letters every once in while dear ron for years i thought you were just fooling when you talked about something or other but the other day i went down to the local clinic and youve been understating the ease you see all right this legislative machinery sweeps over and places in the hands of the anointed practitioner the right and power to operate in the field of the mind as well as in the field of physical illness and the right to railroad this bloke in and so on and here in england about the total training gp has in the field of the mind is sixhour lecture in drafty hall in some insane asylum which he doesnt even have to attend to get his examinations thats his basic training in the field of the mind so they have the idea because the legislators have passed legislation giving them total power in this field in most commonwealth countries in england and united states and they have the idea they know something about the mind and to them of course even by their definition the mind is the brain and yet because of the mixup that words can be subjected to why they therefore say if youre operating in the mind youre trying to do something with the brain and theyre very confused people because in the first place they have not been trained i underscore that they have not been trained they have training in this field at all they have training because one there has never been any textbooks in this field which produced effective release of neurosis or psychosis or psychosomatic illness thats one of the reasons theyve never been trained which is an understandable reason and forgivable but to pretend then theyve been trained when theyre usually quite aware of the fact theres data in this field that to isborders in the realm ofwell lets use mild phrasefraud and the second reason theyve never been trained in this field is that they themselves dont have to be trained in this field any gpgeneral practitionerhas the full power to treat any and all mental illnesses of any kind granted to him by the various legislatures and parliaments of the western world so one he hasnt got anything to know and two he doesnt have to know anything about it so this makes beautiful monopoly which is manipulable politically is very remunerative in various ways and he can go to town the fellow called psychiatrist is not licensed to practice psychiatry there is license to practice psychiatry you have perfect right to call yourself psychiatrist it has legal definition of any kind whatsoever it praactually does not have even the legal definition that scientology does scientology has better right to it because scientologys at least copyrighted and trademarked the word psychiatry has actual legal definition and there is bill on any legislative books anywhere which says psychiatrist can practice in the field of the mind that leaves them completely out on the limb they have to be medical doctor they have to be medical doctor in order to practice in the field of the mind and any medical doctor can practice in the field of the mind they do not have to be trained to practice in this field and therefore fellow who calls himself psychiatrist only operates in the field of the mind legally so long as he is an md in good standing this is something you should realize theres this whole field then called psychiatry which has existence in legal fact isnt that very interesting there are laws licensing psychiatry there are psychiatrists who are licensed your certificate as hca has far far far more validity than any psychiatric certificate ever issued they do not have any certificate signed by freud jung adler or any of them see pavlov so on thered be two ways of training or certifying somebody is the person who develops the information always has right to validate whether or not student who has studied that information can use it in some effective way you see now that is the oldest by the way the oldest method of validating anyones training that is the oldest university substitutes for that this person has been here and read the textbooks of the guy and actually university certificate or diploma and so forth does not have the same validity that thea certificate or diploma issued by person who was an expert in his field directly teaching the student that has validity the other is just detour you understand that all the university can say is this fellows been here and has read the textbooks of joe blitz so therefore hes doctor of something or other im afraid that doesnt hold very well so that even holds many types of training in severe question but im not trying to beat drum in that particular direction im just giving it to you the psychiatrist does not have certificate which has anything like the validity of your lowest certificate of most of you sitting here is hca hpa hes got nothing like that for instance as close as he comes to anything of the sort is he becomes diplomate or something like that through having thoroughly studied and passed examinations on the writings of freud in other words hes been through everything that they have of freuds and he can give you chapter and verse and date of everything freud has written and said and having passed that examination then some unauthorized body says hes diplomate and therefore is valid in the practice of freuds work well thats all very well if this were group of students of sigmund freud who were doing this that would be different you see if that were group which was perpetuating his work but it is not it is simply some body of blokes that set themselves up independent of freud and none of these people were ever trained by freud and he set up such activity and none of the freudian analysts originally set up such an activity so actually today freudian analysis is not practiced there practically is practice of freudian analysis they practice things like horney and other squirrel offbeat things and so forth and perhaps freud could produce finite result in the field of the mind and i know having been trained to some degree by commander thompson who was trained by freud i know very well that commander thompson could do some very wild things hed do such things as train cats and things like this it was pretty wild i know that doesnt sound like much but you really have to have command of the mind to train cat he had cat he called psycho and this cat would do most anything on command and it was quite wild quite fantastic and the way he trained the cat was directly from knowledge of the mind hed wait until the cat did something and then reward it now of course here was basic student also of pavlov at work you see theyd forgotten the other half of pavlovs work what you must do is punish only they think but he wouldhed just use straight reward hed wait for the cat to do something like jump up on chair and then he would say the command word and reward the cat and he eventually had the cat so the cat wouldyouhed say jump up on the chair and the cat would jump up on chair and this really made everybody blink and the cat could do lot of these silly little tricks but there was just an applied piece of the field of the mind do you see directly he for instance told things which i have never since found in any of the written works its quite interesting these little bits of missing information which go to make up the body of data which becomes practice are mostly i think to large extent missing because theyre the wordofmouth things you pick up around the joint you know he taught things about association that i dont findi find association is something else in the freudian texts but association the concatenation of association whereby person is actually able to arrive at some conclusion i say concatenation i really mean string of things and the association by libido theory of course is shortcircuited onto the second dynamic so that the person has certain things he associates with certain things which then these certain things being the woof and warp of his neurosis and psychosisthen his neurosis or psychosis is recognizable by what he has associated with what you understand word association tests in other words and so forth now some of this has survived through freudian lines and they do talk about it but not to the extent that thompson talked about it he talked about other things he talked about diagnosis of the actual incident through not just listening for five hundred hours to the patient you see but actually finding out what he associated with what and this required very active and imaginative practitioner but you could see that practice of this character whereby you sort of have to get an idea of whats wrong with the bloke and then you have to look around and find things for him to pick up and ask him what comes to his mind instantly you see and you would arrive with this trauma now freud didnt have in mind four or five years of an hour per week you see he didnt have this in mind this wasnt his idea of treatment but this other is so imaginative you see we look at this fellow and we say that is sort of type who has fetish onhes fetishistkeeps things or attaches wild significances to thingsbeen terribly dominated probably his mother you know this is the practitioner hes figuring it all out see and he looks like that lets see he looks arrested maybe at the age of three or four all right now when i saynow when i say mother what comes to your mind now yeah and the guy says something you see and he says biscuits or something you know and the guy says mmmm mmmm and then heyou know then he says some other word and the next thing you know hes got moment of punishment or mental conflict at the age of three maybe or something like that when the fellow had an arc break with his family you see and has been in protest ever since against the situation was pretending to be ill or something of the sort in other words it was all on the back of the practitioner well this moved off from the practitioner being very very bright and very smart and very alert moved over into an entirely different aspect of if he goes on long enough maybe we will find out something and you find out that person who is very very dull depends utterly upon simply amassing data to arrive at an answer if he amasses enough data he may find out actually it never happens exactly that way when you amass enough data i assure you you get lost in the data theres danger in amassing too much data im going through phase like that in my study of study right now ive just got through amassing too much data on highly indeof highly antipathetic bit of the subject im studying and so forth and i say good heavens what wouldnt i give for some practical right now too much data im getting confused you know just jammed in with sledgehammer too much data way to practice the data way to apply it if you could just apply some of the data you know why youd feel better about it you see well anyway freuds operational basis may or may not be practiced i wouldnt even know what it was you see very clearly but probably i would have much better idea than doctor sparkbreaker of the bideawee insane asylum in fact i would have much better idea than he would because my communication line only came through one via and his communication lineoh brother see the only point im making here is technology technology is very dicey stuff the more vias it goes through why the more errors it becomes subject to youthats why you like to have around when youre studying scientology you think well if it gets too rough and you get too confused why maybe he will pick up my despatch and so forth and give the gen as matter of fact i feed you lot of gen back along other ways too your instructors are always at and mary sue is always at and reg is always at and so forth about this that and the other thing and so forth and i lay it down tell them which is straight and which is not straight you get it straight in these lectures of course now the number of vias which 90 on to line are proportional to the number of errors which are introduced into it interpretations some bloke didnt quite understand what the phrase was so he relayed that along as something else and then this caroms against something else and the next thing you know you have whole new body of study called freudian analysis and it today is brandnew body of study for instance ive collided with bitter argument with freudian analyst johnnycomelately circa 50s you know bitter bitter argument on the subject of what transference was and the critique of psychoanalysis and so on one of our little booklets there theyre violent on that subject all ive given them in there was what i was given to be true by commander thompson see but now theyve got different psychoanalysis you see so even person who is announcing the original psychoanalysis is wrong and doesnt know what transference is you see we owe quite bit to that particular field but nothing to the body of knowledge or practitioners called psychoanalysts or psychoanalysis today you should make that very very clear we owe something to freud and nothing whatsoever to the existing bodies that call themselves psychoanalysis see now thats as close as these boys have gotten to any wisdom on this particular subject and it has become perverted so their right to practice in this field is very questionable now the right to practice is based upon the ability to do and if you ever permit that to be dropped out of scientology you will have great deal of trouble from thereon the ability to do regulates the right to practice thats open and shut the right to practice does not depend upon legislator see in the first place hes some hayseed that has been hauled off of his seeder by couple of the local political bosses because hes such sterling gent and they shove him in the direction of the local legislature and im saying local legislatures because most of these laws are made in the little state legislatures and the little state parliaments theyre not made atin congress one must say that with great awe coonnngress much less the preeeesident these boys are not the fellows who make these laws theyre madelittle pipsqueak state legislators where they make them clean their boots before they walk into the anteroom you know these are real corny these little legislatures you know my god i had state representative in arizona one time trying to get plaudits from on the fact that they had just read into law the ten commandments and that was now to be the law of arizona oh after all my god imagine it they were actually trying to scrap all the laws of arizona and in its place put in the ten commandments you see it was thereafter going to be paradise well of course their owners or their keepers the moneyed fellows in the society who headed them toward the legislature and controlled them more or less got some wind of this and pulled them off of it so they all agreed that it should be this way and made that into law but these birds can be stampeded they can be stampeded by almost anybody theyre not highcaliber intellect in the first place theyre probably all right growing their seed corn or they probably were all right in the hardware business you know or iron mongery but when it comes to this sort of thing government is never granted the dignity here in the west that it deserves government is specialized skill it is science and an art and these fellows are not very hot on that line so the way they govern is just people rush into them and tell them how bad it all is over there see its government by how bad it all is now this has gotten so prevalent that its even in practice this way in congress so that if enough people rush in and say how bad it all isspecialized interests you seethey can stampede these legislators into doing something catastrophic in the way of new bill and this has gone further and has become highly commercialized so you have promoters promoters for new government department he wants few few more million to play around with and few thousand employees to boss around and give him importance he will then find howbaditallises in the society rush these into the legislature and get then big appropriation by which he can found his new department after hes founded his new department he couldnt care less thats why you see the ebb and flow of attacks on scientology thesescientology is simply used as howbaditallis they rush in with unfounded and completely false representations into these legislatures some promoter does you see some bird who wants his new department to help to get himself new three or four billion quick bucks you see his wife is just fresh out of cadillacs that crude see so he finds out well well paint it up one way or the other and this is never tried you see this is all done in the office of the majority leader or sminority leader or something like that and they go in and they make some kind of dicker and they get this fellow all stampeded about how we actually are driving stakes through peoples chest in the dark of the moon or something like this its never subjected to any contest dont you see and this fellow next thing you know hes out there saying kill all the scientologists and dededaaaa and so next thing you know why some bill slides through mental health bill with five billion dollar appropriation was granted today to joe schmutzno we mean the fda see and then this guy joe schmutz or whatever his name is he couldnt care less about what scientology is doing because he had sincerity to begin with you see so all of sudden its all dropped like hot potato and nothing more happens about it and probably the whole melbourne mess is just the medical department down there actually trying to get themselves few quick pounds thats right this isthis is actually not even cynical view of it i mean thats the way its done so theyve gone stampeding in there and they told this galbatty itno wonder the fellows crazy with name like that they told this boy its terrible its awful how bad it all is the scientologists are ruining everybody while us psychiatrists are only killing people in windrows but we wont mention that but anyway if we just had big appropriation we could prevent these things you see and thats the little rider that the public never hears about see oh they get big hoopla they get it all going and so forth and everybody having found out how bad it all is why somebody appropriates few hundred thousand quid in case like that thousand quid would absolutely buy the mayor you know its not big money like it is in congress when they play this in the congress of the united states you see its worth billions when they play it in the state legislature youd be absolutely fascinated how small change it is therea few thousand andso all of sudden why having started this tremendous campaign about how bad scientologists are and so they could make their quick bucks you see why theyall of sudden nothing else happens of course they get the money and they buy the wife the cadillac and thats it see theyre not interested in doing their job theyre just interested in getting some cash now if you hit somebody with enough bad newsthis is your important technical datumif you hit somebody with enough bad news force or duress you can make him give you something that happens to be mental mechanism nobody ever really looks at this as mental mechanism but it is mental mechanism thats all it is if you hit somebody hard enoughand that would mean blow or bad news or you know blow in the field of mass and bad news in the field of significanceif you hit somebody hard enough you can make him give you something blackmail is based on this government is based on this taxation is based on this you think those soldiers standing around with bayonets are just to fight the enemy youre goofy because theyre not there to fight the enemy theyre to keep the citizenry impressed so theyll keep coughing up those tax bucks you know actually the dollar bill that isnt backed up with bayonet is worthless hasnt anything else to back it up its got to be backed up with bayonet and thats all on the basis ofyou can make somebody give you something see now theresthere could be more to this mental law and there probably is more to this mental law but were not interested in the whole mental law here were just interested in what law they are using that is the law which is being used and it happens to be quite factual so you rush up to somebody with enough bad news and you can shake him down for something ill give you an idea of this is seepage troubling your loved ones this is an ad of mortuary is seepage troubling your loved ones wild isnt it now do you know how much they get for any offor some of those sealed boxes that they put out there those metal caskets and then theirwhat they call vault and so forth wow you talk about going bankrupt the way to go bankrupt is to get the old man to kick the bucket youll go bankrupt fast not because of the depreciation of his income but the cost of the funeral so they can sell everybody then sealedwatersealed watertight caskets and watersealed watertight vaults which cost great deal of money dont you see see well thats piece of bad news and they hit somebody with this piece of bad news and they can shake them down for several thousand dollars you see then for some pieces of concrete and tin work and that is an operating law it operates in the field of commerce to this way to some degree but more aptly in the field of government and certainly in the field of healing now the doctor the medical doctor knows practically nothing else as method of how to get along commercially in life and hes always coming up with new disease campaign of some kind or another now the funny part of it is his money does not come in the public appropriation front from curing anything his money comes entirely from scaring people with how bad it is now im well datafied on this because pal of mine had had quite case history book on the front of this he used to sit around and talk to by the hour and the oldthe old boy used to tell about surgeona surgeon who would rush up to someonethe guy had specialty in appendectomies you seeand hed rush up to the relatives or hed rush up to the person you know see in terrific rush and say he wont last the day you know appendicitis fellows got some kind of bellyache he ate too much turkey or something you know he isnt going to last the day dying gone emergency operation must operate see bang bang oh yes go ahead well these operations are very expensive oh thatsspare expense so hed double and treble his price for the appendectomy see in this particular line hed go down and whip out an old kitchen knife or something and go to work and then this guy having brought out the appendixquite normally theyre healthy appendix you seewould take them and hold them together and squirt them full of air so as to make them four and five times the size you see and there they are all covered with blood and terrifically swollen and if any relatives were waiting in the anteroom hed keep his gory gown on you see with blood splashed all over the place and hed take these things with the air blown up in them and rush into the anteroom shake these things in front of their faces you see and say we got to it just in time they were about to burst and of course these people are terribly grateful and pay his outrageous bill at once method of collection see thank god you were there doctor thank god yes how much did you say the optwelve hundred dollars oh well we got there at once oh well twelve hundred dollars yes sir there you are they use this as operation so scientology scientology is used to shake down appropriations for new psychiatric services thosenew psychiatric policing new psychiatric this new medical this new medical that its just one of the things that is used you wonder why is this good press or bad press and so on it has nothing whatsoever to do with press it has to do with who wants current appropriation now you notice that the fda has further interest now and wish to god theyd never started this suit against emeters in the united states they sit around with their head in their hands because its causing them trouble its causing the election campaign trouble its causing lot of other trouble barry goldwaters getting very interested in this one wevethis is one of the shots thats going to be fired in the campaign now this was very embarrassing that some dumb promoter over at the fda and so forth suddenly starts to beat the drum on how awful emeters are dont you see because they dont want to bring the thing to trial theyll get it to trial theyll lose it like that now if they lose it theyll set precedent theyll also get countersuit against the united states government for about quarter of million half million bucks you see then this brings about another suit against the american medical association for having driven the fda into such state of frenzy see so they dont want to bring it to trial theyve already used it its dead dog and its one they shouldnt have used they recognize this now itll work this way similarly down in victoria therell be repercussions both ways to but theres too much vested interest in doing this in victoria i could not make breakthrough or convince anybody down there they ought to wind this thing up everybody just calmly resisted the idea of it well it was too valuable to one and all well we see the opposition didnt get in and folded up by the wayside which we very possibly strongly influenced but the conservatives got in again but the conservatives are in for new shock when they get things arranged down there im going to throw new brickbat into their vicinity and just work the game backwards on these fellows you see what happened to the laborites when they attacked scientology now you be good to us now we want you to introduce some legislation or well defeat you at the coming election as we defeated the laborite in other words well take full credit for the laborite defeat well tell everybody well you see theylook they lost id have little notice upgot to play these things little tougher than lot of people have guts to do so id put little notice up in the window and itll be an open letter to mr galbatty i told you you shouldnt have done it you know that kind of letter you shouldnt have done it we very seldom enter the realm of polities but when we do were very effective as you noticed in losing your last election very funny for instance our biggest contender up here on the council that was raising the devil with our town and county planning commission now happens to be in beautiful state of having lost the election he was the bird who started the death lessons thing and so forth and we finally moved him out of office now so these things can be manipulated from the other side too but this is mental lawthis is mental law that you should pay some attention to because its the basic law which is used usually in government extortion blackmail medicine any one of these things if you understand that how that law operates and so forth then youll understand why and what and usually think up very nice defense and handle things much better because youll understand who is doing what and why you see why are they raising this much fuss now this works also this way youre in situation where soandso and soandso youre in practice now this law is just not worked by governments this law is also worked by patients i had this and i had that and last night i could hardly pant and so forth and im dying today and so forth and therefore you have got to give something see now you could just discombobulate somebody terribly knowing that law you could discombobulate somebody horribly if when they came in and started telling you how bad it all is ask them what they wanted from you be more bald than this what am i expected to give you now the person quiteof course quite innocently may simply be dramatizing at some vast extent dont you see but you wont get perhaps sensible answer but you will sure change the course of what theyre doing now when you can shift somebody who is in near state of hysteria about something or other when you can shift their attention you can manipulate and handle the mind its obvious that you can manipulate and handle the mind because you can shift and change their attention i had an old pal of mine tell one time that if youif you get aif you can make people laugh when theyre crying and cry when theyre laughing then you would know something about the human mind interesting statement rathera wider statement than one would believe but rather challenging statement if somebodys crying can you make them laugh if somebodys laughing can you make them cry yes this shows then you wouldyou would know the buttons right if you would know the push buttons of the mindbut knowing the mind isnt necessarily manipulating the mind thats where that definition falls down but here is point of mental manipulation what are you after what am i expected to give you and youll see them shift gears they will shift gears with exclamation points because youve hit on the other end of the mechanism which they may unconsciously be applying they may not be consciously applying this mechanism at all they really may not want anything from you you see but by misidentification have you identified with something else from which they do want something but this really shifts gears if you used this for instance as director of training or director of processing and so on in central organization youd have ball registrar and so forth its wonderful post on which to use this particular mechanism all right what are we expected to give you see how bad everyyou all are and how bad everything is and how bad it is all right well what am i expect matter whats all bad do you see if its getting in your hair if you just give this as the response its not the expected response but it is the actual response that fits on the other end of it see they dont expect this response but it is the actual response and youll get discombobulation which is zzzz its fabulous the amount of effect that is produced by that shift ofsudden shift of attention and so forth and my father beat and my mother beat and everybody beat and so forth and everybody hit and youre not auditing this guy you see and so forth and they forbade to come down here and theyre going to haveso forth and they tell the police are going to come down and mop you all up and they tell that so on and so on and theyso on and its all bad and so forth what am i expected to give you it generally will be something and it just turns it all off bing you see and its quite interesting thats not for use in processing session of course now lets see what all this has to do with psychosomatic healing all right it has something to do with psychosomatic healing it means the medical profession means something else by their term psychosomatic healing than you mean by psychosomatic healing because they think its the mind influence on the body that is psychosomatic condition mind influence on the body but this is different because what do they mean by mind now what does the word psychosomatic mean lets go down tolets go down to cases here and ill give you what i started to tell you today psycho named after psyche or the soulyou know thats little psyche that was shot with theby arrows you know this is raphaels little doll see all right its the greek symbol for soul and you might as well put thetan see in the place of it i mean it translates that clearly see its the same word difference asin our field see soma body dont look for any more complication than that soma body body soma i mean thats all i mean thats all that soma means it doesnt mean anything complicated its very straightforward word and thenatic of course is just your suffix which means the action or condition of all right now look look at this psycho soma proper definitionnow understand herea proper definition of psychosomatic would be thetans influence on the body you got that that would be proper definition and is our definition thats our definition therefore it should probably be called psychesomatic get the out of there which has very poor connotations see its more comprehensible if you said psychesomatic see psyche thetan soma body see and because it comes ahead of it on the causedistanceeffect formula why youd have psyche influencing the body simple all right now somebody somewhere along the line translated psyche into mind now thats the first downgrade thetan becomes identified as the mind in other words he doesnt know who he is anymore but he becomes these masses and that sort of thing and he is this massy automatic piece of machinery called mind you see so weve already lost the thetan and we have mind so then that would deteriorate into this definition mind influence on body if psychopsychepsycho as its used has deteriorated to become mind why then its mind influence on soma body see so that would be mental influences on the body is what the word would mean all right now if we further deteriorated the word psyche to mean brain and nervous system which is where medicine lives we would have the influence of the nervous system upon the bodyinfluence of the brain and nervous system brain merely being part of the nervous system influence of the nervous system on the body this is something like saying the influence of telephone switchboards on the government see theres nobody on these lines making any calls the switchboard now is somehow or another conducting all of its business all by itself if you can imagine society in which the switchboard is looked upon and the telephone lines are looked upon as the causative action in the society you can seecan you get that concept were having depression because all the switchboards are reluctant that sounds pretty dingdingding here comes the wagon to doesnt it to you we are down then in the realm of the medical definition which is the psyche by which they mean brain and nervous system influence upon soma body theyve gone the complete identification because of course the brain and the nervous system are part of the body part and parcel so they now are down to bodys influence on body bodys influence on body so now this is total identification they havent anything influencing anything so theres therefore cure for it so theyve solved it thats what theyll tell you theres cure for it of course they havent got anything causing anything either so they should call it somasomatics because psyche has left and they have absolutely right to use the word psycho in their term medical healing now when they treat psychosomatics they think in terms of cutting up few nerves or filing somebody full of few shots that feed up the neurons or make the synapses snap better they do something wild in this to handle the nerve or channel or brain fiber or something like this which is then supposed to handle the body but it is the body so where are we weve busily arrived nowhere so the field then has become lost now the fields lost field basically then better term would be spiritual healing or spiritual influence on the body or spiritual illness if you want to put it on the downgrade do you see that see this is the subject which you are then addressing when you address the fact that mamie glutz has got stomachache and thats because she had fight with her boyfriend last night mamie glutz had fight with her boyfriend last night mamie glutz has got stomachache today you come along and you say mamie whats wrong and she says oooh ive got terrible present time problem got an awful stomachache got terrible present time problem you say what happened oh i had little deterrible things i had an awful fight with my boyfriend last night all right what didnt you communicate to your boyfriend last night what incomplete communication existed last night well soandso and i didnt tell him soandso on and i didnt soandso and i didnt tell him soandso and didnt tell him soandso and didnt tell him soandso and i didnt tell him soandso all right mamie how do you feel now i feel fine thank you very much therere actual case histories you express it as an auditor we handled the pcs present time problem he felt better and you actually are accustomed to somebodys having his wits scrambled and therefore having bellyache or having his foot hurt or having the end of his nose hurt you see you operate very easily in that operating climate see and that is so familiar to you as an auditor that you dont realize that its totally unknown concept to the society at large isnt that interesting they more connect last nights fight with the boyfriend with the stomachache they had today than the man in the moon and this is such brandnew idea to them that in the field of preclear education did you say did you knowdid you know that your various mental difficulties or conflicts or your collisions with life in the field of getting your job done or so forth is affecting your body well i know im not getting enough exercise i have to sit at desk too much all right dont interrupt him because you made sort of progress is there any other way it could have well i dont know they tell fellow gets ulcers if he goes on worrying i sure worry lot all right do you have ulcers but i might have them see he knows its basically true but you could actually bring him up to realization of this by process you could process person to realization of the source of his ills but this is slow way to do it because hell recognize it fastest just by education but im just giving it to you its there to be found it isnt there because i say its there its there to be found in other words you could say to somebody tell time when you had nervous upset and felt worse afterwards you say thats leading question that wouldnt be leading question normally it wouldnt upset anything if there wasnt something there to be found see so the fellow says oh oooooh never thought of it that way before but ithere probably is one uhhhuhhhuhoh yes hey what do you know i was sick for over year and half after my wife divorced you know i think i was sick because i was so upset how about that huh well what do you know felt very degraded hm youre trying to tell that if i wanted to be healthy i shouldnt be mentally upset you say im not trying to tell you anything trying to let you find out something is there any other time in your life when you were ill following mental upset and hell locate three or four and hell make lot of big case gain and hell go up in smoke itll be long comm lag stuff you know it might be almost the session comm lag might be next day he answers the question see but thats because hes gone so far down from being spirit see he now is thinking of himself as an animal or neuron or brain so its wonder that the society at large has fallen into these traps and has gone this low on the tone scale with regard to thetancaused illnesses thetancaused healings see so theeverybodys in that condition out there in the street see they dont but theyll snap to this then theyll all of sudden brush that away and they come up the tone scale quite ways and they suddenly say oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah at first they go around being very careful not to have any mental disturbances you see because it might make them physically ill they get over that in an awful hurry they get to point all right so i have mental disturbance i can process it out then they finally get up to point way up to the point of ot so i have mental disturbance see dont have to do something as result of it but normally in the middle band you have to do something about it you getyou get yourself in big wingding one way or the other and you find yourself thinking and cursing obsessively about something or other and youre going around and around and around and around and around and around and you suddenly say whoa whoa whoa hold it hold it boy here hold it hold it hold it this is the mark actually of scientologist whos crossed over fromwell over from being raw meat theres something im thinking that has something to do with why im thinking and theres some incident that caused this and its possibly an overt now what overt have i done lately uhh oh my god thats what it is okay faces up to the responsibility of his own acts in other words instantly there goes this well the body operates this way so thoroughly how somebody could not notice it is the puzzle see see these guysthis guy goes down the street spinning you see hes going round and round my god uhhhuhhuhhhuhhhuhhhhuhhhh you know andhe hasnt traced it to the fact that he just was told by the bank manager that he was thousand pounds overdrawn because of the wifes drawouts you know he hasnt connected with that hes told this he gets it as terrific shock he goes down the street i feel bad total mystery i wonder why i feel bad and hell suddenly tell his friends he tells his friends the truth but he never looks at it himself i had an awful shock this morning i feel pretty bad i had an awful shock this morning toldthe bank manager told thousand pounds overdraft so hell tell all his friends this but it doesnt do anything for him because he doesnt know what hes said thats correct youll hear great many truths spoken by people that do nothing for them because they dont mean anything to them they never listen to themselves talk theyre always cursing people who dont listen they should curse themselves they never hear themselves speak but there is the upshot of where the society exists right now then theres the upshot of deteriorizationa deterioration of recognition of condition known as thetanspirit and as that has declined in word meaning so it has declined and become degraded in the physical universe ill trace it again for you very rapidly psyche thetan soma body see psychesomatic bang thetan causing sensation on the body is what the inference is there not only thetan can do something bad to body or thetan can do something good to body but thetan can cause the body to feel some way and there is actually the way we use it we use somatic with the greatest of abandon you know justwell somatic to us is highly identified thing fellow feels hot he could even say hot he has somatic you see its just somatic he had somatic you dont ordinarily go so far as to say you feel good so youve got somatic of feeling good wouldnt be very true because itd be you who felt good all right now thats from psychesomatic psyche thetan somatic body condition or influence down to psycho by which was meant 4 mind influence on the body and freud went quite upscale from the normal run and woof and warp of the society when he actually talked about the mind influencing the body but he had the wildest idea of what mind was it looked like some awful old cave with wild men running around inside of it this is wild thing i was going to build it up one time as stage set and everybody sort of discouraged i guess they couldnt confront how awful it was you know he has the censor and he has this and hes gotthats the most populatedhes got the id and the ego well this is talking mass the mind influence on the body and by which they mean mostly sickness caused by the mind bodybodily sickness caused by the mind and theres where the freudian lives you see and his aspects of treatment and thats why you cant quite talk to him because he really means something else when you talk to him about thetan hes liable to think of the censor and just on the other side of the censor is this fellow going around in wild costume you see hes got lion skin on and hes got big arrow in his hand you know he looks like big ape and then the censors job is to say hes got four or five thetans in thisin this darn thing you know so actually psychoanalyst didnt quite know what youre talking about when you talk about thetan see thatd be bad thing to him see because its something that prowls and that youve got to repress and he wouldnt think your aims and goals were good either youre going to free one of these things hm over my dead body brother ooohh you see at that stage the middle ground of mind influencing the body theyve lost touch with the fact that they themselves are thetan see and this mind is already an extraneous otherness they dont have any responsibility for this thing its lost thing its just random and you might not be able to do anything about the mind but it sure influences the body and perhaps if you could remove psychic trauma from this mind by which they mean memory of pain or experience or shock or mental conflict and theyre not as clearcut as itwe were in dianetics by what they mean by trauma we said an engram we meant moment of pain and unconsciousness imprinted and remembered in the mind see they had such rrrrp definition see trauma well that means oh wahdawahwahwah maybe see i wouldnt even try to define it because theyd never really have given it definition so you see where the middle ground of this definition is psycho mind somatic body influence you see but mainly illness somatic has now become to mean bodily illness influence on so its mind causing bodily influence all right now lets take ittake the elevator and go downstairs into the subsubbasement and we get the final meaning of the word where it exists today which is psycho meaning brain or nerve channels same relationship to living being as telephone switchboard would have to its living operator but this is psyche or psycho and thatthat influences itself somatic soma so it is the part of the body influences part of the body and youre right into the field of medicine now whereby if youve got broken leg itll give you headache now they can understand it broken leg gives you headache yes for sure because its the body influencing the body and we have more actual psychosomatic word more condition more explanation we have to get in there with axes we have to get in there with paring knives we have to get in there with drills we have to get in there with drugs we have to get in there with shock we have to get in there with something or other thatll influence the brain we will have to influence those nerve channels and well have to string them up like taffy or well have to do something with them in order to manipulate that so please after ibroken this down for you dont go around in confusion as to why medicine practices psychiatry theres nothing else there to practice see theres nothing else present theres just that brain and theres just those neurons and they think youre batty because theyre like the fellow whos in the bottom of coal mine and hes told about the sun and hes been in this coal mine all of his life he was born in this coal mine and it doesnt have any shaft up to the top its not only one mile deep but hes in the channels which are one mile away from thefrom the stope which is one mile deep he knows youre crazy you talk about the sun you say hey boy theres sun up there someplace you know theres something causing this you know theres something going on theres something going on up there and if you walk down this channel here you walk down thisthis tunnel here this shaft and look up why youll see light haa the fellow says hahaha ahh hell turn around to some fellow working and hell say there was some nut in here the other day that said he walked hahahahaha christ hes crazy should be locked up and thats his attitude see its dead similarity because the guy is of course under his ton of coal hes got gpms pushed down on his head till he thinks that all is mass you see and never the twain shall matter this boy is total depressed degrade in other words the thetan has run its course see its down now to totality of presence it longer exists follow that well that gives you in essence the whole cycle of healing and so forth now we step back in in the area of dianetics and step back into mindand this was not all we were interested inmind influencing body we were more interested in healing in that field than we are now but it was mind influencing body and we were up pretty high scale in that because we knew that there was an eradication of this thing called mind see it wasnt then the causative agent see we had it not as total causation it wasnt the thing which was causing everything see it was somethingsomething to do something about there was that dim feeling there might be something there well we made breakthrough upstairs on this thing it was simply scientology became scientology out of dianetics because we longer had this particular concept and we had to recognize now that there was something there doing something which was not the mind and that was scientology that was the entrance point of scientology we had to call it something so we called it thetan and further investigation and examination demonstrated what this was that were dealing with the human spirit and after about years worry and work and practice and research one way or another why i found out this thing was totally separable from the body and actually separable from the mind and would turn somebody who was spinning into total sanity for matters of minutes just by these actions and exteriorization drills or research drills exteriorization is something that occurs in the normal course of processing andbut it can be forced for experimental purposes i can tell you half dozen ways to exteriorize people and demonstrate it for yourself and for their subjective reality but they get enmeshed again and embroiled in this thing called the body they get embroiled in this thing called the mind again and so forth and they lose the subjective reality very often and even doubt that they have ever been outside the guy downgoes back into the coal mine and he sits down i wonder if i ever did see the sun you know after youve persuaded somebody to look at the thing now theres then the entire cycle of deteriorization of psyche to whats medically called psychosomatic and youll find that the various schools cut in at various levels on this scale i have just given you the scale being from thetan to mind to brain versus the body but in all of these things there is some idea that something is influencing the body and making it ill that is the common idea to all of us that something is influencing the body and making it ill and that is the common denominator to all of these now nobody has been able to expertly knock out one of these illnesses so mans belief in psychosomatic healing is touching and pathetic because nobody could do it freud himself probably was able to do it some other few in his immediate vicinity were possibly able to do it but they had more command of things than they are communicating or than they ever communicated if they were effective in it however in using these things and in sometimes working in this field i have relieved some psychosomatic conditions but it was too accidental for my engineeringeducated and oriented mind for to say that i had done certainly anything very certain about it ive probably had better percentage of recovery than is quite normal maybe 30 or 40 percent or something like this fairly high but not predictable predictable in way at all because i didntcouldnt isolate the elements with which i was working so this made it very difficult for even to get the idea that there was thing called psychosomatic healing you follow that so that man has carried through the tradition is quite interesting and that it has run the gamut to the extent that it has run is horrifying now we have lost it to the degree that if you cut up somebodys neurons and somebodys brain why then somehow or another he will get healed but the only thing they really cure him of is living but there is this field and there is its scope and extent and where we practice is in the area just the upper area of psyche meaning mind versus soma body and were practicing in the upper area of thatthats in ordinary practicein thein thein the realization that there is something there beside the mind but that it is the mind that is influencing it and that there is something there that can influence the mind so we are practicing in third stage were practicing the psyche influencing the mind influencing the soma so you are therefore very advanced beyond the basic tradition of psychosomatic medicine youve got psyche thetan influencing the psycho mind influencing the soma body and the scientologist is actually treating this in three stages and it has never been treated in three stages before by anyone the early spiritual healers always addressed thetan to soma directdirect instantly well thats too big gap for the normal being who is in trouble and therefore he had success to amount to anything hed have enough success to keep him hopeful and keep him going but not enough predictable success spiritual healing which is spirit healing the body well youre not really in the field of spiritual healing because youre getting the thetan to do something about the mind which is doing something to the body your recognition is you realize the mind is doing something to the body see some remainedretained memory has held somatic in place or has done something here has held pain or an experience in place well however this has happened that the mind is doing something to the body which is causing its illness that we realize that it predisposes this body to illness something is going on in the mind that predisposes the body to illness we are the masters of predisposition that field is totally ours nobody ever dreamed of it before you see this is how the accident gets predisposed see you dont have tothis is how the guy gets to the pub see we examine the predisposition of why he went to the pub not the predisposition of the accident by pouring the alcohol down the hatch that then gave him an accident see we go ahead of this and were the only people who do now heres your next stage we recognize that the thetan can influence the mind and make it stop influencing the body and knock out that cornerstone to get over to what we would call real psychesomatic healing and what had been omitted was the center point which is the thetan knocks out the bridge of pain or upset to the body and we have found the thing that the thetan can influence he can influence the mind he may not be able to influence the body directly but he can influence the mind which is influencing the body and then he can get up to point where even he recognizes that he is himself creating the mind but thats too much to ask of him but we can have the thetan influence the mind influence the body and therefore this is brandnew concept this is something which is entirely different and very startling in this particular field this is undreamed of its never even been articulated before you see so there is where we fit in this particular line and although youve been doing it and ive been doing it and so forth we havent said in that many stages how that was and how that fitted into the tradition of psychosomatic healing and what our relationship was in that field and therefore we are something brandnew and we are something quite startling and so forth because we have found route by where we can make an effect on the body from the psyche down and we can knock out and detach the body detach the mind free the thetan so our vector is in reverse overall vector in scientology is in reverse to all these healing vectors which is mind to body our vector is lets do something with the body so it isnt troubling the thetan lets do something to the body so it isnt running up psychic traumas which then troubles the thetan and reversewise lets fix up the thetan so he can fix up the mind so he can do something to the body so that knocks out the illness in the body or the upset in the body which then takes it again out of the mind which makes the thetan feel better and were always on three one two three one two three up or one two three down this makes us brandnew very novel and very effective thank you
