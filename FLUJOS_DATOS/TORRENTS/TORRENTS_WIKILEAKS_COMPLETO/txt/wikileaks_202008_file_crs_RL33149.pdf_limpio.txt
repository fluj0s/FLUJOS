professi onalism within the construction indus try where federal contracts were concerned with their lowbidder speci fications some contractors would bid above their level of expertise and having won particular c ontract then attempt to hire workforce some were successful in this enterprise others we re not some bidders engaged in bidbrokering ie systematic acquisition of contracts followed by leasingout of the work or its transfer to another contractor whose workforce was paid at an extremely low rate with the gove rnment as consumer indirectly supporting such abusive practices there was some sugge sted persistent wering of standards and construction quality w ith little concern for the wo rkers actually engaged in construction nor with the ultimate consumer of the work1 in the process some firms may have been lessthanc ompetent to such firms the opprobrious title flybynight operators was given as the nation moved into the great pression of the 1930s when government was investing substantial amounts in public construction such itinerant jobbers and firms basing their operations on low wage s were seen as subverting the recovery process the economic impact of publically subsidized work intended to spur the economy of an especially depressed area wa s defused and the effort to provide work and contracts for distressed communities was frustrated in 1931 representative robert bacon r ny and senator ja mes davis rpa the latter having served as labor secretary in the cabinets of presidents harding coolidge and hoover proposed what woul d become known as

literature by william g whitakerby the late 1970s president carter comme nced further rest ructuring of the act process carried on by president reagan in the 1980s during subsequent years criticism of the act has tended to reflect ideological perspectives some conservative often in opposition some mostly trade uni onists and contractor s operating with union crews in support3 among labor laws davisbacon is widely known but it may not be well known the act provides wage floor and is geared to specific types of construction ie residential building highway and heavy c onstruction it is implemented on locality basis generally on county level although often misla beled the davisbacon wage is not necessarily the union wage though in cases where the union wage prevails it may be that the davisbacon rate is indeed the union rate conversely the wages paid on davisbacon projects may be somewhat higher than prescribed by the act because of demand for labor and for other ma rket considerations finally davisbacon applies only to federally c ontracted construction t hough its impact may spill over into the nonfederal sector depending upon the market and general conditions of employment perhaps the most frequently asked questi on concerning the davisbacon act is would the federal government and the taxpay ers save money if the davisbacon act were repealed or modified to narrow its scope the short answer is one really knows conversely might davisbacon result in savings to the fe deral government in its purchases of construction that too woul d seem to be an open question one might like to say forthrightly that change in the statute could have positive or negative impact however the state of current resear ch would probably be insufficient to justify just an assertion4 suspension of davisbacon under davisbacon the president is llowed to suspend the act in times of national emergency however the concept of national emergency is not defined in the statute as the implications of hurricane katr ina became known there were increasing pressures upon the bush administration for suspension of davisbacon some suggested that advocates of suspension were simply
