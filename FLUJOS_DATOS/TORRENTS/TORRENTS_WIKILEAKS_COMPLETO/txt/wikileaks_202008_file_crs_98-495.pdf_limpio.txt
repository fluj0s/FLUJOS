imagery is collected by satellites manned reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs satellite programs initiated by the intelligence community in the midst of the cold war continue to be uniquely valuable but remain costly and commercial satellite imagery now becoming available may render some government programs redundant manned reconnaissance aircraft continue to be widely used as u2s fly over iraq but the defense department and the services have often been reluctant to acquire replacement planes preferring to invest scarce funds in bombers and fighters uavs are promising and potentially cost effective but acquisition programs have been frustrati ngly slow and few operational systems are currently available despite decade of efforts often critical of the executive branchs management of imagery congress has shaped the acquisition of collection platforms through number of initiatives it has encouraged the procurement of larger numbers of smaller satellites that can be used more flexibly than the cold war systems it has urged the services to retain or acquire manned reconnaissance aircraft message that the defense department appears to have received the potential of uavs has been appreciated for some time but the slow pace of acquisition programs led congress to mandate the establishment of centralized effort in 1993 when however difficulties persisted many members called for the defense airborne reconnaissance office to be abolished step that the pentagon intends to take by october 1998 efforts to acquire and utilize imagery are complicated by two major factors in additional to inevitable budgetary considerations the first is technological imagery acquisition systems especially uavs are not mature systems they are subject to trialanderror experimentation cancellations delays and cost overruns the second is organizational imagery collection and analysis involves number of agencies inside and outside the department of defense and coordination is complex and difficult furthermore imagery is produced in response to the disparate and not inevitably compatible requirements of washington decisionmakers and military commanders congressional oversight is undertaken by number of different committees taken together these factors make imagery an especially important and difficult issue for policymakers in both

even those at tactical levels the ability to see reliable images of buildings roads bridges fortifications and troop concentrations generally enhances decisionmaking and in combat situation allows action against enemy targets that could reduce significantly the danger to friendly troops and civilians imagery is the basis for the precise attacks on enemy forces and infrastructure that are expected to be at the center of military operations in the next century new capabilities include devices to detect predetermined types of equipment such as tank even when camouflaged as well as moving targets imagery collection has undeniably become crucial element of force planning in the postcold war world imagery is obtained from satellites in space from manned aircraft with cameras configured for specific missions and more recently from unmanned aerial vehicles uavspilotless drones some little bigger than model airplanesthat can take pictures without putting pilot at risk of shootdown or capture each type of platform has strengths and limitations in collecting imagery and each requires significant investment in an era of lower defense spending the platforms are equipped with cameras electrooptical devices and synthetic aperture radars which produce radarderived images that resemble photographs congress has been greatly concerned with imagery and has taken number of initiatives in an effort to improve the effectiveness of all three types of programs there remain however number of major challenges that are likely to persist the increasing complexity of designing balanced force of satellites manned reconnaissance aircraft and uavs for uncertain postcold war missions in addition to encouraging uav acquisition congress has expressed its support for manned reconnaissance aircraft programs despite apparent reluctance among some in the department of defense dod the diffusion of decisionmaking authority for imagery collection platforms within the executive branch and congress congress mandated the establishment of centralized office in dod for airborne reconnaissance in 1993 the house voted to disestablish it in 1997 dod announced in march 1998 that it is to be dissolved and its responsibilities transferred to the services and other defense agencies by the end of fy1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs2 significant cost concerns affect the multibillion dollar satellite effort and the services ability to support manned reconnaissance aircraft congress strongly supported the development of smaller and less costly but also somewhat less capable satellites delivery of an adequate number of operational uavs has been difficult to achieve congress has specifically addressed uav procurement expressing strong complaints about perceived deficiencies in some dod efforts the increasing availability of commercial imagery and the questions regarding its ability to meet current and future government requirements although congress has supported sales of highquality commercial satellites imagery and its purchase by dod there is consensus that government satellites programs can be significantly scaled back across the board technical and organization challenges involved in making imagery available in useable formats and in realtime to appropriate decisionmakers in the wake of the persian gulf war experience congress funded number of initiatives to improve imagery dissemination but it is widely recognized that this must be an ongoing effort manned reconnaissance aircraft face an even more uncertain future although the u2 developed during the eisenhower administration continues to be employed in wide variety of reconnai ssance missions the clinton administration vetoed funding for continued operation of its more sophisticated but costly successor the sr71 blackbird the services have deactivated tactical reconnaissance aircraft in large measure for budgetary reasons and many observers believe that they have not energetically pursued planning for successor versions based on experience in the persian gulf war and in bosnia uavs show great promise for collecting imagery that is otherwise unavailable the acquisition process however has been marked by several false starts delays and for number or reasons an inability to produce operating systems in adequate numbers that some observers have blamed on the defense airborne reconnaissance office darothe muchcr iticized defense department office that has overseen uav programs several programs have been canceled despite major investments of time and money others have yet to achieve expected capabilities in 1997 the house of representatives passed legislation mandating the dissolution of daro even though subsequently enacted legislation was less sweeping in march 1998 dod announced its own plan to restructure airborne reconnaissance programs including the abolition of daro by the following october the executive branch has made what some observers view as uneven progress in the past few years in regard to imagery collection efforts even as congress has taken number of initiatives on its own major concern is organizational the responsibility for acquiring and operating collection platforms is diffuse and not widely understoo d fundamental distinction exists between national and tactical systems ie those that support the nations senior policymakers and

distinctions that are reflected in the separate organizations have produced an unnecessarily expensive and not wholly coordinated effort others maintain that congressional budgetary categories and overlapping committee jurisdictions have also contributed to this alleged problem public discussion of imagery collection systems has been limited by the complexity of the issues as well as by classification of essential data especially in regard to satellite programs whose existence was not even acknowledged until very recent years it is the purpose of this report to describe the role of imagery to policymaking and military planning to examine the capabilities and limitations of the three primary types of imagery collection platforms to review the evolving organizational relationships that govern the acquisition and use of imagery and to describe recent congressional actions regarding imagery platforms although comprehensive assessment of imagery programs would have to be classified it is possible to describe the parameters of the issue in general terms as basis for more detailed consideration the role of overhead reconnaissance overhead reconnaissance has long been important to military operations and it will be essential to postcold war planning and operations since it is closely tied to the use of precisionguided munitions and information warfare strategies expected to characterize postcold war combat designing an effective approach or architecture to imagery collection is however complicated by the different types of collection platforms by the significant problems in adapting them to different types of military environments and by administrative and oversight mechanisms that have developed both in the executive branch and congress imagery collection platforms have evolved over the course of many decades and have been integrated in military and civilian decisionmaking processes in different ways overhead imagery was first used by union forces in the civil war with photographers working from balloons in world war i aircraft undertook overhead reconnaissance of enemy forces along the trenches of northern france in the interwar years photographic equipment was installed on specially configured aircraft and airborne reconnaissance was eventually recognized as separate military discipline during world war ii aerial photography was employed for targeting bomber attacks on germany and japan and for making battle damage assessments1 in the cold war era fear of surprise conventional or nuclear attack by the soviet union drove the development of highaltitude reconnaissance aircraft such as the u2 and satellites dedicated to monitoring military activities in the vast expanseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs4 2prior to the

determining the size strength and disposition of massive soviet military machine that many feared could launch devastating attack on the united states or western europe this effort probably the most important achievement of the us intelligence community provided the basis for shaping us strategic forces and for negotiating series of major arms control agreements with moscow3 as demonstrated in the persian gulf war of 1991 innovative reconnaissance capabilities have emerged as an integral component of military technical revolution that is shaping warfighting in the postcold war world the widely publicized use of precisionguided munitions pgms in desert storm depended upon the availability of precise imagery intelligence subsequent defense planning aims to make such intelligence available in realtime at virtually all levels of military operations as part of an effort to achieve dominant battlefield awareness problems identified in desert storm relating to inadequate and incompatible communications and insufficient wide area imagery are still being addressed the need for realtime imagery has led to an emphasis on electrooptical systems that can be transmitted digitally although it is recognized that photography which usually requires longer processing times can provide uniquely valuable details and better widearea coverage4 imagery technologies continue to be refined as means are sought to acquire images at night through clouds and smoke and to isolate objects of particular interest military operations in bosnia have provided laboratory for innovative uses of imagery us satellite imagery has assisted in the location of opposing military forces as well as of hidden mass burial sites manned aircraft are regularly used for reconnaissance missions uavs are launched from ground stations first in albania and more recently in hungary different platforms with different collection capabilities can be used synergistically to acquire more complete evidence than would be possible from single collectors evidence acquired by one system can also be used to alert or crosscue another platform that is more suitable for obtaining the needed information some

operational use most lowerlevel tactical commanders do not have their own reconnaiss ance assets some commanders and even intelligence officers are not adequately trained to take advantage of imagery that is available the presence of outdated communications equipment designed for cold war missions has led to widespread reliance on workarounds adjustments to systems that allow their use in ways for which they were not designed6 with the end of the cold war the defense department and congress have undertaken number of studies and reassessmen ts to change the focus of us military forces from the threat of strategic warfare with the soviet union to an array of missions ranging from peacekeeping to major theater wars distinct feature of virtually all such studies is the importance of pgms and requirements for increasing amounts of precise realtime intelligence or information the may 1997 quadrennial defense review qdr describes information superiority as the backbone of military innovation built upon robust multisensor information grid providing dominant awareness of the battlespace to our commanders and forces7 the joint chiefs of staffs joint vision 2010 foresees military environment where with precision targeting and longer range systems commanders can achieve the necessary destruction or suppression of enemy forces with fewer systems thereby reducing the need for time consuming and risky massing of people and equipmen t improved command and control based on fused allsource realtime intelligence will reduce the need to assembl maneuver formations days and hours in advance of attacks8 the december 1997 report of the national defense panel suggests that the us may be on the cusp of military revolution characterized in part by rapidly growing potential to detect identify and track far greater numbers of targets over larger area for longer time than ever before and to order and move this information much more quickly and effectively than ever before9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs6 10 william s cohen defense reform initiative report november 1997 p iiall observers recognize that the effort to locate all potential targets within battlefield in realtime is increasingly achievable and has become crucial to success as secretary of defense william cohen has written the conceptual framework for how us forces will fight in the future is joint vision 2010 which charts path to ensure that us forces will be able to conduct decisive operations in any environment at the heart of joint vision 2010 is the ability to collect process and disseminate steady flow of information to us forces throughout the battlespace while denying the enemy ability to gain and use battlerelevant information10 capabilities for collecting and disseminating imagery have grown enormously in recent years as part of the larger expansion in information technologies but determining and acquiring an optimal combination of platforms has proven to be major challenge given the number of potential missions the different and rapidly changing technologies involved and the fact that reconnaissance platforms do not fit neatly into traditional service missions and procurement categories it is unlikely that there is any one best mix of systems indeed almost all observers would accept the need for certain amount of redundancy given the unforeseeable requirements for future military operations nonetheless uncertainties surrounding platform acquisition efforts and use by operating forces should observers suggest be given greater attention given the importance of imagery and the considerable costs involved acquiring and operating imagery collection platforms is of course only one part of the situation once imagery is obtained it must be made available to decisionmakers in useable forms processing and dissemination proved to be major bottlenecks during desert storm compatibility of systems operated by the separate services let alone the forces of allied nations has been an ongoing concern at time when joint operations have become increasingly routine in addition the great changes in availability of all types of information including imagery have significant implications for organizing military forces even if one avoids easy generalizations about revolutio ns in military affairs when precise information can be made available to tactical levels in realtime there will be more opportunity for initiativesas well as risksto be taken by leaders of smaller units as opposed to carrying out smaller parts of larger plans formulated by higher headquarters this is especially applicable in limited engagements and peacekeeping operations allard discusses the implications of this availability for the structure of military organizations information technology is uniquely affected by people their training their procedures and the time they take to perform them but the combination of these factors in combat or operational settings is constantly and curiously under estimated and we have barely begun to address the organizational implicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs7 11allard information operations in bosnia p 58 12 there is

choice of system for specific mission depends upon number of factors including platform availability the potential risk to platforms and operators and the particular type of information needed

consumers outside dod including the white house and the state department for many years the nro was enveloped in secrecy even its existence being classified since 1992 however its role has been officially acknowledged and there has been more extensive public discussion of satellite programs much cold war satellite collection was designed to acquire highly detailed images of specific targets such as icbm silos in limited geographical areas although widearea coverage had been available for some years military commanders during the persian gulf war sought larger quantities of widearea

telephoto cameras produce images with resolution as fine as can be captured by all but the lowestflying aerial platforms in the early 1960s film from satellites was parachuted back to earth and processing could take days or week by contrast todays satellites can transmit electrooptical imagery directly to ground stations in realtime14 the biggest drawback to reconnaissance satellites is their cost budget data for intelligence satellite systems is classified but the administration has indicated that the fy1996 dod space budget amounted to 115 billion and the request for dods unclassified space programs for fy1997 was 57 billion15 even without detailed budget data it is apparent that reconnaissance satellites reach multibilliondollar levels each year press source indicates that the advanced kh11 satellite costs 750 million to 1 billion each with its booster costing another 250300 million16 as result there is clearly limited number of satellites and capabilities for launching additional platforms in an emergency are limited the high costs of launching satellites have led to an emphasis on relatively small number of sophisticated systems17 satellite orbits are generally fixed and while they can be shifted to meet new requirements doing so consumes limited fuel satellite imagery is the gold standard but coverage will always be limited and expenses high in the aftermath of the reported inability of the intelligence community to discern preparations for the nuclear tests that india conducted in may 1998 observers have pointed to the growing sophistication of foreign countries in masking their activities when satellites are overhead as well as the fact that the number of satellites currently deployed are not designed to provide constant global coverage although details about satellite programs have historically been highly classified and closely guarded differences over the question of smaller satellites smallsats that are 2025 lighter and with onehalf the capacity of previous systems some of which weigh over 30000 pounds vs large satellites have been publicly discussed at some length in 1995 majority of the house intelligence committee expressed support for the smaller satellites but several members cautioned that sizable risks and substantial longterm costs could be involved in replacing the larger versions

satellites that would weigh 2025 of thencurrent systems and having 4050 of thencurrent capabilities19 major factor that led to reassessment of the plans for larger satellites known as the 8x and expected to weigh more than 20 tons was the potential cost savings involved in smaller satellites that were less expensive on unitbyunit basis and could be deployed more flexibly for specific postcold war missions rather than having to launch large satellite with many capabilities for narrow mission it was further argued that continuous production line for smaller satellites would make better use of the intelligence industrial base than occasional production of larger versions similarly new technologies could be introduced on piecemeal basis rather than requiring redesign of large system as result of these considerations the nro began work on future imagery architectures plan that would include series of smaller satellites according to recent press accounts production of smaller satellites should begin in 1998 with initial launches scheduled for 200320 the defense department purchases commercial satellite imagery from both domestic and foreign suppliers but the extent to which it can substitute for imagery produced by government satellites is unclear the senate intelligence committee echoing defense science board report has urged greater reliance on commercial imagery21 on the other hand military satellites are designed for some unique military missions that cannot be fulfilled by civilian versions the onemeter resolution of the best proposed commercial satellites may still not be as detailed as that of government satellites many observers argue in addition that maintaining satellite reconnaissance capability is vital national interest that cannot be delegated to commercial firms that in any event might not be able to meet government requirements in emergencies the national imagery and mapping agency has however recently announced commercial

reconnaissance might be advantageous for technology and security reasons but it is costly manned reconnaissance platforms manned reconnaissance aircraft both tactical and strategic have been indispensable over the last few decades for the purposes of intelligence collection and battlefield support the very nature of manned reconnaissance carries with it some advantages over platforms with human operator the manintheloop capability permits greater flexibility allowing for instant alterations to original flightplans and onthespot decisionmaking regarding unexpected targets this flexibility might allow for example manned reconnaissance aircraft to be diverted to photograph an installation that its crew noticed off of the designated flight path this initiative would gather imagery that would not have been collected by drone system or satellite in addition to their flexibility manned reconnai ssance platforms are extremely responsive in some cases reconnaissance aircraft can be quickly deployed during crisis to any part of the world in matter of hours an element of surprise can also be gained as the arrival of aerial reconnaissance assets can either be masked through stealth technologies or high speeds can be usedan important advantage over satellites whose orbits are essentially fixed and widely known by foreign governments these platforms can also be used to fly low over targets to obtain fine details although this capability is rarely drawn upon familiarity of the services with the manned reconnaissance mission is third major advantage offered by these platforms the first role of aircraft for military applications was airborne observation of ground targets many reconnaissance platforms are created by equipping familiar transport aircraft with special cameras or other sensors today most of the airframes used by the services for this task are well known and have been flown successfully for many years the air forces f16 and rc135 rivet joint

speedfaster than mach 3 and capable of flying higher than 80000 feet and with longer range and small radar cross section that arguably made it the first truly stealthy aircraft the sr71 is also capable of carrying several different types of cameras and sensors straight overhead camera resolution has been reported in the press as being nine inches while sidelooking camera shots can reportedly produce usable images in approximately 75milewide swath although resolution decreases as the distance from the plane increases29 highresolution radar system is often carried on the sr 71 as well which provides the craft with the ability to produce quality images in all weather and daylight conditions30 according to press reports more than 1000 unsuccessful attempts to intercept the sr71 especially by the north koreans have been made the sr71 was utilized for overflights of heavily defended north vietnamese air space during the vietnam war31 in addition to nearinvulnerability to air defenses the sr71 also holds the advantage of surprise while satellite paths are typically predictable and regular the sr71 can be sent out to an area of interest at any time its speed gives it the capability to photograph up to 100000 square miles in an hour and limits an adversarys window of opportunity to intercept the plane or ability to hide sensitive activities32 the expense of operating the sr71 has

lineitem veto by president clinton on october 14 1997 because the defense department had determined that it would not make significant contribution to us military capability33 in november 1997 after the iraqis threatened to shoot down any u2s flown over their country some members and outside observers suggested that the president reconsider his veto since the sr71 is considerably less vulnerable to interdiction than the u2 proponents of the sr71 argue that the incremental cost of retaining the two planes is relatively low given that they are in operational condition they add that sr71 can obtain intelligence with low risk of shootdown and loss of pilot further they note that the uavs designed to supply capabilities possessed by the sr 71 may not be deployed for some time opponents of the sr71 counter that the aircraft is very expensive to operate and that intelligence that it can collect can be obtained from other platforms they also maintain that there is relatively low risk to u2s flying over iraq given highaltitude flightpaths the availability of armed escorts and degradation of iraqi air defenses the u2 and sr71 were originally designed for national intelligence collection while the services had their own reconnaissance aircraft to collect imagery for tactical requirements in recent years many of the services aircraft devoted to imagery collection such as the rf4s operated by the marine corps and the air force were phased out of inventories prior to desert storm in large measure as result of cost considerations as well as the potential availability of other collection platforms there is however concern in congress and elsewhere that the deemphasis of manned platforms may have been excessive especially since existing and programmed uavs cannot replace the capabilities they have demonstrated air force rc135s which are modified tankers primarily tasked with sigint missions have been scheduled to be fitted with new engines to permit their use

receiving the consent of oversight committees41 manned reconnaissance aircraft are not without significant limitations perhaps most importantly the manned reconnaissance platforms in use today are vulnerable to interception by hostile air defenses the vulnerability of manned platforms to interception necessitates restricting their operation to the fringes of the battlefield or in such areas where air superiority has been achieved although cameras and sensors do have considerable range especially those sensors used for sigint missions standoff collection may not produce imagery with clarity and detail equal to what can be obtained directly overhead manned reconnaissance aircraft also involve considerable costs both for procurement and for maintenance especially in the case of unique aircraft types such as the sr71 efforts to obtain procurement and operations and maintenance funding for reconnaissance systems must compete with other programs often with higher priorities sometimes directly related to core service missions closely tied to the problem of interception are the political considerations involved in overflying another sovereign nation just as the soviet union vehemently objected to u2 overflights in the 1950s few states today will quietly accept such violation of their sovereignty and airspace country that is being overflown despite its objections will almost certainly denounce the united states in international political forums or attempt to intercept future overflights the political ramifications of this exposure or the danger of losing pilot may be sufficient to preclude these types of flights another drawback to the manned reconnaissance effort is the need for basing reconnaissance missions can be operated from us base but distances to areas of interest may be too long and overflights rights over foreign countries not granted foreign bases may be available but in crisis situation the host country may decline to allow us reconnaissance flights to operate from its territory although strategic platforms like the u2 and sr71 have tremendous reach when coupled with aerial refueling some corners of the world would escape even their grasp time over target is another issue concerning manned reconnaissance platforms loitering over target areas allows for larger quantity of sigint and imagery to be captured and also allows for easier recognition of actively developing situations on the ground although some platforms such as the u2 and the rc135 have the ability to loiter over target areas for number of hours

pp 32 34unmanned aerial vehicles uavs unmanned aerial vehicles offer several advantages over manned aircraft as well as satellites although uavs were used during the vietnam conflict the absence of realtime communications capability and precise locating data limited their effectiveness uavs proved their value during desert storm when they gathered information to support both army and marine corps operations the widespread use of tactical uavs could significantly enhance the availability of intelligence to lower level commanders by providing them with an imagery collection platform under their direct control47 some observers believe that high altitude endurance uavs will eventually be able to capture imagery that at present can be collected only by satellites conclusive judgment on eventual uav capabilities as yet unproven cannot be made especially in view of the classified nature of the evidence uavs matter how stealthy will probably remain somewhat more vulnerable to interception than satellites in some circumstances they may have to be launched and controlled from ground sites outside of the united states that may themselves be vulnerable to attack and when development costs are taken into consideration uav programs may not necessarily be less expensive than satellites major advantage of uavs is that pilot is required to operate them avoiding unnecessary casualties has always been goal of us military operations and uavs support that objective inasmuch as they can be sent into heavily defended airspace without raising concerns about losing pilots48 in addition highly capable uavs are being designed and tested that are fraction of the size of manned reconnaissance aircraft thus cutting down on their radar signatures and producing measure of stealthiness unrelated to materials or speed uav designs that allow for extremely long operating endurance as well as high altitudes are expected to replicate some of the capabilities of reconnaissance satellites at fractions of the cost current uav planning is based on 6 systems tactical uavs pioneer derived from an israeli system with procurement starting in 1985 with nine systems

largescale production over the past two decades dod has invested about 2 billion in uav development and procurement for fy1998 the administration requested some 504 million for funding the uav effort

outrider reportedly costs about 350000 for one air vehicle these sums while sizable pale in comparison with the cost of modern fighter aircraft that can cost 80 million each there have been however distinct problems with uav programs the uav acquisition process has been prolonged and in the view of some observers highly inefficient the establishment of dodwide procurement effort while minimizing duplication of effort has had the disadvantage of removing uav procurement fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs19 51 the cia has also been involved in procuring uavs tactical version known as the gnat

years of effort relatively few uavs have been or are currently deployed in military operations as result there is not yet sizable number of personnel experienced with uav operations especially in combat operations nor has mature infrastructure been established to support them or to utilize their imagery production capabilities some observers suggest that there has been tendency to seek allpurpo platforms that can be used in almost any contingency by introducing wide range of different sensors and communications equipment procurement officials may make planned uavs overly expensive with designs that are not necessarily optimized for the most likely types of missions in addition the effort to make uavs usable by more than one service has also introduced complexities and delays especially difficult are problems involved in making uavs recoverable onboard ships other observers note that current and planned uavs while less costly than manned aircraft and satellites are not so inexpensive that they can really be considered as expendable especially when the costs of surveillance and communications equipment are considered other observers caution that foreign countries will eventually develop effective countermeasures against uavs although one of the advantages of uavs is that they do not require pilot to operate them advocates of manned aircraft would point out this can also be an inherent weakness of the uav human intelligence in the cockpit allows for adjustment to unexpected circumstances and exploitation of opportunities as they arise along with some members of congress the general accounting office gao has been especially critical of dods efforts at uav procurement both before and after the creation of daro in 199351 the use of actds instead of customary procurement procedures has been criticized as leading to acquisition of available platforms that cannot meet actual military requirements normal procurement processes would be used for subsequent operational units incorporating changes based on evaluation of the actd taken as whole according to gao dods uav acquisition efforts to date have been disappointing since aquila began in 1979 of eight

52httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs20 53uav annual report fy1997 p 2defenders of the uav effort maintain that the process is lengthy because of the need to sort out requirements of different missions and because the technology is new and untried mishaps with test vehicles while regrettable are an inevitable part of acquiring new platforms as they were with the satellite program uav proponents argue that the performance of uavs in desert storm and in bosnia fully justifies continued procurement but that the arrival of significant numbers of operational units will take some years given current constraints on defense spending according to daro director major general kenneth r israel fy1997 has been transition year the uav community has persevered both in meeting acquisition challenges and in integrating projected uav capabilities into military operations wherever useful53 even the strong criticisms of daro by some in the 105th congress did not reflect opposition to uavs but rather determination to make more and better uavs available organizational complexities in addition to the technological challenges involved in collecting and using imagery are complex organizati onal relationships among number of dod and intelligence community agencies and the overlappin g responsibilities of several congressional committees the requirements of number of agencies and budgetary realities have led all observers to conclude that it would be impossible either to establish single entity responsible for collecting analyzing and disseminating imagery from satellites manned aircraft and uavs or to let each agency undertake its own imagery effort in isolation from others thus it has been found necessary to establish coordinative mechanisms that inevitably involve compromises and some overlap large measure of complexity also derives from distinctions between the two longestablished categories of national and tactical intelligence national intelligence refers to information necessary for washingtonlevel policymaking by the white house federal agencies and the congress national intelligence would include such topics as the location of foreign missile silos dispositions of military forces in hostile states and evidence of production facilities for weapons of mass destruction tactical intelligence on the other hand refers to information needed by military commanders in specific situationsthe organization of opposing forces their location their equipment missions and immediate intentions national intelligence agencies such as the central intelligence agency cia the national security agency nsa the defense intelligence agency dia the national reconnaissance office nro and the national imagery and mapping agency nima have major roles in the collection analysis and dissemination of nationallevel imagery to the white house and the department of state and defense tactical commanders throughout the world deploy imagery collection platforms

services for tactical purposes distinctions between national and tactical intelligence can easily blur especially in crises in which national policymakers focus intensely on local developments on an hourbyhour or minutebyminute basis advances in computer and communications capabilities have meant that national intelligen ce can be shared with tactical commanders in realtime and tactical data can be readily forwarded to washington headquarters programs have been established to facilitate the tactical exploitation of national intelligence capabilities and conversely national exploitation of tactical capabilities54 nonetheless the distinction is important for understanding many of the questions relating to overhead imagery national and tactical programs appear in different parts of the defense and intelligence budgets and some observers express concern that budget items have been brought together late in the budgetary cycle and that coordination has not always been apparent tactical collection systems whose primary function is to provide targeting data of immediate use to weapons system are not programmed and budgeted as intelligence systems but as operational systems even though they can provide important information on designated targets and their environment55 in congress national programs are directly overseen by the two intelligence committees the senate select committee

aircraft are currently operated by the four military services as such acquisition efforts are included in the services research and developmen t and procurement programs that are submitted to congress as noted above the services have tended to move away from dedicated reconnaissance aircraft and to rely on reconnaissance variants of combat or transport aircraft this tendency however complicates efforts to achieve comprehensive imagery capability especially one that is coordinated with systems managed by other agencies in some cases as also noted above the services have sought imagery collection programs without coordination with other services agencies or appropriate congressional oversight committees organizational disputes have affected uav programs for over decade after the abandonment of the illfated aquila uav effort by the army in 1987 observers argued that the services consistently downplayed uavs because of preference for piloted aircraft derisively termed the silk scarf syndrome and other capabilities closer to their core missions sensitive to arguments that there is an inherent bias especially among air force and navy aviators in favor of manned aircraft and concerned with limited progress in uav acquisition in 1993 congress mandated consolidated dod wide effort that led to the establishment of daro 59 it was hoped that consolidated dodwide effort would accomplish more in an area of new technologies that were not closely tied to any individual service subsequently however congressional critics concluded that daro has had limited success in fielding uav systems and some members urged that the organization should be disestablished and its responsib ilities transferred to the director of the defense intelligen ce agency in 1997 the house

stated concerns with respect to both manned and unmanned airborne reconnaissance yet there has been little improvement noted the conferees saw daros role as providing management oversightcoordinating budget developments ensuring adherenc to standards and interoperability requirements and avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort such oversight according to the conference report should not include execution of operations and maintenance funding or acting as the acquisit ion agent for airborne reconnaissance systems62 although daro did survive congressional criticisms in 1997 in march 1998 dod announced that as part of reorganization of the office of the secretary of defense osd daro would be dissolved and its responsibilities transferred to the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command control communications intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c3isr that office will provide policy guidance develop longrange plans and allocate resources to the services and retain funding supervision the services will become responsible for managing uav programs for the outrider and predator observers are divided over the extent to which the delays and difficulties in uav acquisition plans can be attributed to managerial shortcomings by daro but giving the services responsibilities for increasingly important uav programs could it is hoped lead to more energetic attainment of the goals the new organization is designed to provide better integration of space and airborne platforms the organizational complexities surrounding imagery programs are likely to persist while all parties appear to be content to let the military services acquire and operate manned reconnaissance aircraft largely for tactical missions new arrangements have been established to ensure that satellite and uav programs involve close coordination among different agencies to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and that both national and tactical requirements are satisfied

1996 64 house report 105508 p 26imagery for the future issues for congress the nations imagery effort in coming decades will probably be characterized by larger numbers of smaller satellites by continued reliance on manned reconnaissance aircraft and by greater availability of uavs major questions remain to what extent uavs can replace or supplement either satellites or manned aircraft to what extent commercial satellite imagery can satisfy government needs and the size and shape of the manned reconnaissance effort congress will have major role in shaping the resolution of these issues as it has influenced imagery programs in the past congress supported highly secret initiatives to acquire u2s sr71s and satellites beginning in the 1950s in the 1990s congress has encouraged the acquisition of uavs and has made specific if changing recommendations regarding the uav procurement infrastructure congress has championed the shift to smaller satellites and has emphasized the continuing need for manned reconnaissance aircraft uav procurement is almost certain to remain special congressional focus some observers express confidence that recent changes in dod management of reconnaissance efforts will improve the uav acquisition process but others express skepticism that differing requirements for uavs can be easily resolved or that production efforts can be streamlined in the near term congress has not been concerned only with the procurement of imagery collection systems it is widely recognized that analyzing or exploiting the vast quantities of imagery collected is major challenge and potential source of waste and duplication of effort in some cases imagery is collected at considerable expense only to be stored while analysts are overwhelmed with other materials staff study conducted in 1996 by the house intelligence committee described such difficulties and discussed number of initiatives that might enable imagery analysts to make use of technologies like automated target recognition systems and more flexible and user friendly workstations that could enable them to support intelligence consumers better 63 the house version of the fy1999 intelligence authorization bill calls for study of these and related problems to be completed by march 199964 some observers also argue that many midlevel personnel are not adequately trained

the executive branch but congress has oversight responsibilities that some observers expect to be actively exercised in coming years given the dynamic technologies it remains uncertain whether it is possible to design master plan that would yield an optimal mix in light of the different advantages and limitations of specific platforms for different types of missions daro is recognized to have made an important contributi on in developing imageryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98495crs26 architectures for multiple systems to encourage interoperability but establishing comprehensive plan will be administratively difficult given the acquisition processes for the different platforms that are also overseen by different congressional committees the competing needs of national and tactical consumers and the unique concerns of each of the four services it is especially hard to design imagery platforms for the wide variety of contingencies in terrain littoral areas or far inland deserts or mountains and opposing forces armored divisions to urban guerillas even the most careful study undertaken by experienced experts could produce mix of platforms and systems that would not be optimally configured for the next crisis in the fastmoving postcold war environment some observers suggest that congress should undertake overall assessment of all imagery efforts although such an effort would have to be based on contributions from several oversight committees in any event congress will need to balance funding requirements of imagery collection against other military and intelligence requirements
