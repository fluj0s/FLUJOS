congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code 93355 plant closings mass layoffs and worker dislocations data issues march 29 1993 mary jane bolle specialist in labor economics foreign affairs defense and trade division plant closings mass layoffs and worker dislocations data issues summary for at least 15 years members of congress have continued to ask how many us manufacturing plants have closed for at least 15 years they have continued to ask how many us manufacturing plants have relocated abroad and where have they gone for at least 15 years the answer has been for the most part those questions cant be answere d based on gove rnment data over the years congress has undertaken two legislative efforts to learn the answers to these questions first it ma ndated collection and publication of plant closing data under the job training partnership act of 1982 six years later it mandated notification of state dislocated worker units created under the 1982 act when major plant closing or other layoff event was scheduled to occur this second mandate was part of the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn of 1988 because these two laws are thus linked together the potential exists for data collected under the warn act to be fed into or coordinated with the data system established under the job traini ng partnership act to avoid duplication or to act as check for consistency during the continuing congressional bates on the north american free trade agreement plant closing questions have arisen again but in more specific form how many plants are moving to mexico what industries and what states are the plants from how many us workers are losing their jobs as result in an attempt to obtain answers to these questions the senate governmental affairs committee subcommittee on oversight of government management asked the secretaries of labor and commerce to report on all data systems that provide information on plant closings plant reloca tions layoffs worker dislocations and exportrelated job creations based upon crs analysis of the agen cies responses which include data sources beyond the two mentio ned above it appears that s till after two legislative attempts to mandate collec tion of these data the gove rnment publishes counts of us plant closings and almost information on plant relocations options for strengthening the data systems include addressing three main weaknesses inadequate data prog ram design plant closing defi nition that misses its mark and

table 1 overview of dol and doc sources for data on p l n t c l s i n g s m s s l f f s n d w r k r d i s l c t i n s9plant closings mass layoffs and worker dislocations data issues in the past two decades the nature of us industry has changed pressured by domestic and international competition businesses have exhibited new kind of dynamism and mobility aiming to improve competitiveness businesses automate they tighten up downsize or decentralize operations they open close expand consolidate or relocate plants an important side effect from all this activity is trail of american workers dislocated from their jobs by changing production processes and shifting production locations yet comprehensive data are not available to show overall and by industry how many plants close permanently in the united states each year how many plants relocate to another state nother country or another re gion ie to asiapacific or to mexico how many plants automate or downsize producti on processes and how many workers lose their jobs as result of each of these changes why data are needed congressional policy decisions especially those that may impact us jobs could benefit from data tracking this dynamic industria l movement such data would help policymakers focus on trends that might be exacerbated assisted or targeted by specific trade training job creation or education policy decisions the consequences from lack of data are that certain policy decisions are made to great extent in the dark the implications of this lack of data are evident in the debate on the north american free trade agreement nafta according to recent surveys of the departments of labor and commerce comprehensiv federal data are regularly published on how many plants have relocat ed to mexico where the plants have relocated from what industries they are i n and how many us jobs have been lost as result nor are there data on how many us jobs have been crowded out by mexican imports what little data that do exist are often sketchy and not available in press releases or ot her printed publications complete government data base tracks business decisions prenafta therefore data on busine ss relocations to mexico as result of mexicos maquiladora program have b een hard to come by without full data on current relocation trends it becomes even more difficult to estimate with any reliability the potential for additional plants moving to mexico and the consequences of such dislocation after the added incentive of nafta crs2 congressional efforts to establish data base since the 1970s various members of congress have expressed urgency in obtaining information about mass layoffs plant closings and plant relocations to areas either within or outside the united states and the resulting loss of jobs the objective in obtaining this information is to learn more about the perceived erosion of the us manufacturing sector and the alleged export of us jobs to this end congress mandated the tablishment of two systems in the department of labor dol one system was labor market information program for collecting and publishing each year data on permanent layoffs and plant closings this system was mandated by the job training partnership act jtpa of 1982 pl 97300 the mass layoff and plant closing survey mls was undertaken by the department of labor in re sponse to this mandate th other system stemmed from congressional passage of the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn in 1988 in this law congress required that employers notify three bodies workers state dislocated worker units created under jtpa and local governments of impending major mass layoffs plan t closings or plant relocations yet the statistical systems produced by the dol in response to the congressional mandate to track plant closing plant relocation and worker displacement appear to miss the mark to varying degrees in meeting these objectives the incompleteness of the resulting data stems from three main causes program design that is inadequate to meet congressional objectives definition of plant closing that does not coincide with the ge nerally accepted defin ition and publication of partial instead of complete data survey results in order to document and examine the issue of data adequacies and inadequacies this report aims first to identify the extent to which certain statistical programs of the dol and the department of commerce doc meet or fall short of providing needed information on mass layo ffs plant closings worker dislocations and the counterbalancing eff ects of exportrelated job cr eation and second to offer options for changes to improve the usef ulness to congress of the data being published congressional survey in december of 1992 letters were sent out by the subcommittee on oversight of government management of the senate committee on governmental affairs to the secretaries of labor and commerce the purpose of these letters was to obtain documentation on the availability of data tracking plant closings mass layoffs worker dislocations and counterbalancing exportre lated job creation the motivation behind the request as stated in the respective letters was to obtain data for the nafta debate each agency was asked to identify data sources that are readily available and in an organized form tracking the data requested each agency was further asked to indicate whether the data were available over each of the last 10 years by numbercrs3 1 information on plant relocations to other pa rts of the united states is also an important aspect of the plant relocation phenomenon but wa s not specifically requested in the lettersof workers by industry and occupation by geographic area and by reasons for various closing and layoff events agen cies were asked for information on the availability of data for eight specific layoff events or subject areas the first four focus on establishment events and workers affected the remaining four focus more exclusively on workers or jobs affected the eight layoff events are 1 plant closures in the united states 2 plant relocations to foreign countries1 3 plant downsizings 4 layoffs 5 dislocated or displaced the words are interchangeable here workers 6 dislocated or displaced workers receiving trade adjustment assistance taa 7 jobs lost in the united stat from import penetration and 8 exportrelated jobs created in addition the dol was specifically aske d about the mass layoff and plant closing survey and the worker adjustment nd retraining notification warn data program finally dol was also asked to identify steps it could take to collect and make the requested information which is currently unpublished available to the public in the future together with the co sts and benefits of taking such steps responses by the departments of labor and commerce both agencies responded to the congressiona l request in the first half of january 1993 with memos and data sources th docs role concerned mainly with commerce is really secondary to the dol s role concerned mainly with labor in providing plant closing plant relocation and ma ss layoff data in particular the dol submitted data on some of the layoff events for those layoff events for which it did not publish the requested data it failed to report whether some of the data might be available unpublished in its data bases nor did the dol response identify steps that the agen cy could take to collect and make such data available to the public in the future table 1 on page 11 prepared by crs summarizes the extent to which the sources offered by dol and doc provide data requested by the committee the analysis which follows discusses in greater detail the ability and inability of the data sources to provide answers to the questions asked succeeding section reviews some options for making the surveys more useful in providing policymakers with answers to the questi ons here enumerated crs4 2 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics mass layoffs in 1990 february 1992 p 1 3 for the fy 1992 line item funding the program was included in the presidents budget appropriations committees subsequently inst ructed the dol to fund the program from money appropriated under the job training part nership act and amended jtpa to reserve 6 million for the mls program from the amounts appropriated under title iv of the jtpa the secretary of labor agreed to fund th program in fy 1992 as directed she subsequently notified congress that she did not intend to be bound by report language for fy 1993 if she were directed to use jt pa national account money for the mls again which she was what will happen to the mls under the new administration is unclear information for this paragraph was taken fro m letters exchanged between the secretary of labor and chairmen of several committees and from discussions with the dol office producing the mls surveydata sources the dol response was somewhat limite d in providing comprehensive responses to the subcommittee both in term s of providing comp lete reports and in terms of providing tailed information on material in the data bases that is not reflected in published documents because of this the analysis below draws on some additional information from crs files and pr evious crs research on the data bases additional information to answer the subcommittees questions may exist in the data bases beyond that reported here mass layoff and plant closing survey as mentioned the mass layoff and plant closing survey mls is the department of labors response to the c ongressional mandate in section 462 of the job training partnership act jtpa that the secretary of labor shall develop and maintain statistical data relating to permanent layoffs and plant closings specifically required by jtpa was that the secretary publish an annual report including 1 the number of permanent pl ant closings 2 the number of workers displaced 3 the location of the affected facilities and 4 the types of industries involved the mls program obtains reports on layo ffs involving at least 50 workers and lasting more than 30 days information on mass layoffs is gathered from each states unemployment insurance data base th state agencies then contact these establishments by telephone for additional information2 at present the mls survey has been susp ended collection of the data for the program by states ende d in november of 19923 what follows is discussion of the adequacy of the mls to meet the data needs of policymakers as iterated above plant closings despite the specificity of the jtpa requirement that the secretary of labor publish an annual report including the number of permanent plant closings the mls falls short of the mandate in two ways crs5 4 six relocations were reported for 1991 disl ocating 810 workers and 5 for the first half of 1992 dislocating 1270 workers 5 these industries are rubberplastics with 3 layoff events for 1991 dislocating 443 workers and electrical and ectronic equipment with 4 layoff events in 1991 dislocating 603 workers first it fails to count and tabulate many of what are generally considered to be plant closings even though they may involve 50 or more workers this is because dol defines permanent plant closings to in clude only those closings which represent the final termination of the entire physical plant according to the dol letter submitted to the committee if parts of the establishment branch or department were closing the establishment was cons idered to be staying open thus the way dol counts plant closings if genera l motors gm assembly plant closes in ypsilanti michigan this would not be c ounted as plant closing if an accounting or other office physically associated with the plant remains open thus the dol counting of plant closings may signifi cantly underreport the actual number of plant closings occurring in the united states second the mls fails to report on or even to mention plant closings in any of its published tables even though ta bulation of plant closings was the stated requirement in the congressi onal mandate included in the jtpa only one sentence in the lengthy annual reports generally over 100 pages each even addresses the issue of plant closings in the report issued in 1992 for example th at sentence reads p 2 closure of the establishments results in about 14 percent of the layoff events in 1988 the term plant closing was dropped from the title of the mls document and the initial title report on mass layoffs and plant closings was simplified and shortened to mass layoffs plant relocations even though the mls reports contain data on plant closings except for the one summary sent ence discussed above they do include line item counts for relocation events both domestic and overseas and total number of workers affected for the country as whol as well as by state the mls does not include any indication of industries represented by the plant relocations geographic areas from which the relocations are sourced or to which the relocations are targeted the dol letter responding to the subc ommittee inquiry notes that in 1991 information was obtained from employers specifying the country to which the establishment was relocating when outo fcountry moves were reported dol also included two supplemental unpublished sheets which reported number of relocations to mexico for 1991 and the firs t half of 1992 and the number of workers affected4 the sheets did not identify industr ies represented in the relocation to mexico alt hough they re ported on overseas relocation for two industries without regard to target country5 the dol did not give any indication of industry or geographic identity for any relocations within the united states it is possible that such data does not exist in the data base however it woul d be useful to track relocation within the united statescrs6 6 for 1987 the mls survey reports 16 percent as many workers dislocated from import competition as the taa figures show for 1990 the mls survey reports 48 percent as many workers downsizing the dol letter responding to the subcommittee inquiry indicates that data on actual downsizing of corporations are not available however dol may have in its da ta base such data by companies since it includes line item tallying events and workers on one aspect of initial downsizing automation dols letter notes that the agency cannot provide information on specific companies that have relocated or downsized their wo rkforces because data are collected under pledge of confidentiality to respondents however perhaps data in the database at the company level could be aggregated to the industry level to protect the privacy of individual companies layoffs while the mls report provides only sketchy results for plant closings it provides detailed aggregate information on the number of layoff events and the number of workers affected the survey provides layoff data by industry but not by occupation by state and by reasons for the event there are two weaknesses in the reported data on layoff events first the data do not provide geographic or industry detail on the reason for the separation or layoff temporary layoff events could be grouped together and data could be published by industry and by region such da ta may be available in the data base although the dol letter responding to th committee inquiry gave indication on this one way or the other second mls data from early years are not comparable with mls data from more recent years because between 1986 and 1992 the survey coverage expanded from its original 26 states to 46 states plus the district of columbia california is major state not included jobs lost from import penetration the trade adjustment assistance taa data discussed below reflect the number of workers for whom imports contributed importantly to their job loss data on the number of workers for whom imports contributed somewhat to their unemployment is harder to find the dol letter responding to the s ubcommittee inquiry reports that both conceptually and empirically the measur ement of job loss due to import demand is difficult and that at present official data series fully identifies the extent of such activity the mls survey does howev er contain line item called import competition noting the number of layoff events and related worker separations this number purports to reflect jobs lost from import penetration what is notable about these figures is that they show fewer workers dislocated from import penetration than do taa data6 the reason for this discrepancy is unclear one possibility is the fact that the mls data only included 26 states in 1987 and larger but still incomplete list of 45 states in 1990 another possibility is that the mls survey counts jobs lost to import penetration only when this is the single most important reason for dislocationcrs7 7 businesses of 100 or more workers constitute about 2 percent of all businesses in the united states but employ about 45 percent of all private workers according to the us department of commerce publication county business patterns 1989whereas the taa data could reflect import competition as one of several important reasons for dislocation worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn the warn act of 1988 pl 100379 requi res that all businesses with 100 or more workers give 60 days advance notice to workers local governments and state dislocated worker units befo re closing plant or laying off substantial number of workers according to formula in the w data on notifications under the warn system are collected by each state and summary data are forwarded to the dol the summary data provided to the committee by dol include only total numbers of warn notices for the united states the weakness of the warn data transmitted by dol is that they are not separated out from other jtpa data there are data reported for the number of work ers affected by warn notices for type of layoff event permanent or temporar or for industries or geographic areas affected yet according to dol c overed employer cont emplating qualifying plant closing or layoff event must report minimum of information to the state dislocated worker unit including the name and address of the em ployment site the name and telephone num ber of company official and the number of workers affected the employer must keep add itional detailed information including the nature of the layoff event temporary permanent and if permanent whether it is plant closing etc readily available the warn system is certainly potentia l source of data on closings layoffs and relocations among plants with 100 or more workers thus potentially capturing data on layoff closing and relocation activities of multinational corporations7 if the warn data reporting system were structured to capitalize on this potential it could be used either as double check on the data received under the mls system or as funnel to feed data into the mls system displaced worker survey the displaced worker survey is conduc ted every other year as survey of households as opposed to establishments it is joint product of the doc and the dol the doc as part of its current population survey inquires doortodoor whether any member of the household was displaced from his or her job at any time during the past 5 years because of plant closure or relocation abolition of shift or slack work if the answer is yes ries of questions then are asked the doc submits the results of the survey to th dol which tabulates and publishes them in the report displaced workers survey such as the displaced worker survey is not as precise sampling tool as an actual count of workers and events as reflected in the mls and the warn data systems errors in surveys can result from selfreporting as well as fromcrs8 8 this figure was derived from comparing th number of displaced workers with three years tenure with the number of displaced workers regardless of tenure this latter figure is included in unpublished data nonsampling ie failure to represent all units within the sample they can also result from sampling variability that is variations that occur by chance because sample rather than an entire population is surveyed plant closing data the displaced worker survey is notable in that it is the only government survey to report by industry the number of workers who report themselves to be specifically dislocated by plant closings or plant relocations the main weaknesses of the survey are th ree first it reports on the number of workers displaced from plant closure not on the number of establishments or plants closing this is only weakness of the survey from the standpoint of the policymaker wanting count of plant closings in the united states by its nature as household survey the displaced worker survey was never intended to tally establishments second each everyotheryear survey represents longrange snapshot in time collecting aggregate sampling data on all dislocations that have occurred within the previous five years thus the survey produces da ta on yearbyyear dislocations third in its displaced workers report the dol publishes detailed data only on workers employed three or more years with the employer thus published results of this survey ignore more than half th displaced worker population covered by the survey8 although dol did not mention this in any of the materials it submitted to the committee it does have data for all dislocated workers regardless of tenure in its data base and does ma ke this data available to re questers who know to ask for it displaced workers t h displaced workers report includes in tables considerable detail about displaced workers their numbers the industries and occupations from which they were dislocat ed their geographic distribution and even the reasons for dislocation the weakness of the report in giving picture of displaced workers echoes the weaknesses of the report in measuring plan t closings iterated in reasons two and three immediately above it does not affo rd yearbyyear counts of displaced workers in addition it only describes less than half th total universe of displaced workers covered in the survey trade adjustment assistance program trade adjustment assistance program data submitted by dol for the years 19751990 reflect dislocated workers receiving trade adjustment assistance benefits these are workers for whom determinati on was made as required by the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 that imports contributed importantly to their dislocation according to the dol letter responding to the committee inquiry data are alsocrs9 9 crs is aware that in addition to information submitted to the subcomm ittee by dol current data are published monthly by dol employment and trai ning administration office of trade adjustment in addition the federal register publishes the name and location of each plant for which trade adjustment assistance is approved 10 indirect exports refer to manufactured input upstream to produce the intermediate inputs and capital goods and downstream to complete the final products ready for exportavailable by state and by standard industr ial classification code ie by industry this data source is reasona bly complete as it stands9 exportrelated jobs several publications were submitted by doc and dol in response to request for information on exportrelated jobs the publication trade and employment is the product of joint effort by the doc nd the dol this pub lication is of limited value for measuring exportrelated jobs because it measures not jobs created by exports but rather total jobs in industrie s that had at least 20 percent of their 1987 employment levels tied to direct or indirect manufactured exports10 as the dol letter points out the change in employment data primarily reflect domestic consumption trends rather than exportrelated jobs the doc publication us jobs supported by merchandise exports does measure exportrelated jobs the data results come from university of maryland inputoutput model based in part on the doc bureau of economic analysiss input output tables the report includes for the years 19831990 estimates on both direct and indirect employment requirements for shipments of merchandise exports from all sectors of the economy agriculture ot her

sources addressed above the mls survey the warn program and the displaced worker survey some options for strengthening these programs are included here the doc data sources are fairly complete althoug h data on exportrelated job creation by industry within each state would be useful options for strengthening the mls warn and displaced worker data syst ems under dol could include mls data system 1 the suspended mls data pr ogram could be reinstated 2 the mls could redefine plant closing to include all permanent closings of branches or major depar tments as well as physical plants of an establishment 3 the mls could then collect nd report data on plant closings 4 the mls could provide counts of workers by i ndustry and by geographic location for separate permanent events including plant closings plant relocations and other permanent layoffs aut omation downsizing etc warn data system 1 legislative requirement or dol regulation could mandate restructuring the compilation of data by state dislocated work er units from data reported by employers thus data could be collected and reported on permanent plant closings relocations and other permanent layoff ev ents including the geographic area the industry and the number of work ers associated with each event 2 data from the warn system possibl could be fed into and coordinated with the more comprehensive mls system this coordination could result in single system for producing data on plant clos ings relocations and permanent layoff events avoiding duplication of effort and expense displaced worker survey 1 the dol could pull from its data system and publish data on all workers not just data on workers with three or more years tenure with an employer currently such data are available only to those who know to ask for it because these data are already in the data base publication of more co mplete data could be done with minimum expense 2 the dol could publish data on the number of workers displaced by state or geographic region for categories of layoff ev ents including permanent plant closures plant relocations and automationdownsizing crs13 conclusions the options mentioned for possible changes in the mls warn and displaced worker reporting systems could help provi policymakers with much needed data tracking us plant closings plant relocati ons and worker dislocations the results could enable these three systems to provide data both by industry and by geographic area for the major types of permanent layoff events the question arises about duplication in data production if ll three systems are producing data to their potential the ba sic potential for duplication lies with the warn and the mls system which are both surveys of establishments the displaced worker survey polls only households and thus affords count of establishments the displaced worker survey is potentially important check on the other two systems in its counting of workers displaced from such events as plant closings and plant relocations events which employer s may be reluctant to divulge however for the displaced worker survey to be truly useful for policymaking purposes data on all displaced workers not just the longte nured ones as is currently the case need to be reported since these data on the entire universe of displaced workers are already tabulated in the system the cost of reporting it shoul d be fairly minimal while the warn data production system could potentially be duplicative of the mls system the reverse is not the case because the warn system is potentially less inclusive once the mls system includes all states the warn system only reports closing and layoff events in cas involving businesses of 100 or more workers ideally what could evolve with the warn and mls systems is data coordination between the two systems efficiency in structuring single data system from these two might well save the us g overnment money in the longer term at present neither the mls nor the warn establishment data collection systems provides needed comprehensive data on plant closings both data collection systems miss the mark and the mls system also misses its legislative mandate to provide data on plant closings plant relocati ons and other permanent layoff events tabulated by industry and by geographic location if these data were available policymakers could use the resulting report on trends in i ndustrial restructuring to help them make informed policy decisions especially important are decisions affecting us workers and us jobs such as those surrounding the debate on nafta
