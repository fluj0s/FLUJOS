financial economics government and finance division insurance regulation issues background and current legislation summary the individual states have been acknowledged as the primary regulators of insurance as far back as 1868 since the 1945 mccarranferguson act this system has operated with the specific blessing of congress but has also been subject to periodic scrutiny and suggestions that the time may have come for congress to take back the regulatory authority that it granted to the states in the late 1980s and early 1990s congressional scrutiny was largely driven by the increasing complexities of the insurance business and concern over whether the states were up to the task of ensuring consumer protections particularly insurer solvency congressional interest in insurance regulation in the 107th109th congresses focused on the inefficiencies in the state regulatory system major catalyst for congressional interest has been the aftermath of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba which modernized the regulatory structure for banks and securities firms but left the insurance sector largely untouched many larger insurers and their trade associations had previously defended state regulation but consider themselves at competitive disadvantage in the current regulatory structure they are now largely arguing for an optional federal charter akin to that available to banks the increased internationalization of insurance has also brought more pressure on the current us regulatory system particularly as the regulatory paradigms being embraced overseas differ greatly from those in the united states the states particularly working through the national association of insurance commissioners naic have not been idle in the face of this increased scrutiny they reacted quickly to the glba requirements that related to insurance agent licensing and have embarked on wider ranging project to modernize insurance regulation this includes both regulatory aspects such as streamlining the process for rate and form filing and more basic legal aspects such as the creation of an interstate compact to provide uniformity across states for some life insurance products since every state legislature must pass the legal changes suggested by the naic the process typically does not move rapidly some in congress and the executive branch have not been content with the changes being undertaken by the states and several proposals have been put forth over the past few years for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation in the 110th congress s 40 and hr 3200 would create an optional federal charter ofc for insurers modeled roughly after the dual regulatory system for banks this call for an ofc was echoed by secretary of the treasury paulson in recently released blueprint for regulatory modernization several narrower bills addressing insurance regulation and regulatory requirements have been introduced in the 110th congress these include hr 1065 and s 929 s 618 and hr 1081 hr 1746 s 1061 s 1865 hr 4041 hr 5611 hr 5633 hr 5792 hr 5840 hr 6063 and hr 6213 the house passed hr 1065 on june 25 2007 but the other bills have yet to be considered on the floor of

legislation introduction insurance companies comprise major segment of the us financial services industry unlike banks and securities firms however insurance companies have been regulated solely by the states for the past 150 years this stems from an 1868 decision of the us supreme court1 that insurance was not interstate commerce and thus was not subject to regulation by the federal government under the commerce clause of the us constitution courts followed that precedent for the next 75 years in 1944 the us supreme court effectively reversed its 1868 ruling and held that insurance was interstate commerce and was subject to federal oversight2 by that time the state insurance regulatory structure was well established and joint effort led by state regulators and insurance industry leaders to overturn the decision legislatively led to the passage of the mccarranferguson act of 19453 that act relinquished to the states federal authority to regulate insurance subject to effective insurance regulation by the states and granted federal antitrust exemption to the insurance industry for the business of insurance which has been determined not synonymous with the business of insurers4 after 1945 the jurisdictional stewardship entrusted to the states under mccarranferguson was reviewed by congress on various occasions some narrow exceptions to the 50state structure of insurance regulation have been enacted such as that for some types of liability insurance in the liability risk retention act5 in general however each time broad proposals were made to transfer insurance regulatory authority back to the federal government they were met by successful opposition from the states as well as from united insurance industry such proposals for federal oversight usually spurred series of regulatory reform efforts at the state level and by the national association of insurance commissioners naic such efforts were directed at correcting perceived deficiencies in state regulation in order to forestall federal regulatory takeover they were generally accompanied by pledges from state regulators to work for more uniformity and efficiency in the state regulatory process 1 paul v virginia 75 us 8 wall 168 1868 2 us v southeastern underwriters association 322 us 533 1944 3 15 usc sec 1011 et seq 4 see eg group life health ins co v royal drug co 440 us 205 211 1979 5 15 usc sec 3901 et seq see crs report rl32176 the liability risk retention act background issues and current legislation by baird webel crs2 major effort to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government began in the mid1980s following insolvencies of several large insurance companies representative john dingell who chaired the house energy and commerce committee that had jurisdiction over insurance at the time questioned whether state regulation was up to the task of overseeing such large and diversified industry he conducted several hearings on the state regulatory structure and also proposed legislation that would have created federal insurance regulatory agency modeled on the securities and exchange commission sec state insurance regulators and the insurance industry opposed his proposal and worked together on series of reforms at the state level and at the naic including new state accreditation program setting baseline standards for state solvency regulation under those standards in order to obtain and retain its accreditation each state must have adequate statutory and administrative authority to regulate an insurers corporate and financial affairs and the necessary resources to carry out that authority in spite of such reforms however another breach in the state regulatory system occurred in the 1990s when martin frankel who had previously been barred from securities dealing by the sec slipped through the oversight of several states insurance regulators before being stopped he had looted number of small life insurance companies of some 200 million such breach was major embarrassment to state regulation but it did not bring longterm change to federal policy in the middle and latter part of the 1990s congress attention on insurance regulatory matters waned in recent congresses however attention has again focused on the regulatory structure of insurance the house financial services committee in particular held more than dozen hearings at both the subcommittee and full committee levels on insurance matters from the 107th through the 109th congresses representative michael oxley who chaired the committee for this time indicated strong interest in pursuing legislation to change the regulatory structure number of broad proposals for some form of federal chartering or other federal intervention in insurance regulation were put forward in both houses of congress but none were marked up or reported by the various committees of jurisdiction in the first session of the 110th congress senators john sununu and tim johnson and representatives melissa bean and edward royce introduced the national insurance act of 2007 s 40 and hr 3200 into their respective chambers while differing slightly both bills would create an optional federal charter ofc for propertycasualty and life insurance this legislation was echoed by the us department of the treasury when it released blueprint for modernized financial regulatory structure on march 31 2008 as an intermediate step the treasury blueprint also called for an optional federal charter although it did not specifically endorse the existing ofc bills number of narrower bills affecting different facets of insurance regulation and regulatory requirements have also been introduced these bills include the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act of 2007 hr 1065 and s 929 the insurance industry competition act of 2007 s 618 and hr 1081 the holocaust insurance accountability act of 2007 hr 1746 the homeowners insurance noncoverage disclosure act s 1061 the life insurance fairness for travelers act of 2007 s 1865 the insurance nondiscrimination for survivors act hr 4041 the national association of registered agents and brokers reform act of 2008 crs3 hr 5611 the nondiscriminatory use of consumer reports and consumer information act of 2008 hr 5633 the increasing insurance coverage options for consumers act of 2008 hr 5792 the insurance information act of 2008 hr 5840 the personal lines of insurance fairness act of 2008 hr 6062 and the reinsurance international solvency standards evaluation board act of 2008 hr 6213 see below for additional details on legislation factors promoting change three interrelated factors provide impetus for broad change in the insurance regulatory system these are 1 previous legislation that revamped regulation for the banking and securities industries 2 change in the insurance marketplace and 3 the impact of regulatory changes abroad taken together these changes are having significant impact on the competitive position of companies both within the insurance industry and between insurers and other financial service companies largely because of this impact significant portions of the insurance industry which had previously supported the state regulatory system are now calling for federal intervention the grammleachbliley act6 in 1999 congress passed the grammleachbliley act glba instituting massive overhaul of the federal laws governing us financial institutions support for the measure came largely as result of changes in market forces frequently referred to as convergence convergence in the financial services context refers to the breakdown of distinctions separating different types of financial products and services as well as the providers of once separate products drivers of such convergence are generally considered to be market forces such as globalization new technology ecommerce deregulation market liberalization increased competition tighter profit margins and the growing number of sophisticated consumers the goals behind these driving forces in turn appear to be the increasing efforts of all financial services providers to find growth gain market share create new revenue streams and enter new markets for example us banks have looked to adjunct nonbanking products such as insurance and pension products to increase their profitability pointing to european bancassurers that generate 20 to 30 of their profits from the sale of insurance and investment products integrated into core retail banking businesses glba repealed federal laws that seemed inconsistent with the way that financial services products were actually being delivered and removed many barriers that kept banks or securities firms from competing with insurance companies the result was the creation of new competitive paradigm in which insurance companies now find themselves in direct competition with brokerages mutual funds and commercial banks glba did not however change the basic regulatory structure for insurance or other financial products instead it reaffirmed the mccarran ferguson act recognizing state insurance regulators as the functional regulators 6 pl 106102 113 stat 1338 crs4 of insurance products and those who sell them some insurance companies believe that in this environment state regulation places them at competitive marketplace disadvantage they maintain that their noninsurer competitors in certain lines of products have far more efficient federally based systems of regulation while they remain subject to the perceived inefficiencies of state insurance regulation such as the regulation of rates and forms as well as other delays in getting their products to market for example life insurers with products aimed at retirement and asset accumulation must now compete with similar bank products banks can roll out such new products nationwide in matter of weeks while some insurers maintain that it can take as long as two years to obtain all the necessary state approvals for similar national insurance product launch glba also addressed the issue of modernizing state laws dealing with the licensing of insurance agents and brokers and made provision for federally backed licensing association the national association of registered agents and brokers narab which would have come into existence three years after the date of enactment if at least 29 states failed to enact the necessary legislation for state uniformity or reciprocity following glba the requisite number of states enacted this legislation and thus the narab provisions never came into effect the issue of insurance producer licensing reciprocity or uniformity continued however as some have continued to see problems in the actions taken by the individual states every state has not passed legislation implementing reciprocity and even in those states that did it has not always been implemented as smoothly as desired particularly by the agents and brokers themselves7 the market after the grammleachbliley act congress passed the grammleachbliley act to enhance competition among financial services providers though many observers expected banks and insurers to converge as institutions after it passed this has not occurred as expected in fact the major merger between large bank citibank and large insurer travelers which actually spurred the passage of glba has effectively been undone the corporation that resulted from the merger citigroup has divested itself of almost all of its insurance subsidiaries the propertycasualty divisions were sold first to the st pauls companies and the large majority of the life insurance operations were sold to metlife the only remaining sizeable bankinsurer merger is chase insurance which is part of jpmorgan chase8 although large bankinsurer mergers have not occurred as expected significant convergence has continued instead of merging across sectoral lines banks began distributing but not manufacturing insurance and insurers began creating products that closely resembled financing consolidation has also continued within 7 see for example the april 16 2008 testimony by tom minkler on behalf of the independent insurance agents and brokers made before the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises at httpwwwhousegovappslisthearingfinancialsvcs_demminkler041608pdf 8 in 2003 bank one acquired zurich life and then in 2004 bank one merged into jpmorgan chase and the insurance divisions were renamed crs5 each sector as banks merged with banks and insurers with insurers also although congress had instituted functional regulation in glba regulation has since tended to track institutional lines9 international developments although banking insurance and other financial services are not an industry that produces tangible good to be shipped across borders the trade in such services makes up large amount of international trade the united states has generally enjoyed surplus in trade in financial services other than insurance but in insurance services the united states has consistently run deficit with the rest of the world10 consolidations in the insurance industry are creating larger international entities with growing market shares particularly in the reinsurance market some have speculated that the growing internationalization of the financial services industry means governments may find it difficult to reform their regulation in isolation from other jurisdictions and international developments the need for single voice at the federal level to represent us insurance interests on the international stage is frequently heard argument for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation the european union eu our biggest trading partner in insurance services is continuing with its financial services action plan fsap comprehensive program to transform the eu into single market for financial services the eu is putting forward an updated solvency regime for insurers known as solvency 2 that is intended to parallel the basel ii capital standards for banks it is an ambitious proposal that will completely overhaul the way we ensure the financial soundness of our insurers we are setting worldleading standard that requires insurers to focus on managing all the risks they face and enables them to operate much more efficiently11 the eu has also adopted reinsurance directive that creates single license or passport for eu reinsurers which would enable reinsurers licensed under the proposed standards in their home eu country to do business in all other eu countries without further requirements or collateral12 the reinsurance directive is seen as useful tool in international trade negotiations as 9 see crs report rs21827 insurance regulation after the grammleachbliley act by carolyn cobb 10 us exports of noninsurance financial services were 46 billion in 2007 vs imports of 115 billion insurance exports in 2007 totaled 103 billion vs imports of 428 billion see the bureau of economic analysis website at

could help improve access for european reinsurers to foreign markets such as the united states13 access to the us market for insurance is significant issue of particular concern have been the state regulatory requirements that reinsurance issued by alien14 reinsurers must be backed by 100 collateral deposited in the united states alien reinsurers have asked state regulators to reduce this requirement to as low as 50 for insurers who meet particular criteria pointing out among other arguments that us reinsurers do not have any collateral requirements in many foreign countries and that the current regulations do not recognize when an alien reinsurer cedes some of the risk back to us reinsurer in the past the naic has declined to recommend collateral reduction citing fears of unpaid claims from alien reinsurers and an inability to collect judgments in courts overseas at recent naic national meetings however the naic reinsurance task force has advanced proposal to ease the collateral requirements somewhat tying them to the financial strength of alien reinsurers final naic decision has not been reached on the issue and it has provoked significant controversy within the naic in addition to the reinsurance collateral debate the overall complexity of the regulatory system in the united states has been seen by some as barrier to overseas companies operating in the united states15 this complexity may also end up hindering us companies in the eu as it is not clear that state supervision of us insurers will be sufficient to allow the same single passport access to all eu countries that eu insurers will enjoy state regulatory modernization following the passage of glba state insurance regulators working through the naic embarked on an ambitious regulatory modernization program in response to both the mounting criticisms of state insurance regulation and the recognition of the growing convergence of financial services and financial services products in early 2000 naic members signed statement of intent the future of insurance regulation in which they pledged to modernize insurance regulation to meet the realities of the new financial services marketplace and to work cooperatively with all our partners governors state legislators federal officials consumers companies agents and other interested parties to facilitate and enhance this new and evolving market place as we begin the 21st century new naic working groups were formed and charged with addressing the various changes needed to implement those provisions of glba requiring regulatory action such as that needed 13 european commission commission proposes directive to create real euwide market for reinsurance internal market financial services insurance press release

httptradeeceuropaeudoclibdocs2008april tradoc_138559pdfpdf crs7 to prevent narab from coming into existence and also to update and modernize state regulation in other ways not required by glba but needed to deter growing industry support for federal oversight the naics new groups addressed such key issues as state privacy protections reciprocity of state producer licensing laws promotion of speed to market of new insurance products development of state based uniform standards for policy form filings and other proposed improvements to state rate and form filing requirements according to naic the states are now well underway in their efforts to modernize state regulation in 2003 they set specific targets and an implementation schedule for their action plan entitled reinforced commitment insurance regulatory modernization action plan16 highlights of the naic efforts include certification of 47 states as of september 2006 as reciprocal jurisdictions for producer licensing laws17 this is substantially more than the 29 states needed under glba to prevent the establishment of narab continued growth of the system for electronic rate and form filing serff intended to be single onestop point of entry for insurers to file changes to rates and forms more than 26900 filings were made through serff in 2005 up from about 3700 in 2001 twelve states now require insurers to file using serff or other electronic means18 state approvals of the interstate insurance product regulation compact this compact is intended to provide increased regulatory uniformity and single point of product filing using serff for four insurance lines life annuities disability income and longterm care it came into effect in may 200619 currently 32 states20 have joined the compact four additional states21 have current legislation pending to endorse the compact naic maintains that states are better positioned than the federal government to serve the interests of us insurance consumers emphasizing that state regulators are more able to make sure that the personal interests of consumers are not lost in the arena of commercial competition to support this position the naic points out that 16 see httpwwwnaicorgtopicstopic_regulatory_mod_planhtm 17 see httpwwwnaicorgurtt_utlrhtm 18 see httpwwwserfforg 19 see httpwwwinsurancecompactorg 20 ak co ga hi ia id in ks ky ma md

and more than 25 million consumer inquiries regarding their policies and their treatment by insurance companies and agents in 2006 the states employed more than 13600 employees to handle these complaints and perform the other functions of the state insurance departments22 us treasury blueprint for modernized financial regulatory structure on march 31 2008 the us treasury department released blueprint for revamping the financial regulatory structure in the united states23 wideranging document the blueprint foresees completely revamped regulatory structure for all financial services as an intermediate step it makes two specific recommendations on insurance regulation first it calls for the creation of federal insurance regulator to oversee an optional federal charter for insurers as well as federal licensing for agents and brokers second recognizing that the debate over an optional federal charter is ongoing in congress it recommends the creation of an office of insurance oversight in the department of the treasury as an interim step this office would be charged with two primary functions 1 dealing with international regulatory issues including the power to preempt inconsistent state laws and 2 collecting information on the insurance industry and advising the secretary of the treasury on insurance matters recent legislative activity 110th congress the national insurance act of 2007 s 40 and hr 3200 senators john sununu and tim johnson introduced s 40 on may 24 2007 and representatives melissa bean and edward royce introduced very similar but not identical version of the bill hr 3200 in the house on july 26 2007 these bills would create the option of federal charter for the insurance industry including insurers insurance agencies and independent insurance producers they would create federal regulatory apparatus inside the department of the treasury and would preempt most state insurance laws thus nationally licensed insurers agencies and producers would be able to operate in the entire united states without fulfilling the requirements of each individual 50 states insurance laws s 40 and hr 3200 also would reduce substantially the rate and form regulation applicable to national insurers similar but not identical bills of the same name were introduced in the 109th congress one significant difference between the 109th and 110th congress 22 statistics provided by the naic 23 see httpwwwtreasgovpressreleasesreportsblueprintpdf crs9 versions is the inclusion of surplus lines insurance24 in the bill the current bills would allow only the state in which the insured resides or does business to tax surplus lines insurance and would allow national insurance producers to sell surplus lines insurance the previous versions of the national insurance act did not specifically address surplus lines insurance25 hr 3200 was referred to the house financial services committee hearings or markups specifically on it have yet to be scheduled the bill was discussed in subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises hearing on april 16 with one witness alastair shore testifying on behalf of the american council of life insurance and the american insurance association in support of the bill s 40 was referred to the senate banking committee which has yet to take action on the bill the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act of 2007 hr 1065 and s 929 representative dennis moore and 44 cosponsors introduced hr 1065 on february 15 2007 hr 1065 is nearly identical to hr 5637 which passed the 109th congress as is discussed below senators mel martinez and bill nelson introduced s 929 on march 20 2007 s 929 is identical to hr 5637 from the 109th congress as that bill passed the house in the 110th congress the house again acted on this bill passing it under suspension of the rules by voice vote on june 25 2007 after being received by the senate hr 1065 was referred to the committee on banking housing and urban affairs as s 929 was after introduction at the time of this report committee action was scheduled on either bill these bills would address relatively narrow set of insurance regulatory issues where currently some see overlapping regulation by multiple states in the area of nonadmitted or surplus lines insurance the bills would harmonize and in some cases reduce regulation and taxation of this insurance by investing the home state of the insured with the sole authority to regulate and collect the taxes on surplus lines transaction those taxes that would be collected may be distributed according to future interstate compact but absent such compact their distribution would be up to the home state these bills also would preempt any state laws on surplus lines eligibility that conflict with the naic model law and would implement streamlined federal standards allowing commercial purchaser to access surplus lines insurance for reinsurance transactions they would invest the home state of the insurer purchasing the reinsurance with the authority over the transaction while investing the home state of the reinsurer with the sole authority to regulate the solvency of the reinsurer26 24 this is insurance written by companies who do not hold license in particular state in general it is used to insure unusual risks which licensed or admitted insurer wishes to insure 25 see crs report rl34286 insurance regulation optional federal charter legislation by baird webel 26 see crs report rs22506 surplus lines insurance background and current legislation by baird webel crs10 the insurance industry competition act of 2007 s 618 and hr 1081 senator patrick leahy and four cosponsors introduced s 618 in the senate on february 15 2007 while representative peter defazio and five cosponsors introduced hr 1081 in the house on the same day the two bills are identical both would abolish the current exemption from federal antitrust laws for the business of insurance that dates to the mccarranferguson act of 1945 and remove prohibition on investigations of insurance companies by the federal trade commission neither bill would change the sections of the mccarranferguson act that give preeminence to state insurance regulators the senate judiciary committee held hearing on s 618 on march 7 2007 but hearings have not been scheduled in the house on hr 108127 the holocaust insurance accountability act of 2007 hr 1746 representative ileana roslehtinen and four cosponsors introduce hr 1746 on march 28 2007 this bill would create publically available registry of insurance polices issued between january 30 1933 and december 31 1945 to persons domiciled in an area controlled by or allied with nazi germany and require insurers to file information on these policies with the secretary of commerce within 90 days of the bills enactment hr 1746 would also create federal civil cause of action for any claim arising out of such policy it specifically indicates that nothing in the act would preempt state laws requiring disclosure or providing for rights or remedies available to claimant on such policy the house foreign affairs committee marked up the bill with minor amendments and ordered it reported on october 23 2007 the house financial services committee the primary committee of jurisdiction held hearing on february 7 2008 and marked up the bill on june 25 2008 at this markup chairman barney frank began with an amendment in the nature of substitute significantly different than the original bill text chairman franks amendment would require insurers to respond to written inquiries regarding holocaustera policies within 90 days and provide within reasonable amount of time all information regarding this request it provides for monitoring of insurer compliance by the new york holocaust claims processing office and 5000per day civil penalty on insurers for noncompliance the frank amendment retains federal cause of action for holocaustera claims but substantially limits this cause of action in the markup sherman amendment relating to subsidiary liability was agreed to subject to modification of the precise language while another sherman amendment establishing registry of insurance policies from the holocaustera was not agreed to the committee ordered the bill to be reported by voice vote hr 1746 has also been referred to the house oversight and government reform committee where it is still pending28 27 see crs report rs22639 impact of the abolition of mccarranferguson antitrust exemption for the

lott introduced s 1061 on march 29 2007 this bill would require plain english disclosure box at the front of the insurance policy restating all conditions exclusions and other limitations of the policy such requirements are typically part of the policy form approval process that is done by state insurance regulators s 1061 however would not create federal insurance regulator instead the federal trade commission would enforce this requirement pursuant to its unfairness authority the life insurance fairness for travelers act of 2007 s 1865 senator charles schumer introduced s 1865 on july 24 2007 this bill would limit the ability of life insurers to consider foreign travel in their underwriting decisions preventing them from declining coverage due to travel and requiring any increase in premium be based on good faith actuarial evidence it would do this by amending the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria 15 usc 6701 note and is similar to language included in hr 2761 and hr 4299 bills considered by the house to extend and expand the tria such language was not included in hr 2761 as it was signed into law by the president s 1865 does not indicate specific enforcement mechanism for the requirements it contains nor grant specific right of private action the insurance nondiscrimination for survivors act hr 4014 representatives lucille roybalallard and ted poe introduced hr 4014 on october 31 2007 this bill would forbid insurers from discriminating against survivors of domestic abuse by canceling an insurance policy limiting insurance coverage or increasing insurance premiums on the basis of this abuse such actions would be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the federal trade commission act and individuals would be granted private cause of action in state or federal court against insurers in violation of the act the national association of registered agents and brokers reform act of 2008 hr 5611 this bill was introduced by representative david scott along with 14 cosponsors on march 13 2008 hr 5611 would establish national association of registered agents and brokers narab narab would be private nonprofit corporation whose members once licensed as an insurance producer in single state would be able to operate in any other state subject only to payment of the licensing fee in that state the narab member would still be subject to each states consumer protection and market conduct regulation but individual state laws that treated out of state insurance producers differentially than instate producers would be preempted narab would be overseen by board made up of five appointees from the insurance industry and four from the state insurance commissioners the appointments would be made by the president and the president could dissolve the board as whole or suspend the effectiveness of any action taken by narab the language in this bill is similar to the provisions on insurance producer licensing in glba discussed previously in this report 28 continued legislation by paul belkin david h carpenter janice rubin and baird webel crs12 hr 5611 was referred to the house financial services committee hearings or markups specifically on it have yet to be scheduled the bill was discussed in the house financial services committees subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises hearing on april 16 2008 with one witness thomas minkler testifying on behalf of the independent insurance agents and brokers of america in support of the bill the nondiscriminatory use of consumer reports and consumer information act of 2008 hr 5633 this bill was introduced by representative luis gutierrez along with two cosponsors on march 13 2008 hr 5633 would amend the fair credit reporting act to prohibit the use of consumer information in connection with the underwriting of insurance when the federal trade commission determines that this usage results in racial or ethnic discrimination or represents proxy for race or ethnicity the bill specifically exempts information on property loss data driver history and medical history subject to other requirements in the law it also specifies

107th109th congresses in the 109th congress the national insurance act of 2006 s 2509 was introduced by senators john sununu and tim johnson on april 5 2006 representative ed royce introduced house version of the bill hr 6225 on september 28 2006 while not identical the two versions were nearly so and shared the same basic structure and intent these bills modeled to some degree after the statefederal regulation in the banking industry would have provided for an optional federal charter for the insurance industry they were similar to the bill of the same title introduced in the 110th congress and discussed above crs14 also in the 109th congress the financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises held june 16 2005 hearing on the state modernization and regulatory transparency smart act draft bill that had originally circulated among interested parties in the latter part of 2004 one draft of the smart act encompasses 17 titles and more than 300 pages30 this draft would set up number of uniform standards in different areas including market conduct product and producer licensing life insurance propertycasualty insurance and reinsurance while establishing that there should be uniform standards and threatening federal preemption if the standards are not followed the draft often leaves the exact standards to be followed to the state regulators and naic one aspect of the proposal however that is not up to the states is federal preemption of state laws requiring prior approval of insurance rates at june 21 2006 subcommittee hearing thenchairman richard baker indicated that the smart acts comprehensive approach might be superseded by number of smaller bills addressing particular problems in state regulation as an example he held up hr 5637 which was primary focus of this hearing hr 5637 the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act of 2006 was introduced by representative ginny brownwaite along with 16 bipartisan cosponsors on june 16 2006 this bill as introduced was substantially similar to the two bills of the same name discussed above after relatively minor amendments at subcommittee and full committee markups the house financial services committee ordered hr 5637 reported favorably by voice vote on july 26 2006 and reported the bill hrept 109649 part i on september 12 the house judiciary committee which was jointly referred the bill held subcommittee hearing on september 19 and hr 5637 was discharged from that committee on september 22 it was brought to the house floor under suspension of the rules and passed 4170 on september 27 the senate received the bill but did not act on hr 5637 during the 109th congress during the 108th congress senator ernest hollings introduced s 1373 bill to authorize and direct the secretary of commerce through an independent commission within the department of commerce to protect consumers by regulating the interstate sale of insurance and for other purposes s 1373 would have created federal commission within the department of commerce to regulate the interstate business of propertycasualty and life insurance and would have required federal regulation of all interstate insurers it thus would have preempted most current state regulation of insurance except that of single state insurance companies the federal commission would have had full regulatory powers including licensure rate and form approval regulation of solvency and regulation of market conduct s 1373 also would have repealed the antitrust exemptions in the mccarranferguson act and created federal guaranty fund s 1373 was referred to the commerce committee hearings or markups on the bill were held senator hollings retired following the 108th congress during the 107th congress two formal proposals were advanced providing for an optional federal charter for insurers senator charles schumer presented legislation in december 2001 which was not assigned number while 30 see httpwwwabacomabiaabia_reg_mod_pagehtm for one copy of the bill crs15 representative john lafalce introduced bill in february 2002 which was designated hr 3766 as with the current national insurance act of 2006 they both were roughly modeled after the current dual statefederal regulatory system that exists for the banking industry such system allows institutions to be chartered at either state or federal level and would have enabled insurance companies to choose between state and federal regulation there were hearings or markups on either proposal during the 107th congress senator schumer has not introduced such bill since while representative lafalce retired following the 107th congress in addition to the legislation taking general aim at the current insurance regulatory system other proposals have had more limited impact on the system for example the terrorism risk insurance act of 200231 tria specifically endorsed state regulation of insurance while it included provisions preempting state definitions of terrorism and previous state approvals of terrorism exclusions in considering the fair and accurate credit transactions fact act of 200332 some would have included provisions to regulate insurer usage of credit information however the final bill included only study of this usage this study was to be completed in late 2005 but was only delivered to congress in july 2007 tria had been set to expire at the end of 2005 and this pending expiration provoked significant legislative and lobbying activity on bill to extend tria such bill s 467 was passed in early december 2005 and signed into pl 109144 on december 22 2005 s 467 extended tria two years and changed little in trias relatively minimal intrusion into the state insurance regulatory system the 110th congress passed another tria extension bill hr 2671 in december 2007 and it was signed into pl 110160 on december 26 2007 this bill extended tria seven years and again did not substantially change trias minimal intrusion into the state regulatory system 31 pl 107297 116 stat 2322 32 pl 108159 117 stat 1953 for other versions of this document see
