experts widely accept that technical progress is re sponsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal drivin g force for increases in our standard of living historically industrial expans ion was based on the use of technology to exploit natural resources today such growth tends to be founded on scientific discoveries and engineering knowledge eg electronics biomed ical applications and is even more dependent than before on the development and use of technology technological advance can drive the econom because it contributes to the creation of new goods and

and quality or results in new or impr oved product or service that can be sold in the marketplace it is only then that significant s timulus to ec onomic growth occurs entrepreneurial firms often play an impor tant role in technological advancement and economic growth it usually is through these companies that the results of research and development are commercialized and brought to the marketplace thus the current interest in creating an environment to facilitate the development of indigenous talent and to ttract outside players wh ile the manufacturing facilities of high technology companies can bring an infusion of new jobs to region studies have shown that branch plants do not provide much additional high technology development3 such businesses tend to move when it is cheaper to manufacture elsewhere even though they utilize skilled workforce in contrast the rd facilities of high tech companies generate higher value added jobs it might be possible to devise mechanisms to use th location of production plant to stimulate involvement of the rd sectors of the rele vant corporation ho wever concentrating on branch plants poses problems in that the stifling effects of branch plant economy on entrepreneurship are great and cannot easily be overcome by policies to locate government research facilities in b ackward regions in the hope of generating spinoffs4 economic benefits remain within re gion through the creation of new firms5 these companies create wealth through value added jobs that are long term and require highly skilled employees that generate

of traditional industries in the 1970s and 1980s and the subsequent loss of thousands of jobs helped spur the formulation of many of todays state programs12 the conditions precipitated shift away from state policies to promote smokestack chasing attracting large manufacturing firms away from other areas toward assistance to high technology companies in the areas of research velopment commercia lization technology transfer and capital formation among others many of th efforts have crystalized into state industrial policies under which particular busin esses or industrial sectors are selected as the nexus of state investment endeavors the activist nature of these state ventures has foundation in their responsibilities to promote the economic viab ility within their jurisdictions state involvement initially veloped based on the idea that these nonnational governments must take action in areas where the private sector was unwilling to play role thus the government was not s een as replacing the business community in the decisionmaking process but as filling void left by inaction13 in filling this void the states saw an opportunity to attract or develop high technology firms

because of perceived parallels with the current situation in many regions critical to local technology development is strong technolog ical infrastructure and an entrepreneurial network15 this presents opportunities for state and local governments in pursuit of their respons ibilities to promote ec onomic development however it is important to keep in mind that some argue government policies are limited in what they can do to create entrepreneurs policy does not create entrepreneurs but can encourage them to stay in location there is general finding that due to the complexity of

coalesced around the federal facilitie s in cape canaveral24 large aerospace and defense contractors were able to induce high tech growth through the recruitment of skilled workers and the training of

was strengthened academic resources were considered infe rior and concerted effort was made to improve the system at all levels including precollege through graduate school as well as vocational education educational programs were designed to meet industry needs and state funding was provided for engineering and science programs in the universities and for community and vocati onal schools by 1987 there were over 400 specialized academic research programs of interest to industry in the state another region which focused on imp rovements in the educational establishment was research triangle park north carolina there are three research universities in the area including the university of north carolina north carolina state university and duke university in 1959 research triangle park rtp was created as university affiliated research campus the objectives of the park were the diversification of the economy the au gmentation of high value added jobs and additional employment

hodges the former governor of north carolina and then governor terry sa nford numerous other r d organizations have set up facilities in the park since that time among the reasons for the decision to relocate were the prestige of being associated with the park the ability to interact with professionals in other organi zations and access to entry vel graduates for recruiting purposes29 the ability for an area to develop viable and prosperous research park is dependent on several factors although ll need not be present for success an existing rd infrastructure and ongoing research activity is

hightech companies and it was often too costly for small firms to locate within its confines31 however there were other efforts outside of rtp to facilitate new firm growth the state concentrated on improving the educational system to mold indigenous scientific and t echnical talent and developed job training programs through an extensive number of community colleges to attract new industries32 educational opportunities also played significant role in high tech development around phoenix arizona one 1987 study funded by the national science foundation found that 70 of micro electronics firms
