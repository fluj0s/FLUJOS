continuous multimillennial ringwidth chronology in yamal northwestern siberia yamal treering chronology rashit m hantemirov and stepan g shiyatov institute of plant and animal ecology ekaterinburg 620144 russia abstract remains of subfossil siberian larch trees in the holocene deposits of the yamal peninsula western siberia have been collected in order to develop continuous multimillennium treeringwidth chronology to date this work has resulted in the construction of an absolute 4000 year from 2000 bc to 1996 ad series from these data we are able to estimate summer temperature variability in this region on scales radiocarbon dating of selected older material shows that the absolute age of the oldest subfossil wood reaches back 9400 years and the dates of the sampled material are generally distributed more or less evenly through time this demonstrates that it will be possible to develop treering chronology more than 9 thousand years long an initial assessment of long term fluctuations in northern yamal summer warmth has been realised through the reconstruction of treeline dynamics using combination of dendrochronological absolute dated material and less precisely radiocarbon dated older subfossils keywords treerings temperature reconstruction subfossil wood tree line dynamics holocene western siberia introduction the reconstruction and analysis of natural climatic changes at high latitudes throughout the whole holocene is an important goal however there are very few long preciselydated and highresolution proxy climatic series for these regions tree rings as proxy indicator of past environmental conditions are of special interest as they facilitate the reconstruction of climatic parameters with seasonal and annual resolution for many hundreds and even thousands of years to develop multimillennial treering chronologies it is necessary to find special regions that meet the specific requirements wellpreserved remains of trees well distributed throughout the holocene and that exhibit high sensitivity to environmental changes one area with proven potential for developing near holocene length series is the yamal peninsula just east of the northern polar ural mts in northwest siberia history holocene deposits in the southern yamal peninsula contain large amount of subfossil tree remains tree trunks roots and branches this is the result of intensive accumulation and the good preservation of buried wood in the permafrost the occurrence of this material in the presentday tundra zone of the yamal peninsula was described for the first time by bm zhitkov 1913 later ba tikhomirov 1941 had shown by the remains of trees preserved on peat deposits that during the warmest period of the holocene the northern treeline reached the central region of the yamal peninsula up to 70n whereas today the polar timberline passes through the most southern part of the peninsula at latitude of 6730n by 1964 attention had been drawn to the potential significance of yamal subfossil wood for reconstructing climatic and other natural processes over many thousand years as result of fieldwork carried out within the valley of the khadytayakha river in the southern part of the yamal peninsula shiyatov and surkov 1990 the systematic collection of subfossil wood samples was begun in 1982 in the basins of the khadytayakha yadayakhodyyakha and tanlovayakha rivers in southern yamal in the region located between 6700 and 6750n and 6830 and 7100e figure 1 these rivers flow from the north to the south hence driftwood can be brought from the adjacent southern territories at the present time the upper reaches of these rivers are devoid of trees larch and sprucebirchlarch thin forests are located mainly in valley beds in the middle and lower reaches the most intensive work on constructing supralong chronology in yamal has been carried out during the last six years some preliminary results were published in 1995 and 1996 hantemirov 1995 shiyatov et 1996 hantemirov and surkov 1996 the present article reviews the recent status of the work partly undertaken as contribution to the advance10k programme and incorporates review of other recent articles ie hantemirov 1999 hantemirov and shiyatov 1999a 1999b subfossil sites remains of dead trees can be found lying on the surface that tend to be up to maximum of 750 years old within the frame of these researches some 30 of these dead trees have been collected there is also subfossil wood at the bottom of thermokarst lakes but this source of material is much more difficult to collect and has not as yet been explored however by far the most significant source of subfossil wood remains often trunks in near complete state with bark roots and large branches are alluvial deposits in the southern part of the yamal peninsula very intensive lateral erosion of sandy river banks occurs according to our observations up to 24 metres per year living trees growing along the river terraces are undermined and often fall into the running water figure 2 this occurs mainly in spring and early summer when water level and stream velocities are high some fallen trees remain at the bottom of the river near to their growth sites after few years these trees are buried by sand and silt deposits as the river channel is continually moving these buried trees soon become incorporated within the permafrost layer subfossil wood lies usually up to 56 metres below the surface and can be exposed by the river perhaps after many hundreds or thousands of years when the riverbed is deepened the frequency of log deposits is variable in the best case 50 60 stems may be exposed within distance of 200400 metres along the river figure 3 total of 1945 samples have been collected from alluvial deposits at the time of writing the second important source of subfossil wood is peat deposits in this area there are large number of peats that reach depth of 23 metres the largest logs are usually found at the base of these peats where they are exposed by the erosional activity of lakes and rivers large lakes with dimensions of more than one kilometre are very strongly affected by wave erosion which is typical for regions with permafrost and where there are often strong winds during summer months such wood remains are in situ because these trees likely grew in some depressions and were subsequently engulfed by later peat formation to date 196 samples have been recovered from such peat deposits sampling of subfossil wood we travelled to the upper reaches of the river to be sampled by helicopter small boats were then used for locating and collecting crosssections from wood exposed along the river banks it was also possible when going with the stream to explore the nearest lakes the bestpreserved material of an individual tree is usually found at the base of the trunks near to the roots however many of these remains are radically cracked and it is necessary to tie cross sections cut from these trunks or roots using aluminium wire before sawing this wire is left in place afterwards as the sections are air dried material at present total of 2171 sawn wood samples have been collected from trunks and some roots of subfossil larch larix sibirica ldb and from spruce picea obovata ldb and birch betula tortuosa ldb by far the greatest proportion of these samples is made up of siberian larch 95 with most of the remainder being siberian spruce 4 and the rest mountain birch 1 however it has to be noted that sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish on anatomical grounds between larch and spruce all of these samples are now stored at the laboratory of dendrochronology at the institute of plant and animal ecology ekaterinburg russia most of the wood samples contain only 60120 rings figure 4 the maximum number of counted rings in any subfossil sample is 501 and the average of all samples is 125 rings living larches and spruces in this region may have up to maximum of 400 rings radiocarbon dating to provide some estimate of the possible length of the eventual chronology 55 radiocarbon dates from 53 remains of subfossil trees 51 samples of siberian larch and 2 of siberian spruce were determined radiocarbon analysis and data calibration were performed in the laboratory of historical ecology of the institute of plant and animal ecology ekaterinburg 11 dates and the radiocarbon laboratory of the physical institute of the bern university 44 dates for two samples dating was repeated in both laboratories comparison of these results showed an acceptable degree of similarity in the obtained dates the results of the radiocarbon dating of subfossil wood from yamal peninsula have been published earlier shiyatov erokhin 1990 shiyatov et 1996 hantemirov shiyatov 1999a 199_b these datings show that the absolute age of the oldest subfossil wood reaches 92009400 years the dates are distributed more or less evenly through time but see below this provides strong evidence of the feasibility of developing treering chronology that is more than 9 thousand years long moreover the radiocarbon dates provide basis for distinguishing several main stages of tree vegetation development in the yamal peninsula in the holocene hantemirov shiyatov 1999a figure 5 using our own data and some additional data from other authors it is possible to propose the following conclusions open larch forests were already growing in yamal in the early holocene ie 9105 thousand years ago the most favourable period for tree growth lasted from 7200 to 6000 bc then until 5600 bc climatic conditions deteriorated somewhat however this did not result in any significant shift of the polar boundary to the south such shift did occur later at about 5400 bc by that time the overall density of forests in yamal had also decreased considerably which allows us to regard this stage as transition to the next period of the holocene from 5400 to 1700 bc the polar boundary was located at approximately 69n trees survived in river valleys during unfavourable periods 45003900 and 36003400 bc and expanded to interfluvial habitats in the more favourable times 52004500 39003600 and 34001800 bc although the last period was probably one of the most favourable in the holocene trees failed to return to the boundary of 5400 bc strong southward shift of the polar boundary of open forests and significant decrease in stocking density occurred for the second time at approximately 1700 bc this stage may be regarded as the end of the middle holocene and the onset of the current stage of tree vegetation development in the yamal peninsula over the past 3700 years forestandtundra communities were preserved mainly in river valleys located in the very south of the yamal peninsula relatively favourable conditions existed in 1200900 bc 100 bcad 200 and during the medieval optimum 700 1400 ad treering chronology construction the clarity of tree rings on crosssections of subfossil larch are reasonably clear though the visibility can be improved by rubbing chalk powder into the wood vessels the total ring widths have been measured along one radius of some 2170 samples with an accuracy of 001 mm considering that firstly the climatic conditions within area of research are very homogeneous and secondly sensitivity of the individual treering series tends to be very high mean sensitivity coefficient fritts 1976 range from 03 to 06 the majority of the sample series can generally be dated using standard crossdating techniques applied between samples undated series are short for the most part the percentage of crossdated samples contained more than 150 rings is about 80 the number of dated series with less than 100 years is about 35 spruce chronologies also crossdate well with the larch data the main difficulty in crossdating treering series in this region is the occurrence of frequent missing rings on measured radii in some samples generally those with relatively narrow rings up to 510 of the rings are absent in the sample the first step in developing multimillennial ringwidth chronology is the production of several 200400 year long floating chronologies groups of individual series firmly crossdated relative to each other but only preliminarily anchored in time on the basis of radiocarbon dates construction of the absolutelydated chronology was started using tree rings of living trees growing in the southern part of yamal peninsula with the river valleys mentioned above initially 1250year chronology from the polar ural mountains shiyatov 1995 was used as master dating series as well there is high degree of similarity in the annual variability of radial tree growth in yamal and polar urals because of their proximity about 200 km later the main problem was to establish positive overlap positions between the absolute recent series and the most recent floating chronologies some periods proved to be difficult to bridge notably between 350 and 450 bc and especially 1250 and 1350 bc for these time intervals the chronologies should still be considered provisional due to the relatively low sample replication however at present we consider the chronology to reliably span the 4000 years from 2000 bc to the present 1996 with some confidence within this period data from 535 subfossil wood samples are incorporated 513 of them collected from alluvial deposits and 22 on the surface figure 6 shows the sample distribution of the trees from alluvial deposits through time corridorstandardized version of the yamal chronology in one approach to constructing mean chronology 224 individual series of subfossil larches were selected these were the longest and most sensitive series where sensitivity is measured by the magnitude of interannual variability these data were supplemented by the addition of 17 ringwidth series from 200400year old living larches to remove the growth trend that can obscure climatic influences on tree growth procedure known as standardization fritts 1976 the corridor method was used as described in detail in shiyatov 1986 this incorporated some correction of the mean chronology to reduce the variance where this was artificially inflated due to low replication here taken to be those time intervals with less than 7 samples per year above and resulting higher annual variability slight correction was made for the this amounted to 605 years 15 of total length within these periods larger correction was made for periods represented by only three samples 97 years 24 figure 7 shows the corrected corridorstandardized version of the absolute yamal larch chronology this emphasises interannual to multidecadal timescales of variability climatic reconstruction the width of the annual growth rings in many tree species depends among other things on the width of one or more previous rings manifest as statistically measurable autocorrelation this is due to the degree of biological persistence that follows from extended physiological processes such as needle formation and longevity and storage of materials fritts 1976 rather than using lagged regression model incorporating predictors from years prior to and sometimes following the predictand climate year eg briffa et 19__ the chronology was instead statistically prewhitened and the residuals from general autoregression model were used for estimating past climate variability this means that the resulting reconstructions are representative of interannual to multi decadal timescales only and will not show centurytomillennial scale changes that explored later using the evidence of treeline changes at high latitudes interannual variability in ringwidth is known to correlate well with variations in summer temperature to define the optimum season for this study and we correlated individual monthly mean temperature series with the prewhitened chronology the temperature data used were observations from the salekhard meteorological station located 150 km to the southwest of the research area correlations were calculated for the period 18831996 the largest correlation coefficients show that ring width is increased in association with warm conditions during june and more especially during july with correlation coefficients for june of 035 and for july of 063 an average of june and july mean temperatures was therefore selected as the predictand to be reconstructed using these treering data the complete reconstruction is plotted in the form of temperature anomalies from the mean of the full reconstructed period 2000 bc1996 ad in figure 8 this long record shows that the amplitude of temperature variability within the range being reconstructed here has altered noticeably through time figure 9 summarises the changes in interannual variability of summer temperatures over the last 4000 years in this region there is correlation between this variability and mean reconstructed temperatures over corresponding 50year periods different periods parameter that can describe climate conditions during certain periods ie by periods with can therefore be categorised according to combination of mean and variance ie periods with similar mean temperature may be distinguished according to whether they exhibit high interannual variability than periods with low variability possibly implying different impacts on people and ecosystems the separate frequencies of extreme cold and extreme warm summers are shown in figure 10 high numbers of moderate 2σ negative extremes occur in the 8th and 6th centuries bc and the 1st and 13th 14th 16th and 18th centuries ad while there are none in the 3rd century bc most equivalent positive extremes occurred in the 10th 5th and 2nd centuries bc and in the 17th and 18th centuries ad while none occurred in the 17th and 13th centuries bc before discussing relatively longterm variations in the reconstructions figure 11 it is necessary to stress again that the majority of constituent treering series forming the chronology range in length from about 100300 years on average 180 rings this fact and the method of standardization used here to remove nonclimatic trends that are of equivalent length or longer than the series in question mean that the calibrated reconstruction will not represent multicentennial or longer variations in temperature despite the total length of chronology eg cook et 1995 however fluctuations of summer temperatures on annual decadal and partly century timescale are notice having emphasised the effective bandpass nature of the reconstruction it is apparent figure 11a that many of the extreme decadaltimescale cold periods occurred within the last 1400 years the most severe were ad 620 650 800830 9951015 the most severe cooling 14401470 and finally 18051840 many short warm periods occurred during the first half of the reconstruction in 12101990 530500 and 440425 bc among the more notable longer multidecadal cool periods the most severe occurred in the 19th century ad while other longer cool periods included 500 to 280 bc perhaps even to 190 bc and ad 16001750 the latter may be western siberian manifestation of the socalled little ice age the warmer periods include 1660 and 13801320 bc and the second half of the 18th century ad the long warm period that lasted from about 10 bc to 160 ad is also remarkable feature of the reconstruction recent warming is also clear especially if it is judged to have commenced at the low interannual variability and the minimum occurrence of cold extremes during the 20th century argue that the most recent decades of this long summer record represent the most favourable climate conditions for tree growth within the last four millennia reconstruction of treeline dynamics to display centurytomillenniumscale climate variability it is possible to construct record of treeline shifts as the dynamics of polar and upper treelines reflect longscale climatic changes though with some limitations payette lavoie 1994 figure 12 shows reconstruction of the treeline dynamics composited from evidence from the different river valleys in the yamal peninsula expressed with respect to the presentday polar limits of larch this longtimescale representation of summer conditions is based on the relative positions of more than 500 trees each of which has been preciselydated by crossdating their ring patterns the data were treated separately for each valley system and tree position transformed into anomalies from their own present day limit and because river valley could as yet supply sufficient samples to cover the whole period the data were then combined to form single regional indication of treeline shifts this should be considered as preliminary result because there is some subjectivity in the way the different valley data were expressed shifts of treeline during the last 3700 years were relatively small and possibly less significant being confined to an area within about 5 km of the present day limit however there was dramatic southward shift of the treeline that occurred in the middle of the 17th century bc from the presently available data the full magnitude of this shift is impossible to estimate other than to say that the polar line shift was noted previously on the basis of radiocarbon dating figure 5 but it is dated much more exactly here on the evidence of dendrochronological crossdating during the last 3700 years 5 periods of unfavourable climate are evident as minor southward treeline shift the latter 4 of these commenced at around ad 600 950 1450 and 1800 all coincident with severe cool periods in figure 11 the most protracted starting at around 350 bc was time of cool summers also though these began little earlier at about 400 bc the much larger shift of the 17th century bc also coincides with an abrupt and large cooling after 1660 bc this may have been severe cooling double event figure 11a the latter part of which may have been associated with the eruption of the thera volcano around 1628 bc baillie 1999 grudd et 2000 as regards periods of more northerly treeline perhaps around ad 1200 these may reflect warmings that slight and persistent or warmth that is simply not represented in the ringwidth reconstruction combining the evidence of treeline shifts on cross dated ring sequences and radiocarbon see also figure 6 it is possible to summarise the longertimescale variation of summer temperature from 1800 bc to 1300 bc continuous deterioration of climate conditions was underway then warming followed that lasted for the next four centuries further onset of worsening conditions began at 900 bc and continued to 100 bc with the least favourable period occurring in the period 400300 from the second half of the first century bc to the end of that millennium generally warm conditions prevailed the most favourable punctuated by conditions during the last two millennia apparently occurred between about ad 500 and 1400 though punctuated by cooler summers in 600 700 and at about 1000 following the second half of the 15th century climatic conditions again became worse though the second half of the 16th marked the next period of warming which then changed to cooling in the 19th century culminating in the present period of relative warmth conclusion the work we describe here marks significant progress in the development of holocene length treering chronology for the yamal peninsula large amount of well preserved subfossil wood with climate sensitive ring widths have allowed reliable hightomedium frequencies of summer warmth radiocarbon dating of tree samples and more precise dendrochronological dating of the same samples has enabled preliminary interpretation of tree line shifts in terms of longertimescale temperature variations the immediate task for future work is to both extend the length of the chronology while increasing the sample depth throughout its whole length together with experimentation of new data processing techniques that require wellreplicated data sets this work will certainly increase the timescale of information directly interpretable from these data in addition to climate reconstruction the multimillennialength yamal treering chronology has great potential for solving other problems in ecology geology and
