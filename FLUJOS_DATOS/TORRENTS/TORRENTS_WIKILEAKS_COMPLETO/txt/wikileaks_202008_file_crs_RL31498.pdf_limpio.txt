and finance division january 31 2007 abstract comprehensive social security reform has been an issue of debate in congress for some time but major action has occurred reform proposals have been driven in part by recognition that in the future the program is Ô¨Ånancially unsustainable under current policy this report tackles the issue from an economic perspective that focuses not merely on reform that achieves programmatic sustainability sustainability within the trust fund but reform that achieves sustainability for the government and economy as whole moreover it stresses the importance of understanding the economic consequences of program changes if one is to understand who pays to achieve this sustainability and what type of changes might be consistent with the economic rationale for social insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31498g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

on the congressional agenda while social security originated as depressionera program aimed at alleviating the economic circumstances of the elderly social insurance also corrects market failures in the annuity market adverse selection prevents freeriders requires workers to provide for their retirement spreads risk and may correct for failure to optimize by shortsighted individuals the system imposes costs on society as well through distortions in savings and labor supply and political risk the need for reform arises from projected financial shortfalls of the current system largely pay asyougo paygo transfer system trust fund assets cannot sustain the system the assets were arguably not generated through real government saving in light of the history of persistent budget deficits the problem is not merely blip that occurs as the baby boom retires the workerrecipient ratio is projected to fall permanently and ultimately either taxes must be increased by about 50 or benefits must be cut by one third inaction would likely lead to significant tax increases in the future since it is difficult to cut the benefits of existing recipients reform now would allow future recipients to ad apt to benefit changes and the economy to expand through saving making the long run problem less burdensome proposed reforms involve revisions to the present system the introduction of individual accounts or combination of both all else equal raising taxes or cutting benefits increases government saving most taxes would not significantly affect the private saving rate especially wage and consumption taxes evidence suggests that some benefit reductions eg raising both the early and full retirement age are more likely to increase labor supply and the tax base than others investing trust fund balances in equities cannot however provide higher aggregate returns unless financed through higher taxes or lower governme nt spending otherwise gains from investment earnings will be offset by lower returns to private portfolios and higher government interest rates this analysis suggests that increased government borrowing costs could largely negate the perceived gains to the government individual accounts are often touted for their higher returns however these comparisons are not accurate they do not account for general equilibrium effects on interest rates transition costs of paying off existing liabilities the increased risk for individuals andin some casesthe full cost of the current systems social functions eg disability transfers if debt financed individual accounts systems would magnify the crisis because transition costs would increase moreover if pure individual account system is to be successful in addressing market failures such as adverse selection and free riders it must be made mandatory in participation annuitization and prudent investment two problems emerge even if these rules are followed individual accounts would redistribute away from the poor because of their shorter lifespan and would eliminate the explicit redistribution of the current system individual accounts would also expose cohorts of retirees to significant variation in benefits due to the vagaries of the stock market individual accounts however could reduce tax distortions and political risk and facilitate budgetary discipline this report will not be updated

of the current problem and the proposed solutions to that problem it is worth taking moment to consider why we have social security system at all historically of course social security arose as depressionera program to alleviate the economic circumstances of the elderly for that reason and perhaps others it began as transfer rather than fullyfunded retirement system and the susceptibility of tax and transfer system to demographic changes is the reason for the current problem today social security is more than retirement system it provides disability payments which account for about 15 of benefits as well as benefits to survivors and dependents there is companion program medicare that provides for health benefits in retirement social security has also been way to provide income redistribution that has lifted many elderly out of poverty without resort to explicit and to some demeaning welfare programs to some these other functions of social security represent social goals that should be separated from the provision of retirement income for others they are an integral part of social securitys role of insuring against the risks associated with old age why not simply allow individuals to cope with their own retirement and other risks such as disability through private saving and insurance economic theory suggests several reasons that are discussed below g3g141g159g142g155g156g142g561g21g142g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 one reason for an aggregated mandatory social insurance program is problem called adverse selection since individuals know more about their own circumstances than insurance firms individuals who are more likely to benefit from insurance would tend to purchase it for example using ones life savings to purchase an annuity that pays fixed amount per month over the rest of ones life would be most attractive to individuals who expect to live long time and unattractive to person with terminal disease so the insurance industry will only offer to pay smaller annuity than that justified by average life expectancy because the companies know that their customers will more likely be those who expect long life these less advantageous terms lead annuities to be attractive to an even smaller group of individuals the result is that markets do not provide attractive annuities to the average person the problem can be avoided by the government mandating the purchase of annuities or by directly providing them through tax and benefit system c

one known as moral hazard which arises from behavioral responses to incentives in this case moral hazard arises if society has safety net for only the poor individuals know that if they do not save for retirement society will not allow them to be destitute so there is an incentive to free ride on the programto undersave to take too many risks in saving choices and to spend accumulated savings too quickly by requiring individuals to participate in and pay taxes into minimum retirement system that pays lifetime annuity upon retirement that is not risky this moral hazard problem can be avoided g11g151g140g152g150g153g149g142g157g142g561g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g156g561 social insurance system also allows for the reduction of individual risk in saving for retirement by spreading investment and other risks across individuals within generation as well as across generations even if private insurance markets are complete within generations they are unlikely to be complete between generations implying that social insurance system can lead to efficiency gains for society as whole 1 prolonged slump in the stock market for example can be especially damaging to the generation reaching retirement age during that period g8g138g146g149g158g155g142g561g157g152g561g17g153g157g146g150g146g163g142g561 there are other reasons for mandatory social insurance system individuals may not always do what is in their own best interest insurance and annuity purchases are complicated and the optimal lifetime savings plan is one susceptible to mistakes or myopia economists would call this problem failure of individual optimization the fact that so many individuals retire at their earliest age of eligibility is suggestive that such failures might occur if the failure to optimize is the dominant reason for social security then economic models and theories may have very little predictive power regarding the effects of reform 2 g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g5g152g156g157g156g561g152g143g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561 social insurance programs also impose costs on society if taxes are not directly tied to benefits they can cause distortions in labor supply and other economic behavior since the current social security system is not fully funded it may reduce national saving from its efficient level it may be politically difficult to maintain an accumulated asset fund that is not viewed as permitting greater degree of deficit financing in the remaining part of the budget and even social insurance programs that are funded may not reflect the optimal choices in asset holdings since the program is legislated it can also expose participants to the political risk of arbitrary transfers among individuals note however that the potential future tax and benefit changes necessary to address the current solvency problem would not disappear in system of private saving political risk should be thought of as shifting costs and benefits among individuals and is 1 see robert schiller social insurance and institutions for intergenerational intragenerational and

creating the current financing problem these economic rationales for social insurance and the costs associated with them provide an important framework for analyzing alternative appr oaches to reform and will be referred to frequently in this report to illustrate their importance consider briefly what they imply about individual accounts which have been proposed as full or partial substitute for social security by some and which have the advantage of reducing economic distortions individual accounts as complete substitute for social security would not address the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard unless they were mandatory both with respect to contributions and to conversion to life annuity and prudently invested if these restrictions were not introduced then there is economic advantage to government involvement in retirement decisions and such decisions could be left to the private market they also do not permit explicit redistribution in favor of lower income individuals as the current system does indeed given the higher mortality rates of lower income individuals higher income individuals would actually enjoy higher benefits on average the longer expected life span of high income individuals give them an advantage in the current system as well but explicit redistribution toward lowerpaid workers offsets this effect therefore individual accounts are caught on th horns of dilemma they cannot simultaneously satisfy the objectives of eliminating adverse selection and moral hazard and the distributional objectives of the current system to maintain all of these objectives individual accounts would need to constitute only part of the social security system or the accounts would need to be subsidized for low income individuals g25g145g138g157g561g11g156g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g501g561 social security was and largely remains payasyougo paygo system in which current workers pay the retirement benefits of current retirees through payroll tax 3 there is saving component to this type of system from an economic perspective it is generational transfer system not pension or investment system if benefits equal tax payments as pure paygo system implies then total benefits can only grow at the rate that payroll tax revenues growwith stable population growth and age distribution that will be the growth rate of the economy thus for an average retiree who has spent his entire life contributing to paygo the rate of return on his payroll taxes would be about equal to the growth rate of the economy but for retiree in the early years of the system who lived part of his working life before the systems inception the rate of return on his payroll taxes will be much higher because he receives the same benefits without making lifetime of contributions 4 according to one estimate past and present generations will receive 91 trillion more in benefits than they paid in contributions in present value terms which under current policy will be borne by future generations5 3 the economic incidence of the payroll tax is borne by the worker regardless of who has the legal obligation to pay thus the incidence of the onehalf of taxes paid by employers is different from taxes paid by employees 4 for more information see john geanakopolis olivia mitchell and stephen zeldes social security moneys

per average retiree need to fall for the system to remain solvent and the return on contributions would fall and could become negative trouble arises in the future because the retirement of the baby boom generation along with increasing life spans cause the growth rate of retirees to greatly outstrip the growth rate of workers in the system pure paygo system could rectify this imbalance by increasing taxes in order to maintain the historical growth rate of benefits or by decreasing the growth rate of benefits to maintain taxes neglecting economic effects for the moment the choice is simply transfer of income increasing taxes in the future constitutes transfer from future workers to the baby boomers while lowering benefits constitutes transfer from the baby boomers to future workers the only other possibility would be to cover the difference through the issuance of government debt to the public but this option would simply transfer the burden further into the future because the budget deficits would decrease the national saving rate and with it the future size of the economy in the long run such an approach could not be sustained in any case the imbalance is large enough that debt issuance could not be primary solution to the problem even in an intermediate horizon cbo forecasts suggest that as the baby boomers retire debt would quickly exceed 200 of gdp primarily because of higher health care spending it would be difficult for the government to convince its citizens to purchase debt at these levels the problem of the baby boomers retirement is well appreciated what may be less well understood is that the financing problem is permanent problem it is not decadelong blip while the baby boomers retire key to financing paygo system is the worker to recipient ratio and it is the level of the workerrecipient ratio that determines the revenues of paygo system not the change in the ratio as seen in figure 1 this ratio deteriorates markedly while the baby boomers retire from 34 workers per recipient today to about 20 by 2040 6 if the ratio then recovered as the baby boomers died the financin g problem would be temporary one whose cost could be spread by borrowing to generations before and after the blip but the problem is permanent the ratio is not projected to recover part of the reason for this effect is the increase in life expectancy after9 retirement which reflects assumptions about both longevity and earlier retirement 6 it is always important to remember that forecasting is not science and any future estimates are only the most likely outcome of an uncertain event as projection moves further into the future uncertainty increases in their report the oasdi trustees address this issue by offering alternative high and low cost scenarios under the high cost scenario the workerrecipient ratio would reach 18 by 2040 and under the low cost scenario the ratio would reach 24 in 2040

annual report 200 6 table ivb2 note s ol id line based on truste intermediate assum ptions dashed lines rep rese nt workerreci pient ratio under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios one can contrast the past and future financial state of the social security system with the state that would have been achieved if fully funded system had originally been instated instead of payasyougo system in fully funded system current workers pay for their own future benefits through either collective account or individual accounts instead of the benefits of current retirees until they retire the proceeds are saved in real financial securities allowing fully funded system to achieve market rate of retur n how would outcomes differ under this type of system as opposed to paygo system benefit levels and the rate of return on workers taxes would longer be directly related to the workerrecipient ratio it would only change as the capital stock per worker is affected thus the retirement of the baby boomers would not require reductions in benefits or tax increases because their benefits would come from their own contributions and the earnings on them 7 where would the money come from to make this possible it would come from the fact that early retirees who spent only few working years under the system would have received little or benefits instead the money they would have received under paygo system would have been saved and invested for later retirees because money has already been transferred to the early retirees in the current system there is reform to that system to achieve solvency that can avoid lowering someones rate of return the social security system has operated differently from pure payasyougo system retirement system historically in two important ways first unlike pure paygo the social security system has not always paid out as much as it s taken in social security has always maintained small reserve against shortterm fluctuations more importantly changes to the system in 1983 7 increasing longevity however would result in smaller annual annuities for fixed amount of contributions under funded system this effect cannot be avoided but it does not affect the typical rate of return httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31498g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g497g561g7g140g152g151g152 g150g146g140g561g11g156g156g158g142

of gdp in 2006 from an accounting perspective these surpluses have introduced partial funding aspect to the system and the social security trust fund has grown to 1687 billion as result unfortunately the budget deficits of the government in most of these years have arguably prevented the surpluses from partially funding the system in an economic sense indeed most years since the 1980s debt held by the public as percentage of gdp increased second the average single retir ee will not enjoy the paygo rate of return equal to the growth rate of the economy because portion of his contributions are diverted to benefits unrelated to retirement the current system also provides benefits to the disabled survivors and dependents in 2003 these uses accounted for more than onethird of total benefits paid 18 for survivors 15 for disability and 5 for dependents in addition it explicitly redistributes benefits by earnings level apparently further lowering the systems rate of return for higher paid workers for example single worker retiring at age 65 in 2003 earning low wages would recoup the retirement portion of his and his employers payroll taxes plus interest in 104 years worker earning an average wage would recoup them in 149 years and worker earning the maximum eligible wage would recoup them in 214 years 8 however comparisons of the benefit structure overstate the actual degree of redistribution because of other factors such as greater life expectancy for high income individuals9 it is important to factor in the resources devoted to these social functions when calculating the return the system can earn for retirees even funded system could not earn the return of private saving account if it were to maintain these social functions

narrow definition used by the social security trustees of preventing the social security trust fund from being depleted over 75 years seems unsatisfactory from an economic perspective after all the trust fund can be replenished in any number of ways that would not make it any easier for the government to meet its financing needs and would have effect on the economy for example income tax revenues could simply be diverted to the trust fund anytime benefits exce ed payroll tax revenues but if the government wished to maintain its other spending without ra ising taxes it would then have to borrow to finance spending that would otherwise be financed through income tax revenues the government cannot borrow sufficiently to maintain current policy through the retirement of the baby boomers largely because of the rapid projected growth of medicare spending because debt cannot grow faster than gdp without limit as current policy implies 8 crs report rl31034 social security the

unsustainable when benefits exceed revenues as is forecast to occur in 2017 or is it sustainable as long as there are assets in the trust fund to draw down as will be the case until 2040 the latter option seems unsatisfactory when one considers that there are not any real assets in the trust fund at all since the social security trust fund holds us treasuries the government owes money to itself it is analogous to saying that one can afford to make purchase because ones left pocket has an iou from ones right pocket even though ones right pocket is empty what is in the left or right pocket by itself is irrelevant it is total wealth that determines whether the purchase can be made similarly it is the governments overall ability to meet the needs of retirees that determines the sustainability of the social security system when the baby boomers retire the governments overall ability to pay benefits comes down to what benefits have been promised how much overall tax revenue is being raised and what is the size of the economy from which taxes are being raised the answer to these three questions determines the underlying solvency of social security because the decline in the worker to recipient ratio is projected to be permanent the financing problem is permanent this makes the trustees estimate of the 75year actuarial deficit of 202 of payroll misleadingly low estimate of the systems financing problemsa trust fund that is solvent for exactly 75 years merely shifts the permanent tax increases to year 76 and offers indication of how the government will finance the redemption of trust fund assets 10 the problem with current policy is that mostly due to the projected rise in medicare spending the overall gap between revenues and outlays would place an unsustainable strain on the unified budget deficit11 for this reason although the trust funds are assets to the social security system it is doubtful that there will be general revenues available to honor those assets thus the best measure to gauge the size of the problem is the difference between taxes and benefits paid over time under current policy as shown in figure 2 for the time being focusing on this measure sets aside the issue of trust fund balances which are not meaningful in an economic sense without considering total government assets or liabilities 10 the measure of social securitys financing shortfall most commonly cited is the actuarial deficit the actuarial deficit is the size of the tax increase or benefit reduction as percentage of payroll that would be required for the trust fund to exhaust its assets in 75 years it does not measure the tax increase or benefit reduction needed to prevent cash deficits within the system over 75 yearsthe actuarial deficit assumes that cash deficits in any given year can be closed by drawing down trust fund assets 11 the indefinite maintenance of current policy implies that the national debt as percentage of gdp would be projected to asymptotically approach infinity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31498g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g497g561g7g140g152g151g152

increase of roughly 50 it would also be about 3¬Ω times as large the trustees actuarial deficit of 202 of payroll although this report addresses only social security it should be stressed that medicare and medicaid face projected shortfalls that are even larger and would require even larger tax increases to fund the projections are extremely sensitive to underlying assumptions and should be treated with caution under the lowcost alternative scenario the shortfall would reach 05 of gdp by 2030 and 09 of gdp by 2080 under the highcost scenario the shortfall would reach 19 of gdp by 2030 and 39 of gdp in 2080 thus while the extent of needed changes is highly uncertain even under the lowcost scenario some tax increase or benefit reduction would be necessary if tax increase or benefit reduction of nearly 1 of gdp is necessary by 2030 and 2 of gdp by 2080 but the system is currently in surplus is there any reason to reform the system before it 12 congressional budget office updated

worker to recipient ratio is nearly fixed barring massive immigration or higher birth or death rates only the future size of the economy and the future state of government finances can be influenced today thus reform can ease the future financing burden only if reform causes the economy to grow faster and improves the government s finances13 these are macroeconomic problems that cannot be posed in terms of the social security system s trust fund in these terms according to standard economic theory the crucial factor in determining whether the social security surpluses increase economic growth and improve the governments finances depends on whether they are saved saving by the government has two salutary effects first it increases national saving which increases private capital accumulation the future size of the economy and with it the future size of tax receipts in this way saving budget surpluses is analogous to transferring resources from present to future generations second saving frees up future government resources by reducing interest payments and increasing tax revenues in absolute terms that make financing future imbalances easier by contrast when the social security surplus is used to finance other government activities or tax cuts rather than being saved the social security trust fund is increased but nothing is done to alleviate the governments future fiscal imbalance of course it is difficult to actually determine whether the social security surplus was saved because the budget that would have been in the absence of surpluses cannot be observed but it is known that the government had deficits ever year from 1983 to 1997 and again beginning in 2002 when surpluses were appearing in the social security system and that debt as percentage of output increased during that period if the social security surpluses were used to finance other spending then running surpluses in the accounts s done nothing to address the crisis in real sense the counterargument is that the social security surpluses increased national saving because the historical budget deficits would have been even bigger in their absence 14 from this discussion it should be clear that saving surplus from any source will increase the future size of the economy and improve the governments future financial position even though nonsocial security surpluses do not increase the social security trust fund however merely saving all of the projected social security surpluses which are determined by budget accounting rules rather than the scope of the problem is gro ssly insufficient to close the longterm financing gap word of caution is in order simply increasing the size of the economy alone will not convert permanently unsustainable system to sustainable one higher wage base will increase tax receipts but because under current law benefits are linked directly to wages benefits will increase as well because it would not raise the benefits of those already retired higher economic growth would improve the systems financesbut only temporarily what increased saving will do is make other changes such as higher taxes or reductions in benefits relative to wages easier because everyone will be better off for example if income is higher relatively lower tax rate will be needed to raise given amount of revenue plans that aim to improve sustainability through economic growth would therefore be mo re effective if the link between wage growth and benefit growth were weakened 13 reform in advance is also essential for approaches that involve benefit reductions so that workers have enough of their working careers left to adjust their pe rsonal saving behavior to the reductions 14 for alternative perspectives on the social security trust fund see

on savings and the supply of labor the social security system like all tax and transfer systems has potential effects on the size of the economy through effects on labor supply and capital accumulation first the tax and transfer system could alter savings decisions because it reduces income in the present and increases it in the future secondly the payroll taxes themselves could alter labor supply as would be the case for any tax on labor income with the effects depending on the linkage between taxes and benefits in social security there is link between benefits and taxes however so payroll taxes are not taxes in strict sense workers may view them more as contributions that will later be recouped higher earnings during the working years result in higher benefits albeit earning much smaller return than would savings and perhaps reflecting forced savings 15 thus the behavioral effects of tax and transfer system occupy middle ground between an ordinary tax and expenditures system and pension system moreover individuals may perceive the tax as different from other taxes indeed the payroll tax is tax that has generally not been as unpopular as income taxes g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g561 to an individual participation in the social security system appears to be form of saving it reduces disposable income in working years and increases it in the future in certain models of household behavior over time eg the life cycle model such an income shift should reduce personal saving natural response is to rebalance consumption over time by increasing consumption today and reducing funds available in the future that are less needed in simple model where social security earns normal return and borrowing is available savings should fall by exactly the amount of social security taxes this expected effect has been the basis for much criticism of the unfunded social security system that is the social security system can be seen as system that provides effects similar to saving in pension plan except that real accumulation of capital necessarily occurs the system has generated surpluses but this effect is not very meaningful for two reasons first most of the system is still payasyougo and the surpluses are small in relation to the future size of the unfunded liabilities and secondly these surpluses may have permitted larger deficits in programs outside of social security so that it is not clear that real savings has occurred however this effect on savings is not certain for several reasons first to the extent that social security system substitutes for preexisting inte rgenerational transfers savings effects would be expected for example if in the absence of social security individuals expect to support their parents and expect in turn to be supported by their children and that obligation is reduced or eliminated by social security the transfer system is acting as substitute for private transfers and would not necessarily reduce private saving similarly if parents had expected to leave bequests to their children the parents would have increased their bequests to offset the payroll tax and children would wish to save that bequest to relieve their own children of the tax most families do not leave bequests of any significance however so it is the former rather than the latter 15 in the medicare program there is link between the level of earnings and the level of benefits

if all individuals are connected through intergenerational transfers anything the government does is offset by what individuals do this phenomenon is referred to as ricardian equivalence although such model is obviously not entirely realistic some individuals have children for example some elements of it may be present in the us economy in either of these models outcomes may also be affected to the extent that some individuals are liquidity constrained that is they would like to consume more now but cannot liquidity constrained individuals are affected only by cash flow effects that is taxes lower consumption and future income such as social security has effect on current consumption there is evidence that significant fraction of individuals falls into this category people may also save for precautionary reasons because of future uncertainty and the potential for misfortune social security may lower private saving by reducing uncertainty and the need for precautionary saving then again the family safety net may make precautionary saving largely unnecessary so that the introduction of social security has little effect on precautionary saving finally this analysis of savings effects assumes that individuals are making optimizing choices however making the appropriate lifetime savings decision is not only complicated it is done only once so people cannot learn from mistakes thus the possibility for significant error must be considered all of this discussion suggests that turning to empirical evidence to assess the effects on savings is necessary much of this approach has been based on time series studies which examine the change in savings rates over time with changes in social security wealth unfortunately the econometric evidence has been mixed 16 an early influential study by feldstein 1974 found social security significantly reduced private savings actually increasing consumption however that study was found to have programming error by leimer and lesnoy 1982 which caused the results to become smaller and generally statistically insignificant feldstein 1982 1996 still found significant results with additional data his findings suggested that social security reduced the saving rate by half in 1992 these results were questioned by meguire 1998 who found result about tenth as large and by coates and humphreys 1999 who found results that tended to be smaller and in some cases in the opposite direction part of the problem with these studies is that it is very difficult to measure social security wealth another is that it is difficult to control for other effects and finally the results tend to be sensitive to functional form in general studies have found some savings offset but typica lly not enough for social security to offset private wealth dollar for dollar some studies have used cross section data and in most cases found some effect on saving but considerably less than the full savings reduction implied by the life cycle modeling approach most of the effects were not statistically significant however these data are in any case quite questionable because social security rules are generally applied uniformly thus any variation is 16 see martin feldstein social security induced retirement and aggregate capital accumulation journal of political economy 82 sepoct 1974 pp 905926 dean r leimer and selig d lesnoy social

could independently affect savings17 final approach is to compare savings rates in c ountries with different social security systems these results tend to not be very conclusive finding both positive and negative effects usually without statistical significance but perhaps it is not surprising that it is difficult to detect results given the possible influence of cultural mores on saving18 in general therefore the evidence suggests savings effect but one that is by means large enough to be consistent with the life cycle model at this point word of caution is also in order for predictions of the effects of social security reform that rest on simulation models an example is the recent study that uses dynamic model to estimate the effects of social security revisions19 this model is life cycle model although it allows for bequests the bequest motive is not the type that leads to effect of social security on savings this study tends to find privatization an attractive option in part because of its effect on saving but this result is driven in part by the fundamental nature of the model different model would not have led to the same predicted effect it should also be recognized that if individuals are wellinformed rational and optimizing the projected insolvency of the social security system should already have an effect on the national saving rate if people working today know that the system will be capable of paying only say twothirds of their benefits as promised under curr ent law then they should be saving more than they would if the system faced crisis on the other hand if individuals currently believe they will pay the taxes and receive the benefits promised under current law reform could induce more private saving this could happen because individuals are not well informed eg they base their expected benefit on account statements from the social security administration instead of the financial position of the system or because they think that others will bear the burden of solving the problem eg they believe taxes will be raised after they have retired the theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that social security has had less clear cut effect on saving than is often assumed if social security has not caused individuals to save less then the paygo approach may not be necessarily faulted as discouraging savings in any case it is one thing to argue that had we originally introduced fully funded system rather than paygo system we would have achieved higher national sa ving rates but it is another to argue that now that we have had paygo system for over 60 years shifting to funded system will raise the national saving rate as discusse d below moving from paygo to fully funded system involves significant transition cost and if this transition cost is financed through debt issuance national saving will not rise thus the move to fully funded system is only likely to increase national saving if real resources are devoted to financing the transition in the form of higher taxes or lower benefits 17 see the review in social security and private saving review of the empirical evidence congressional budget office july 1998 18

systems can also affect labor supply economic theory suggests that wage taxes have the potential to reduce or increase work effort depending on offsetting income and substitution effects these effects may be reflected in hours worked or the workforce participation rate if the tax reduces hours worked or participation raising payroll taxes themselves could have negative effect on the size of the work force relative to the retired population and the size of the economy most evidence however suggests that labor supply is not very responsive to the wage rate because of offsetting income and substitution effects indeed for men the evidence suggests that an increase in net wages would slightly reduce work while for married women the effect is slight increase both of these effects are more likely to reflect participation choices rather than choices of hours worked based on empirical studies that reflected taxes the congressional budget office puts the total response at an elasticity of between 0 and 03 meaning that 10 reduction in wage might reduce work effort by up to 3 reflecting response of between 01 to 02 for men and 03 to 07 for married women 20 social security has some particular attributes for the effect on work that might modify these results in various ways first there is link between payroll taxes and the size of social security at retirement that makes the payroll tax only partially tax because of redistribution in the system and the paygo nature this relationship is not perfect ie the return earned is too low and variation in taxes does not lead to the same degree of variation in benefits but the payroll tax is more directly linked to benefits than are other taxes secondly there is ceiling on covered wages so that higher income workers do not experience the marginal tax effects that tend to lead to reduced work indeed for such individuals which would include higher income men there is if anything an inducement to increase work from payroll taxes via income effects for married women who have generally been viewed as most responsive to taxes in their labor supply the link between taxes and benefits is lessened because they may receive spousal benefits even if they do not work this latter link suggests that the benefits to contributing are smaller than would be the case for other workers and the presence of the spousal benefit could reduce labor force participation benefits for nonworking spouse are essentially transfer and some have argued that such benefits should not be larger for nonworking wives of higher income men rather the payment should be flat payment smaller flat benefit would increase the tie between social security contributions and benefits for married women who work and should increase their labor supply however empirically estimating the labor supply responsiveness of women to wages is always difficult because potential wages of nonworkers are not observed moreover the responsiveness to social security benefits also depends on perceiving and expecting that working will result in losing the nonworking spouse transfer younger women particularly may be unaware of how spousal benefits are formulated empirical evidence that focuses particularly on social security is relatively limited one study found significant effect on labor force participation of the implicit benefit differential due to being eligible for spousal benefit for older married women but not for younger ones another study found that the benefit differential led to earlier retirement 21 20 us congressional budget

been the increase in retirement of older men since the introduction of the system between 1950 and 1989 labor force participation decreased from 46 to 17 for those 65 and over and from 87 to 67 for those 55 to 64 the median age of retirement for both men and women fell from around 67 years to about 62 years22 labor force participation of men aged 6264 fell dramatically after the introduction of early retirement at 62 in the early 1960s even though there was an actuarial correction to prevent early retirees from drawing larger lifetime benefits in 1963 76 of these men worked by 1985 only 46 participated the number has roughly stabilized at that rate 23 the fall in retirement age appears to have slowed down and perhaps stab ilized from the 1970s to the 1990s however there are number of factors that might affect this decline but some of it is estimated to be due to social security in part because social security makes retirement feasible and in part because social security has an earning test that discourages work in 2000 congress repealed the test for recipients 65 and older it is probably too early to measure the potential effects of this change for those expecting not to live very long retirement at 62 would be attractive despite the aggregate actuarial correction moreover by setting minimum age for benefit eligibility social security may have contributed to setting some social norm statistical studies have generally found an effect although in some cases not large effect of social security on retirement age some researchers attribute significant portion of the reduction in labor force participation to mandatory retirement policies adopted by businesses and only recently made illegal and to features of private pension systems which encouraged retirement at specific age 24 as in the case of saving studies that rely on cross sections within the united states may be questionable because social security wealth is correlated with other variables that may affect retirement moreover the observation of falling retirement age following the introduction of earlier retirement ag eligibility and the dramatic fall in labor participation has also occurred in other countries that did not experience major changes in private pensions older mens labor force participation has been declining in these countries as well these studies suggest that statutory early retirement age significantly influences the average age of retirement 25 if these studies are correct an important method of raising the worker to recipient ratio may be to raise the age of early retirement the normal retirement age is already being increased critics argue that early retirement reduces the pressure on disability insurance and that many individuals cannot easily work into older age however most occupations have probably become physically less demanding they also argue that allowing earlier retirement prevents people from being thrust into poverty the evidence suggests that about quarter of men receiving early retirement had selfreported worklimiting disability of all early retirees fewer than one in ten were both disabled and had nonsocial security income below the poverty level 26 another study estimated 22 see andrew samwick new evidence on pensions social security and the timing of retirement journal of public economics vol 70 nov 1998 20736 murray gendell

raising current andor future taxes decreasing current andor future benefits investing the trust fund in higher yielding assets the adoption of individual accounts whichever approach is ultimately chosen changes will have to be made to the system in one fashion or another while this report does not provide detailed quantitative analysis of the options they are each discussed briefly in light of the objectives of social insurance the distributional effects both across generations and across income levels and implications for economic behavior the efficacy of any reform will depend on whether it limits the size of eventual tax increases or benefit reductions implied in current policy in some cases the effects of specific revisions are not as clear as they are often portrayed an illustration is proposal to invest trust fund assets in the stock market rather than in government securities thereby earning higher rate of return however in the absence of basic increases in the supply of capital and labor this change cannot be free lunch somewhere someone will pay for these apparent gains another example is the potential effect of moving to voluntary individual accounts which can result in higher interest payments and in the presence of adverse selection and moral hazard higher welfare cost s in the rest of the budget one of the most important effects of this proposal is that individual accounts are supposed to shift from payas yougo finance to funded finance to simultaneously solve the problem of financing promised benefits in the social security system and shift to permanently prefunded even if only in part system would require great deal of new resources during the transition period commentators tend to divide reform proposals into sacrifice approaches such as benefit reductions or tax increases or investment approaches such as equity investment by the trust fund or the introduction of individual accounts this report suggests that policymakers cannot simply choose one approach or the other they must be linked to other changes to succeed tax increases or benefit reductions at present are only useful if they result in higher government saving rate this effect can be accomplished through debt reduction or an investment approach if changes lead to higher government spending outside of social security or to tax cuts they will have increased the size of the trust fund without improving the governments ability to honor trust 27 see olivia s mitchell and john w r phillips retirement responses to early social security

useful if they lead to higher government saving rate and higher gove rnment saving rate is only possible through tax increases or benefit reductions otherwise investment in the trust fund or individual accounts will be debt financed and have positive effect on national saving to make the system sustainable or solvent after reform social security should have roughly effect on the unified budget balance every year to achieve this if social security is to remain in its current paygo form would require that its cost rate be approximately equivalent to the income that has been designated to the program it is also possible for some of the systems income to come from investment earnings if the trust fund or individual accounts were invested or for the system to be redesigned to receive revenue from onbudget sources such as the proceeds of an increase in income tax revenues this definition of solvency may seem overly strict since there is nothing preventing the system from running deficits as l ong as the trust f und possesses assets and nothing preventing the government from supplementing the system with general revenues if it desires nevertheless the definition used in this report is conceptually useful because it is the only definition that requires an explicit description of how the financing gap would be closed in each year reform options that include proposals such as the use of unidentified general revenue transfers the redemption of trust fund assets or the issuance of debton temporary or permanent basisimplicitly depend on further tax increases benefit reductions or reductions in other government spending but do not explain how they will occur again it shou ld be stressed that deficit financing does not impose smaller burden than tax increases or benefit reductions it simply shifts the burden forward to future generations of course reforms can only return the system to projected solvency and the margin of uncertainty on projections is large if the projectio ns are too pessimistic then reforms could turn out to be overly harsh if the projections are too optimistic then further tax increases or benefit reductions would become necessary in the future g11g151g138g140g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g6g142g143g138g158g149g157g561g21g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561 inaction itself does have some consequences as stressed at the beginning of this report the social security system is not sustainable in its current form and inaction shifts the burden of fixing it to the future without action now however these future changes cannot be softened by preparation or warning as noted above given the permanent gap between income and outflow eventually payroll taxes will have to increase by about one half or benefits be cut by about one third in order to match income and outflow on the other hand if social security cannot be more successfully insulated from the rest of the budget and gains from reform are used to finance other government spending or tax cuts as has happened in the past inaction may be preferable second reason to take action soon is that if benefits were to be reduced it would be appropriate to determine those reductions in advance so that workers could plan for them policy makers are reluctant for obvious reasons to reduce benefits of those currently retired and taking action today may simply result in increased taxes in the future as default condition

taxes now and saving the proceeds by improving the unified budget balance would raise the national saving rate and improve the governments finances the beneficial effect would not occur if taxes were raised and the proceeds were not saved raising taxes now would impose part of the adjustment burden on current workers including the baby boom generation if this accumulation could occur without causing deficit finance in the rest of the budget increases in the capital stock result in true improvement in sustainability as wage income would rise however the improvement in solvency would be partly offset unless there were some reduction in benefits relative to wages that is one would need to keep benefits on the path they were already on which would effectively mean cut in social security benefit relative to the larger economy raising taxes now and keeping them permanently higher as method of achieving sustainability could convert the system to partially funded system while tax increases are never popular it should be noted that in this caseif ones goal is to maintain the current size of the social security systemraising taxes now is more economically efficient than raising them in the future since the deadweight loss of taxation grows exponentially as taxes increase there is smaller efficiency loss from raising taxes now than maintaining them for the time being and raisin g them to greater extent in the future if the current payroll tax base were raised there would probably be relatively little adverse effect on private savings or labor supply generally wage taxes are unlikely to have an effect on the savings rate or private capital accumulation in the economy through price effects its only effect may be that because any tax reduces net income it reduces the saving of those who save at fixed rate that is some small part of any tax increase may come out of savings because individuals wish to spread the reduction in consumption over their lifetimes 28 there are also concerns about the regressivity of social security taxes which might argue for increases in the earnings base as well currently there is ceiling on wages subject to the payroll tax alternatively income taxes could be increased to help reduce the systems liabilities these taxes are relatively progressive and fall on the elderly as well as workers but they may have somewhat larger distorting effects on savings and even labor supply income taxes have mixed effects they still have some effect on income in retirement but they also have the potential for discouraging savings through effects on the rates of return these offsetting effects may be the reason that substituting wage for income taxes typically has little effect on the economy in life cycle models 29 some studies have proposed using consumption based tax such as valueadded tax to supplement payroll taxes30 one argument for using such tax is that it is less likely to adversely 28 there are economic models where such an effect would not occur including infinitehorizon models with fixed labor supply where taxes have effects only spending however in the context of these models the government as well as the economy must be dynamically stable and one could view the taxes simply as consequence of spending decisions 29 see eric engen jane gravelle and kent smetters d ynamic tax models why they

and labor supply while payroll taxes fall solely on workers consumption taxes also impose lump sum tax ie tax that does not distort economic behavior on older individuals because they fall on assets as well as on wages in general social security benefits are not affected since they are inflationindexed so that elderly individuals without income from wealth would not bear this burden moreover because it falls on existing retired workers it can be imposed at lower rate than wage tax another approach to raising tax revenue would be to change the tax treatment of social security benefits for purposes of the income tax to make it consistent with the taxation of private pensions as discussed below currently about twothirds of social security recipients pay income tax on their benefits this approach could also be thought of as an effective benefit reduction it would fall relatively lightly on lowincome indi viduals who would be less likely to pay income tax because of standard deductions and personal exemptions in the tax system its impact would also be limited for higher income individuals who already pay tax on larger fraction of their benefits

absolute terms mo st proposals would make benefit cuts prospective to provide time for adjustment so little of the effect would be felt by the current elderly proportional acrosstheboard phasedin decrease could be used or slowing of indexation to prices and wages could be used the advantage of the latter approach is that the savings to the government would grow over time offsetting the gr owth in funding shortfall although if carried out indefinitely it would cause social security benefits to become extremely small relative to preretirement income cbo estimates that one proposal along these lines could reduce outlays to 41 of gdp from 62 of gdp under current law by 2050 31 two particular approaches to restoring solvency that could also induce economically beneficial behavioral effects are reducing benefits for dependents of high wage earners and increasing the retirement age as noted earlier one of the transfers in the social security system is spousal benefit guarantee that rises with the payment to the primary worker for secondary worker the existence of these benefits means that contributions paid into social security earn lower return and thus may have adverse behavioral effects more in the nature of pure taxes lowering the expected benefit to women who do not work increases the return to working and should in theory result in more labor force participatio n evidence cited earlier suggests that this treatment particularly has an effect on the labor force participation of older married women second approach is to increase the normal or full benefit retirement age proponents justify this approach on the grounds that rising life expectancy means that retirees are collecting benefits for longer than previous retirees the full benefit retirement age is already scheduled to increase to 67 raising the full benefit retirement age would result in direct savings in terms of benefit reductions either because of fewer delayed retirement credits or because of reductions in payments received in early retirement cbo estimated that proposal to raise the retirement age and reduce early retirement benefits would reduce outlays in 2050 from 62 of gdp to 5 of gdp

projected increase in spending on social security as percentage of gdp by about 4033 to the extent that workers delayed retirement because of these changes output would be higher and more taxes would also be collected an alternative that might have greater behavioral effect is to raise the age of early and full benefit retirement or to reduce benefits for early retirees such an approach might have larger effect on delaying retirement which would also boost output and tax revenue raising the early retirement age should also reduce the amount of adverse selection in the system the tendency of shorterlived people to choose early retirement reducing benefits to early retirees permits adverse selection but does not reward it as much however if early retirement decisions are not primarily driven by adverse selection the behavioral effect of lower early retirement benefits may be limited these proposals have cost in that the burden may fall disproportionately on demographic groups with lower life expectancy including lower income individuals men and minorities or those who work in arduous occupations and it may increase claims for retirement based on disability

increases or benefit cuts appear necessary to restore the system to solvency does analysis provide any guidelines as to what mixtur of the two would be desirable the answer to this question depends on the economically optimal size of the social security system which in turn depends on the tradeoff between the systems costs and benefits 34 the smaller the system the less it is able to alleviate the market failures it was designed to curemoral hazard adverse selection incomplete insurance markets and failure of optimization the larger the system the more it distorts labor and saving decisions higher taxes have negative substitution effects while benefit reductions have none thus in economic models benefit cuts would typically lead to better macroeconomic outcomes than higher taxes because there would be negative effect on saving and labor supply because evaluation of the costs and benefits of social security is so deeply embedded in value judgements the optimal size of the system must ultimately be determined through the political process and cannot be evaluated in this report if the current size is too large reform should be directed more to benefit cut with private saving making up the difference if the current size is too small reform should be more directed to tax increase if the current system is assumed to already be the optimal size however at least some rationale exists for providing mixture of relatively small benefit cuts and large tax increases if individuals want to smooth the effects of reform over their lifetimes after reform is completed and adjusted to they might prefer roughly proport ional effect on their standard of living since social security benefits are larger fraction of retirement income than social security taxes are of workers income it could be argued that much of the adjustment might be made in tax increases as an illustration consider case with 10 contribution during working period of 45 years to finance an annuity for retirement sp an of 10 years assume 6 rate of return and 33 ibid after 75 years costs including medicare were projected to rise to about 0264 from 0137 instead they would rise to 0209 these projections included some adverse labor supply and savings responses 34 it can be argued that the solution to the systems funding crisis is not primarily an equity argument if higher taxes or lower benefits affect the same people at different points in life then there is equity rationale for favoring one approach over the other

could either increase the contribution by 55 or decrease the annual annuity by 35 suppose however one desired proportional decrease in income for all years to accomplish that would require tax increase of about 47 and an annuity decrease of 47mos t of the adjustment 85 would come on the tax side the share allocated to taxes would still be significant if the social security annuity represented only part of retirement income for example the average share of retirement income from social security is 51 for singles and 37 for married couples 35 with these shares the tax adjustment would be between about twothirds nd about threefourths of the total adjustment respectively rather than 85 this relative shif t away from tax increases to benefit cuts occurs because change in benefits now constitutes smaller portion of overall retirement income of course to the extent that the cause of the crisis is greater longevity individuals might also prefer delay in retirement age which is characterized above as retirement benefit reduction but which also increases the revenues available for benefits in the illustration above retirement would need to be delayed by about four years to maintain benefits if increased longevity were accompanied by increased health during the foregone retirement years then an increased workspan might also be an optimal solution nevertheless it would be problematic for those whose health does not permit longer working period36 in sum what this life cycle discussion suggests is that if social security were initially set at optimal levels only relatively small portion of an adjustment to reflect longevity should be in the form of general benefit cut and most of the adjustment should take place in either higher taxes or higher retirement age

one proposal intended to alleviate the social security problem is to invest funds in higher yielding assets although most often associated with the development of individual accounts other proposals have suggested that such investments be made by the trust fund itself instead in either case the results would be the same the key to whether this strategy provides any net national benefit rests on whether it is debt financed if the investments were funded by raising taxes or lowering government spending they will result in higher rates of capital accumulation which would increase the future size of the economy and increase future resources but if the investments were financed thr ough the issuance of government debt or the use of existing surpluses the exercise amounts to mere shifting of assets into different portfolios since this shift results in increase in net national savings there would be increase in the total capital stock nd the exercise would not create more resources for the nation as whole as will be shown in the simulation below diverting funds out of non marketable treasury bonds and into equities would decrease returns to other investments and raise the government borrowing rate much of the improvement in the systems finances would be offset by higher interest payments in the overall government from the debt issued to finance the trust funds investments

including the retired37 assuming the fund remained defined benefit plan any risk of lower return would also need to be made up presumably by higher taxes estimates that find that investment in equities improves trust fund balances are based on expected returns the variance of financial markets implies that in reality returns on assets could be higher or lower than their expected return for example one study found that if equity markets continued to perform as they have historically there is greater than 25 chance that the value of trust fund invested in equities would be lower after 10 years than if it were invested in government bonds as it is now over longer periods of time however the probability diminishes after 75 years there is less than 1 chance that the equityinvested trust fund would have lower value 38 g16g158g150g142g155g146g140g138g149g561g21g146g150g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 simulation will illustrate how investment by the trust fund affects financial markets and the government budget in simple model with only one type of debt and equity the effects of shifting from holding debt to equity is clear and the gain in earnings will be divided into an offsetting rise in government interest payments and fall in the return on equities this fall in the return on equities also reduces the return on trust fund assets although this is second order effect for small change the same results would occur if the government introduced individual accounts with debt financing and the accounts were invested in the stock market moreover one can estimate the basic magnitude of the effects as discussed briefly in the appendix using 2000 asset shares which depend on the willingness of business to substitute debt and equity and the willingness of individuals to substitute in their portfolios the degree of willingness is called an elasticity it is the percentage change in the ratio of assets divided by the percentage change in the ratio of asset returns the smaller these elasticities are the larger the effect on government borrowing for example if both elasticities are 03 and there is some evidence to support small elasticities 39 then 45 of equity earnings will show up as an offsetting increased cost of borrowing so the government as whole gains only about half of the amount projected the public in its role as private investor loses the remaining 55 the amount that shows up as higher interest costs falls as elasticities rise becoming 12 at elasticities of one 37 an extensive literature describes the presence of what economists call an equity premium in financial markets that is the spread between the returns on equ ities and the returns on bonds is larger than can be explained by models which attempt to weigh the tradeoff between risk and return if the equity premium does still exist and it is caused by failure to optimize investment by the social security system centrally or through individual accounts has the potential to lead to an improvement in social welfare by contrast if the equity premium is the result of other factors eg transaction costs or misspecification by economists then there will be increase in social welfare even if social welfare was increased the reduction in the equity premium would still by definition lead to the same relative reduction in rates of return 38 amy harris noah

with shift to equity primarily results in decline in private returns or an increase in government interest payments in the simulation the effect on the return to equities themselves is relatively small with that elasticity set at 25 interest costs rise by 43 of the gain in the return to the trust fund while the remaining 57 appears in decline in private returns mostly thr ough decline in private interest rates with an elasticity of 101 interest costs rise by more than the gain in trust fund earnings and private returns rise this model is not definitive but rather illustrative it suggests that potentially significant amount of the gain in earnings would be offs et by an increased burden on taxpayers through higher interest rates the results are the same whether assets are accumulated centrally by the government or in individual accounts although in the latter case the investment returns would flow to account owners while the debt pa yments would be borne by the

benefit format towards system of definedcontribution individual accounts were these accounts to completely replace the current system then the paygo system would be replaced by fully funded system other advocates have argued that individual accounts should augment rather than replace the current system one of the key differences among competing individual accounts proposals concerns whether they would be added on to or carved out of the current social security systems tax and benefit structure but pursuing either of these approaches alone would not reduce the systems unfunded liabilities addon accounts that use additional revenues in the form of higher taxes general revenues or voluntary contributions to finance individual accounts but leave the current benefit structure of the system intact would not alter the systems future financing imbalance likewise proposals for carveout accounts that divert revenues from the payroll tax into individual accounts and then lower benefits paid by the system to offset the diverted revenues only reduce the systems unfunded liabilities to the limited extent that the benefit offset is greater than the diverted revenues as explained below the unfunded liabilities can only be significantly reduced by raising adding on taxes while holding benefits constant or cutting carving out benefits while holding taxes constant 40 the objective of the following discussion of individual accounts is to analyze the claimed merits of individual accounts as well as explaining some of their disadvantages for analytical clarity consider the economic effects of hypothetical proposal to move completely from the current paygo system to fully funded system of pure individual accounts the reports conclusions apply to specific proposals only where explicitly noted once the costs and benefits of pure system have been identified one can evaluate whether specific costs and benefits of mixed system are attributable to its individual accounts or its governmentprovided paygo portion mixed system could address some of the market failures and social goals that pure system of individual accounts could not but would also reduce the benefits stemming from individual accounts first we begin by discussing clai m commonly made for individual accounts that rates of return are larger than the return in the so cial security system and that these higher returns can help achieve solvency g20g138g157g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g157g158g155g151g561g5g152g150g153g138g155g146g156g152g151g156g561 there is doubt that expected returns are higher on private assets than benefits under the current system yields for current workers are expected to be small or even negative because of the fall in the workerretiree ratio upon the retirement of the baby boomers but even setting this demographic problem aside and considering sustainable steady state if the economy is growing at real rate of 2 per year dollar paid into paygo system over say 25year period would permit benefit payment of 164 dollar invested in an individual account that yielded an 40 from an economic perspective carveout accounts would be unlikely to significantly affect public or private saving addon accounts however could lead to some increase in national saving and hence economic growth but only if they did not supplant private saving this would be the case for individuals who undersave for individuals who planned their saving through optimization and were not liquidity constrained addon accounts would strictly s upplant private saving unless they were subsidized in which case they would instead reduce public saving

685 such is the power of compound interest there are several important problems with this argument the one noted in the previous simulation holds for individual accounts as well without an increase in the capital stock there can be net gain to society gains in individual accounts will be offset by losses to other investors and to the rest of the government budget by our calculations it is certainly possible for half or more of the apparent gain from investing in equities to appear as an added interest cost in the general budget while an individual account may appear to outperform social security society as whole including individual account holders cannot escape the unfunded liabilities of the current system there are other reasons that social security cannot earn market rate of return first over one third of contributions finance benefits for the disabled survivors and dependents contributions also redistribute income to lower income recipients second individual accounts are likely to have higher administrative costs than social security finally the risky returns offered by individual accounts cannot be meaningfully compared to the safer returns offered by social security since people willingly accept lower returns to avoid risks the economywide benefit to individual accounts would not come from the rate of the return that they earned it would come from the stronger link between benefits and contributions that should reduce or eliminate the distortions arising from soci insurance such as effects on labor supply and savings these distortions may not be completely eliminated as long as there are mandatory components to the system and some individuals save more than they would otherwise prefer but in general they should reduce distortions in private decisions to work and save g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 furthermore reform plan based on individual assets will have to deal with the cost of paying off currently accrued obligations and making the transition to funded system this effect is far from trivial suppose all contributions were immediately shifted into individual accounts but the system was committed to make one who had already participated in the system worse off existing retirees would still have to receive benefits and working individuals would have to pay close to the existing 124 payroll tax as well as set aside their new contributions to finance those benefits these payroll tax dollars would earn return even of principal for their contributors what if mixed system were introduced that diverted some of the payroll tax say 2 into individual accounts and used the rest to pay current benefits would this allow the future funding crisis to be diverted without tax increases or benefit reductions to make this evaluation more concrete we analyze the budgetary effects of the proposals of the presidents commission to strengthen social security based on the official estimates of the social security administration ssa actuaries the estimates make it clear that introducing 2 individual accounts without introducing new stream of revenue to finance them would not prevent funding crisis 41

plans in option 1 workers under 55 could elect to deposit 2 of their oasdi taxable earnings in an individual account with an offsetting reduction in benefits based on diverted amounts compounded at real rate of return 35 it is the only option that relies solely on individual accounts in the second the amounts diverted were 4 up to 1000 per year of taxable earnings with benefits offset by compounding at real rate of return of 2 this plan also included benefit cut to slow the growth of benefits by indexing to prices rather than wages option 3 allowed the diversion of 25 of earnings not to exceed 1000 plus required additional 1 of taxable earnings for which refundable tax credit would be received the diverted amounts would reduce benefits compounded at real rate of return of 25 according to the trustees options 2 and 3 lead to significant longterm improvement but shortterm deterioration in the systems finances while option 1 does not 42 none of the reforms achieve solvency according to this reports definition however figure 3 illustrates the effect of introducing individual accounts on the income and costs of the social security system as percentage of taxable payroll43 the estimates are based on the introduction of individual accounts under the option 1 plan of the presidents commission on strengthening social security option 1 makes the effects of individual accounts clearest because it is the only option that does not include benefit cuts roughly 40 years after the introduction of individual accounts when enough retirees had spent their entire career making contributions the accounts would indeed allow larger reduction in social security benefits than the revenue lost from 2 marginal payroll tax cut 44 over time the savings to the government would get larger and larger and eventually become quite significant unfortunately for the first 40 years after the introduction of individual accounts the accounts would generate less revenue than was being diverted from beneficiaries 42 for the sake of brevity many of the details of the commissions proposals are omitted here for detailed description of the commission and its proposals see crs report rs21095 social security report of the presidents commission to strengthen social security by dawn nuschler 43 this graph does not illustrate the overall income and cost rates under system of individual accounts but rather the change in income and cost rates caused by the introduction of individual accounts thus the future financing crisis is not averted if the proposals generate additional revenues it is only averted if the proposals generate enough additional revenues to cover the entire financing gap 44 this graph does not illustrate the reve nue generated to the individuals who own the individual accounts it illustrates the reduction in benefits that the government is obligated to pay because social security benefits are offset by an amount equal to the diverted payroll tax compounded at 35 real rate per year httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31498g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g497g561g7g140g152g151g152

introduced in 20 04 thus individual accounts would exacerbate the financing problems of the social security system for roughly 40 years but improve the systems finances from that point on whether this is desirable can only be determined by judging their effect on the economy and government as whole and such accounts improve the governments overall finances and national saving only if the revenue shortfalls caused by them in the first 40 years of their existence are financed through tax increases or benefit reductions in this case the improvement in the governments finances could be calculated by compounding the rising line in figure 3 reduction in cost rate by contrast figure 4 illustrates the effects the accounts have on the unified budget balance if the accounts are debt financed ie introduced wi thout an accompanying source of financing as explained in the introduction the effect on the unified budget balance is the most meaningful measure because it is the only one that clearly identifies the cost of reform to the government as whole it may surprise some readers to see that individual accounts if debt financed still generate less revenue than the current system for the entire 75year projection window in other words debtfinanced individual accounts worsen social security s financing crisis for the next 75 years

although the assets in individual accounts are growing through the accumulation of interest the debt issued by the government to finance the accounts is also growing because of interest accumulation the individual accounts offset government benefits at higher rate of return than the interest payments on government debt so eventually outside the 75year window the individual accounts save the government money but because so much debt must be issued immediately it takes more than 75 years before the accounts pay for themselves in fact the actuaries of the ssa make two sets of assumptions both of which are illustrated in figure 4 since the accounts are voluntary they estimated the costs under the assumptions 1 that 667 of eligible individuals elect to participate and 2 that 100 elect to participate comparing the results under the two assumptions lead s to surprising result the best way to limit the costliness of debtfinanced individual accounts is to reduce the participation rate

option 1would not avert future financing crisis for that reason it also proposed two further options that coupled the introduction of individual accounts with benefit reductions these two options it asserted would make social security solvent in both cases the actuaries of the ssa believe that 667 participation rate is most likely and the figures below are based on this assumption the reforms do not make the system solvent however if solvency is defined as the avoidance of cash deficits throughout the 75year forecast window both proposals would greatly reduce the size of the deficits in the second half of the projection window however under option 2 the system would generate cash deficits from 2010 to 2059 under option 3 it would generate cash deficits from 2014 to 2072 in other words additional unidentified funding would need to be found to pay benefits promised under reform and this funding would ultimately come from further tax increases or reductions in benefits or other government spending however these options do achieve solvency if solvency is defined as achieving cash surplus at the end of the forecast window this means thatunlike reform proposals that achieve 75year trust fund balancethey do not result in renewed crisis in 76 years by examining figures 5 and 6 which illustrate the effect these options would have on the unified budget balance it can been seen that if the individual accounts are debt financed only the benefit reductions are responsible for the improvement in the systems finances 45 indeed much larger improvement in the systems finances is possible if the individual accounts were excluded from option 2 and 3 and only benefit reductions were made assuming the proceeds were saved in other words the systems finances could be improved to the same degree with smaller benefit reductions than recommended in option 2 and 3 if individual accounts were not implemented source chief act uaries of social security administration memorandum to

individual accounts on the governments finances this may seem at odds with many other evaluations of individual accounts which center on whether there are gains to the worker but the effect on the governments finances is quite separate from the effect on the worker government finances are affected because the benefits the government must pay are reduced by the presence of individual accounts eg in option 1 benefits are reduced by the amount of tax redirected to the account compounded at real rate of 35 the potential gain to the individual comes from the fact that the accounts are expected to be worth more than the amount the individual has lost in reduced benefits eg under the assumptions of the ssa actuaries the accounts would earn real rate of return of 46 whereas benefits would be reduced by 35 in option 1 46 debt financed accounts would only result in an eventual cashflow improvement in government finances if the compounding factor used in the benefit offset is greater than the interest rate on government debt this is not the case in option 2 or option 3 which call for offsets with real interest compounding factors of 20 and 25 respectively compared with 3 rate of return on us treasuries the reason this report focuses on the effect on government finances is that the systems crisis centers on the fact that the government does not have enough money to pay promised benefits in preventing that crisis estimating the gain to individuals is largely irrelevant individual accounts could earn rates of return of 100 year but if they did not offset governmentprovided benefits then the funding shortfall would be the same and the same unidentified financial sacrifice would need to be made in the form of higher taxes or lower benefits furthermore even if reform proposal reduced the systems unfunded liabilities if it did not eliminate them then further unspecified sacrifices would have to be made at some point since those unspecified sacrifices would need to come from the same workers possessing the individual accounts calculating the rate of return on the accounts gives only partial picture of the proposals overall effect on the individual

paid out to retired workers the other 38 is paid to disabled workers 13 survivors 19 and dependents 6 these payments for social functions directly lower the rate of return available to healthy single retired workers one therefore should make sure that in comparisons these social functions are being included in any comparisons of the return on social security and individual accounts for example if one contracted to invest and purchase an old age annuity one would not be covered for disability or insurance payments for early death the purchase of such insurance would use some of the investment that could grow in the annuity in addition the rate of return available to wealthier retirees is lowered further because of the systems progressive benefit formula the degree of this redistribution is not certain because of offsetting factors higher income individuals tend to have larger ratios of retirement years to working years largely because they live longer they also tend to enter the workforce later because of more extensive schooling moreover the distributional effect depends on whether one examines families or individuals higher income men who marry wives who do not work outside 46 note that the ssa estimates do not take into account the ne gative effects on rates of return that portfolio shifts may cause as suggested in the numerical simulation above thus individual accounts may have lower return than the ssa estimates suggest for any given portfolio

that are proportional to their own benefit levels and if one includes these benefits high income families have higher return another regressive feature of the current social security system is the tax treatment of benefits and payroll contributions if social security is t hought of as retirement plan contributions are like other retirement plans subsidized through the tax system compared to other investments there is subsidy because contributions made by employers are not subject to individual income tax at the time of contribution and because earnings benefits in excess of contributions are taxed only when received and then taxed only partially social security benefits are taxed differently from pensions however fraction of social security benefits is taxed when income exceeds certain levels with individuals with relatively high incomes paying tax on 85 of benefits low income individuals paying tax and some individuals falling in between currently about twothirds of all individuals do not pay tax but the number covered will grow absent legislative change because the exclusions and phaseouts are not indexed pensions are taxed in way that explicitly permits previously taxed benefits to be excluded and many pension systems allow full exclusion of contributions from the income tax base even though there are aggregate assets in paygo transfer system there is return from the perspective of the individual since benefits typically exceed contributions 47 these tax benefits favor higher income individuals and the subsidy per dollar of payroll tax is more pronounced other things equal the higher the individual tax rate the longer the holding period and the higher the rate of return benefits are positive at any reasonable rate of return and are also larger in absolute value for higher income individuals because they have larger contributions table 2 shows the ratio of endofperiod value from an investment receiving social securitys tax treatment compared to an investment subject to normal tax for variety of returns including holding periods depending on whether benefits are taxed the current system offsets these effects through both direct redistribution and exclusions from benefit taxation the latter of which favors middle income individuals but not the poor whose ratio is one ie who would pay income tax in any case because of the income tax systems

social security systems tax treatment were applied to those accounts the relative subsidy to higher income individuals would increase in the posttransition period as rates of return rise and the benefit exclusions are eroded through inflation this tax subsidy differs from that of iras which have fixed dollar rather than percentageofwage limits constraining the benefit for high income individuals the treatment is more like that provided for private pensions one could offset that effect by withdrawing favorable tax treatment taxing employer contributions and taxing account earnings as accrue d or by introducing offsetting subsidies such as higher contribution levels or government matching contributions for low income individuals when all of these factors are taken into account the magnitude of the distributional effects of the current system are not entirely clear 48 nevertheless these observations suggest that individual accounts would place lower income individuals at disadvantage compared to the current system because they would lose the explicit redistribution in the current system it is also possible that they would place low income individuals at further disadvantage if their tax treatment were similar to the current system unless the accounts were subsidized by earnings at the same time because the poor do not live as long individual accounts would maintain one of the redistributional disadvantages of the current system if beneficiaries were forced to annuitize for the reasons discussed below some proponents of the current system base their opposition to individual accounts on the fact that these social functions could not be incorporated into individual accountsownership of assets is incompatible with horizontal and vertical redistribution while that is true these social functions could be carried out through new government programs that were financed through general revenues 49 what should be realized is that comparison between the rate of return 48 see karen smith eric toder and howard iams lifetime distributional effects of social security retirement benefits presented at the third annual joint conference for the retirement research consortium making hard choices about retirement may 1718 2001 washington dc who find that the current system favors the lowest income group and projects redistribution to increase in the future under current policy however their paper does not consider the distributional effects of tax treatment 49 survivor and disability benefits could be partially incorporated in system of individual accounts through bequests and annuities maintaining the level of benefits available under the current system would require government subsidization however for example personal accounts could not replace current survivor benefits when death comes before retirement age

administrative costs that nearly all analysts agree would be higher than under the current system administering the system would be significantly more complex than the current systemindividual account

consider in terms of the fees charged by the systems administrator or funds appropriated if the system were administered by the government and the implicit cost to employers and employees in terms of more complicated paperwork and higher compliance costs the more choice that was allowed in the system the higher the administrative costs would be the administrative costs of the current system

that individuals should be able to choose how to deal with their own contributions whether to participate what to invest in and whether to annuitize or withdraw their assets as they desire on the other hand if the purpose of social security is to correct for the adverse selection moral hazard and nonoptimization then these restrictions on choice are fundamental to the system they include not only mandatory participation but also mandatory annuitization restrictions on account withdrawals and restrictions to ensure th at investments are prudent the problem is not only the lack of actuarially fair annuities but also the possibility of free riders who do not save and rely on welfare to support them in old age in sense choice is in fundamental conflict with the basic economic reason for social insurance partial restrictions such as requiring individuals to save but not annuitize would also run afoul of both adverse selection and moral hazard issues adverse selection would lead to smaller annuities for those who take them and still allow individua ls to spend down their assets and then rely on welfare as simple example in an economy wher half of the individuals live five years and half live 20 years after retirement assume all individuals know their own life span an average monthly actuarially fair mandatory annuity w ould pay 970 per 100000 of assets if annuities were made voluntary the individuals with fivey ear life spans would not purchase an annuity and the annuity would fall to 454 per 100000 of assets but the need for mandatory annuities to avoid moral hazard and adverse selection also means that it would be impossible to rely completely on individual accounts without higher income individuals and women enjoying higher rates of return on average than lower income individuals and men since the latter have shorter life spans

role as dependable safe portion of an individuals retirement portfolio or for others the only significant source of retirement income some individual account advocates have suggested that the government should guarantee minimum benefit to retirees in case their accounts suffer investment losses it can be argued that such provisions in effect would defeat the purpose of individual accounts which is to allow individuals to shoulder more risk if they desire and offer them more control over their retirement saving furthermore many proponents of individual accounts state that individual accounts could help fund the systems unfunded liabilities by achieving higher rates of return the introduction of minimum benefit guarantee would make stand alone rateofreturn comparisons misleading because these guarantees pass on the benefits of higher returns to the retiree while leaving the government with the same liabilities to retirees as the current system in fact the guarantees would increase the potential liabilities of the current system because of moral hazard if individuals received all of the benefits of holding high riskreturn assets but assumed few of the risks because they were guaranteed minimum benefit then they will shift their portfolio towards riskier assets than they would otherwise desire this choice increases the expected value of liabilities to the government since the presence of moral hazard makes it more likely that the government will have to pay minimum guarantees the moral hazard problem can be reducedbut not eliminatedby placing restrictions on investment decisions eg limiting equities to say 60 of the portfolio for portion of the portfolio although this approach would run cont rary to the goal of promoting investment freedom and the restrictions by forcing investor s to hold lower riskreturn assets would reduce

advantage over the current system less favorable individual accounts that entirely eliminate risk without creating moral hazard would have to be invested in much lower yielding assets than proponents typically use in rate of return comparisons even without an explicit minimum guarantee the government might feel compelled to use other government programs such as supplemental security income medicaid or the food stamp program to aid retirees whose life savings were lost thus the moral hazard problem may not be avoidable even in the absence of an explicit guarantee because individuals may act in the belief that losses they suffer would be implicitly guaranteed for political reasons if avoiding moral hazard is the motivation for individual accounts however why not maintain social security as paygo system of smaller size that covers only minimum benefit and leave individuals free to make other investments if and when they choose and while higher spending on other programs is not cost to the retirement program it is still cost to the government that lowers the funding advantage of individual accounts

investments retirees would face another risk with individual accounts that they do not face with the current social security system the risk that they will outlive their assets known as longevity risk because ones time of death is uncertain there is the risk that retirees will draw down their assets too quickly and be left impoverished in their last days this risk can be avoided through annuitization that is through the exchange with financial intermediary of ones assets for promised stream of income unfortunately annuities can currently be purchased in private markets only on terms unfavorable to retireeson average the expected value of the annuity benefit can be 1525 lower than life expectancy would suggest 51 since annuities would presumably be more desirable in the absence of the current social security system the purchase cost might go down as the market grew particularly if it reduced adverse selection the only way to eliminate adverse selection completely however would be for the government to make annuitization mandatory this would not prevent companies from attempting to cherry pick unhealthy retirees from each other howevereither government provision or re gulation would be needed to prevent it the problem of moral hazard also argues for making annuitization mandatory here again the government would need to weigh the benefits of allowing individuals greater freedom of decisionmaking eg the ability to spend large amount of wealth suddenly in response to personal calamity against the social desire to prevent people from becoming destitute because they ran down their assets too quickly even if it were in persons best interest to buy an annuity he or she may not do so if given the choice and again if annuitization were not made mandatory the government might feel obliged to use other government resources to prevent individuals who had run down their assets from becoming destitute yet mandatory annuitization introduces an element of risk that is not present in the current system the problem of market fluctuations close to retirement undermining the value of an individual account if the market were to fall dramatically before retirement mandatory annuitizationparticularly of accounts invested in equitieswould lock in that low market value whereas individuals might feel that they could regain some of that lost income as the

is whether individuals should be able to bequeath the balance of their account to their heirs upon death doing so would raise some problems since closing the current systems unfunded liabilities is one of the major justifications proponents raise for switching to system of individual accounts it is important to note that bequests would increase the unfunded liabilities of the system that is because they would represent new set of benefits that do not exist under the current system the current system does pay survivor benefits to spouses and dependents and to the extent that bequests partially replaced those benefits they would not represent new liability but the ability to transfer benefits to broader circle of heirs upon deathparticularly in the case of premature deathis not possible under th current system and would represent new liability in pure system of individual accounts allowing bequests would reduce annuities for example returning to our case where half of the individuals live for five years and half live for 20 years after retirement guaranteeing minimum 10year stream of payments with the heir to receive the payments in the case of premature death would reduce the monthly annuity from 970 to 807 per 100000 of assets however giving individuals choice between larger annuity with bequest and smaller annuity with bequest would reintroduce the adverse selection problem because healthy individuals would likely choose the former and sick individuals would choose the latter this feature would lead to smaller annuities for the healthy than in the absence of choice

individual accounts differ from an aggregated system in the allocation of risk there are different types of risk that face individuals in planning for retirement some are unavoidable in any system while some can be mitigated or worsened by collective provision before examining specific types of risks it is useful to ask how risk affects individuals preparation for retirement both privately and through social security what is the role of risk in social insurance generally in investment markets higher rates of return can be enjoyed only by taking on greater risk the fact that an aggregate social insurance system offers relatively low return is not necessarily an undesirable feature of the system nor in funded aggregate system would portfolio invested in low returnlow risk securities such as government securities necessarily be undesirable for most individuals willing to set aside adequate investments for retirement social security is only one portion of their investment portfolio and most individuals would like to have some part of their retirement kept relatively safe they are free to invest their private assets in more risky ventures other individuals who fail to optimize do not set aside adequate retirement savings for whatever reason because they are relying primarily on social security in their old age strong case can be made that it should remain riskfree 52 52 note

affect these two types of individuals for those individuals who save adequately is the current system keeping too much of their retirement income safe and earning low returns or if given the choice in an individual account would they place an equal proportion of their overall portfolio in riskless assets if that were the case then the rate of return on their individual account would be higher than their overall portfolio is at the present after accounting for transition costs for those individuals who do not save for retirement outside of social security should society allow them to expose their individual accounts to greater risk and return knowing that if they are unlucky they will have other private source of income to fall back on and that it will fall to government transfer programs financed by all taxpayers to provide some minimum level of subsistence investment risk move away from the current paygo system towards individual accounts or trust fund investments in private assets introduces new type of risk into social security the risk of investment market volatility the two approaches could theoretically distribute market risk very differently however some market risks can be reduced relatively easily for example through portfolio diversification although it is not clear that all individuals reduce these risks optimally in reality there are other market risks that are more difficult to pool however such as risk across time as explained above dollar invested in private assets by the social security system would have the same rate of return as dollar invested in the same asset through an individual account obviously the same amount of risk is associated with that investment in either case as well losses associated with trust fund investments would ultimately result in lower benefits or higher taxes but there is significant difference in who bears the risk and enjoys the profit associated with any given investment betwee n the two systems in system of individual accounts the entire risk is placed on the individual who chose to make that investment in system with collectively invested trust fund and benefits only indirectly tied to the systems income those risks can be spread both among the members of generation because the system has defined benefits rather than defined contributions and between generations if the system is allowed to build up and draw down its assets over time is the difference in riskbearing between the two systems significant table 2 demonstrates that if the stock market performs in the future as it has in the past the historical difference in outcomes would have been extremely large 53 historically the stock market has frequently gone through long phases of doing extremely well eg the 1990s or extremely poorly eg the 1970s and this would be fully reflected in the value of accounts accrued during those times the first column of the table demonstrates that if system of individual accounts had been in place between 1927 and 2001 the value of the account invested entirely in the standard and poors composite stock index would have varied from 228 for retiree in 1974 to 978 for retiree in 1999

already present in the current system is demographic risk which cannot be avoided since mortality will always be unknown in social security or individual accounts with annuitization demographic risk comes from dying before one has received the value of ones contributi ons in individual accounts without annuitization the demographic risk comes from outliving ones assets demographic risk could be avoided through annuitization with bequests but would result in smaller annuity payments demographic risk that is part of the cause for the current insolvency of the system is the increase in life spans that is not anticipated in advance and will leave individuals with smaller retirement accumulations and potentially smaller retirement incomes just as an individual facing such an increase must either save more or accept smaller retirement income or delay retirement social insurance system must increase taxes or reduce benefits thus potential variability in taxes or benefits which is sometimes characterized as part of the political risk is not risk that can be avoided with an individual account system and the large increase in taxes or decrease in benefits needed to restore the curren t system to solvency is still present in any shift to individual accounts pure system of individual accounts would still have to alter contribution continued column it is assumed that the

type of risk changes in fertility would not affect private accounts or fullyfunded social insurance system but such changes might still affect private retirement incomes by altering the availability of private intergenerational transfers thus these risks would not be avoided but rather would be addressed in different ways political risk final type of risk that many argue would be diminished by individual accounts is political risk because there is ownership of benefits in the current system retirees and workers planning for retirement are always at the mercy of legislative change individual accounts would remove assets income and benefit flows from the government budget and create individual ownership of retirement benefits th at would be less subject to manipulation through legislative changes as result it might be more difficult to use surpluses in the retirement system to finance other government spending it is important however to distinguish this political risk from actual risks such as demographic or investment risks discussed above only political risk which involves shifting benefits and costs among individuals is zerosum for society as whole political uncertainty is particularly compelling issue when one considers that the current system is unsustainable because of anticipated life span and fertility changes at some point either workers will see taxes raised or retirees will see benefits reduced from their current level since much of the political risk revolves around future uncertainty the transition to fully funded pure individual account system would also have the be nefit of forcing the question of who will bear the costs of reforming the system to be answered immediately in other words pure system of individual accounts would bring the future funding crisis forward to the present by making implicit liabilities explicit then individuals would longer be left uncertain of how they will be affected by reform in the future arising from in formation already available today this argument does not apply to most current proposals however because the proposals do not call for pure individual account systems they call for mixed systems and many of these mixed systems do not increase the systems prefunding thus proposals that do not address the issue of the systems current unfunded liabilities do not really reduce political risk even if they have created individual ownership because they make further undefined reform in the future necessary the risk of credit distortion is another potential political risk present if centralized trust fund were to make private investments but avoidable in system of individual accounts if markets allocate capital among different types of investments efficiently on their own then from an economic perspective any move towards investment by the government retirement system should preserve that market allocation or it would wer economic efficiency system of individual accounts would largely preserve the market allocation of capital because private individuals would continue to choose where they wished to invest their money by contrast if the government were to make private investments ce ntrally through the trust fund there would be the possibility that investments would be made on the basis of political criteria rather than the profit motive this potential risk seems relatively easy to avoid however by stipulating that the trust fund be invested on the basis of passive index similarly to some mutual funds and the tsp of course political risks are present in any sort of government intervention into the provision of fullyfunded retirement system for example ideally the government may be able to offer individual account holders actuarially fair annuities on more favorable terms than the private sector but were the government to do so there so would be the possibility that it would offer actuarially unfair annuities instead for political reasons eg making annuities overly generous to win political support among the elderly such an outcome could create new unfunded liabilities

in theory the government could equitably spread the risks of centrallyfunde d trust fund over time but it could also distort riskspreading formulas in ways favorable to current generations which store up problems for future generations g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the analysis in this report points to two major conclusions first it reemphasizes the old saying there is free lunch someone has to pay to address social securitys funding imbalance and while the burden can be distributed differentially across individuals and across generations it cannot disappear inaction continues uncertainty as to who will pay and when tax increases and benefit cuts provide at least general picture of who might bear the burden some approaches such as investing the trust fund or individual account savings in higher yielding assets other than government bonds have the appearance of being costless but the benefits to be gained from these higher yields appear as costs in other parts of the economy higher interest rates on government debt or lower returns on private investment which may include direct reductions in the returns to private securities in the accounts or trust fund and changes in risk analyses of such approaches need to account for any declines in private returns to capital and also address what taxes are to be increased or government services to be cut to pay for the increased government borrowing cost none of the current proposals being discussed has provided such detail of course one way to avoid an increase in interest costs would be to increase national saving but again such saving would mostly likely only be accomplished by some forced government saving plan and the policies to accomplish it would need to be spelled out to clarify who pays trying to judge the merits of alternative approaches based on which approach poses smaller burden is not really meaningful all plans face the same problem that income does not cover cost the only difference between plans is who bears the burden rather they may be framed in terms of losses and gains in economic efficiency if one rules out options that spread the costs to other parts of the economy the choice between higher taxes and lower benefits primarily depends on the optimal size of the social security system the smaller the system the less it is able to alleviate the market failures it was designed to curemoral hazard adverse selection incomplete insurance markets and failure of optimization the larger the system the more it distorts labor and saving decisions the form of tax increases or benefit cuts can also have implications for economic behavior and distribution besides economic efficiency the decision depends on social goals and distributional effects that may affect social welfare funding the system can occur under either cent ralized system or individual accounts since it is national saving not saving in the accounts that matters the principal distinction between maintaining an aggregated system such as we have currently versus set of individual accounts involves efficiency gains and not differential rates of return many of the potential criticisms of individual accounts are mirror images of the rationales for social insurance if individual accounts are to fulfill the objectives of social insurance then they must be very much like an aggregate system in that they must involve mandatory contributions mandatory annuitization and requirements for prudent investment but such re quirements are in direct contradiction with the notions of choice and of the complete elimination of distortions induced by taxes indeed choice is itself in conflict with the rationale for social insurance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31498g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g497g561g7g140g152g151g152 g150g146g140g561g11g156g156g158g142 g156g561 g561

minimum requirements for the objectives of social insurance that contributions and annuitization are to be mandatory and investment choice restricted there are still two limits to individual accounts first they could not by themselves fulfill the current systems social objectives which include redistribution and the provision of benefits to survivors dependents and the disabled they could reverse the distributional objective of the current system shifting income from the poor to the rich on average because of the latters longer expected life span and potentially through the tax treatment of the accounts this effect could be addressed by subsidizing the poor and taxing the rich eg government matching rates for low income indivi duals but that revision would move away from pure individual account system and its economic benefits second they would introduce elements of risk including risk across cohorts reflecting variations in returns and in stock market valuations if the goal of reform were to move towards greater prefunding an aggregate system could be more successful at spreading risk among and across generations nevertheless it is important to also understand the advantages of individual accounts individual accounts do maintain connection between marginal contribution and marginal benefit that can reduce distortions in private work and saving behavior although the mandatory nature of the contributions may undermine this gain to some extent individual accounts also eliminate political risk at least within the program itself which makes the retirement plan itself less risky in some ways finally individual accounts may impose more budgetary discipline by explicitly removing any social security surplus from government control so that in reality they may be more likely to lead to an increase in national savings than would be the case of the aggregate trust fund but for this to occur individual accounts must be financed through tax increases or benefit cuts many proposals actually include mixture of individual accounts and some smaller version of the current system such mixed system might be used to address some of the problems with pure individual accounts discussed above such as their tendency to redistribute from the poor to the rich and the problem of moral hazard such shift dilutes both the costs and benefits of individual accounts in particular it reduces the return to investment and it leaves significant portion of the system as paygo system but it is the interaction between paygo financing and demographic change that is responsible for the current systems impending insolvency there is fundamental tension between the objectives of social insurance to deal with adverse selection and failure of optimization as well as moral hazard and risk spreading and the merits of individual accounts choice and reduction of other behavioral distortions any mixed system is giving up some of the benefits of the first to attain the benefits of the second evaluating plan necessarily involves assessing those costs and benefits it is important to keep this tradeoff in mind for example proponents of mixed plan may argue that their plan does not suffer from moral hazard or undesirable redistribution nevertheless correcting these elements must reduce the rate of return for most individuals constrain the degree of choice and limit reduction in economic distortions that are the rationale for considering individual accounts in the first place thus mixe d plans do not address these problems without cost
