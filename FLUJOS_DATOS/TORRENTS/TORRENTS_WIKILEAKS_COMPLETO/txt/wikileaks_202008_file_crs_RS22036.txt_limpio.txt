institutions to disclose to customers their funds availability policies federal reserve regulation cc implements the funds availability provisions and includes schedule with maximum time limits for withholding funds the 2003 enactment of pl 108100 the check 21 act2 refocused attention on the checkhold policies of financial institutions this act made it easier for financial institutions to

stat563 2 117 stat1177 crs2 background the intent of the expedited funds availability act efaa of 1987 was twofold first to ensure that account holders have timely access to deposited funds and second that depository financial institutions provide to their customers clear disclosure about check hold policies the practice of placing holds on accounts was developed to protect an institution in the event deposited check was returned unpaid provisions of the 1987 act addressed the need for improvements in the check collection and return system to counter the effect of reduced hold periods the potential costs to account holders from lengthy hold periods and insufficient disclosure of hold policies provided the impetus for this legislation during hold period customers are unable to make withdrawals by check or other means against those deposited funds on which the hold was placed if financial institution receives check written against an account before the hold is lifted and the account has insufficient funds because of the hold it can choose to cover the check and charge the customer an overdraft fee alternatively the institution can return the check without paying it and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22036 charge the account holder bounced check or nonsufficient funds fee the third party check recipient may charge the account holder an additional returned check fee as it is possible for more than one check to be presented during the hold period the fees can accumulate quickly the federal reserves regulation cc implements the efaa3 regulation cc applies to all transaction accounts as defined by federal reserve regulation d and it extends to both consumer and businessheld deposit accounts the regulation does not require check holds the check hold policies of depository financial institutions can vary within the restraints of maximum time frames that are outlined in schedule the regulation also provides for longer hold periods under exception situations regulation cc contains rules for disclosure of funds availability policies and to expedite the return of unpaid checks by institutions the schedule is measured in business days following the banking day of deposit and all references are to the maximum number of days that financial institution can hold check deposit the first 100 of any check deposit must be made available the first business day following the day of deposit several types of check deposits are subject to nextday availability which means that funds must be available the first business day following the banking day of deposit in this category are us treasury checks and the following checks when deposited in person cashiers certified or tellers checks us postal service money orders federal reserve bank or federal home loan bank checks state or local government checks and checks drawn on another account held by that institution onus checks the time period is extended when deposits are made at an atm automated teller machine if the atm is owned by the account holders financial institution the funds must be available by the second business day deposits made at atms owned by other institutions must be available by the fifth business day 3 12 cfr 229 the full text is available at httpecfrgpoaccessgovcgittexttext idxcecfrsid635f26c4af3e2fe4327fd25ef4cb5638tplecfrbrowsetitle1212cfr229_ main_02tpl and by way of httpwwwfederalreservegovbankinforegrelistinghtmcc crs3 in general if check is not subject to next day availability the clearing schedule except for the first 100 depends on whether the check is local or nonlocal if the account holders institution is in the same check processing region as the paying institution4 the check is local funds deposited by local checks must be made available for withdrawal by the second business day and alternatively funds from nonlocal checks must be made available by the fifth business day regulation cc also permits financial institutions to impose exception holds for certain types of deposits or accounts included in the exception category are large deposits greater than 5000 redeposited checks deposits to accounts repeatedly overdrawn when the institution has reasonable cause to doubt the collectibility of the check emergency conditions and new accounts open less than 30 days in general the extended period of time for onus checks is one additional business day for total of two days for local checks five additional business days for total of seven days and for nonlocal checks six additional business days for total of eleven days however the financial institution shall make 400 of the deposited funds available by 500 pm on the business day on which the funds would have cleared if the exception had not been imposed the 400 is in addition to the first 100 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22036 regulation cc requires financial institutions to provide customers with written disclosure of their funds availability policies prior to opening transaction account if the availability terms on an existing account are changed the account holder must be provided with new disclosure 30 days in advance unless the change expedites the availability of funds in which case notice may be given later than 30 days after implementation in addition notices must be posted in each location where employees accept deposits and at all atms the customer must be notified when an exception hold is placed on deposit model disclosure statements are provided the regulation contains provisions to speed up the checkreturn process in an effort to ensure that institutions are advised when check is being returned before the deposited funds are made available options and methods are addressed in subpart c of regulation cc in general institutions are encouraged to use the most efficient path to route the return and to provide for the automated processing of returned checks finally the board of governors of the federal reserve is directed by section 603 d 1 of the efaa to make reductions in the hold time periods established in regulation cc as warranted by improvements in the check clearing system issues raised by check 21 the check clearing for the 21st century act pl 108100commonly referred to as check 21 was enacted on october 28 2003 to foster innovation in the payments system and enhance its efficiency by facilitating the use of electronic check processing5 4 party responsible for making the payment of the amount written on check 5 for more information see crs report rl32668 electronic banking the implementation of the check 21 act by walter w eubanks and crs report rs22525 electronic banking the postcheck 21 payments system by walter w eubanks crs4 the implementation of the act has raised concerns with the current checkhold time periods permitted by regulation cc and whether they should be adjusted overview of check 21 act check 21 deals with the check collection process and its purpose is to enable financial institutions to handle more checks electronically the law does not require institutions to adapt new collection procedures or generate digital check images but it does require institutions to accept new negotiable instrument paper substitute check created from the electronic information captured from the original paper check it was anticipated that the check 21 act would not result in an immediate transformation but in gradual evolution away from paperbased payments system therefore the benefits from electronic check processing might not be immediately realized pl 108100 the check 21act required the federal reserve to conduct study of the percentage of total checks cleared in which the paper check is not returned to the paying bank httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22036 the extent to which banks make funds available to consumers for local and nonlocal checks prior to the expiration of maximum hold periods the length of time within which depository banks learn of the nonpayment of local and nonlocal checks the increase or decrease in checkrelated losses over the study period and the appropriateness of the time periods and amount limits applicable under sections 603 and 604 of the expedited funds availability act as in effect on the date of enactment of the act6 the act also required the board to report the results of the study together with recommendations for legislative action the board submitted the required report to congress in april 2007 see discussion below check processing issues consumer advocates have raised several issues with check 21 major concern has been that although the electronic check processing facilitated by this act would greatly reduce the time it takes to deduct money from customers account the act would not improve the account holders access to the deposited funds therefore they have argued the benefits from the increased use of electronic processing would accrue mainly to banks legislation hr 799 to address this potential imbalance was introduced in the 109th congress on february 15 2005 hr 799 would have amended the expedited funds availability act to reduce the maximum time frames for hold policies other adjustments addressed in the legislation included raising the threshold for large check exceptions from 5000 to 7500 treating saturday as business day if accounts are debited on saturdays and requiring institutions to process credits before debits the bill was referred to the house committee on financial services but further action was taken 6 pl 108100 16 crs5 in april 20 2005 the house committee on financial services subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit of held an oversight hearing on the implementation of the check 21 act7 among the issues addressed was whether to revise funds availability schedules the federal reserve testified that material improvements from check 21 had not yet been realized the banking industry representatives testified that the transition to electronic check processing would be gradual and that the provisions of check 21 facilitate gradual and orderly change in addition check hold policies continued to provide protections against check fraud the consumer advocate testified that the check 21 act and advances in technology have facilitated more efficient check processing according to this testimony changes to the funds availability schedules should not have to wait until the vast majority of checks are processed electronically congress was urged to reduce check holds by amending the efaa if the federal reserves 2007 report did not recommend changes in hold times april 2007 federal reserve report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22036 in april 2007 and pursuant to pl 108100 the federal reserve submitted report to congress on the effects of the check 21 act on the nations check collection system8 in march 2006 the board of governors of the federal reserve system conducted survey of the banking system to assess whether there had been sufficient improvement in the check collection and return system to support changes to the funds availability schedules based on the survey findings and other research gathered by the board the board recommended making changes to the current funds availability policies at the time of the survey check 21 had been in effect for 17 months the march 2006 survey identified slowpaced adoption of check 21 by financial institutions the survey results indicated that approximately 93 of all checks paid involved paper check9 the federal reserves report did state that by january 2007 the nations banking industry had experienced significant increase in the use of electronics to collect and present checks for payment the report also concluded that check 21 was an important catalyst for potential change but much broader adoption of new technologies and processes must occur before check return times can decline appreciably the report also addressed the effect on check holds of the consolidation of the federal reserves checkprocessing sites the federal reserve had begun program of reducing the checkprocessing infrastructure in response to declining check volumes 7 us congress house committee on

combined into one larger region the result is change in the classification of number of deposited checks from nonlocal to local this reclassification reduces the maximum permissible hold periods for that volume of checks now deemed local the report stated that additional consolidations were expected finally the board would continue to monitor the check collection and return system and would use its existing authority consistent with efaa to accelerate funds availability schedules when the evidence warranted as mentioned above the board of governors of the federal reserve is directed by section 603 d 1 of the efaa to make reductions in the hold time periods established in regulation cc as warranted by improvements in the check clearing system hr 6871 the expedited funds availability
