6108c22 shspec43 ptps unknownnesses details on goals running normally pc is arc breaky because he is being audited over undetected ptps which he will notis in order to get auditing the auditor should suspect it for instance when auditing an executive it is problems alone which give you this terrific timelessness they show up as sticky meter an unchanging graph slow reaction time not moving around much in life problems stick and float forward in time and the guy is stuck in past moment another useful definition of problem is unknown problem is an accumulation of notknowingnesses and consideration of the person as to the value of the notknownnesses remember that the thetan is stuck to his bank valences etc by mystery mystery is the glue of life if you want freedom you must restore knowledge if you want slavery establish ignorance create notknows so common denominator of all problems is an unknown problem cannot exist in the absence of unknowingness as the dianetic axiom puts it randomity can be caused by missing datum axiom 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity axiom 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data mans difficulties were getting more and more involved because of the missing data technology about man based on the fundamental missing datum what is mans nature or what is man trying to do when the pc runs describe the problem he may well be giving lots of aspects of the basic unknown problem if you run unknownness on the subject of problems you cut through to this central problem rapidly thetan is mystery sandwich two way comm is an inquiry of the pc as to what is going on and an invitation for him to look at it it should be limited to such questions as how are you doing whats worrying you what is that all about processes arent two way comm process is involved in two way comm except 2wc if you start process be sure you flatten it this datum has never varied it applies to running unknownness of problems its ok to handle ptp by asking what unknown is connected with it this runs ptps fast use any version of the oddnumbered postulates notknow forget doubted pretended dont use 2wc to handle problems you dont have to be repetitive get all versions of notknow off of it more details on running of ptps routine 1a consists of everything you can think of in terms of problems processes it gives total ability to confront problems without being upset by the unknownness of them man doesnt like having to confront the unknowns of life its hard to do because there is nothing there to confront were back to processing loss when you process unknowns since loss is notknow so someone with lots of problems experiences sense of loss what is so maddening about loss is that you dont know what is happening with the thing lost the pc will misassign causes of loss too because some terminal is gone and there is lots of unknownness on it the guy will go to the bottom of the prehav scale and pretend some knowingness and pretend cause the two are closely associated it makes someone who is real inventor feel strange when he gets down to the inventors club and the others know all about it and invented it two years earlier someone in that state cant duplicate if they were asked what did you invent theyd answer with some irrelevance so thats good rebuttal pretended knowingness and pretended cause are blood brothers and continually come up together this is at the bottom of the notknow scale because it is substitute know the way you handle it is not direct you go at it by way of problems the guy has had so many problems he has begun to substitute false solutions those are the pretended knowingnesses you see on the case so you dont process the pretended knowingnesses you process the problems and the pc will fly you enter at the level of reality of what problem is and the false solutions and pretended cause fade out flattening routine 1a means getting the guy comfortable confronting unknowns then he wont be obsessively escaping from them and longer experiencing lot of anxiety about them cf alan watts the wisdom of insecurity jealousy is basically an inability to confront the unknown the sickness one experiences with it is not because of betrayal it is just another aspect of the unknown of faithfulunfaithful or something they know that i dont etc why does case suddenly dive into the middle of the bank and refuse to come out the guy is unable to not ask why theres an unknown in the incident the guy gets some glimmer of the unknown and he dives into it he cannot confront an unknown and becomes hectic at the idea that an unknown exists the oddity is that all knowingnesses are invented knowingnesses with sn inability to confront the unknown you eventually get an inability to confront the known then this goes down to an inability to confront at all so any little tiny incident of the day becomes problem he dwells on so dont judge by the apparent size of the problem whether he will be stuck on it if he cant confront the unknown at all he will be totally glued into all his unknowns all along the track you could run what unknown about an auditing session could you confront would you rather not confront you will solve anybodys difficulties with auditing you could run it on an old timer who doesnt much like auditing anymore or on someone who is having trouble learning to audit etc one old timer would get every pcs somatic because its mystery he instantly snaps terminals with these unknowns this process would blow him out it is very workable specific process it could be used for anyone who has left off doing some formerly successful activity or someone who is having trouble learning something eg language what is unknown about german would handle problems with the german language the treatment of condition is an attempt to alter valence without addressing the valence and this just doesnt work so some process addressed directly at the condition unless it aimed at solids like engrams wont do it address the valence find whose condition it is handle the terminal cf again xdn wants handled rundown long lists of goals wont be that useful but long lists of valences could be out of this you could get process for ptps of long duration ww would have condition what isnt known about that person what might you have done to him what might you have withheld from him you would strip off valences and get off problems and ow at the same time if you run lots of notknow youve got to remedy havingness because the whole bank is coming unglued
