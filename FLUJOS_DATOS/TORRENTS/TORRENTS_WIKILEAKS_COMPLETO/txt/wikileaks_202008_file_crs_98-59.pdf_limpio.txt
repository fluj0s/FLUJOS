food stamps background and funding updated november 7 2000 joe richardson domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859food stamps background and funding summary the food stamp program provides monthly benefits now averaging 73 person that increase lowincome recipients food purchasing power those eligible must have monthly income and liquid assets below federally prescribed limits or be receiving other public assistance and pass several nonfinancial eligibility tests eg work requirements bars against eligibility for many noncitizens benefits are based on the monthly cost of the agriculture departments thrifty food plan are adjusted annually for inflation and vary with household size amount and type of income eg earnings are treated more liberally and certain nonfood expenses eg high shelter costs dependent care expenses basic eligibility and benefit standards are federally set and the federal government pays for virtually all benefits and about half the total cost of administration and worktraining programs for recipients states shoulder the remaining expenses and have responsibility for daytoday operations and number of significant program rules the regular food stamp program operates in the 50 states the district of columbia guam and the virgin islands variants operate in puerto rico 13billionayear nutrition assistance grant aiding 11 million persons american samoa and the northern marianas food stamp benefits are the countrys largest source of food aid making up 57 of federal spending on food and nutrition efforts and one of the most extensive welfare initiatives just over 60 of those eligible participate and the program helps as many as 1 in 10 americans over the course of year the majority of recipients get other public aid slightly over half are children and some 20 are elderly or disabled about 35 of recipient households have monthly income below half the federal income poverty guidelines and onequarter have significant earnings participation in the program is responsive to federal and state welfare reform initiatives to changes in the economy eligibility standards and administrative practices and to needy households willingness to apply and their perception of their eligibility status enrollment has declined continuously and dramatically in recent years monthly average participation fell to 182 million people in fy1999 and recent figures july 2000 show 169 million persons in 73 million households for fy2000 estimated spending for the regular program was about 179 billion plus 13 billion for puerto rico the administrations fy2001 budget and the fy2001 agriculture department appropriations law pl 106387 provide support for spending as much as 187 billion on the regular program and 13 billion for puerto rico the fy2001 appropriations law also includes substantive changes to the food stamp act liberalizing benefits for those with high shelter costs and loosening eligibility standards for those owning cars the food stamp act originally enacted in 1964 was largely rewritten in 1977 recent major changes include those in the 1996 welfare reform law which made the most extensive revisions since 1977 the 1997 balanced budget act which directed new money to worktraining efforts for food stamp recipients and 1998 law pl 105185 which restored federally financed food stamps to many legal immigrants

funding the food stamp act became law in 1964 however the program did not become nationally available until early 1975 when puerto rico and the last few counties in the country entered in 1977 the 1964 act as amended was rewritten and replaced with the food stamp act of 1977 which greatly liberalized the program and increased participation amendments to the 1977 act during the early 1980s significantly restricted eligibility and benefits but beginning in the mid1980s and continuing through amendments in 1990 and 1993 program benefits were generally increased in 1996 the omnibus welfare reform law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104193 incorporated the most extensive changes in the program since the 1977 rewrite of the law substantial benefit and eligibility cutbacks were legislated lowering projected spending by an estimated 13 over 20 billion through fy2002 and states were given significantly greater role in the program this was followed by the 1997 balanced budget act pl 10533 which directed spending of 15 billion on worktraining efforts to ease the effects of new work rule put in place by the 1996 law more recently 1998 law pl 105185 reduced federal spending for food stamp administrative costs and restored food stamp benefits to some legal immigrants who were barred by the 1996 welfare reform measure the program description in this report reflects changes in food stamp law and changes in food stamp policies and regulations through mid2000 amendments to the food stamp act are under the jurisdiction of the house committee on agriculture and the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry appropriations under the act are authorized through fy2002 and funding normally is contained in each years agriculture department appropriations measure the program the food stamp act authorizes regular food stamp program for the 50 states the district of columbia guam and the virgin islands1 food stamp program rules are generally uniform with minor variations for alaska hawaii guam and the virgin islands however major revisions to the law in 1996 and 1997 significantly eased federal controls on how states can administer the program and granted states number of important options to vary from federal rules especially in the case of food stamp recipients who also are participants in their states other public assistance programs significant waivers from regular rules also may be granted so long as federal food stamp costs are not increased httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs2 2 income eligibility limits are 25 higher in alaska and 15 higher in hawaii 3 the looser income eligibility test allows elderlydisabled households with total cash monthly income above 130 of the poverty guidelines to participate if they have certain very high nonfood living expenses eg large shelter or medical costs for other households these types of expenses are not taken into account until benefits are calculated in effect program rules require that elderlydisabled households monthly income fall below the federal poverty guidelines not 130 of the guidelines but after income reductions that are applied in the benefit calculation see later discussion of benefitsthe food stamp program depends for the most part on federal funding federal appropriations pay for almost all benefits and roughly half the cost of administration and worktraining activities for recipients and states carry the remaining administrative and worktraining expenses and the cost of some benefits standards for the regular program are established by the act and regulations of the us department of agricultures food and nutrition service fns which also is responsible for overseeing food stores and other outlets that it approves for participation at the state and local level the program is administered by the offices that run other public assistance programs they are responsible for determining eligibility calculating and issuing benefits and operating or arranging for worktraining programs for recipients eligibility applicants for food stamps must have their eligibility determined and if eligible their benefits issued within 30 days of application or 7 days if they are very poor in most cases benefits are issued within 2 weeks of initial application however applicants can be refused benefits if they fail to cooperate with the welfare agency in obtaining the information necessary for determination the food stamp assistance unit is household typically those living together who also purchase and prepare food together but not all coresidents must apply together eg while spouses and parents and children must apply together unrelated persons not purchasing and preparing food in common may apply separately eligibility depends primarily on whether household has cash income and liquid assets below federal limits for most the income test confines eligibility to households with monthly total cash income at or below 130 of the federal income poverty guidelines adjusted for inflation and household size for fy2001 this is 1848 month for four persons 1533 for three persons 1219 for two persons and 905 for one person in the 48 contiguous states the district of columbia guam and the virgin islands2 the liquid asset limit is 2000 for the majority of applicants more liberal financial eligibility standards apply to the elderly and disabled slightly looser income test for both the elderly and disabled and allowance of liquid assets up to 3000 for the elderly3 however not all financial resources are taken into account eg exclusions include households home and personal belongings the first 4650 of the fair market blue book value of licensed vehicle work or business related assets noncash income and few types of cash income like federal energy assistance most student aid and earned income tax credit payments with some exceptions recipients of aid under states temporary assistance for needy families tanf grant programs supplemental security income ssi payments and most statelocal general assistance benefits automatically meet food stamp income and assethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs3 4 ssi recipients in california are not eligible for food stamps because their ssi payment is assumed to include food stamp component and welfare recipients living with nonwelfare recipients are not automati cally foodstampeligible under terms of regulatory policy change announced in mid1999 states may apply tanf rules governing the treatment of assets in determining food stamp eligibility to those food stamp applicants who also receive any type of tanf assistance eg those receiving tanf cash aid or services may be eligible for food stamps without regard to generally more rigorous food stamp eligibility rules governing the value of households vehicle 5 those disqualified by this work rule may requalify if they work or participate in work training program at least 80 hours in 30day period or join workfare program and they may qualify for up to an additional 3 months without working halftime or participating in worktraining or workfare if they lose the job or end worktraining participation major exceptions to the rule are allowed eg federal waivers from the rule may be granted for areas of very high unemployment or where there are insufficient jobs states may on their own exempt up to 15 of those coveredeligibility tests but their benefit must be calculated using food stamp rules eg their income may qualify them for benefit4 nonfinancial eligibility criteria include those related to work citizen and student status and institutional residence unless exempted most 1850yearold ablebodied adults without dependents are denied eligibility if during the prior 36 months they received food stamps for 3 months without 1 participating in workfare program or 2 working or engaging in worktraining program for at least 20 hours week5 in addition to this new rule added by the 1996 amendments to the law work requirements include directive that most unemployed ablebodied adult recipients not caring for very young children meet various workrelated conditions of eligibility such as searching or training for job or doing public service work if assigned by the state welfare agency and bar eligibility to those who voluntarily quit job or significantly reduce work effort eligibility also is denied to households with strikers to most postsecondary students eg those without children not working at least half time and to residents of institutions other than residents in substance abuse programs and shelters for the homeless and battered women and children in addition to the abovenoted federal eligibility standards states have the option to disqualify or make eligible certain categories of applicants states may disqualify individuals from food stamps for failing to perform an action required by another law related to meanstested benefits they also may bar food stamps to those who are in arrears in their child support payments or who fail to cooperate with child support agencies finally states may at their own expense provide food stamps to persons made ineligible by the work rule for 1850 year old adults without dependents and to noncitizens ineligible for federally financed food stamps see below eligibility rules governing noncitizens greatly restrict their participation under the 1996 welfare reform law most noncitizens were made ineligible for federally financed food stamp benefits illegally present aliens and nonimmigrant aliens were already ineligible only few categories of legal immigrants were left eligible those with long us work histories covered by social security veterans and active duty military personnel and their families and refugees and asylees for 5 years after entry effectiv in late 1998 pl 105185 restored eligibility to several significant newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs4 6 some 100000 legal immigrants are covered by these state initiatives the overwhelming majority are participating in californiacategories of legal immigrants noncitizen children who had entered as of august 22 1996 the enactment date of the 1996 welfare reform law so long as they are children the elderly who were here legally and age 65 as of august 22 1996 the disabled who were here as of august 22 1996 including persons who become disabled after that date refugees and asylees for 7 years after entry as opposed to 5 years under prior law and hmong refugees from laos and certain native americans living along the canadian and mexican borders in addition dozen states have chosen to take advantage of an option to provide food stamp benefits at their own expense to some or all legal immigrants still barred from federally financed food stamps6 benefits food stamps are aimed at increasing recipients food purchasing power monthly benefits averaged 72 person about 170 month for typical household in fy1999 and 73 person for 10 months ending july 2000 benefits are inflationadjusted each october and vary with type and amount of income eg earnings are treated more liberally household size and some nonfood expenses eg high shelter costs child support payments dependent care expenses they are provided monthly and except for very poor recipients monthly food stamp benefits are not intended to cover all of households food costs most recipients are expected to contribute portion of their income to their food expenses to determine monthly benefit allotments households total cash monthly income the amount that is used to judge income eligibility is first reduced to net income figure representing income deemed available for food and other normal living costs by allowing standard deduction 134 month and additional deductions for certain expenses these include deductions for 1 excessively high but not all shelter costs generally those above about onethird of households total cash income 2 20 of earnings recognizing taxes and work expenses 3 dependent care expenses related to workeducation 4 child support payments and 5 medical expenses above 35 month if incurred by the elderly or disabled shelter expense deductions claimed by households without elderly or disabled members are subject to monthly dollar limits 300 month or higher amounts in alaska hawaii and guam and lower amount in the virgin islands as are deductions for dependent care costs 200 month for children under age 2 175 for other dependents food stamp allotments then equal the estimated monthly cost of an adequate lowcost diet maximum benefits set at the cost of the agriculture departments thrifty food plan for the households size and indexed annually for foodprice inflation less 30 of monthly net income as calculated above the households expected contribution toward its food costs the theory is that food stamps should fill the deficit between what household can afford for food its 30 contribution and the estimated expense of lowcost adequate diet maximum benefits in fy2001 maximum monthly benefits in the 48 contiguous states and the district of columbia are 434 for fourperson household 341 for three persons 238 for twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs5 7 food stamp benefits also can be used for some prepared meals eg in shelters for battered women and children in elderly nutrition programs in residential substance abuse treatment programs seeds and plants for growing food and hunting and fishing equipment in remote areas of alaskapersons and 130 for one person recognizing significantly higher food prices higher maximums apply in alaska hawaii guam and the virgin islands monthly allotments may be spent for virtually any food item but not alcohol tobacco or readytoeat hot foods in approved food stores meeting rules as to minimum staple and fresh food offerings or food sales volume7 purchases with food stamp benefits are not subject to sales taxes and food stamp assistance is not counted as income under welfare housing and tax laws allotments have historically been issued as paper coupons however food stamp recipients in all or part of some 40 states and the district of columbia well over half of all recipients now receive their benefits through electronic benefit transfer ebt systems that deliver benefits by using special atmlike debit cards rather than paper coupons all states are expected to issue food stamp benefits through ebt systems by 2002 food stamp benefits also may be converted to cash to assist some recipients leaving cash welfare rolls paid as cash to recipients employers in work supplementation programs or in few areas paid as cash grants to elderlydisabled recipients employment and training programs as noted earlier unemployed able bodied adults not caring for very young children can be denied food stamp eligibility if they do not participate in an assigned work or training activity unless they are already covered under another welfare programs worktraining requirements whether to assign food stamp recipient to worktraining activity and the type of activity eg monitored job search workfare job training schooling is the responsibility of the state welfare agency in fy1999 states reported placing nearly 700000 food stamp recipients in employmenttraining program components federal requirements on employment and training programs for food stamp recipients are relatively minimal where actual work is involved eg workfare the number of hours required is limited to the households benefit divided by the applicable minimum wage and generally may not exceed 30 hours week welfare agencies must pay transportation dependent care and other support costs necessary for participation up to certain limits welfare agencies must spend at least 80 of the unmatched federal funding they receive for employment and training programs see below on those covered by the work requirement for 1850yearol d adults without dependents discussed earlier the agriculture department is authorized to monitor and limit states spending on individual employment and training program components to reasonable amounts federal financial support for employment and training programs consists of several parts all states receive share of basic formula grant totaling 86 million in fy2000 in addition states can receive share of an additional grant totaling another 86 million in fy2000 if they maintain their own spending on employment training activities these funds are for operating costs not required support costs like transportation and dependent care do not require any state matching and are available without fiscal year limitation for any program and support costs thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs6 8 the results of these surveys are used by states to target areas for improved administration in addition states with very high rates of erroneous benefit decisions are assessed financial penalties that generally are required to be reinvested in upgrading administration for fy1999 15 states and the district of columbia were assessed 31 million after downward adjustments for states with very high proportions of errorprone cases states with very low erroneous decision rates receive increased federal matching funds for administration in fy1999 four states were granted this enhanced administrative funding for total of 38 million 9 for more information see the extent of trafficking in the food stamp program an update us department of agriculture food and nutrition service march 2000 10 welfare agencies may recoup any improperly issued benefits not just those issued because of an intentional violation of program rules however in cases not involving fraud certain limits are placed on how much recipients future benefits can be reducedexceed these unmatched grants to states the federal government pays 50 match now running about 150 million year fraud abuse and penalties for noncompliance fraud and abuse in the food stamp program takes several forms benefits can be paid to households that are ineligible benefits can be overpaid to eligible households and food stamps can be trafficked for cash or nonfood items annual quality control indepth investigations of sample of the food stamp caseload indicate the extent to which food stamps are issued in error overpaid or issued to ineligible households8 the fy1999 survey showed that 7 of benefits about 11 billion in that year were erroneously overissued it also showed that underpayments equaled 29 or some 450 million both these percentage error rates were down slightly from fy1998 erroneous eligibility and benefit decisions occur because of intentional violations fraud and unintentional mistakes by both recipients and eligibility workers the fy1997 survey indicated that 59 of overpaid benefits to ineligible and eligible households were attributable to recipients and that just over onethird were due to intentional recipient violations the remaining 41 were caused by eligibility workers errors the extent of abuse of the program in the form of trafficking in food stamps is difficult to measure the most recent attempt was made by the fns for calendar years 19961998 it estimated that about 660 million year about 35 of food stamps issued was exchanged for cash trafficked through retailers ie diverted from food stamp benefits9 there are variety of penalties for intentional failure to comply with food stamp program rules recipients can be disqualified for periods ranging from 1 year to permanent disqualification and welfare agencies are authorized to collect all improperly issued benefits through any means they see fit including reducing future benefits and recovering from unemployment compensation payments income tax refunds and some other government payments10 food concerns can be disqualified for periods ranging from 6 months to permanent disqualification and be fined 20000 or more in addition intentional violations like trafficking or falsely acquiring benefits can lead to prison terms of 1 to 20 years and fines ranging from 1000 to 250000httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs7 fy1998 information on disqualifications and claims collections indicate 1 almost 1500 stores were removed for noncompliance with food stamp rules 2 about 90000 persons were disqualified and 3 about 170 million in claims against recipients were recouped finally the expanding use of ebt benefit issuance systems noted earlier is expected to significantly curtail trafficking because these systems make it is easier to identify and link trafficking to specific recipients and retailers through electronic records of transactions puerto rico american samoa and the northern marianas variants of the regular food stamp program operate in puerto rico american samoa and the northern mariana islands puerto ricos nutrition assistance program provides its benefits in cash under rules similar to but more financially restrictive than the regular food stamp program it is the largest welfare program in the commonwealth but federal support is limited to an annual block grant of specific amounts laid down in and funded under the food stamp act appropriation this annual block grant pays for all benefits half of administrative expenses and some worktraining initiatives in recent years puerto rico has received 1213 billion year for cash nutrition assistance in lieu of food stamps allowing it to offer benefits to about 1112 million persons in some 450000 households the programs in american samoa and the northern marianas also are limited grants each funded at about 5 million year and serving 30004000 people they are not cash assistance programs and are roughly similar to the regular program although american samoas program is limited to the elderly and disabled and the northern marianas program has special rules directing the use of some benefits to local products participation in the food stamp program enrollment in the regular food stamp program is responsive to changes in the economy ie recipients employment status and earnings food stamp eligibility rules and potential applicants perception of their eligibility status and administrative practices as well as recipients getting or losing public assistance eligibility with few changes in eligibility rules the caseload expanded from monthly average of 226 million persons in fy1991 to 254 million in fy1992 27 million fy1993 and 275 million in fy1994 alltime peak participation was 28 million people in the spring of 1994 since the 1994 peak level enrollment has declined continuously in fy1995 the monthly average was 266 million persons and fy1996 participation averaged 255 million people in fy1997 and again in fy1998 there were further reductions to monthly average of 229 million persons in 95 million households during fy1997 and 198 million people in 82 million households during fy1998 because of the effects of an improving economy federal and state welfare reform initiatives and lower participation rate among those eligible in an average month food stamp participation dropped to 85 of the us population in fy1997 and 73 in fy1998 as opposed to 1011 in earlier years in fy1999 participation continued to decline to monthly average of 182 million persons in 77 million households and the latest published enrollment report for july 2000 shows the caseload down to 169 million persons in 73 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs8 11 participation rates were and are not uniformly high among all segments of the foodstamp eligible population eg participation is very low among the elderly below onethird and the working poor less than half of those eligible and relatively high among those enrolled in other welfare programs in addition while overall participation among eligible individuals was estimated at 71 the proportion of benefits issued as proportion of potential benefits was projected to be even higher approximately 80 participation rates also varied and continue to vary significantly by state from an estimated 4045 to over 90 in few states 12 for information on overall participation rates nationally and by state see reaching those in need food stamp participation rates in the states july 2000 report done for the agriculture departments food and nutrition service by mathematica policy

1990s june 2000 report from the agriculture departme nts economic research service food assistance and nutrition research report number 7 this report is available through the agriculture departments website at httpwwwersusdagovepubspdffanrr7households while the rate at which food stamp enrollment is dropping has slowed recently the total caseload is now at the lowest point since the late 1970s by the mid1990s agriculture department studies eg for september 1994 indicated that about 71 of those eligible for food stamps actually participated following rise in the caseload and higher levels of persons in poverty and unemployment11 but the relatively dramatic decline in food stamp enrollment since 1994 even more substantial than would be suggested by the reduction in the number of those with belowpoverty incomes has led many observers to conclude that the participation rate among those eligible noted above has dropped significantly to 62 in september 1997 by the most recent department estimate and to look for explanations for the large number of lowincome persons disappearing from food stamp rolls12 studies of the reasons for the caseload decline agree that large share of the decline in participation cannot be explained by readily measurable variables like the jobincome effects of an improved economy and specific changes in welfarefood stamp law and policies for example one recent agriculture department study based on information through 1998 found that 35 of the caseload decline was associated with changing economic conditions and 12 with program reforms and political variables it also found that 28 of the reduction was associated with decrease in the number of persons with annual income below 130 of the federal poverty levels and another 55 of the difference was due to decline in the proportion of low income persons who participate because of economic conditions program changes or both13 other cited reasons range from changing welfare office administrative practices to recipients lack of understanding that being dropped from or discouraged from applying for one public assistance program does not mean automatic ineligibility for others like food stamps the caseload decline study cited above notes that 1 studies of those leaving states tanf welfare programs indicate that food stamp participation dropped significantly among tanf leavers and increased earnings alone were not likely the reason and 2 fns reviews of state local welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs9 14 also see the general accounting office report cited in footnote 15 15 in addition to the economic research service report and the july 2000 food stamp participation report cited above several agriculture department studies provide information about recent

welfare reform on the incomes of singlemother families and 3 an october 1999 discussion paper from the urban institute entitled declines in food stamp and welfare participation is there connection numbered 9913 16 discussion of some of the more important of these initiatives those dealing with how households report changed circumstances is provided in september 2000 report by the center on budget and policy priorities washington dc entitled improving access to food stamps new reporting options can reduce administrative burdens and error rates 17 for brief overview of information available as to the need for food assistance eg the extent of food insecurity that some feel is not being fully met see the emergency food assistance program and emergency feeding needs crs report rl30164administrative practices have identified improper barriers to food stamp participation14 finally there is concern that the safetynet character of the food stamps is being undermined lessthanoptimum participation appears to be concentrated among needy families with children and the working poor and states emphasis on moving families off welfare and into jobs may be having the sideeffect of keeping eligible poor families off food stamps15 because of the caseload decline and concerns over the noneconomic reasons for it the administration has announced series of initiatives to boost participation these have included significant outreach efforts and changes that liberalize rules governing how cars are counted as assets in judging eligibility how households are required to report income and other changes in their circumstances and how states are held accountable for erroneous benefit and eligibility determinations16 in addition legislation aimed at increasing participation among eligibles and easing eligibility rules is likely see the discussion of legislation at the end of this report17 according to preliminary data from the fy1999 survey of the characteristics of food stamp households 52 of participants were children onethird of whom were preschool age and about 20 of enrollees were elderly or disabled single parent households with children made up almost 40 of participating households and elderly persons living alone comprised 16 of food stamp households nonhispanic white enrollees made up 41 of the caseload nonhispanic africanamericans comprised 36 and hispanics totaled 18 about 35 of food stamp households were very poor having cash monthly income below half the federal income povertyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs10 18 spending for few activities such as research and evaluation related to the food stamp program computer and electronic benefit transfer system support and special nutrition education and outreach projects are treated as discretionary spending items as such they are dependent on annual appropriations decisions as to how much should be spent rather than being driven by the number of recipients and benefit paymentsguidelines recipients income was primarily from other public assistance nearly twothirds of participating households received some type of cash welfare while 27 of participating households had some earned income the 1999 survey characteristics of food stamp households fiscal year 1999 advance report is available through the agriculture departments website at httpwwwfnsusdagovoanemenupublishedfspparticipationhtm the abovenoted enrollment figures and data on recipients characteristics do not include 1112 million persons receiving benefits under puerto ricos nutrition assistance grant in fy199799 down from 13 million in fy1996 and 1415 million people in earlier years funding the food stamp program for budgetary purposes virtually all programs and activities under the food stamp act are treated as entitlements federal money is guaranteed to the extent needed to fund benefits the federal share of expenses related to administration and worktraining programs for recipients and stipulated amounts for grants to puerto rico american samoa and the northern marianas18 as result the bulk of each years appropriation normally is based on an estimate of the amount needed to fully fund benefit administrative and worktraining expenses under the regular food stamp program plus money for nutrition assistance grants for puerto rico american samoa and the northern marianas and contingencies moreover some funding for programs not directly related to food stamps also is contained in each years appropriation for the food stamp account money for the food distribution program on indian reservations and food purchases for the emergency food assistance program is mandated and appropriated under the food stamp act and added funds outside regular annual food stamp act appropriation are available for spending on foodstamprelated operations they include dollars collected from benefit overpayment recoveries payments from states exercising their option to pay for benefits to noncitizens ineligible for federally supported benefits accrued unused employment and training program funds from prior years and in recent years money appropriated to the economic research service for research and evaluation on the other hand the amount spent on food stamps differs from the amount available for spending appropriations plus funds from benefit overpay ment recoveries state payments unused employmenttraining money and the economic research service budget account for the most part expenditures depend on the number of personshouseholds actually receiving benefits the level of their benefits and related administrative and worktrainin g program costs as result readily identifiable food stamp act annual appropriations do not provide clear picture of the extent of federal spending on food stamps and total appropriated and other funding generally exceeds actual spending obligations or outlays as shown in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs11 19 for information about the emergency food assistance program see the emergency food assist ance program and emergency feeding needs crs report rl30164 the food distribution program on indian reservations provides federally donated food and money for administration and distribution costs as an alternative to food stamps on indian reservations opting for this program in years prior to fy1997 these programs were funded out of continuedspending and funding tables in this report unspent appropriations normally are returned to the treasury or in few cases transferred to help fund other agriculture department nutrition programs however unspent grants to states for worktraining programs typically are accumulated for allocation and spending in later years finally in addition to federal dollars states make substantial contribution with their matching share of administrative and worktraining costs and the abovenoted payments for benefits to some noncitizens see the discussion of these contributions payments later in this report fy1994f y1997 spending for the regular food stamp program peaked in fy1994fy1995 it increased from 187 billion in fy1991 to 225 billion in 1992 237 billion in 1993 and 244 billion in 1994 even with decreased participation see the earlier discussion of participation in the program obligations inched up to 245 billion in fy1995 because of inflation indexing and more administrative and worktraining spending in fy1996 and again in fy1997 spending on the regular program turned down to 244 billion in fy1996 and more significantly to 217 billion in fy1997 these lower expenditures were the result of reduced participation and slower growth in benefits brought on by an improved economy and greater employment prospects as well as implementa tion of changes in food stamp and other public assistance laws made by the 1996 welfare reform measure and states welfare reform initiatives while spending peaked and declined in the fy1994fy1997 period the annual amounts available from appropriations and other sources were consistently above the level needed to finance all needed spending by 821 2148 billion

noncitizens and unused employmenttraining program funds for total available of 22823 billion the currentlaw budget request was supplemented with three proposed changes to existing law and appropriations allocations that were projected to have small effect on food stamp spending in fy2000 first as part of larger initiative to provide benefits to legal immigrants made ineligible by the 1996 welfare reform law the administration proposed to grant food stamp eligibility to legal immigrants who were lawful residents in august 1996 the month of enactment for the 1996 welfare reform law and who subsequently reach the age of 65 those who were 65 in august 1996 are already eligible under the terms of 1998 legislation this initiative would have required separate legislation and added an estimated 10 million to fy2000 food stamp benefit costs second the administration proposed to spend 7 million in fy2000 on nutrition education and technical assistance outreach providing information about food stamps to populations with low food stamp participation rates such as the elderly and working poor finally the administration proposed to provide about 11 million for research and evaluation projects related to food stamps using the food stamp act appropriation for the food and nutrition service rather than the appropriation for the agriculture departments economic research service in fy1998 and fy1999 funding for these efforts was provided through the economic research service appropriation by direction of the annual appropriations acts the 11 million proposed by the administration represented significant increase above the 6 million provided through the economic research service in fy1999 altogether these three administration initiatives were projected to add 28 million to spending under the food stamp budget account in fy2000 although the 11 million proposed for research and evaluation would be offset by reduction in money provided to the economic research service for foodstamprelated research and evaluation activities on june 8 1999 the house approved its version of the fy2000 agriculture department appropriations measure hr 1906 hrept 106157 which included total food stamp act appropriation of 21577 billion this bill appropriated lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs17 22 the houseapproved bill also did not include the request for 48 billion advance appropriation for fy2001 23 as with the house bill the senate measure did not include the administrations request for 48 billion advance appropriation for fy2001than requested by the administration but without affecting currentlaw food stamp benefitsservices because the required change in food stamp law was not anticipated to be made the 10 million requested for the administrations initiative for legal immigrants was not accounted for in the bill funding for the administrations new outreach effort 7 million was not explicitly included and the administrations proposal to fund food stamp research and evaluation projects through the food stamp account and the food and nutrition service was rejected although the requested amount 11 million was part of the house bills economic research service appropriation finally the housepassed bill differed from the administrations request for fy2000 by reducing the size of the requested contingency reserve from 1 billion to 100 million22 on august 4 1999 the senate approved its version of the fy2000 agriculture department appropriations bill s 1233 srept 10680 this included total food stamp act appropriation of 21564 billion as with the house bill the senate measure appropriated less than requested by the administration but with anticipated effect on currentlaw benefitsservices also like the house bill

administrations new outreach effort or 3 the administrations proposal to fund food stamp research and evaluation projects through the food stamp account and the food and nutrition service23 with regard to funding for research and evaluation activities the senate bill as in the house directed money through the economic research service appropriation although at reduced level estimated to be

the enacted fy2000 food stamp appropriation together with the estimated 352 million provided from recouped overpayments state payments unused work training money and the economic research service

amount available 198 billion some 16 billion less or 14 billion less if spending for the food distribution program on indian reservations and the emergency food assistanc program is included the gap between the amount available and the amount spent now is expected to be even larger as the result of newer and lowerthanexpected participation figures the administrations summer 2000 midsession budget

respectively research and evaluation funds also are included as appropriated to the economic research servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs20 24 included in the currentlaw appropriations request were funds to cover the benefit spending effects of regulatory changes proposed in february 2000 approxima tely 80 million in fy2001 and over 170200 million year in later years these revisions expected to become effective in late 2000 include 1 allowing states to disregard vehicles with an equity value below 1000 when determining food stamp eligibility 2 increasing state options as to how to count the financial resources of ineligible noncitizens residing with eligible persons eg allowing states to disregard the income of ineligible noncitizens and 3 significantly changing federal rules as to income reporting and other administrative requirements to ease burdens on state agencies and recipients also included in the administrations currentlaw request was 25 million for community food projects approved in the freedom to farm law pl 104127 and authorized under section 25 of the food stamp act funding for these projects has been included in the regular food stamp appropriation since 1996 25 the administration also separately proposed changes in child support enforcement law that would increase food stamp recipients child support income and lower food stamp benefit costs by some 7 million in fy2001 rising to over 40 million year thus table 4 shows only net 24 million benefit cost in the administrations fy2001 request with proposed legislation congressional action on child support proposals incorporated in the pending child support distribution act of 2000 is not complete and if child support revisions are enacted there will be food stamp benefit savings not reflected in the fy2001 enacted appropriation spending figuresfy2001 the administrations budget for fy2001 the administration asked for total food stamp act appropriation of 22132 billion to provide funding for operations under current law24 this requested appropriation included money for the regular food stamp program and the small grants for american samoa and the northern marianas 13 billion for puerto ricos nutrition assistanc block grant 177 million for the food distribution program on indian reservations and food purchases for the emergency food assistance program and 1 billion contingency reserve in case caseload projections for fy2001 are too low the fy2001 budget request also assumed that some 363 million will be available from recouped benefit overpayments state payments for benefits to noncitizens and unused employmenttraining program funds for total available amount of 225 billion the currentlaw budget request was supplemented with three proposed changes to existing law that were projected to have minor effect on food stamp spending in fy2001 adding some 31 million but larger effects in later years eg costing about 130 million in fy2002 and 265 million in fy200325 note while these changes were outlined in budget presentations legislation to implement them was not submitted by the administration however the two most important of these proposals those dealing with legal immigrants eligibility status and the counting of vehicles as assets in eligibility determinations were largely subsumed in other legislation see below and the discussion of legislation at the end of this report for details first the administration proposed to restore eligibility for federally financed food stamps to two groups of noncitizens who were barred from food stamps by the 1996 welfare reform law as with its fy2000 budget request the administration would have made eligible persons legally resident on august 22 1996 the date of enactment for the welfare reform change who subsequently turn age 65 those who were 65 at enactment are already eligible under the terms of 1998 legislation this change would have affected an estimated 10000 persons when fully implemented at an fy2001 benefithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs21 26 proposed regulatory change would modify this rule by allowing states to disregard vehicles with an equity value of less than 1000 it is scheduled to become effective in late 2000 the significant cost of this regulatory revision over 100 million year when fully implemented is included in the administrations currentlaw estimates and reduces the cost of the proposed legislative change regarding vehicles as assetscost of 10 million rising to 20 million in fy2002 and 35 million in fy2003 in addition the administration asked to make eligible adult legal immigrants who were legal residents on august 22 1996 and live with eligible children ie citizen children or noncitizen children made eligible by the terms of 1998 legislation this would have restored eligibility to about 200000 legal immigrant adults when fully implemented at an fy2001 benefit cost of 15 million increasing to 75 million in fy2002 and 105 million in fy2003 however it should be noted that these changes would have allowed some states that now pay for food stamps for noncitizens ineligible for federally financed benefits to reduce their costs much more expansive restoration of food stamp eligibility for legal immigrants was included in the hunger relief act hr 3192s 1805 and remains under congressional consideration see discussion of legislation at the end of this report second the administration proposed to allow states to change the rules under which vehicles are counted as an asset in judging food stamp eligibility states would be permitted to conform food stamp rules with those they use in their temporary assistance for needy families tanf programs the majority of states completely disregard the value of one vehicle under their tanf program while federal food stamp rules are generally stricter eg the fair market value of most vehicles is counted as an asset to the extent it exceeds 465026 when fully implemented this proposal was anticipated to allow food stamp eligibility for some 245000 additional people federal benefit costs would rise by 1 million in fy2001 30 million in fy2002 120 million in fy2003 and over 200 million year in following years very similar revision of vehiclesasassets rules was advanced in the hunger relief act hr 3192s 1805 and became law as part of the fy2001 agriculture department appropriations measure see the discussion of legislation at the end of this report third the administration proposed to permit states to choose to conform the types of income they count in the food stamp program with the income definition used for medicaid eligibility purposes this would have allowed states to disregard certain types of income for food stamps that are now disregarded in the medicaid program but counted under food stamp rules the administration expected that this option would affect an estimated 17000 persons at an annual food stamp benefit cost of 5 million finally in addition to its three legislative proposals the administrations fy2001 food stamp budget 1 proposed that funding for foodstamprelated research and evaluation be directed through the food and nutrition service as it was prior to fy1998 rather than the economic research service 2 asked for an increase in funding for researchevaluation activities from 6 million to 11 million and 3 requested 10 million for nutrition education and program information outreach initiative aimed at eligible population groups with low rates of participationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs22 27 as with the administrations request this appropriation included money for the food distribution program on indian reservations 77 million and food purchases for the emergency food assistance program 100 millionfy2001 appropriations and estimated spending in july 2000 the house and senate approved their versions of the fy2001 food stamp appropriation as part of their respective fy2001 agriculture department appropriations bills in effect both measures appropriated more than enough money to maintain anticipated currentlaw spending levels for food stamps even if enrollment declines end and participation turns upward ie sufficient resources were made available for an average monthly caseload of 188 million persons well above average participation of 182 million people in fy1999 and 172 million persons for the first 10 months of fy2000 and average monthly benefits of 76 person about 4 higher than expected in fy2000 nevertheless they both 1 cut the administrations requested 1 billion contingency fund to 100 million and 2 denied requested funding increase for foodstamprelated research while directing research spending through the economic research service not the fns and the food stamp act appropriation as asked for by the administration in addition explicit adjustment was made for legislative changes the house fy2001 appropriations measure hr 4461 hrept 106619 reported may 16 2000 passed july 11 2000 appropriated total of 21232 billion27 this was 900 million less than the administrations currentlaw request and 924 million less than the request amount including the net costs of proposed legislation it reflected decisions to decrease the requested contingency fund amount from 1 billion to 100 million and not adjust for any legislative changes money for food stamp research 6 million not the 11 million requested was appropriated to the economic research service whether funding for the administrations outreach effort 10 million was included under the house bill was unclear although specific dollar reduction from the requeste d appropriation amount or committee report language reflected decision to deny these funds finally the house bill directed 25 million reduction from 219 million to 194 million in the amount to be allocated for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients although change in the appropriation level reflected this this mandate however would not affect fy2001 spending because money made available in earlier years is going unused and building up in reserve for future use the real effect of the house directive would be in the longer term it would reduce the amount of new ie fy2001 money flowing into the reserve for future use but not decrease spending in fy2001 itself because the large reserve that has already been built up can be drawn down the senates fy2001 appropriations measure s 2536hr 4461 srept 106 288 reported may 10 2000 passed july 20 2000 appropriated total of 21221 billion as with the house it reflected decisions to reduce the amount set aside for the contingency fund by 900 million and not adjust for legislative changes again like the house the senates bill appropriated money 6 million not the 11 million requested for food stamp research to the economic research service but differing slightly from the house it specifically reduced requested food stamp appropriation amount by 11 million to reflect the fact that money from the food stamp account can be spent for research and specified 500000 for study of problems related to applicants accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs23 28 also unlike the house bill the senate included 7 million for bison meat purchases and distribution through the food distribution program on indian reservations funding for this program is covered by the appropriation to the food stamp budget account 29 the conference agreement added 3 million in funding for bison meat purchases through the food distribution program on indian reservations to the 77 million requested for the program by the administrationto food stamp benefits and the recent decline in food stamp participation28 as with the house it was unclear whether funds for the administrations 10 million food stamp outreach project was included on october 6 2000 the housesenate conference agreement on the fy2001 agriculture department appropriations bill was filed hr 4461 hrept 106948 it was approved by the house on october 11 2000 and by the senate on october 18 2000 on october 28 2000 the congressional conference agreement on the fy2001 agriculture department appropriations measure was enacted as pl106387 the fy2001 law appropriates 20114 billion substantia lly less than either the house or senate approved or requested by the administration while lower than earlier recommendations this amount simply represents downward adjustment of 1107 billion to reflect new estimates of probable fy2001 spending needs made in the administrations summer 2000 midsession budget review not cut in support for the program the housesenate conferees reduced the senates figure by 1107 billion but with other available funding there will still be nearly 205 billion to support the regular program puerto ricos block grant and other spending under the food stamp budget account 100 million in food purchases for the emergency food assistance program and 80 million for the food distribution program on indian reservations29 this amount is noticeably above the figure needed to support significant rise in food stamp participation and the cost of food stamp program changes also legislated in the fy2001 appropriations law see the discussion of legislation at the end of this report table 4 shows estimated spending and available funding under the administrations fy2001 budget and the fy2001 agriculture appropriations law spending figures are adjusted to reflect the administrations summer 2000 mid session budget review ie reduced costs for benefits because of lower than previously expected participation in fy2001 the amounts presented for the administrations currentlaw request do not take its legislative proposals into account while those shown for the request with proposed legislation reflect the 24 million fy2001 net cost of the administrations legislative package the figures for the enacted appropriations law reflect 1 new spending 40 million as estimated by the congressional budget office from the legislative changes to food stamp program rules made by the law 2 an estimated 5 million reduction in puerto ricos grant mandated by the agreement and 3 5 million cut in the administrations request

those presented in earlier versions of this report and the administrations fy2001 budget primarily because they reflect downward adjustments to spending estimates made during the administrations summer 2000 midsession budget review reduction of 1107 billion in benefit spending and include estimated spending due to legislative changes included in the conference agreement 40 million for added benefits and 5 million decrease in puerto ricos block grant amounts do not include 1 about 2 billion in state funds for administrationissuance costs and worktraining programs and 2 spending for the

million substantial spending effects estimated to total about 80 million in fy2001 resulting from implementation of regulations proposed in february 2000 are included in all figures spending figures for the regular program shown in this table are slightly higher than the 18613 billion designated for expenses in the joint explanatory statement of the housesenate conferees primarily because spending from funds provided by states and other sources is included regular program spending includes grants to american samoa and the northern marianas totaling some 10 million as well as spending for benefits to some noncitizens financed by state payments about 100 million notes for table 4 are continued on the following pagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs25 b amounts include federal funding

for spending on the emergency food assistance program and the food distribution program on indian reservations 177 million in total for the administrations request and 180 million in the conference agreement the do not include separate appropria tions to the economic research service for foodstamprelated research and evaluation see note other available funds include recouped overpayments payments from states choosing to pay for food stamp benefits to noncitizens and unused prioryear worktraining funds they also include separate appropriations to the economic research service for research and evaluation in the conference agreement nonfederal funding there are three types of nonfederal funding in the food stamp program the largest amount is state matching funding for administrative costs estimated at about 2 billion for fy2000 up from 17 billion in fy1999 in general states are responsible for 50 of food stamp administrative costs eg determining eligibility issuing benefits however states can pay less than 50 as little as 40 if they have very low rates of erroneous benefit decisions eg four states qualified for this enhanced funding treatment worth 38 million in fy1999 and beginning with fy1999 over 40 states have effectively been responsible for somewhat more than 50 of food stamp administrative costs pl 105185 enacted june 23 1998 requires that the normal 50 federal payment to them for administrative costs be reduced by flat annual dollar amount for each state as an adjustment for additional funding received in their tanf block grants for each year this reduction in federal payments for administrative costs is just over 200 million states pay matching share of the cost of worktraining programs for food stamp recipients about 150 million year in recent years finally 12 states have chosen to pay the cost of providing benefits to some or all legal immigrants barred from federally financed food stamps by the 1996 welfare reform law and not restored by 1998 revisions to the law estimated at just under 100 million yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs26 30 these amendments will slightly reduce puerto ricos grants in fy2001 and fy2002 but changing puerto ricos grant to indexed amounts as opposed to figures explicitly set out in food stamp law will mean that when food stamp appropriations are reviewed for reauthorization in 2002 renewing puerto ricos annual grant at levels automatically increased for inflation will not be scored as cost by the congressional budget office 31 this change in food stamp law derives from proposal included in the hunger relief act continuedlegislation enacted in the 106th congress the electronic benefit transfer interoperability and portability act pl 106171 enacted february 11 2000 requires that by october 2002 all states electronic benefit transfer ebt systems for delivering food stamp benefits be interoperable ie that ebt cards issued by one state be usable to purchase food items in food stamp retailers in all other states it also provides small amount of federal funding to cover added state costs for doing so section 604 of the fy2001 defense authorization law hr 4205hr 5408 h rept 106945 enacted as pl 106398 on october 30 2000 provides for special family subsistence supplemental allowances for those military personnel who might be otherwise eligible for food stamp assistance these allowances up to 500 month are intended to substantially eliminate the likelihood that military households would be financially eligible for food stamps the fy2001 agriculture department appropriations measure hr 4461 hrept 106948 enacted as pl 106387 on october 28 2000 and discussed earlier in this report includes three important changes to food stamp law two of which were derived from proposals advanced in the hunger relief act hr 3192s 1805 none of these revisions were included in either the house or senate versions of the appropriations measure they were added by housesenate conferees section 821 of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations law changes the terms of puerto ricos nutrition assistance block grant prior law fixed the amount of this grant at 1301 billion in fy2001 and 1335 billion in fy2002 amounts after fy2002 will be determined when the food stamp act appropriations authorization is next taken up probably in 2002 the revisions made by the appropriations law require that 1 the fy2001 grant amount be the fy2000 figure 1268 billion inflated by the foodathome component of the consumer price index and 2 the fy2002 grant amount be the newly calculated fy2001 figure adjusted for changes in the cost of the thrifty food plan used to determine basic food stamp benefits under the regular program it is expected that these changes will result in puerto ricos grant being about 5 million smaller than under prior law in fy2001 and some 7 million lower than the prior law amount in fy200230 section 846 of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations law liberalizes the treatmen t of shelter expenses when determining food stamp benefits31 food stamp law increases benefits for those with veryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs27 31 continued hr 3192s 1805 32 this change in food stamp law derives from proposals included in the hunger relief act hr 3192s 1805 and the administrations fy2001 budget package 33 foodstampeligible households are limited to 2000 in liquid assets 3000 for elderly households including any amount attributable to the value of vehicle over 4650shelter expenses in relation to their income it allows the cost of shelter above threshold equal to roughly onethird of total household income to be disregarded deducted when judging the amount of income household has available for food spending for households without an elderly or disabled member prior law limits the disregardeddeducted amount to 300 month thereby restricting the shelterexpense related benefit increase available to nonelderly nondisabled households primarily families with children the amendment included in the appropriations law raises the limit to 340 beginning in march 2001 and indexes it annually to the consumer price index beginning with fy2002 preliminary estimates place the 5year cost at 500 600 million section 847 of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations law liberalizes the treatment of vehicles when determining financial eligibility for food stamps32 for those not receiving assistance under states temporary assistance for needy families tanf programs the fair market value of households vehicle generally is counted as liquid asset to the extent it exceeds 465033 the appropriations law amendment allows states to elect to use their tanf rules governing vehicles as assets already applied to tanf households if they are more liberal effective july 2001 preliminary estimates place the 5year cost at approximately 1 billion hunger relief act amendments although two major provisions of the hunger relief act hr 3192s 1805 were enacted as part of the fy2001 agriculture appropr iations law see above one additional set of amendments revamping food stamp eligibility rules for legal immigrants was not these amendments remain under consideration by congress and would remove all categorical limits on food stamp eligibility for legal immigrants for general coverage of immigration legislation see immigration legislation and issues in the 106th congress crs issue brief 10044 under the omnibus 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 food stamp eligibility for noncitizen legal immigrants was severely limited illegally present aliens and non immigrant aliens were already and continue to be ineligible later amendments made by 1998 law pl 105185 loosened limitations on legal immigrants somewhat but retained several substantial barriers the categories of legal immigrants who remain eligible for food stamps are generally limited to 1 those with long us work histories covered by social security 2 veterans and active duty military personnel and their families 3 refugees and asylees for 7 years after entry 4 children who legally entered the country as of august 22 1996 the enactment date of the 1996 welfare reform lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9859crs28 so long as they are children 5 the elderly who were here legally and age 65 or older as of august 22 1996 6 the disabled who were here legally as of august 22 1996 including persons who were here but become disabled after that date and 7 hmong refugees from laos and certain native americans living along the canadian and mexican borders in addition number of states have chosen to take advantage of an option to provide food stamp benefits at their own expense to some or all legal immigrants barred from federal financed food stamps the majority of these state covered legal immigrants are in california the legal immigrant provisions of the hunger relief act would remove all the still existing food stamp categorical eligibility limits imposed by the amended 1996 law this would primarily benefit those who entered after august 22 1996 or entered before that date and have reached age 18 or 65 they would not change the long standing provisions of food stamp law barring eligibility to illegally present aliens other facets of the 1996 welfare reform law affecting legal immigrants also would be affected most notably rules dealing with immigrants sponsors and food stamps basic welfare reform law rules strengthening requirements that legal immigrants sponsors financial resources be attributed to the immigrant when judging food stamp eligibility thereby limiting their access to food stamps based on financial need would not be changed however immigrants sponsors would be excused from certain requirements that they reimburse the cost of food stamp benefits provided to sponsored immigrant if the sponsor is unable because of hardship eg bankruptcy disability or experiences severe circumstances beyond the sponsors control according to preliminary congressional budget office estimates these provisions would have 5year cost of just over 900 million in food stamp benefits and affect 400000450000 persons when fully carried out other legislation because of time and budget constraints or because they have been overtaken by other legislative initiatives other significant food stamp legislative proposals are not likely to be taken up in this session of congress they include initiatives that were included in the administrations fy2001 budget submission discussed earlier in this report but subsumed in the broader provisions of the hunger relief act discussed above or dropped by the administration conforming food stamp income definitions with the medicaid program provisions in the food stamp outreach and research for kids act hr 2738 s 1800 to encourage outreach to those eligible for food stamps and help lessen potential administrative barriers to their participation eg require variety of outreach activities federal inspections of state public assistance agency administrative operations and testing of strategies to ensure food stamp participation among recipients and former recipients of tanf and proposals in hr 3304 and s 1307 to allow the use of food stamp benefits to purchase vitamins and nutrition supplements
