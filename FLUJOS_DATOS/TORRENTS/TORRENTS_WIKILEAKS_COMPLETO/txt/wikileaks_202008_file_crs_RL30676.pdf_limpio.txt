european nations signed the treaty on open skies the united states officially ratified the treaty on november 3 1993 the treaty has not yet entered into force however because russia and belarus have not yet ratified it president bush revived the open skies concept in may 1989 at the time the united states believed that the open skies concept would reduce the chances of military confrontation and build confidence in europe by providing participants with the ability to collect information about the military forces and activities of others in the treaty in addition even though the united states and russia can collect this type of information with sophisticated observation satellites open skies observation flights will provide nations who do not have their own satellites with way to participate in the data collection and confidencebuilding process the parties to the treaty on open skies have agreed to permit unarmed aircraft to conduct observation flights over their entire territories the united states air force has modified three c135 aircraft for this purpose open skies aircraft can be equipped with four types of sensors optical panoramic and framing cameras video cameras infrared linescanning devices and sidewayslooking synthetic aperture radars these sensors must be based on offtheshelf technology that is available to all participants in the treaty the treaty includes quotas that specify maximum numbers of observation flights that can occur within each nation each year and the maximum number of observation flights each nation can conduct each year for the united states these quotas are 42 flights per year however only 4 flights will occur over us territory in the first year that the treaty is in force in addition the united states will conduct only 9 observation flights during the first year of treaty implementation 8 over russia and belarus and one in conjunction with canada over ukraine when the senate reviewed the open skies treaty in 1992 and 1993 members raised several concerns about the implications of the treaty for the united states for example some were concerned that the costs of outfitting and operating the us open skies aircraft would outweigh the benefits that the united states would receive by participating in the treaty as result the senate suggested that the united states restrict its participation conducting fewer than the 42 permitted observation flights per year some were also concerned about potential risks to us security from observation flights that would gather information on us military forces and activities if the open skies treaty remains in force for many years the united states could host dozens of visits by other participants with foreign military aircraft equipped with sensors flying over us territory virtually all observers agree however that these flights will pose security threat to the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676 contents introduction 1 background 2 key provisions of

activities introduction on march 24 1992 the united states canada and 22 european nations signed the treaty on open skies1 this treaty had grown out of may 1989 proposal by president george bush he envisioned an agreement that would promote cooperation and build confidence between the two cold war blocs nato and the warsaw pact but the warsaw pact dissolved before the treaty was completed so it emerged as an agreement among european nations the united states and canada rather than as treaty between two opposing alliances the open skies treaty has not yet entered into force however because russia and belarus have not ratified it each of the parties to the treaty on open skies will permit unarmed aircraft operated by any other party to fly over its territory to observe military forces and activities by allowing the participants to gain insights and understanding into the military capabilities of potential adversaries the treaty can accordin g to its supporters build confidence reduce the chances of military confrontation and encourage cooperation among the nations of europe under the terms of the treaty observation aircraft from the other participants can conduct up to 42 flights over us territory each year russia too will be subject to 42 flights the other participants will host between 2 and 12 flights each year consequently if the open skies treaty remains in force for many years the united states could host dozens of visits by other participants virtually all observers agree that these flights will pose security threat to the united states however questions about the presence of foreign military aircraft and the purpose of the observation flights may come up when the observation flights occur this report provides basic information about the rationale for the open skies treaty the provisions that govern its implementation and the capabilities of the aircraft and sensors that will be used during the observation flights this information can help congress review the implementation of the treaty it may also help members respond to concerns that constituents may raise about the presence of open skies aircraft and observation flights around the country the first section of this report briefly reviews the history of negotiations on open skies the second discusses key provisions of the 1992 treaty the third reviews the current status of the treaty and

august 1989 canada took particularly active role in advancing the negotiations see tucker jonathan b back to the future the open skies talks arms control today v 20 october 1990 p 21background the idea for treaty on open skies first appeared in 1955 when president eisenhower suggested that the united states and soviet union permit aerial observation flights over each others territories in principle aerial observation flights would permit the two nations to reduce their reliance on worstcase estimates of the other sides military capabilities and to demonstrate that they were willing to cooperate with each other to ease tensions at the same time in the era before the development of observation satellites aerial observation flights were only way for the united states to gain needed intelligence information about military forces and activities inside the soviet union according to the bush administration the eisenhower proposal would have dramatically changed the quantity and quality of our knowledge of the soviet union2 the soviet leadership rejected president eisenhowers proposal arguing that the observati on flights would simply legalize espionage president bush revived the open skies concept in may 1989 at the time as the cold war was ending the united states believed increased transparency in europe would reduce the chances of military confrontation and build confidence according to secretary of state james baker open skies would promote and consolidate the international trends towards openness already in train3 the bush administration also viewed open skies as test of soviet willingness to move forward in cooperative relationship with the united states according to president bush such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the true meaning of the concept of openness the very soviet willingness to embrace such concept would reveal their commitment to change4 unlike the bilateral 1955 version of open skies the negotiations that began in february 1990 included all of the members of nato and the warsaw pact5 the united states sought pacttopact treaty with the united states and nato conducting observation flights over the

interested in conducting their observation flights over soviet territory6 as result after the abortive soviet coup in august 1991 the participants altered their approach and produced treaty among nations rather than pact between alliances each of the parties to the treaty can collect information about and improve its understanding of the military forces and activities of any of the other participants as secretary of state baker indicated when the treaty was submitted to the senate the treaty on open skies represents the widestranging international effort to date to promote openness and transparency of military forces and activities7 but the treaty would do more than just build confidence and reduce the risk of conflict many viewed the treaty as symbol of the new europe according to thomas graham the acting director of the arms control and disarmament agency by strengthening the environment of security and confidence such measures increase the ability of our new partners in europe to fill their commitments as participants in the csce and to ensure that democratic change is irrevocable they also facilitate further security cooperation within more stable and predictable internatio nal environment8 key provisions of the treaty on open skies objectives the primary objective of the open skies treaty is to reduce the risk of conflict by providing participants with the ability to collect information about the military forces and activities of others in the treaty in particular information derived from open skies flights can contribute to participating states national efforts to address range of military and civil issues these could involve observing known military facilities and largescale force deployments determining the presence but not the detailed composition of major military forces or large possibly militaryrelated construction activities as such open skies flights could contribute to recognizing the scope of excess military preparedness or unusual military activity9 this information can help nation make informed assessments about the military capabilities of its neighbors provide early warning of threatening military activities or conversely information that could dispel concerns about ongoing military activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs4 10 in the arms control context these satellites are known as national technical

see tucker jonathan b back to the future the open skies talks arms control today v 20 october 1990 pp 2123 13 see the prepared statement of michael l moodie in us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing september 22 1992 p 9most observers agree that the open skies treaty will add little to us knowledge of russian military forces and activities and little to russian knowledge of us or nato forces and activities the united states and russia each operate sophisticated observation satellites that can provide information without any cooperation from the other side10 nonetheless many have noted that the observation flights will provide nations who do not have their own satellite systems with way to participate in the data collection and confidencebuilding process as ambassador john hawes the us representative to the conference on open skies noted the treaty offers each of the participat ing states regardless of size or level of technological development the opportunity for direct involvement in the observation of military forces and activities of concern on the territory of other participating states for most of the participating states open skies will provide the first opportunity they have had to acquire this kind of hard information relevant to their security11 provisions governing observation flights territorial coverage the parties to the open skies treaty have agreed to make all of their territory accessible to overflights by unarmed fixed wing aircraft the only limitations on the flights would be those required for reasons of flight safety the united states and its nato allies proposed unrestricted access for open skies observation flights when the negotiations began by the end of the first round of negotiations in february 1990 the east european participants had agreed to this proposal the soviet union on the other hand sought to exclude large areas of its territory from the observation flights for national security reasons it also sought to limit the duration of observation flights and to require that flights over some areas such as nuclear power plants and densely populated urban areas occur at minimum altitude of 10000 feet12 when the negotiations resumed in november 1991 after the failed coup in moscow the soviet union announced that it would accept full territorial coverage if flights over soviet territory were conducted with soviet aircraft carrying soviet sensors13 this would allow soviet officials to confirm that observation aircraft were not carrying unauthorized sensors that could collect sensitive information although the other participants preferred to use their own aircraft in observation flights they accepted this compromise flight distances and airfields according to the treaty to ensure that observation flights cover the entire territory of participating nations each party to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs5 14 open skies aircraft can also land at honolulu international

treaty on open skies briefing center for national security studies alamos national laboratory v 5 july 1994 p 15treaty must specify the location of airfields that observation flights can originate from and the maximum distance that flights from these airfields can travel every part of the participants territory must be accessible to flight that originates from one of the airfields and travels more than the specified maximum distance the united states has designated travis air force base in california elmendorf air force base in alaska dulles international airport outside washington dc and lincoln municipal airport in nebraska as its open skies airfields the maximum distance for flights originating at travis and elmendorf air force bases are 4000 kilometers 2455 miles and 3000 kilometers 1841 miles respectively the maximum distance for flights originating at dulles and lincoln municipal airports are 4900 kilometers 3007 miles and 4800 kilometers 2946 miles respectively travis air force base and dulles international airport will also serve as the points of entry for open skies aircraft and crews that come to the united states for inspections all flights must land at these facilities first even if they plan to conduct their observation flights from other open skies airfields14 time lines the open skies treaty specifies that nation seeking to conduct an observation flight must inform the observed nation of its intentions 72 hours before the observation team arrives at the point of entry dulles or travis afb in the us this notice is designed to ensure that the host country has enough time before the observation begins to suspend any sensitive military exercises or activities that it would not want observed during the flight the observation flight can begin as soon as 24 hours after the observation team arrives in the host country because the host nation will not know precisely which areas will be covered by the observation flight until the team arrives at the point of entry it would not have enough time to conceal large formations or concentrations of military forces in that area the observation flight must also conclude longer than 96 hours after the team arrives at the point of entry this is designed to ensure that the visits do not disrupt exercises or activities in the host country for an undue amount of time mission plans the treaty states that an observation team must present the host with its mission plan when it arrives at the point of entry this document indicates what area of the host nations territory will be covered by the flight it must specify such details as the airfields the flight will use the starting time and duration of the flight the distance the flight will travel and flight plan that specifies the route and altitude for the flight15 the host nation can propose changes to the mission plan for example if weather conditions would affect flight safety but it cannot deny the observation team access to any area of its territory the two parties must agree on plan within 8 hours of the time when the observation team arrives at the point of entryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs6 16 us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 61 17 discussion with air force national security negotiations division october 18 1995 18 there is requirement in the treaty for the actual number of flights conducted by nation to be equal to the number conducted over its territory the actual number of flights will depend on the requests of the other participants if few participants seek flights over continuedthe open skies treaty specifies that open skies observation flights will take precedence over regular air traffic in the air traffic control system if another aircraft plans to fly along the same route at the same time as the open skies aircraft the other aircraft must alter its route this is because change in flight path or altitude of the open skies aircraft could enhance or degrade the sensors operating on the aircraft and therefore undermine the objectives of the observation flight the us federal aviation administration faa has stated that giving precedence to open skies aircraft will pose threat or inconvenience to civil air traffic in the united states16 it frequently gives precedence to specified aircraft such as the presidents airplane air force one without passengers on other aircraft knowing that their altitude or flight path has been altered in addition the air force has concluded formal agreement with the faa that establishes policy for giving precedence to open skies flights according to the air force these policies worked well during numerous open skies training and demonstration flights17 the open skies treaty contains several provisions to ensure that observation flights do not pose an undue burden on the host nation for example nations can be subject to only one observation flight at time this limit precludes both excessive demands on the personnel who must implement the open skies provisions and an unacceptable burden on national air traffic control system when it manages the flights of the aircraft the treaty also specifies that an observation flight can not pass repeatedly over the same spot or circle around single area this precludes efforts to focus too much attention on single facility or military activity annual quotas for observation flights the open skies treaty lists the number of flights that each nation must accept over its territory each year passive quota the passive quota is generally related to the size of nations territory each nation also has an active quota number of flights that it can conduct each year the treaty specifies that nation will be allowed to conduct more flights over other nations territory than it is required to receive over its own territory ie the active quota for nation cannot exceed the passive quota for that nation the open skies consultative commission oscc is charged with allocating the flights among the participating nations ie each year it prepares list that specifies who will conduct flights over whom the treaty states that when the oscc allocates fights nation may conduct more than half of the flights permitted by its active quota over the territory of one single party to the treaty and nation must receive number of observation flights from single nation that equals more than half of the flights required by its passive quota18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs7 18 continued nations territory so that its passive quota is not filled that nation can still conduct the full number of flights permitted by its active quota 19 tucker back to the future the open skies talks p 21 20 us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearings p 40determining passive and active quotas prior to the open skies negotiations analysts in the us defense department and the intelligence community concluded that with sufficient notice the united states could host one observation flight per week without putting sensitive military activities and facilities at risk19 hence when the negotiations began in 1990 the united states indicated that it would be willing to accept 52 observation flights per year over us territory because the soviet union had more than twice the land mass of the united states the united states proposed that the soviet union accept 110 observation flights per year in response the soviet union proposed that each alliance nato and the warsaw pact host 30 flights per year with more than half the flights occurring over any one nation in the alliance when the participants abandoned efforts to devise treaty between the two opposing alliances in late 1990 the united states accepted nato proposal to allocate quotas for observation flights on national basis at that time the united states suggested that the soviet union accept 52 flights per year as the united states was willing to do the soviet union refused but it did raise the number of flights it was willing to receive from 15 to 25 after the abortive coup in moscow in 1991 the soviet union agreed to accept 52 flights per year after the december 1991 demise of the soviet union russia stated that it would accept 40 flights per year based on its relative size compared to the soviet union20 the negotiators reached agreement at 42 flights per year for the united states and russia russia has formed group with belarus so these 42 flights will cover both of those two nations the other participants will receive between 4 and 12 flights per year depending on the size of their territories allocation of observation flights among the parties open skies observation flights will be allocated on an annual basis by the open skies consultative commission oscc each of the parties to the treaty will submit list of the observation flights it wishes to conduct during the coming year if the parties request more flights over particular nation than allowed by that nations passive quota the oscc will divide the number of permitted flights among the requesting parties as result all participants may not be able to conduct all of their requested flights at the same time the treaty permits two or more nations to join together on observation flights and essentially share the passive quota of observed nation this will allow nations to participate in more observation flights without exceeding the passive quota of the observed nation in addition all parties to the open skies treaty can purchase data collected during any nations observation flights hence all nations will have access to information about the other parties military forces and activities even if they do not conduct their own observation flightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs8 21 us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 42passive and active quotas for the united states the open skies treaty gives the united states passive quota and therefore an active quota of 42 observation flights per year these are the maximum number of flights the united states could conduct or receive each year however when nations requested flights for the first year of treaty implementation only one party to the treaty the group of russia and belarus requested flights over the united states and this group requested only 4 flights over the united states the united states submitted request for its maximum permitted number of flights over other parties but it requested flights over many of the same nations that other participants wanted to visit as result when the oscc allocated flights for the first year of treaty implementation the united states received only 8 flights over russia and belarus it will also conduct one flight jointly with canada over ukraine because the oscc will reallocate flights each year that the treaty remains in force the united states may be granted greater number of its requested flights in future years permitted aircraft the open skies treaty specifies that observation flights must be conducted by unarmed fixedwing aircraft these aircraft can be provided by either the observing party or the observed party if the observed party requests to use its own plane the parties cannot use helicopters for their observation flights during the negotiations the united states and nato proposed that the nation conducting the observation flight provide the aircraft for the flight the soviet union on the other hand proposed that the nation hosting the observation flight provide its own aircraft or that all nations rely on the same fleet of dedicated open skies aircraft21 this proposal reflected soviet concerns about the quality of data that could be collected by aircraft using western sensor technologies and soviet concerns about the possible presence of illicit sensors on observation aircraft the participants from eastern europe also sought common pool of aircraft because they did not want to rely on soviet technology for the observation flights the united states and nato argued however that common pool of aircraft would be costly and difficult to maintain nonetheless they agreed that the soviet union could provide its own aircraft for flights over soviet territory in exchange for soviet agreement to open all its territory to observation flights in addition nations can borrow or lease aircraft from other parties to the treaty so that all parties can conduct open skies observation flights even if they cannot afford their own aircraft us aircraft the united states is planning to equip 3 aircraft specifically for open skies observation flights the first is already operational it is based at offut air force base in nebraska and is used to conduct testing and training flights for open skies personnel once the treaty enters into force this aircraft will be used for training flights and as backup aircraft for observation flights the other two aircraft were reached full operational capability during 1996 one by the middle of the year and the second by the end of the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs9 22 us congress senate

cameras with ground resolution of 30 centimeters around 1 foot infrared linescanning devices with ground resolution of 50 centimeters around 20 inches and sidewayslooking synthetic aperture radars sars with ground resolution of 3 meters around 8 feet according to us officials these sensors will be able to recognize major pieces of military equipment this has been characterized for example as the ability to tell the difference between tank and truck this level of capability is not sufficiently detailed to reveal technical information about the major items of equipment nor would it permit identification of particular models of category of equipment in most instances22 the united states and nato initially proposed that the open skies treaty impose restrictions on the capabilities of the open skies sensors with the exception of ban on signals intelligence sensors that could eavesdrop on electronic communications23 the sensors that nato wanted to employ including still and video cameras infrared line scanning devices synthetic aperture radars spectrometers and airsampling devices would have permitted the collection of both photographic data on visible activities and scientific data on activities inside facilities such as the manufacture of chemical agents the soviet union on the other hand wanted the treaty to permit only optical cameras the united states nato and eastern european participants rejected the soviet approach because it would have severely limited the quantity and quality of information collected during the observation flights the soviet union eventually agreed that the participants could use infrared sensors and synthetic aperture radars in exchange nato dropped its proposal for the use of wider variety of sensors24 during the negotiations the participants also disagreed about the resolution that would be permitted on the sensors and determining the level of detail the data would show nato proposed that optical cameras provide ground resolution of 75 centimeters about 3 inches the soviet union suggested 30 centimeters about 1 foot for the synthetic aperture radar25 nato sought resolution of 3 meters about 8 feet the soviet union suggested 10 meters about 30 feet the two sideshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs10 26 us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 41eventually agreed to use the soviet proposal for optical cameras and the nato proposal for sars26 sensor quality the open skies treaty specifies the sensors must be derived from offtheshelf technology available to all the parties this responds to the eastern european nations concerns about being at disadvantage if they had to rely on russian technology for their data collection offtheshelf sensors may collect lower quality of data than the stateoftheart technologies nato had hoped to use at the same time the use of offtheshelf technology made it possible for all nations to share the data collected by any nation during an observation flight the treaty contains provision that allows the parties to approve the use of improved sensors and additional types of sensors on observation flights this provision not only allows the participants to take advantage of technological advances but would allow them to expand the objectives of the treaty into areas such as monitoring air quality for environmental protection the open skies consultative commission would have to approve proposals for new sensors if any participant objected the sensors would not be used the treaty contains several provisions to address concerns about the possible presence of unauthorized sensors on board open skies aircraft first at russian insistence the treaty permits any nation to request that its own aircraft be used for observation flights second the treaty permits the nation hosting the observation flight to fully inspect the observing nations aircraft to ensure that it does not carry covert sensors and to conduct calibration exercises to ensure that sensors do not have capabilities in excess of those permitted by the treaty finally when the nation conducting the observation flight prepares its mission plan it must make sure that the aircrafts altitude throughout the flight when combined with the calibration of the sensors is consistent with the limits on sensor resolution cameras would have better resolution if the aircraft flew closer to the ground treaty participation the original 25 signatories of the open skies treaty include all of the members of nato and the former warsaw pact along with russia ukraine and belarus from the former soviet union the other newly independent states from the former soviet union including the baltic states can join the pact at any time georgia and kyrgyzstan have already done so all other european nations who are members of the organization on security and cooperation in europe can apply to join the treaty during the first six months after the treaty enters into force the open skies treaty also contains provisions to expand beyond europe the united states and canada after the treaty has been in force for six months the open skies consultative commission can consider request

senate gave its consent to ratification of the treaty in august 1993 the united states officially ratified the treaty on november 3 1993 in their reports the three senate committees that reviewed the treaty highlighted several concerns about the costs of implementation and the possible implications for us security all three were concerned about the cost of fleet of three fully equipped aircraft which the department of defense believed it needed to conduct all 42 observation flights each year the committees noted that the united states would collect little new information during these flights and therefore might not need to conduct 42 flights27 the committees also expressed concerns about the addition of new sensors to open skies aircraft they noted that these sensors might not only add to the costs of open skies implementation but might also eventually put us national security at risk28 the senate attached two conditions to its resolution of ratification for the open skies treaty first the senate found that united states interests may not require the utilization of the full quota of allowed observation flights or the procurement of more than one or two observation aircraft29 as result the senate called on the president to submit report after the first year of treaty implementation that reviewed the operation of the treaty and provided an analysis estimating the number of annual observation flights and aircraft that the united states would need for the duration of the treaty second the resolution stated that the president should provide the senate with prompt notification of proposed improvements to open skies sensors and should not provide us approval to the proposed changes until 30 days after the senate received the notification30 this time period would presumably be used to assess the costs of the new sensors and possible implications for us securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs12 31 us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on

three times without reaching consensus but eventually did so and ukraine ratified the treaty on march 2 2000 reports indicate that the delay in these nations can be attributed to their concerns about the cost of implementation each of these nations is facing economic difficulties officials in russia ukraine and belarus have complained about the costs of implementing arms control agreements such as the strategic arms reduction treaty start i and the conventional armed forces in europe treaty cfe the treaty cannot enter into force until russia and belarus approve its ratification planning for

department of defense the department of state and the intelligence community31 this group will address questions about number of issues including the number of observation flights the united states should request over specific nations and the areas of those nations that should be covered by each flight the united states air force and the onsite inspection agency osia which is now part of the defense threat reduction agency will take the lead in implementing open skies observation flights for the united states the air force will own operate and maintain the us open skies aircraft representatives from osia will operate the sensors during us observation flights and participate as escorts and observers in observation flights other nations conduct over us territory open skies aircraft the united states had initially planned to deploy 3 fully operational observation aircraft to support 42 observation flights per year however in response to congressional concerns about the cost of these aircraft the air force now plans to outfit only two aircraft with the full suite of sensors needed to conduct observation flights the third aircraft which is currently conducting testing and training flights for open skies personnel is equipped with only the optical cameras permitted by the treaty it will not be modified to carry the infrared sensor or synthetic aperture radar the united states air force which will operate the open skies aircraft is modifying existing c135 airplanes for the open skies mission similar in size to civilian 707 aircraft these modified oc135

report 1035 pp 170172 million on research and development for new sensors and integration of sensors and aircraft trial and training flights the united states has participated in more than 50 training and trial flights since 1993 crews assigned to the aircraft at offut air force base conduct on average two training flights per month to maintain their proficiency in operating the aircraft us crews have also participated in trial flights to certify that the aircraft and sensors operate in accordance with us and treaty requirements and to support ongoing oscc discussions about procedures that will be used during official observation flights32 the united states has also conducted several flights in cooperation with other parties to the treaty these flights carry participants from both nations and are used to test the procedures for mission planning and mission implementation in june 1998 the united states conducted training flights over ukraine this effort was designed not only to exercise us mission procedures but also to demonstrate these procedures to officials in ukraine in part to show that these procedures would not be too costly or intrusive to implement other treaty signatories have also conducted trial inspection flights for example in june 1995 the german open skies aircraft conducted trial flights over us territory this was the first time that foreign military aircraft had ever had unrestricted access to us airspace33 russia has also conducted training mission over the united states with its aircraft visiting us territory during august 1997 russia also conducted training flight over bulgaria in april 1998 and hosted training flight over russian territory in august 1998 the german crew used russian aircraft for its observation flight in july 1998 germany had announced that it would longer use its own aircraft to participate in open skies flights34 the first aircraft that it modified for this purpose had crashed in 1997 and it suspended plans to modify second aircraft analysts were uncertain as to whether the german decision would affect the ratification and implementation of the open skies treaty when the treaty enters into force the department of defense has estimated that it might cost the united states 2025 million per year to conduct and host observation flights some have estimated that it could cost the united states 2500035000 to host an open skies observation flight and 165000170000 to conduct an observation flight using the us aircraft35 these are primarily the costs of training and employing the personnel needed to operate the aircraft and the sensors and the actual costs of flying the aircrafthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs14 36 this point is made in the report of the senate select committee on

see the prepared statement of thomas karas office of technology assessment in us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 35implications for the united states most analysts and observers agree that the open skies treaty can play valuable role as confidence building measure among the nations of nato and the former warsaw pact at the same time some have questioned us participation in the open skies regime these questions have focused on two key areas the value of the information the united states might collect during open skies observation flights and the cost to us security of the information that others might collect during flights over us territory value of information several analysts and some members of congress have noted that the united states does not need to bear the costs of equipping and operating open skies aircraft to acquire information about the military forces and activities of other nations it already operates expensive photo reconnaissance satellites that serve the same purpose some have proposed therefore that the united states conduct few observation flights and limit its participation in the treaty36 most supporters of the open skies regime have acknowledged that the united states will not acquire much new information during its open skies observation flights nonetheless as ambassador john hawes the us representative to the open skies conference noted during his testimony before the senate foreign relations committee for most of the other participants however the ability to utilize the open skies sensor suite to observe the full territory of the other participating countries will represent new and very significant enhancement in their ability to gather security related information the united states will be major indirect beneficiary of this increase in knowledge confidence and security of the participants37 the treatys supporters have also noted that the united states might acquire information during open skies observation flights that is more useful than satellite data for international relations purposes for example the united states is often wary of releasing satellite photographs that could reveal secret information about us satellite capabilities but similar information acquired during open skies flights could be used in the international arena38 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs15 39 according to brig gen teddy rhinebarger who represented the joint chiefs of staff at the senate hearings the scope of the open skies regime was carefully considered and the overflight access open skies provides does not place sensitive facilities at risk see us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 16 40 see the prepared statement of thomas karas in us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 33 41 the resolution limit of 30 centimeters for optical sensors establishes level of intrusiveness commensurate with the treatys goal of openness and transparency in military forces and activities while effectively safeguarding legitimate national security interests see us congress senate committee on foreign relations treaty on open skies hearing p 44security concerns although most analysts acknowledge that russia like the united states does not need to participate in the open skies treaty to collect information about military forces and activities in the united states some have expressed concerns that nations who currently lack access to satellite data could use open skies observation flights to collect sensitive information about the us military or us industry some have also expressed concern about the possibility that treaty participan ts could transfer information collected during open skies observation flights to others including rogue nations or terrorists who might use the information in planning operations against the united states these concerns would be heightened if the open skies regime allowed the use of more sophisticated sensors or if the treaty were expanded to permit participation by nations who remain hostile to the united states officials from both the bush and clinton administrations insisted during testimony before the senate foreign relations committee that information collected during open skies flights would not place us national security at risk39 number of factors would limit these nations ability to collect sensitive information for example the treaty requires advance notice before flights begin and prohibits flights from circling or returning to specific area repeatedly during the flight40 the advance notice would allow the united states to cease any sensitive activities before an observation flight began the ban on repeat visits during single flight would complicate an observing nations effort to focus extra attention on single facility or military activity us officials have also emphasized that the resolution of sensors permitted by the open skies treaty will not be sufficient to allow the collection of sensitive intelligence about us military forces and activities41 the sensors will lack the capability to identify the capabilities of weapons systems or the types of activities occurring in closed structures in addition information about the size and location of most major military installations in the united states is already available to the public at large because the open skies observation flights would not provide any additional information about activities occurring inside buildings the flights would do little to help those seeking targets for attack in the united states finally it is unlikely that the open skies treaty would expand to include any nation that might use open skies data to threaten current participan t the open skies consultative commission must approve all applications for admission the treaty states that ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs16 any one of the current parties to the treaty objects to an applicant the oscc would have to reject the application conclusion the primary benefits of the open skies treaty will accrue to its european participants these nations will not only be able to acquire information about military forces and activities in neighboring nations they will also be able to collect this information themselves without relying on the observation satellites of other nations some observers believe the united states should limit its participat ion in the open skies regime to reduce the costs of equipping and operating observation aircraft however even if the united states reduces its own participation it must remain willing to host up to 42 observation flights from other countries each year if the first years plans are any indication this should not create an undue burden only russia and belarus showed an interest in conducting flights over us territory and they only requested 4 flights still if the open skies treaty remains in force for many years the united states could host dozens of visits by other participants with foreign military aircraft equipped with sensors flying over us territory virtually all observers agree that these flights will pose security threat to the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30676crs17 table 1 parties to the treaty on
