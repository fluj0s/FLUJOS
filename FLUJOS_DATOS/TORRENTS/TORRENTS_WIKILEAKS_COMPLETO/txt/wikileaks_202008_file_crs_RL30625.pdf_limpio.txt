1989 to present 8 this report has been prepared in consultation with richard f grimmett specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30625armed conflicts in the world since the end of the cold war 1989 present background the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 was the most dramatic signal that the cold war between the worlds two superpowers was coming to an end during the cold war most wars were consider ed an extension of the conflict between the united states and the soviet union however the end of the cold war did not bring the end of armed conflict despite the termination of the cold war nations continue to fight wars both internally and with their neighbors the following tables are listing compiled from several sources see attached source list of post1989 civil and inter state wars including those conflicts that began prior to that date sources differ as to what constitutes war for the purposes of this compilation civil war is conflict contained within the borders of one country where national government military forces were actively involved in fighting the opposing side offered effective resistance and there were at least 1000 combatant casualties an interstate war is military conflict between two entities that are commonly recognized as sovereign states where at least 1000 battle deaths occurred various discrepancies exist among the sources used in this compilation regarding data on casualties onset and termination dates and the nature of some conflicts common definition of war includes conflicts with at least 1000 casualties however reliable casualty figures especially for smaller conflicts often do not exist it is not unusual for different sources to report conflicting casualty figures fixing dates as to when war began or ended is also problematic flareups or resumptions of fighting pose one problem for example renewal of fighting after break in hostilities is sometimes classified as continuation of previous war and at other times as new war in some conflicts the participants disagree about when the conflict is resolved one may claim victory while the other vows to carry on the struggle in some cases delineating between wars where one party is fighting several others is point of disagreement among sources somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30625crs2 sources consider such case to be multiple wars but other sources consider it to be one extended war since most wars include aspects of both civil and interstate conflict definitional problems also extend to classifying wars as either civil or interstate because of these difficulties credible sources often differ in what they include in their listings of current wars in compiling this list the authors loosely followed the definition of civil and interstate wars offered by the university of michigans correlates of war project however when questions arose about conflicts exact identifying characteristics the most expansive estimates were usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30625crs3 wars chronological table 1 civil wars 1989 to present name begin end notes burma 1950 ongoing burmese myanmar gov vs ethnic guerrilla
