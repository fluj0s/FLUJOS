affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division mary beth nikitin analyst in nonproliferation foreign affairs defense and trade division japans nuclear future policy debate prospects and us interests summary japan traditionally one of the most prominent advocates of the international nonproliferation regime has consistently pledged to forswear nuclear weapons nevertheless evolving circumstances in northeast asia particularly north koreas nuclear test in october 2006 and chinas ongoing military modernization drive have raised new questions about japans vulnerability to potential adversaries and therefore the appeal of developing an independent nuclear deterrent the previous taboo within the japanese political community of discussing nuclear weapons capability appears to have been broken as several officials and opinion leaders have urged an open debate on the topic despite these factors strong consensus both in japan and among japan watchers remains that japan will not pursue the nuclear option in the shorttomedium term this paper examines the prospects for japan pursuing nuclear weapons capability by assessing the existing technical infrastructure of its extensive civilian nuclear energy program it explores the range of challenges that japan would have to overcome to transform its current program into military program presently japan appears to lack several of the prerequisites for fullscale nuclear weapons deterrent expertise on bomb design reliable delivery vehicles an intelligence program to protect and conceal assets and sites for nuclear testing in addition range of legal and political restraints on japans development of nuclear weapons including averse public and elite opinion restrictive domestic laws and practices and the negative diplomatic consequences of abandoning its traditional approach is analyzed any reconsideration andor shift of japans policy of nuclear abstention would have significant implications for us policy in east asia in this report an examination of the factors driving japans decisionmaking most prominently the strength of the us security guarantee analyzes how the nuclear debate in japan affects us security interests in the region globally japans withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt would damage the worlds most durable international nonproliferation regime regionally japan going nuclear could set off an arms race with china south korea and taiwan india andor pakistan may then feel compelled to further expand or modernize their own nuclear weapons capabilities bilaterally assuming that japan made the decision without us support the move could indicate lack of trust in the us commitment to defend japan an erosion in the usjapan alliance could upset the geopolitical balance in east asia shift that could strengthen chinas position as an emerging hegemonic power all of these ramifications would likely be deeply destabilizing for the security of the asia pacific

debate prospects and us interests introduction the notion of japan developing nuclear weapons has long been considered far fetched and even taboo particularly within japan hailed as an example of the success of the international nonproliferation regime japan has consistently taken principled stands on nonproliferation and disarmament issues domestically the largely pacifist japanese public with lingering memories of the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki by atomic bombs in the closing days of world war ii has widely rejected any nuclear capacity as morally unacceptable the inclusion of japan under the us nuclear umbrella with regular reiterations from us officials provides guarantor to japanese security successive japanese administrations and commissions have concluded that japan has little to gain and much to lose in terms of its own security if it pursues nuclear weapons capability today japanese officials and experts remain remarkably uniform in their consensus that japan is unlikely to move toward nuclear status in the shortto medium term however as the security environment has shifted significantly the topic is longer toxic and has been broached by several leading politicians north koreas test of nuclear device in 2006 and chinas military modernization have altered the strategic dynamics in the region and any signs of stress in the usjapan alliance raises questions among some about the robustness of the us security guarantee an ascendant hawkish conservative movement some of whom openly advocate for japan to develop an independent nuclear arsenal has gained more traction in japanese politics moving from the margins to more influential position in addition previous securityrelated taboos have been overcome in the past few years the dispatch of japanese military equipment and personnel to iraq and afghanistan the elevation of the japanese defense agency to fullscale ministry and japanese codevelopment of missile defense system with the united states all of these factors together increase the still unlikely possibility that japan will reconsider its position on nuclear weapons any reconsideration of japans policy of nuclear weapons abstention would have significant implications for us policy in east asia globally japans withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt could damage the most durable international nonproliferation regime regionally japan going nuclear could set off nuclear arms race with china south korea and taiwan and in turn india and pakistan may feel compelled to further strengthen their own nuclear weapons capability bilaterally assuming that japan made the decision without us support the move could indicate tokyos lack of trust in the american commitment to defend japan an erosion in the usjapan alliance could upset the geopolitical crs2 balance in east asia shift that could indicate further strengthening of chinas position as an emerging hegemonic power these ramifications would likely be deeply destabilizing for the security of the asia pacific region and beyond background japans postwar policy on nuclear weapons and nonproliferation has been to reject officially military nuclear program the japanese army and navy each conducted nuclear weapons research during world war ii but neither was successful in gaining enough resources for the endeavor1 despite the fact that by the early 1970s japan had already acquired the technical industrial and scientific resources needed to develop its own nuclear weapons japanese policy has repeatedly stated its opposition to the development of nuclear weapons complicating japans antinuclear weapons policy has been postworld war ii dependence on the us nuclear umbrella and security guarantee under the terms of the mutual security assistance pact signed in 1952 and the 1960 treaty of mutual cooperation and security japan grants the us military basing rights on its territory in return for us pledge to protect japans security the rejection of nuclear weapons by the japanese public appears to be overwhelmingly driven by moral rather than pragmatic considerations but japans leaders have based their policy of forswearing nuclear weapons on protection by the us nuclear arsenal the bedrock of domestic law on the subject the atomic energy basic law of 1955 requires japans nuclear activities to be conducted only for peaceful purposes in 1967 the three nonnuclear principles hikaku sangensoku were announced by prime minister eisaku sato enshrining the policy of not possessing not producing and not permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons into japan when japan ratified the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in 1976 it reiterated its three nonnuclear principles placed itself under the treaty obligation as nonnuclear weapons state and pledged not to produce or acquire nuclear weapons japan has been staunch npt supporter in good standing ever since despite multiple reiterations of japans nonnuclear status this orthodoxy has been challenged on several occasions usually when japan has felt strategic vulnerability probably the most prominent episode occurred in the mid1960s china tested nuclear device for the first time in 1964 and the united states was engaged in the vietnam war prime minister eisaku sato secretly commissioned several academics to produce study exploring the costs and benefits of japans possible nuclearization the socalled 196870 internal report2 another secret investigation into japans nuclear option was done by the japan defense agency 1 priority was placed on biological and chemical weapons programs kurt m campbell and tsuyoshi sunohara japan in campbell einhorn reiss eds the nuclear tipping point brookings institution press 2004 and federation of american scientists website httpwwwfasorgnukeguidejapannuke 2 yuri kase the costs and benefits of japans nuclearization an insight into the 196870 internal report the nonproliferation review summer 2001 crs3 jda in 1995 as japan assessed its standing in the new postcold war environment after the 1994 north korean nuclear crisis in 1994 and as the international community was considering the indefinite extension of the npt3 both reports concluded that japan should continue to rely on the us security guarantee and that development of nuclear weapons would threaten that relationship an evolving security environment in asia since the end of the cold war and particularly in the past decade developments in the region have increased japans sense of vulnerability and caused some in the policy community to rethink japans policy of forswearing nuclear weapons development during the cold war the us military presence in japan represented the pacific front of containing the soviets reassuring statement of commitment to japans security to many japanese north koreas test of ballistic missile over japan in august 1998 dispelled the sense of more secure postcold war environment for the archipelago moreover india and pakistan both conducted underground nuclear weapons tests earlier that year which to many undermined the success of the international nonproliferation regime and set off fears of new nuclear arms race japan was particularly alarmed at the tests and instituted freeze on new loans and grants to the two states since then more provocative behavior from pyongyang particularly its 2006 tests of mediumrange missiles and nuclear device have heightened japans fear of potential attacks the nuclear test prompted prominent officials in the ruling party to call for an open debate on whether to pursue nuclear arms both foreign minister taro aso and chairman of the partys policy council called for such debate before later backing off their comments in addition to north koreas activities proposed usindia civilian nuclear deal has led to concern among some japanese non proliferation experts that the npt has weakened further to these experts the legitimacy and deterrent effect of the global nonproliferation regime underpins japans commitment to its own nonnuclear status while north korea represents more immediate danger many defense experts see china as the more serious and longterm threat to japans security4 chinas rapid military modernization and advancements in weapons systems have compounded tokyos concern japanese defense papers have pointed to beijings apparent progress in short and medium range missiles its submarine force some of which have on occasion intruded into japans territorial waters and nuclear force modernization as specific areas of concern as chinese military spending continues to accelerate japanese defense budgets have stagnated although sinojapanese relations appear to have stabilized since period of tension under former prime minister junichiro koizumis administration fundamental distrust and the potential for conflict remains between the pacific powers 3 95 study japan and nukes dont mix the asahi shimbun

japans nuclear energy program japan is country poor in natural resources but with high level of energy consumption since the 1960s japan has relied on nuclear power for significant portion of its energy nuclear energy currently provides 35 of its electricity the japan atomic energy commissions 2005 framework for nuclear energy policy emphasizes the importance of nuclear power for energy independence and carbon emission reduction japan is currently the thirdlargest user of nuclear energy in the world with 55 lightwater nuclear power reactors 4958 million kw operated by 10 electric power companies the first commercial power reactor began operation in 1966 two nuclear power plants are under construction four are in the final stages of regulatory review and an additional seven may be built over the next decade japans policy is to achieve fully independent or closed fuel cycle5 the closed fuel cycle promotes the use of mixedoxide mox fuel in lightwater reactors the set goal is to have 1618 such reactors by fy2010 and utilities in japan are now in the process of being licensed for mox loading and obtaining consent from the local governments the japan atomic energy agency jaea was established on october 1 2005 to integrate japans rd institutes the japan atomic energy research institute and the japan nuclear cycle development institute jaea carries out rd work on the full range of fuel cycle activities two of the more controversial aspects of japans civilian power program are its large stocks of separated plutonium and advanced fuel cycle facilities plutonium is byproduct of the uranium fuel used in all nuclear reactors plutonium in spent fuel is not weaponsusable once this reactorgrade6 plutonium is separated out of spent fuel through reprocessing it is potentially directly usable in nuclear weapons7 this 5 natural uranium ore first passes through the refining conversion enrichment reconversion and fabrication processes before it is fed into the nuclear reactor as metalsheathed fuel following irradiation the spent fuel from the reactor is sent to reprocessing plant where the residual uranium and newly produced plutonium are recovered for reuse as fuel then the plutonium oxide is mixed with uranium oxide at mox fuel conversion plant to produce mixed oxide nuclear fuel mox fuel can then be irradiated just like fresh fuel in nuclear power plant this entire process is called the closed nuclear fuel cycle see httpwwwjapannuclearcomnuclearpowerfuelcyclewhathtml 6 plutonium that contains at least 20 percent of the nonfissile isotopes pu240reactorgrade plutonium is 65 fissile by thermal neutrons compared with 93 fissile for weapon grade material 7 although reactorgrade plutonium has higherrate of spontaneous fission reactions and therefore difficult to use in nuclear weapons it was proven possible in 1962 test see us congress office of technology assessment technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction december 1993 additional information concerning underground nuclear weapon test of reactorgrade plutoniumus department of energy office of public affairs httpswwwostigovopennetdocumentpresspc29htmll and richard l garwin reactorgrade plutonium can be used to make powerful and reliable nuclear weapons continued crs5 separated plutonium can also be recycled into mox fuel for lightwater power reactors france india japan russia and the uk currently all produce reactor fuel through reprocessing the global stockpile of separated plutonium is estimated to be about 500 tons including military and civilian stocks8 stocks of civilian separated plutonium are growing around the world according to the 2005 declared annual inventory under iaea infcirc549 japan possesses 59 mt of civilian stocks of separated plutonium stored in japan and 379 mt of separated plutonium stored outside the country9 this material has the potential to make over 1000 nuclear weapons japans civilian separated plutonium stockpile is expected to grow to 70 tons by 202010 to date japan has sent its spent fuel to the united kingdom sellafield and france hague for reprocessing and mox fuel fabrication but japan is completing facilities which will eliminate the need for such outsourcing the private company japan nuclear fuel limited jnfl has built and is currently running active testing on largescale commercial reprocessing plant at rokkashomura which is expected to begin operating sometime in 2008 its expected capacity is 800tonsyear11 mox fuel fabrication plant currently being built by jnfl at rokkashomura is expected to be completed in october 2012 around 2050 japan plans to shift from mox fuel in light water reactors to using mox fuel in fast breeder reactors12 rd work continues using the prototype monju and joyo fast breeder reactors despite earlier accidents13 final disposal site for high level radioactive waste has not yet been selected japan plans to store and dispose of its nuclear waste domestically14 japan also has uranium enrichment rd facility at tokaimura and is developing an advanced centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at rokkashomura 7 continued august 1998

httpwwwfissilematerialsorg 11 pilot reprocessing plant began fullscale operation in 1981 at the tokai nuclear fuel cycle engineering laboratories 12 fast breeder reactor is fast neutron reactor that produces more plutonium than it consumes which can then be reused as fuel in the reactor thereby creating closed fuel cycle 13 the monju reactors operation was stopped due to sodium leakage accident in the reactors secondary system in 1995 during the course of manufacturing fuel for the joyo reactor level4 criticality accident occurred in september 1999 at fuel conversion facility 14 for more on waste storage in japan see httpwwwjapannuclearcomnuclearpower programwastehtml crs6 the rokkashomura reprocessing facility the first in nonnuclear weapon state has raised some proliferation concerns15 concerns have been raised in particular over the construction of an industrialscale reprocessing facility in japan additionally fast breeder reactors also produce more plutonium than they consume potentially posing proliferation risk some cautionary voices point out that advanced countries have been shifting away from the pursuit of reprocessing technologies as the international community strives to find appropriate multilateral approaches to containing the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies to new countries16 to counteract public concern japan emphasizes transparency in all aspects of its nuclear activities to assure the public and international community that atomic energy is used solely for peaceful purposes all reactor operating electric power utilities in japan are required by law to make public the quantity of plutonium in possession and plutonium use plan each fiscal year all of japans nuclear facilities are subject to iaea fullscope safeguards and an additional protocol to its iaea safeguards agreement came into force in december 1999 the protocol augments the agencys authority to verify that nuclear activities are not diverted to military purposes japan has also been leader in developing advanced safeguards technologies with the iaea and participates in multilateral advanced research efforts for future fuel cycle technologies such as generation iv international forum geniv international project on innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles inpro and the usled global nuclear energy partnership gnep17 technological potential japans technological advancement in the nuclear field combined with its stocks of separated plutonium have contributed to the conventional wisdom that japan could produce nuclear weapons in short period of time in 1994 prime minister tsutomu hata famously told reporters that its certainly the case that japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not made them indeed few dispute that japan could make nuclear weapons if tokyo were to invest the necessary financial and other resources however the ability to develop few nuclear weapons versus the technological financial and manpower requirements of full nuclear deterrent should be considered producing nuclear weapons would require expertise on bomb design including metallurgists and chemists while reliable deterrent capability may also 15 nuclear weapon state as defined by the npt is limited to states that have detonated nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive device before january 1 1967 the united states united kingdom russia france and china are the five nuclear weapon states under the npt all other npt parties are nonnuclear weapon states 16 since japan has been in possession of this technology for decades it does not fall into the category of countries whose access to the technology might be limited in the future see crs report rl34234 managing the nuclear fuel cycle policy implications of expanding global access to nuclear power coordinated by mary beth nikitin 17 httpwwwgen4orgindexhtml httpwwwiaeaorgourworkstnenenp nptdsprojectsinproindexhtml httpwwwgnepenergygov crs7 require reliable delivery vehicles an intelligence program to protect and conceal assets from firststrike and system for the protection of classified information the 1995 jda report stated that japans geography and concentrated populations made the political and economic costs of building the infrastructure for nuclear weapons program exorbitant if one assumes that japan would want weapons with high reliability and accuracy then more time would need to be devoted to their development unless weapon or information was supplied by an outside source as some analysts have pointed out if japan manufactured nuclear warheads then it would need to at the minimum perform one nuclear test but where this could be carried out on the island nation is far from clear18 furthermore japans nuclear materials and facilities are under iaea safeguards making clandestine nuclear weapons program difficult to conceal the rokkashomura reprocessing plant was built in close consultation with the iaea with safeguards systems installed in process lines during construction japan seems to have intentionally built its nuclear program so it would not be ideal for military use in compliance with japanese law japanese legal and political restraints domestic factors public opinion in general public opinion on defense issues in japan appears to be shifting somewhat but pacifist sentiment remains significant in the past japanese public opinion strongly supported the limitations placed on the japanese military but this opposition has softened considerably since the late 1990s despite this overall shifting tide the nuclear allergy among the general public remains strong the devastation of the atomic bombings led japanese society to recoil from any military use of nuclear energy observers say that the japanese public remains overwhelmingly opposed to nuclearization pointing to factors like an educational system that promotes pacifism and the few surviving victims of hiroshima and nagasaki who serve as powerful reminders of the bombs effects while japanese public opinion remains by most accounts firmly antinuclear some social currents could eventually change the conception of nuclear development many observers have recognized trend of growing nationalism in japan particularly among the younger generation some japanese commentators have suggested that this increasing patriotism could jeopardize closer cooperation with the united states if japan feels too reliant on us forces and driven by us priorities some may assert the need for japan to develop its own independent capability another wild card is the likelihood that japan will face major demographic challenge because of its rapidly ageing population such shock could either drive japan closer to the united states because of heightened insecurity or could spur nationalism that may lean toward developing more autonomy 18 tetsuya endo how realistic is nucleararmed japan ajisscommentary 8 july 20 2007 crs8 elite opinions review of recent articles and interviews with prominent japanese opinionmakers and experts revealed nearconsensus of opposition to the development of nuclear weapons19 realistminded security observers cite the danger of threatening china and causing unnecessary instability in the region while foreign policy managers point to the risk of weakening the us alliance some observers claim however that younger generation of upcoming elites may be more nationalistic and therefore potentially more supportive of the option in the future there is some degree of disagreement in japan on if debate itself about whether japan should consider the nuclear option would be valuable exercise some nuclear critics argue that such debate would solidify japans nonnuclear stance by articulating for the public why not possessing nuclear weapons serves the national interest the debate could also reassure those who oppose japans nuclear development others however argue that simply raising the issue would alarm japans neighbors arouse distrust and negatively affect regional security domestically some analysts think that public debate on nuclear weapons would outrage the japanese public making most politicians averse to the proposal constitutional restraints there are several legal factors that could restrict japans ability to develop nuclear weapons the most prominent is article 9 of the japanese constitution drafted by american officials during the postwar occupation that outlaws war as sovereign right of japan and prohibits the right of belligerency however japan maintains wellfunded and wellequipped military for selfdefense purposes and the current interpretation of the constitution would allow in theory the development of nuclear weapons for defensive purposes beginning with prime minister nobusuke kishi in 1957 and continuing through shinzo abe in 2006 japanese administrations have repeatedly asserted that article 9 is not the limiting factor to developing nuclear weapons20 as chief cabinet secretary in 2002 current prime minister yasuo fukuda said that the constitution did not prohibit nuclear weapons adding that depending upon the world situation circumstances and public opinion could require japan to possess nuclear weapons21 1955 atomic energy basic law although the constitution may be interpreted to allow for possession of nuclear weapons since 1955 japanese domestic law prohibited any military purpose for nuclear activities22 its basic policy statement article 2 says the research development and utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes aimed at ensuring safety and performed independently under democratic management the results therefrom shall be made public to contribute to international cooperation this law which also established 19 according to

program three nonnuclear principles japanese leaders have often cited the three nonnuclear principles as another obstacle to japanese development of nuclear weapons the trio consists of japanese pledges not to allow the manufacture possession or importation of nuclear weapons many security experts however point out that the principles passed as diet resolution in 1971 as part of domestic negotiations over the return of okinawa from us control were never formally adopted into law and therefore are not legally binding23 although not technically legal constraint japanese leaders have consistently stated their commitment to the principles including reiteration by prime minister shinzo abe in the aftermath of north koreas nuclear test in 2006 external factors international law japan is obligated under article 2 of the npt not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly or indirectly not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices under article 3 of the npt japan is required to accept iaea fullscope safeguards on its civilian nuclear program japan signed an additional protocol in 1998 under which the iaea can use an expanded range of measures to verify that civilian facilities and materials have not been diverted to military program consequences for civilian nuclear program lacking adequate indigenous uranium supplies japan has bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation agreements with the united states france united kingdom china canada and australia if japanese nuclear program for military purposes were declared or discovered japan would need to return the supplied material to its country of origin japans civilian nuclear energy program which supplies over third of japans energy would then be cut off from world supplies of natural uranium enriched uranium and related equipment the united states most recent nuclear energy cooperation agreement with japan took effect on july 17 1988 article 12 of this agreement states that if either party does not comply with the agreements nonproliferation provisions or violates their iaea safeguards agreement the other party has the right to cease further cooperation terminate the agreement and require the return of any material nuclear material equipment or components transferred or any special fissionable material produced through the use of such items if japan withdrew from the npt it would likely be subject to security councilimposed sanctions and economic and diplomatic isolation penalties under 23 llewelyn hughes why japan will not go nuclear yet international security vol 31 4 spring 2007 crs10 security council resolution could include economic sanctions beyond the nuclear suppliers group cutoff of nuclearrelated supply international diplomatic consequences diplomatically the policy turn about would have profound implications japan has built reputation as leader in nonproliferation and as promoter of nuclear disarmament it has consistently called for safe world free of nuclear weapons on the earliest possible date japan submits resolution to the general assemblys first committee each year on nuclearfree world and submits working papers to the npt review conferences and preparatory committees on disarmament it has been vocal advocate for iaea verification and compliance and was the first to respond with sanctions to nuclear tests in south asia and north korea it has been constant voice in support of nuclear disarmament in international fora an aboutface on its nonnuclear weapon state status would dramatically change the global view of japan or might dramatically change the perception of nuclear weapons possession in the world this move could have profound implications for nuclear proliferation elsewhere perhaps leading to additional npt withdrawals acquiring nuclear weapons could also hurt japans longterm goal of permanent membership on the security council issues for us policy us security commitment perhaps the single most important factor to date in dissuading tokyo from developing nuclear arsenal is the us guarantee to protect japans security since the threat of nuclear attack developed during the cold war japan has been included under the us nuclear umbrella although some ambiguity exists about whether the united states is committed to respond with nuclear weapons in the event of nuclear attack on japan24 us officials have hinted that it would following north koreas 2006 nuclear test secretary of state condoleezza rice in tokyo said the united states has the will and the capability to meet the full range and i underscore full range of its deterrent and security commitments to japan25 during the cold war the threat of mutually assured destruction to the united states and the soviet union created sort of perverse stability in international politics japan as the major pacific front of the us containment strategy felt confident in us extended deterrence although the united states has reiterated its commitment to defend japan the strategic stakes have changed leading some in japan to question the american pledge some in japan are nervous that if the united states develops closer relationship with china the gap between tokyos and washingtons security perspectives will grow and further weaken the us commitment26 these critics also point to what they perceive as the soft negotiating position on north koreas denuclearization in the sixparty talks as further evidence 24 hajime izumi and katsuhisa furukawa not going nuclear japans response to north koreas nuclear test nautilus institute policy forum online july 19 2007 25 us is japans nuclear shield rice says angeles times october 19 2006 26 brad glosserman japan peers into the abyss pacnet newsletter 20 march 20 2008 crs11 that the united states does not share japans strategic perspective27 weakening of the bilateral alliance may strengthen the hand of those that want to explore the possibility of japan developing its own deterrence despite these concerns many longtime observers assert that the alliance is fundamentally sound from years of cooperation and strong defense ties throughout even the rocky trade wars of the 1980s perhaps more importantly chinas rising stature likely means that the united states will want to keep its military presence in the region in place and japan is the major readiness platform for the us military in east asia if the united states continues to see the alliance with japan as fundamental component of its presence in the pacific us leaders may need to continue to not only restate the us commitment to defend japan but to engage in highlevel consultation with japanese leaders in order to allay concerns of alliance drift congressional leaders could face pressure to reconsider allowing the sale of the f22 raptor aircraft in order to bolster trust in the alliance28 us behavior plays an outsized role in determining japans strategic calculations particularly in any debate on developing nuclear weapons security experts concerned about japans nuclear option have stressed that us officials or influential commentators should not signal to the japanese any tacit approval of nuclearization29 threatening other countries with the possibility of japan going nuclear for example could be construed as approval by some quarters in tokyo usjapanese joint development of theater missile defense system reinforces the us security commitment to japan both psychologically and practically the testlaunch of several missiles by north korea in july 2006 accelerated existing plans to jointly deploy patriot advanced capability 3 pac3 surfacetoair interceptors as well as seabased system on aegis destroyers if successfully operationalized confidence in the ability to intercept incoming missiles may help assuage japans fear of foreign attacks this reassurance may discourage any potential consideration of developing deterrent nuclear force in addition the joint effort would more closely intertwine us and japan security although obstacles still remain for seamless integration30 27 brad glosserman

kurt campbell and tsuyoshi sunohara japan thinking the unthinkable the nuclear tipping point 2004 30 the principle of collective selfdefense raises questions about how closely the united states and japan can integrate missile defense cooperation the term comes from article 51 of the charter which provides that member nations may exercise the rights of both individual and collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs the japanese government maintains that japan has the sovereign right to engage in collective selfdefense but 1960 decision by the cabinet legislation bureau interpreted the constitution to forbid collective actions because it would require considering the defense of other countries not just the safety of japan itself the ban on collective selfdefense raises questions about how continued crs12 potential for asian arms race to many security experts the most alarming possible consequence of japanese decision to develop nuclear weapons would be the development of regional arms race31 the fear is based on the belief that nucleararmed japan could compel south korea to develop its own program encourage china to increase andor improve its relatively small arsenal and possibly inspire taiwan to pursue nuclear weapons this in turn might have spillover effects on the already nucleararmed india and pakistan the prospect or even reality of several nuclear states rising in region that is already rife with historical grievances and contemporary tension could be deeply destabilizing the counter argument made by some security experts is that nuclear deterrence was stabilizing during the cold war and similar nuclear balance could be achieved in asia however most observers maintain that the risks outweigh potential stabilizing factors uschina relations the course of the relationship between beijing and washington over the next several years is likely to have significant impact on the nuclearization debate in japan if the relationship chills substantially and cold wartype standoff develops there may be calls from some in the united states to reinforce the us deterrent forces some hawkish us commentators have called for japan to be unleashed in order to counter chinas strength32 depending on the severity of the perceived threat from china japanese and us officials could reconsider their views on japans nonnuclear status geopolitical calculations likely would have to shift considerably for this scenario to gain currency on the other hand if ussino relations become much closer japan may feel that it needs to develop more independent defense posture this is particularly true if the united states and china engaged in any bilateral strategic or nuclear consultations33 despite improved relations today distrust between beijing and tokyo remains strong and many in japans defense community view chinas rapidly modernizing military as their primary threat future of the korean peninsula any eventual reunification of the korean peninsula could further induce japan to reconsider its nuclear stance if the two koreas unify while north korea still holds nuclear weapons and the new state opts to keep nuclear arsenal japan may face different calculation indeed some 30 continued japanese commanders will gauge whether american forces or japan itself is being targeted under the current interpretation japanese forces could not legally respond if the united states were attacked 31 masahiro matsumura prudence and realism in japans nuclear options brookings institution website january 16 2008 32 see richard lowry

analysts have claimed that nucleararmed reunified korea would be more of threat than nucleararmed north korea such nuclear decision would depend on variety of factors the political orientation of the new country its relationship with the united states and how reunified government approached its historically difficult ties with japan although south korea and japan normalized relations in 1965 many koreans harbor resentment of japans harsh colonial rule of the peninsula from 19101945 if the closely neighboring koreans exhibited hostility toward japan it may feel more compelled to develop nuclear weapons capability the united states is likely to be involved in any possible korean unification because of its military alliance with south korea and its leading role in the sixparty talks us contingency planning for future scenarios on the korean peninsula should take into account japans calculus with regard to nuclear weapon development japans international reputation if japan decided to go nuclear its international reputation as principled advocate for nonproliferation would erode many observers say this would rule out japans ambition of eventually holding seat on the united nations security council japan of course would bear the brunt of these consequences but it could be harmful to us interests as well japan is generally viewed overwhelmingly positively by the international community and its support for usled international issues can lend credibility and legitimacy to efforts such as democracy promotion peacekeeping missions environmental cooperation and multilateral defense exercises to name few damage to global nonproliferation regime japans development of its own nuclear arsenal could also have damaging impact on us nonproliferation policy it would be more difficult for the united states to convince nonnuclear weapon states to keep their nonnuclear status or to persuade countries such as north korea to give up their weapons programs the damage to the
