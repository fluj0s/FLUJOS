army corps of engineers primer nicole t carter analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division betsy cody specialist in natural resources policy resources science and industry division summary at the direction of congress primarily through water resources development acts wrdas the us army corps of engineers an agency within the department of defense undertakes water resources projects the agencys civil works mission has expanded beyond its original responsibility of improving and maintaining navigable channels the mission now includes flood control emergency and disaster response environmental restoration municipal water infrastructure and other activities the non federal sponsors and the federal government primarily through the annual energy and water development appropriations acts share the cost of most corps projects and activities this report outlines the agencys organization project development process civil works appropriations and evolution of its responsibilities corps of engineers and its civil works program the us army corps of engineers corps is an agency in the department of defense that has military and civilian responsibilities the military program provides engineering construction and environmental management services for department of defense agencies under its civil works program at the direction of congress the corps plans constructs operates and maintains wide range of water resources projects military chief of engineers oversees the corps civil and military operations and reports on civil works matters to an assistant secretary of the army for civil works the corps operates as military organization with largely civilian workforce 34600 civilian and 650 military personnel nine divisions coordinate projects in field offices worldwide congressional research service the library of congress crs2 and 41 district offices1 projects are largely planned at the district level and approved at the division and headquarters levels the corps oldest civil responsibilities are creating navigable channels and flood control projects navigation projects include river deepening channel widening lock expansion dam operations and dredged material disposal flood control projects are intended to reduce riverine and coastal storm damage these projects range from levees and floodwalls to dams and river channelization many navigation and flood control projects are multipurpose that is they provide water supply recreation and hydropower in addition to navigation or flood control in recent decades congress has given the corps responsibilities in the areas of environmental restoration and infrastructure and other nontraditional activities such as disaster relief and remediation of formerly used nuclear sites environmental restoration activities involve wetlands restoration and environmental mitigation activities for corps facilities environmental infrastructure refers to municipal water and wastewater facilities the agencys regulatory responsibility for navigable waters extends to issuing permits for private actions that might affect wetlands and other waters of the united states2 the economic and environmental impact of corps projects and the agencys regulatory activities can be significant locally and regionally and at times are quite controversial project development process the corps currently follows twophase planning process that is intended to determine if water resources project warrants federal investment and inform congressional authorization decisions project development is directed by agency guidance and the principles and guidelines for water and related resources implementation studies pg the pg were prepared by the water resources council wrc in 1983 to guide federal water resource development3 projects generally originate from community eg citizens or businesses or local government entity requesting assistance with water resource need that is beyond its capability to alleviate the corps generally requires two types of congressional authority to initiate study study authorization then appropriations4 study authority allows the corps to 1 division and district maps available at httpwwwusacearmymildivdistmaphtml 2 sections 10 and 13 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899 22 usc 407 require that permit be obtained from the corps for alteration or obstruction of and refuse discharge in us navigable water the corps also has regulatory responsibilities under other laws notably section 404 of the clean water act 33 usc 1344 since the mid1960s court decisions and administrative actions have altered the jurisdictional reach of the corps regulatory program 3 wrc was established pursuant to the 1965 water resources planning act 42 usc 1962b2 it is currently dormant due to lack of funding 4 technical assistance and some small projects can be conducted without obtaining project specific authorization or appropriations through the corps programmatic authorizations known as continuing authorities programs these projects of limited size that have defined scope consistent with one of the programmatic authorization can be performed at the corps discretion based on the availability of program funds the authorized programs include activities for beach continued crs3 investigate problem and determine if there is federal interest in proceeding further if the corps has performed study in the geographic area before new study can be authorized by resolution known commonly as survey resolution of either the house transportation and infrastructure committee or the senate environment and public works committee if the corps has not previously investigated the area the study needs to be authorized in an act of congress typically water resources development act wrda which often are considered biennially5 the majority of corps studies are currently authorized by survey resolutions once authorized appropriations for corps studies are sought through the annual energy and water development appropriations acts the objective of corps studies is to guide the decision to authorize corps project for construction early in the study process the corps assesses the level of interest and support of nonfederal entities that may be potential sponsors nonfederal sponsors generally are state tribal county or local agencies eg levee district or governments that join the corps in the effort based on the results of the study the chief of engineers may sign final recommendation on the project known as the chiefs report in recent years congress has used favorable chiefs report as the basis for authorizing projects once authorized federal funds for project construction can be sought through the annual energy and water development appropriations bills for more information on the phases of the project development process see crs report rl32064 army corps of engineers water resources activities authorization and appropriations by nicole t carter project costsharing how to allocate the cost of corps projects among nonfederal sponsors and the federal government has been debated for decades wrda 1986 significantly increased local costshare requirements some subsequent wrdas made further adjustments in costsharing6 under current requirements reconnaissance studies are entirely federal expense local sponsors pay 50 of the cost for feasibility studies except for inland waterways 100 federal responsibility7 the division of federal and nonfederal financial responsibilities for construction and operation and maintenance om vary by project purpose as shown in table 1 in most cases costsharing for preconstruction planning and engineering is determined using the construction requirements in table 1 4 continued erosion navigation flood control streambank and shoreline protection snagging and clearing modifications to existing projects for the benefit of the environment and ecosystem restoration 5 these acts are commonly distinguished from each other by including reference to the year of enactment for example wrda 1986 refers to the act passed in 1986 6 in addition to authorizing planning and construction projects congress uses wrda to establish policies for the corps civil works projects such as costsharing requirements 7 local costsharing for the feasibility phase is not required for studies of navigation improvements to the inland waterway system see 33 usc 2215 a2 crs4 table 1 costshare requirements for corps projects project purpose maximum maximum federal share

percentages reflect that the nonfederal sponsors pay 10 of the cost of the general navigation features of the project over period not to exceed 30 years 50 is paid by federal appropriations and 50 by the inland waterway trust fund for the 17 western states where reclamation law applies irrigation costs are funded by the corps but ultimately repaid by nonfederal users civil works appropriations congress provides federal appropriations to the corps primarily for specific projects rather than through programmatic authorizations8 fiscal priorities and public attitudes in recent decades have produced decline in federal funding for water resources 8 in addition to the activities that the corps performs using appropriations that it receives through direct federal appropriations the corps performs reimbursable work for department of defense agencies other federal agencies eg us environmental protection agency local governments tribes us territories foreign governments and international organizations in fy2002 this work totaled 953 million more information on the interagency and international program of the corps is available at httpwwwhqusacearmymilcempcniishmpghtm crs5 development projects generally for example from the mid1970s to the mid2000s the annual funding for the corps construction account fell from an average of 45 billion to 18 billion in 2004 dollars9 another measure of the decreased emphasis on water resources development is that the agencys civil works budget fell from more than 1 of federal discretionary spending in the mid1970s to between 06 and 05 since 200010 funding for the civil works program has often been contentious issue between the administration and congress with final appropriations typically providing more funding than requested regardless of which political party controls the white house and congress the corps generally maintains strong congressional support because of the direct water resource benefits and indirect economic and political benefits of its projects evolution of civil works mission navigation and flood control 18021950s in the 19th century the corps mission evolved into civil and military building for the nation in 1824 congress passed legislation using military engineers for planning roads and canals to move goods and people in 1850 congress directed the corps to engage in its first planning exercise flood control for the lower mississippi river the modern era of federal flood control emerged with the flood control act of 1936 pl 74738 which declared flood control as proper federal activity and in the national interest during the 1920s congress expanded the corps ability to incorporate hydropower into multipurpose projects and authorized the agency to undertake comprehensive surveys to establish riverbasin development plans the 1944 flood control act 33 usc 708 significantly augmented the corps involvement in large multipurpose projects the flood control act of 1950 33 usc 701n began the corps emergency operations through authorization for flood preparedness and emergency operations11 the water supply act of 1958 43 usc 390b gave the corps authority to include storage for municipal and industrial water supply in reservoir projects at 100 local cost changing priorities 19601986 by the late 1960s construction of major water works had declined changing national priorities and local needs increasing construction costs and completed projects at most prime locations decreased the attractiveness of water projects water supply for traditional offstream uses such as domestic commercial industrial and agricultural uses was increasingly in direct competition with instream uses such as recreation fisheries and wildlife habitat from 1970 to 1985 congress authorized major water projects scaled back several authorized projects and passed laws that altered project operations and water delivery programs to protect the environment the 1970s marked transformation in corps project planning the1969 national environmental policy act and the endangered species act of 1973 16 usc 9 crs updated information provided by the corps to senator voinovich at his request available

activities are also conducted under the disaster relief act of 1974 42 usc 5121 also known as the stafford disaster and emergency assistance act crs6 1531 required the corps to consider environmental impacts increase public participation in planning and consult with other federal agencies executive orders eo 11988 and eo 11990 united the goals of reducing flood losses and environmental damage by recognizing the value of wetlands and required federal agencies to evaluate potential effects of actions on flood plains and to minimize impacts on wetlands environmental mission and local responsibility 1986present congress fundamentally transformed the ground rules for corps water project planning and funding through wrda 1986 33 usc 2211 by establishing new costshare formulas resulting in greater financial and decisionmaking roles for local stakeholders wrda 1986 reestablished the tradition of biennial omnibus authorization bill congress has since enacted wrdas in 1988 1990 1992 1996 1999 and 2000 wrda 1986 also provided the corps with authority to determine if changes can be made in existing structures or operations to improve environmental quality wrda 1990 33 usc 1252 2316 explicitly expanded the corps mission to include environmental protection and increased the corps responsibility for contamination cleanup dredged material disposal and hazardous waste management wrda 1992 33 usc 2326 authorized the corps to use the spoils from dredging in implementing projects for protecting restoring and creating aquatic and ecologicallyrelated habitats including wetlands wrda 1996 33 usc 2330 gave the corps the authority to undertake aquatic ecosystem restoration projects while the corps has been involved with numerous environmental restoration projects in recent years wrda 2000 approved restoration program for the florida everglades that represented the agencys first multiyear multi billion dollar effort of this type these legislative changes have given the corps environmental responsibility beyond its traditional water resources development projects for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20866
