garrett l hatch analyst in government organization and management government and finance division the federal funding accountability and transparency act implementation and proposed amendments summary on september 26 2006 president bush signed the federal funding accountability and transparency act ffata into law pl 109282 in an attempt to expand oversight of federal spending including earmarks the new law required the office of management and budget omb to establish publicly available online website that provides access to information about entities that are awarded federal grants loans contracts and other forms of assistance federal agencies award over 880 billion dollars annually in three of the primary categories of financial assistance that are included in the database 470 billion in grants 381 billion in contracts and 29 billion in direct loans the ffata was endorsed by leaders of both parties and an array of business union and watchdog organizations omb launched the ffatamandated website usaspendinggov on december 13 2007 while the website has been praised as step toward worthy objective enhancing the transparency of government expenditures government officials and members of the public have expressed concern that issues surrounding its implementation have not been adequately addressed in particular many observers question the reliability of information taken from the federal assistance award data system faads and the federal procurement data system next generation fpdsng which are important sources of information for usaspendinggov they note that information in faads and fpds is often incomplete and inaccurate and therefore might limit transparency some observers also believe that the cost of establishing and maintaining the new website might grow as agencies seek to improve data quality and collect new information on subawards this report initially discusses the background of the ffata it then discusses the acts provisions noting what types of assistance are part of the new website the primary sources of the data and deadlines for implementation the report then identifies and discusses issues that have been raised regarding the act that might affect its implementation finally it examines legislation proposed in the 110th congress s 3077 that would significantly expand the information accessible through usaspendinggov this report

proposed amendments on september 26 2006 president bush signed into law s 2590 the federal funding accountability and transparency act ffata pl 1092821 according to supporters of the new law the ffata was an attempt to reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending by the federal government including spending on funds earmarked for special projects2 to that end the legislation required the office of management and budget omb to establish publicly available website that would allow users to search for detailed information about entities that are awarded federal grants loans contracts and other forms of assistance using the website supporters asserted citizen or watchdog group would be able to easily determine how much money was given to which organizations and for what purposes3 the premise of the legislation was that by making the details of federal spending available to the public government officials would be less likely to fund projects that might be perceived as wasteful supporters of the legislation also suggested that the website would give citizens the opportunity to better understand how the government distributes funds and enable the public to become more involved in the discussion of federal spending priorities4 three of the primary categories of federal expenditures and obligations to be included in the database federal grants loans and contracts represent significant element of federal spending according to the most recently published consolidated federal funds report cffr federal agencies award over 880 billion in those three categories of financial assistance alone 470 billion in grants 381 1 the white house office of the press secretary president bush signs federal funding accountability and transparency act press release sept 26 2006 available

the report then identifies and discusses issues that have been raised regarding the act that might affect its implementation finally it examines legislation proposed in the 110th congress that would significantly expand the information accessible through usaspendinggov background s 2590 received extensive bipartisan support at each stage of the legislative process in the senate the bill was introduced with bipartisan sponsors voted unanimously out of committee and passed by unanimous consent on april 6 2006 the legislation was ultimately cosponsored by 47 senators including thenmajority leader bill frist and thenminority leader harry reid in the house s 2590 was passed by voice vote on september 13 with members of both parties speaking in support of the senate bill and none speaking against it6 the white house did not issue statement of administrative policy on s 2590 but president bush did express his support in press release distributed the same day the bill was enrolled making it apparent he would sign the measure once he received it7 as noted previously the president signed s 2590 on september 26 2006 according to senator tom coburn the bills original sponsor s 2590 was endorsed by over 150 organizations with wide range of political leanings8 the senators list of supporters included representatives of private enterprise such as the us chamber of commerce unions like

traditional values coalition overview of the act the website required in the act was to be implemented in two phases by january 1 2008 the new website was required to provide access to information on entities that were awarded funds directly from the federal government entities covered in the first phase of implementation include corporations associations partnerships sole proprietorships limited liability companies limited liability partnerships states and localities by january 1 2009 by law the website must include access to information on subgrantees and subcontractors that receive federal funds through primary award recipient the act excluded individual recipients of federal assistance and organizations with less than 300000 in total income were not required to report on subawards9 consistent with the objective of providing to the public comprehensive information on federal financial assistance virtually all categories of awards are ultimately to be covered by the database including grants contracts subgrants subcontracts and loans two special provisions addressed particular types of transactions individual transactions of less than 25000 are exempt and credit card transactions were excluded until october 1 2008 to achieve greater transparency the act required the website to provide the following information about each federal award name of entity receiving award amount of award type of award eg grant loan contract agency funding award north american industry classification system naics code for contracts or catalog of federal domestic assistance cfda number for grants and loans10 9 entities with less than 300000 might be required to report on subawards in the future if the director of omb determines this requirement is not unduly burdensome to those entities 10 the census bureau assigns an naics code to each business establishment for the purposes of collecting and analyzing statistical data on the us economy naics codes are two to six digits long with each digit representing information about the economic sector in which the establishment conducts the largest portion of its business cfda numbers are assigned by the general services administration gsa to all federal domestic assistance programs including grants and loans cfda number usually has five digits where the first two digits represent the federal agency and the last three digits indicate the specific continued crs4 program source award title that describes the purpose of the funding location of recipient city state congressional district and country in which award performance primarily takes place unique identifier for entity receiving award and of the parent entity of recipient if one exists any other information specified by omb the act required that the website permit users to 1 conduct search of federal funding by any of the data elements listed above and 2 determine the total amount of federal funding awarded to an entity by fiscal year in addition the act stipulated that the website must provide information in downloadable format and that agencies must post new information to the website within 30 days of making an award three major financial assistance databases were identified in the act as likely sources of information for the new website the federal procurement data system next generation fpdsng the federal assistance award data system faads and grantsgov11 according to the act user must be able to access information from these databases directly through the website the act was explicit on this point it was not acceptable merely to provide links to these or other databases because that would force users to search for information at different websites as previously noted the act did not require information on subcontractors and subgrantees to be included in the database until january 1 2009 the delay reflected the fact that information on subrecipients was not collected consistently across federal agencies and programs to address existing gaps in the data on subawards the act required omb to implement pilot program that tested the feasibility of having primary recipients provide information on their subgrantees and subcontractors there was provision in the legislation that allowed federal award recipients and subrecipients to be reimbursed for the costs associated with collecting and reporting data on subrecipients the act also specified that any requirements for collecting data on subawards made by state and local governments under block and formula grants be costeffective according to the congressional budget office 10 continued program for which the agency is providing funding 11 the federal procurement data systemnext generation fpdsng is database of federal contracts maintained by gsa and the federal assistance award data system is database of federal grants maintained by the census bureau grantsgov is part of the government initiative and it permits grant seekers to find apply for and manage federal grants through single web portal all entities that apply for federal assistance through grantsgov are assigned unique identifier known as data universal numbering system duns number complex entities such as state or local governments might have multiple duns numbers making it difficult at times to link subunits to the parent entity crs5 cbo unfunded mandate would be placed on recipients or subrecipients for complying with the act12 the act also required omb to submit an annual report to the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform the report must include data on public usage of the website an assessment of the reporting burden on federal award and subaward recipients and an explanation of any extension of the subaward reporting deadline implementation issues reliability of underlying data database of the breadth and depth contemplated by the ffata is only as useful as the quality of the information it contains as noted previously the act referred to three existing databases as likely sources of information for the new public database faads fpdsng and grantsgov usaspendinggov draws extensively from faads and fpdsng but it is unclear whether data from grantsgov is also incorporated number of observers have expressed concern about relying on information from faads and fpdsng both government officials and knowledgeable members of the public describe significant weaknesses in the databases such as incomplete and inaccurate information that cannot be quickly corrected these observers suggest that substantial changes in the collection reporting and verification of information relating to federal assistance awards would likely be necessary before faads and fpdsng might be considered reliable sources of information in 2005 report gao noted that fpdsng users lacked confidence in the data provided largely because there was rigorous system in place to ensure the data were accurate and complete13 in 2006 panel of procurement experts attempted to use fpdsng in their evaluation of federal contracting operations but reportedly found so many errors in the data that the chairman declared that fpdsng is not reliable database14 one reason the data are inaccurate is human error contract information might be incorrectly entered into fpdsng by inexperienced users who have received minimal training15 moreover agencies might vary in the degree to which they fill out the fields in the database resulting in data of uneven quality in one instance fpdsng users reportedly complained that the database failed to consistently identify contracts related to hurricane katrina recovery efforts that were 12 us congressional budget office s 2590 federal funding accountability

and gaps in fpds ng data are now evident in usaspendinggov january 2008 editorial stated that the new database might not provide information on whether 70 billion in fy2007 contracts was awarded with or without competition17 similar problems have been reported with faads the governments primary source of grant award information in 2006 report gao reviewed 86 federally funded grant programs and determined that in the majority of cases the administering agencies provided data incomplete data or inaccurate data to faads over threeyear period18 the report concluded that these problems occurred because 1 the census bureau lacked the resources to ensure agencies were submitting accurate and timely data 2 agency program officials lacked knowledge of faads reporting requirements and 3 agencies had not implemented sufficient oversight to ensure they were submitting accurate data census bureau official concurred with these findings adding that number of data elements required by the ffata are not uniformly captured by federal agencies or grant award recipients such as information on subrecipients and the congressional district in which federal funds are spent19 the official also noted that agencies are currently required to update their information in faads on quarterly basis so it might take time for agencies to develop the capability to update faads within 30 days of making an award as the ffata requires some members of congress have also expressed concerns about fpdsng and faads during floor debate of the bill in the house one supporter cautioned that the ffatas potential to improve oversight of federal funds while substantial would be largely determined by the degree to which improvements in fpdsng and faads were made during implementation20 another supporter expressed concern that the problems with fpdsng and faads were so significant that if the administration is not committed to making this legislation work all we will get is another incomplete and hardtouse

later that same month omb issued memorandum to the presidents management council highlevel policy task force comprising agency chief operating officers that identified the specific data elements that agencies must report and the time frames in which the data are to be submitted to meet the requirements of the ffata23 on november 9 2007 omb issued its most comprehensive memorandum on data submission requirements under the ffata24 this memorandum required agencies to submit plan to omb by december 1 2007 that identified gaps in their data on grants contracts and loans and outlined their plans to address any deficiencies in addition it required agencies to implement internal controls to ensure the accuracy integrity and timeliness of their submissions the reliability of agency data submissions remains concern less than three months after the launch of usaspendinggov in december 2007 omb criticized the quality of the data that agencies were providing in memorandum dated march 6 2008 omb called on agencies to redouble the efforts to improve data quality as much of the data submitted for posting to the usaspendinggov in the past has been incomplete untimely and inaccurate review of the website on october 3 2008 more than two years after the ffata was enacted bears out this assessment with regard to timeliness of data the ffata requires award information to be posted to the website not more than 30 days after the award is made the contract data available october 3 however had not been updated in six weeks while grant and loan updates ranged from august 2008 to august 2007 meaning some agencies had not updated their assistance award data in over year25 the lack of timely information may result in significant gaps in award data on usaspendinggov for example on october 3 2008 the website provided fy2007 and fy2008 assistance data for two agencies the department of homeland security dhs and the small business administration sba which had combined assistance outlays in fy2006 of over 750 billion if assistance outlays at those two agencies were at similar levels for fy2007 and fy2008 then usaspendinggov may be missing data for as much as 15 trillion in assistance awards just for dhs and sba 22 memorandum from paul dennet omb administrator to chief acquisition officers federal procurement data verification and validation nov 9 2007 at

guidance on data submission under the federal funding accountability and transparency act nov 9 2007 25 the agencies that had not updated their assistance award information in over year were the department of homeland security the department of transportation the small business administration the office of personnel management the nuclear regulatory commission and the department of the treasury crs8 even when agencies did submit fy2007 or fy2008 data it often appeared to be incomplete on october 3 2008 usaspendinggov showed that the social security administration ssa reported 5399 billion in assistance outlays for fy2006 but only 38 million in fy2007 similarly the website showed that the department of agriculture reported assistance outlays of 1470 billion for fy2006 but only 247 billion for fy2007 the department of housing and urban development hud reported 1003 billion in assistance outlays in fy2006 but nothing for fy2007 here again it appears that data on hundreds of billions of dollars in assistance awards are not available on usaspendinggov as mandated by the ffata implementation costs concerns have been expressed regarding the cost of implementing usaspendinggov two types of costs are at issue the costs of implementing the act as whole and the costs associated with the development of information on subawards overall implementation costs it is not known how much the initial implementation of usaspendinggov has cost there is publicly available estimate for example of the dollar value of the time it has taken federal agency employees to collect validate and submit award information it is also not known whether agencies have had to modify their internal data collection systems to obtain information not previously collected implementation costs may not be distributed evenly across agencies agencies that have reported little or information for fy2007 or fy2008 may have found that they are further behind other agencies in terms of their ability to obtain the required assistance award data and may have to invest more resources to meet the ffatas reporting provisions prior to enactment cbo estimated that the ffata would cost 15 million to establish and maintain the new database of federal assistance between 2007 and 201126 the cbo estimate however was based on ombs assurance that the government currently collects all of the information needed to create comprehensive database on federal spending27 the estimate might thus reflect the cost of simply combining existing systems without fully accounting for other costs associated with improving the quality of the data in those systems one expert familiar with fpdsng and faads said that an enormous amount of data cleanup will be necessary to correct inaccurate information in those systems28 another industry observer was quoted as saying that enhancing and integrating existing data 26 us congressional budget office s 2590 federal funding accountability and

million projected by cbo29 subaward information costs prior to enactment of the ffata the national association of state auditors comptrollers and treasurers nasact expressed strong reservations about the potential financial and administrative burden that the proposed reporting requirements would impose on state and local governments30 in particular nasact noted that collecting data on subgrantees would be very very costly for state and local governments since federal grant funds are often passed down multiple levels eg state receiving federal assistance gives subgrant to organization which in turn gives subgrant to organization b additional costs might be incurred under the bill nasact said if state and local grant recipients were required to modify their financial systems to collect and report any other new information after s 2590 was amended to include the pilot program for collecting information on subgrantees nasact said it supported the bill with the new language but also noted that it still believed obtaining all the required information will be challenge31 some trade groups have made similar arguments regarding the cost of collecting subcontractor information the council of defense and space industry associations codsia for example has reportedly stated that prime contractors do not normally collect subcontractor information at the level of detail required by the ffata and that doing so would become significant administrative burden on both contractors and subcontractors32 the subaward reporting pilot program mandated by the ffata was intended to identify the least burdensome and most costeffective method for collecting and reporting data on subawards information from the pilot program is available yet however as it did not commence until october 8 2008 more than year beyond the statutory deadline of july 1 200733 explanation for the delay has been provided after the pilot program is complete it may provide sense of the costs 29 jenny mandel omb says

policy committee gpc of the chief financial officers council cfoc is overseeing implementation of the subaward pilot program at sept 16 2008 conference hosted by the national grants partnership the chair of the pilot program said that the pilot would begin october 8 and continue for three or four weeks unless it encountered complications in which case it might be extended webcast of the conference may be found at httpwwwthengporg crs10 and technical challenges that agencies may face in collecting and reporting subaward data the pilot will only test reporting award data from firsttier subrecipients however and there may be greater costs and technical challenges associated with collecting data from lower tier subrecipients which tend to be smaller and may have less welldeveloped reporting systems in place earmarks and wasteful spending although one of the stated purposes of the legislation was to enable the public to use the online database to identify congressional earmarks it is unclear how users of usaspendinggov might actually do this since neither faads nor fpds ng collect that information not all grants loans or contracts are congressionally directed some are at the discretion of the responsible federal agency unless the congressionally directed items are specifically identified as such the website will be of limited value for purposes of earmark identification the ffata also intended the website to provide the public with an opportunity to assess the worthiness of individual awards the manner in which an award is described under the award title field on usaspendinggov might lead the public to draw different conclusions about the value of given federally funded project for example project that some believe has merit might be described in manner that puts it in an unfavorable light in this way award descriptions might influence the publics perception of whether funding action is wasteful or not proposed legislation to amend the ffata on june 3 2008 senator barack obama on behalf of himself and three cosponsors introduced new legislation to expand and improve the quality of the data posted to usaspendinggov34 s 3077 the strengthening transparency and accountability in federal spending act of 2008 would amend the ffata and require usaspendinggov to provide new information on federal awards including the same information about lease agreements that is already required for grants and contracts copy of each contract and its associated request for proposals announcement and scope of work the highest lowest and median offered price among acceptable procurement bids details about the amount of each contract awarded including profit incentives and options to expand or extend contract information about the extent of competition in awarding contract including when applicable an explanation of why contract was awarded without full and open competition 34 the three other cosponsors were senators carper coburn and mccain along with senator obama these three senators were cosponsors of the ffata crs11 an indication if an award is the result of congressionally directed spending item35 and number of data elements that had been voluntarily provided by usaspendinggov such as the amount of nonfederal matching funds required if any to obtain federal assistance award in addition s 3077 would require usaspendinggov to provide information about federal award recipients including an assessment of the quality of work performed on federal awards during the previous five years information about federal audit disputes and resolutions award terminations and suspensions and debarments information about civil criminal and administrative actions taken against the recipient by the federal government or state government for violation of federal or state laws or regulations related to the workplace environment protection fraud securities and consumer protections and information about compliance with federal tax requirements including whether the recipient has filed annual tax returns for the previous five years and is paying any taxes owed to improve the quality of data on usaspendinggov the bill would also require the director of omb to ensure that each agency inspector general reviews sample of agency awards every six months to verify the accuracy of the data submitted to usaspendinggov the data posted to usaspendinggov is audited for quality every six months the website provides simple method for the public to report errors in the data and personally identifiable information is made available through the website in contrast to the ffata which was almost universally supported when it was introduced s 3077 has been both lauded and criticized the president of americans for tax reform supporter of the bill has argued that expanding the award information posted to usaspendinggov as proposed by s 3077 would be another step towards the objective of comprehensive fiscal transparency36 the executive 35 s 3077 uses the definition of congressionally directed spending item found in pl 110 81 which amends the senates standing rules and therefore applies only to the senate it would be necessary to amend s 3077 to include congressionally directed spending items that originate in the house the houses definition of congressional earmark which is substantively the same as the senate definition of congressionally directed spending item is found in sec 404 of hres 6 36 letter from grover g norquist president of americans for tax reform to senators tom continued crs12 director of omb watch another supporter argued that enacting s 3077 would strengthen the publics ability to hold government officials accountable for their funding decisions37 critics have voiced concerns about making certain contract information available to the public through usaspendinggov step they say could have unintended consequences for example s 3077 would require the website to include information on the highest lowest and median offer for contract bids procurement expert in the private sector said that if usaspendinggov included data on proposed contract prices which is only one of the factors considered when awarding contract then government procurement officers may feel pressured to award contracts to the lowest bidder even if the lowest bidder cant do the work38 the president of government contractor trade organization wrote in an editorial that posting information on government website about purported contractor misconduct would be misleading to the public and unfair to contractors39 the broad scope of contractor performance information would lack proper context he argued such as metric to help the public understand the comparative severity of actions taken against contractor without the proper context he wrote the public might presume that all such cases represent probable or proven misconduct of serious nature when some actions are routine and other actions may result in findings of misconduct he questioned how making such information available to the public would improve federal procurement oversight the ffata and s 3077 also differ in that the former identified specific sources of data to use in implementation but the latter does not until these data sources are identified it will not be possible to estimate the cost and technical challenges associated with implementing s 3077 it is not known for example the extent to which agencies are already collecting the data they would be required to report the quality of that data and the cost of collecting data not currently captured by agencies implementing the reporting provisions of s 3077 may also pose technical challenges for agencies the data that must be reported under the bill which range from workplace discrimination to violations of the clean water act may now be located in half dozen or more separate databases and it is not known how difficult it would be to incorporate these databases into the usaspendinggov search function 36 continued carper tom coburn john mccain and barack obama june 4 2008 at httpwwwatrorgcontentpdf2008june060408ltobamacoburnpdf 37 letter from gary d

competitive acquisitions 39 stan soloway fine line between transparency and chaos washington technology july 14 2008 at httpwwwwashingtontechnologycomprint23_12331171html crs13 concluding observations although usaspendinggov was operating before the statutory deadline implementation of the ffata may be considered behind schedule in that the data made available to the public remain incomplete and untimely the effectiveness of usaspendinggov as an oversight tool is diminished in proportion to the amount of award information it does not provide in addition because the ffata subaward pilot program was not launched by the statutory deadline it seems unlikely that subaward information will be incorporated into usaspendinggov by january 1 2009 as the act requires if the pilot program concludes in november 2008 there may not be sufficient time to address the problems identified by the pilot particularly if the solutions involve developing new financial data collection and reporting processes the ffata does permit the director of omb to extend the reporting deadline by an additional 18 months for subawards that were passed through state local or tribal governments the director may also exempt entities with gross income from all sources of 300000 or less from subaward reporting requirements until the director determines that such reporting would not cause undue burden on the subaward recipients it is possible the director will exercise these authorities which could delay reporting on subawards that passed through government entities until 2011 while smaller entities those with less than 300000 in total income could be exempt indefinitely implementation of the ffata could be affected by enactment of s 3077 the new legislation would expand the information about federal assistance awards and recipients which some observers may view as increasing transparency primary objective of the ffata in particular s 3077 would require usaspendinggov to identify earmarked awards function that the website does not currently have s 3077 would also establish new rules to enhance the quality of data on usaspendinggov which as previously discussed remains an issue expanding the data available through usaspendinggov might also slow full implementation of the ffata agencies and award recipients are still developing procedures that will enable them to meet the ffatas reporting standards and omb continues to address the technical challenges associated with posting data to usaspendinggov some observers suggest that the requirements of s 3077 would strain already tight agency
