recertified governro s all very clear powerful devoted onepointed and lots of fun too i just wanted to congratulate you you have wonderful group to work with iii raja steven we have been in vlodrop since october 2005 primary responsibility right now raja of china it is maharishi sized project that he can sink his teeth into i am raja of new zealand australia and 13 small islands and 4 or possibly 5 states kentucky is being discussed whether it is in that right now i would like to give you an insight into maharishis current thinking and relevance for the south eastern united states the action princip he has shared with for china and how the project started i had retired from business 2 years ago at my wifes proddingnote taker lost the connection that course was quite bit different from earlier courses entirely inward projects discussion about activities contin ued for 10 months had to leave for 1 month for family health considerations maharishi said that if i came back when finished with responsibilities and course had ended i would continue with next course when we came back mmy put us on next raja course on which only 2 people bruce plaut and i in spring maharishi started to call us rajas and we had little projects out of that came activities in which i was helping to identify land for global financial capital maharishi wanted something like 70 broad street for financial activities in china month ago maharishi decided to reorganize rajas by language groups somewhere in that process i became raja of china he started to put tremendous amount of attention there in speaking with maharishi about china one day maharishi asked if i had had an opportunity to speak to dr ju professor of mum responsible for setting up affiliated university in beijing i told him i would call him the next day or afternoon maharishi said i want to introduce you to him this is the phenomenon he moves and waves of ocean start to flow he had secretaries call and dr ju was in dome he had secretaries call him in the 2 dome and pull him out of dome maharishi had maybe spoken to him only once maharishi connected with him with bevan he asked dr ju what was his activity he was so impressed with his clarity enthusiasm and dedication that he latched on to him and became very excited he called him the star of bethlehem he loved him and loved the activity as we were all settling down from the call around afternoon program with bevan and raja harris on line maharishi said he wanted to appoint dr ju as chief minister of china and do that with formality we are going to call him again and see what his response is he will have someone ask the question and will listen to the there was everything you would want in dr jus response to maharishi out of that maharishi said we are going to draft decree decree 1 of raja of china and that would be translated into chinese the whole thing had certain flow unpredictability and incredible expansion wher just riding that wave i thought i should draft something from the phone call maharishi and dr feldman were already drafting the decree maharishi made the comment that dr ju had lot of ground to cover it is probably most importa nt country in world financially now it is still communist we have lot of ground to cover and we will just go step by step i said there is an ancient proverb journey of thousand miles starts with single step he just loved that i googled that expression the actual literal translation is journey of thousand miles begins with silence beneath ones feet i want to read what mahar ishi wrote and what i think maharishi has been doing for 50 years what he is doing now and what all of you are doing the wisdom of china is record ed in an ancient proverb journey of thousand miles begins with singl step another version of this proverb begins with silence beneath ones feet we are proud of this proverb that locates all success in silencewe see the philosophy of the biggest nation in universe silence in control of all dynamism this is ancient wisdom from which all our present programs are based it underlies our aspiration to raise world consciousness to high level and invincibility dr ju will be in china month looking for schools in his talk to ministers and chief ministersi will organize so you can hear what we have been teaching is for people to work out their own silence from silence of mind they are to promote thought our role is parental role now we know we can handle collective silence and nature of collective silence is invincibility what maharishi has brought to world is silence in history of movement book in 1957 he was asked what he is bringing to world and he said silence initially he said silence existed and silence had certain quality to it bliss and it supported activity over time he started giving us the knowledge that it controls activity controls dynamism dynamism is not outside of silence but is fluctuations reverberations within silence and it is all selfcontained even though this quote is incorporated into the decree that had to do with chinese philosophy and chinese culture it relates to everything we are doing we are infusing silence into our domain giving people experience of that then school is experiencing silence and 3 reverberations of silence promoting peace and happiness which maharishi now summarizes in that one word invincibility out of those conversations with myself and dr ju some of them he directed to and he would make comment for to understand we would stay on the line when he was talking to others he would share universal basic principles of action for everyone to hear over and over few basic ones the art archery you see raja steven when you see the target you immediately shoot the arrow you dont spend lot of time in thought in gossip we just proceed this is something he does all the time part and parcel of that he has said on dozens of occasions and we dont look for perfection rajas ministers will make mistakes if it doesnt work we can amend it i know when you are in the field sometimes you are teaching alone and some of things you are responsible for you have lot on your plate and you are having to maintain your livelihood make sure you stay on routine that you are living that silence that is going to make people respond to you and keep the endeavor fun for everybody as far as administrative structure we are still sorting that out kentucky may or may not be in our domain jeff murphy will be taking over for elaine for netsuite coordination and vedic tours we are still sorting that out raja rogers everyone in former atlanta domain is so fortunate to have raja steven working with us he is brilliant has deep high level of consciousness and he is raja of action this is why he has chosen him to be raja of china we have beautiful matching of our dynamic teachers and dynamic raja iv questions gerard we purchased land over year ago and we are still waiting for land to put up building raja s where is land gerard near mall raja rogers gerard and connie have been very one pointed in obtaining land it was long shot it is very good location they were having celebration in big open field where they were having flag raising indian gentleman passing by crossed the field and said that he and his had seen the global country flag in india and wanted to be part of this celebrati on he and his stayed and helped v contacting raja steven raja steven i will give my email address rajasteven maharis hinet likely jeff murphy will be raj assistant and administrator any questions you have write in email so i have written record to follow up on vi tributes stuart i wanted to add my expression of delight when we first heard raja rogers was retiring from this domain we were bit crestfallen because we have come to admire him and be so inspired by his quality of leadership 4 compassion and dynamism then when we heard you would be raja we were delighted because we know the depth of silenc and your commitment to maharishis programs this beautiful exposition that you gave so deep and profound and so relevant it is tremendously inspiring we just feel deeply grateful maharishi has appointed you to be our raja and to work with you to create heaven on earth raja steven entertainment and enjoyment i was on with maharishi and we were actually in discus sion on how countries would be organized and maharishi wanted every state to have raja we were with raja peter and dr feldman it is infinity and then it is point up and down sideways and then whole thing stretched issue of hawaii came up and maharishi said i am thinking to offer hawaii to raja rogers and you will take states of tennessee florida georgia secretaries please connect raja rogers in dr feldman got raja rogers on phone you were in the car from seeing some land maharishi of course was listening and dr feldman said we are thinking you would like to take hawaii and you will longer have those other states how do you think of those statesthat would be wonderful said raja rogers raja rogers you become so associate d and endeared to everyone in both directions it is some times difficult and you learn to let go quickly but there is still the lesha vidya i will always remember everybody in the atlanta domain vii tampas initiative to make presentation on consciousnessbased schools to the governor raja rogers government hands are tied and they cannot do anything meaningful for us and they are just reflection of collective consciousness when we deal with individual schools and principals there has been lot of success on that level in theory it would be wonderful to have governor behind us even if 100 behind us in any state they do not make decisions for schools that would be principal and superinten dent to have expectation we are going to capture the fort that would not be best use of time i think school programs are without question important maharishi is most interested in have people heard talk on 24th of may to ministers and chief ministers i will organize so we will get the tape and play at convenient time dr feldman introduction and summary whole thing may be about one hour maharishi speaking very directly and personally to the teachers it is very inspiring the focus maharishi has made we are obviously teaching the same silence giving the experience but not on one to one basis here one there one we want groups we want schools where children will make little hops in their school school here school there every wave of their giggles of bliss they excite everyone that giggle is bliss consciousness for so many years we have taught individuals one person comes and we teach them he wants the focus to be to create groups it seems the easiest way is to promote these groups lynch foundation has consistently been coming up with funding we come up with 5 these types of programs that is capturing the fort and we have opportunity to create larger group of meditators and then sidhas when one person starts individually the level of commitment that they have and percentage of chance that they continue as sidha is much greater if they have group support and consistency that comes with group program group in school business hospital certainly school because they are young and before life style has changed and might not be as conducive to pure knowledge raja rogers i agree exactly greatest success is getting school or superintendent or somebody in district the higher you go it seems the more politics are involved it seems like we have started at individual level and now maharishi has moved up to group level these leaders that we have today are less than we always want to say we want parental role for society and they are less than parental raja steven the higher up you go people are trying to protect their authority and power and compensation they dont want to do anything that will risk their role at school they have more parental feeling for their children that is what drew in dr rutherford his parental role for his children dr rutherford and sarina are willing to travel it is just compellin g the lower level of economic status the more inner city the school it just so happens the more they tend to respond to us we dont have to think of going to private school the inner city school may take little more time with follow up maryo carol and ray work together and extensively with one high school here and teachers taking martial arts for defense our governor has made big noise that he wants to improve education raja steven what is the status of it carol we got approval from principle and guidance counselors because they wanted to do whole school of 2000 ray and maryo and i advised they get all the necessary approvals they took it to next level and superintendent for pinellas county wanted more information he approved the project totally but would not allow it to be in school day because florida is 49th of 50 states and this is triple d school they didnt know how wonderful our programs are on every level they are afraid to take time from academics one of problems is their school starts at 700 in morning we couldnt imagine any student coming in morning essentially it was tabled at that level our thinking of going to governor was because governor has touted himself as being education governor and there is person taken with tm and connected to governor even if we could give small presentation and governor was on the side it would help us tip it over raja steven i think if you have an in to the governor we can make presentation to anyone if we are looking for an edict that probably wouldnt happen take into consideration you dont want to be in position that superintendent is slighted by going over his head even if he is favorable dont want him going in and saying you should do this i think it is worth making presentation has this superintendent and principal had presentation by rutherford sarina ashley deans their peers carol we had dr hagelin 6 conferenced in sarina and nick we had clips raja steven one thing you can do i am sure it will be possible if favorable we organize conference call with dr rutherford to talk with why necessary and why he should want it to happen in school day and why his concerns are unfounded how we can resolve those objections the principal can say i had same thought when i started the program i didnt want their grades to get any lower but here is what happened and this is why it is so important to have it in school day the lynch foundation requires it and i dont think maharishi would want them to meditate outside of the school day either you will have lot of drop outs carol now school is finished for the year we can arrange conference call i know dr rutherford and i know he will be able to confe rence in i feel we are an inch away from having school of 2000 we really want to do it we are creatively thinking how we can do this raja steven you have to persevere you may get little resistance you keep trying different angles it sounds to from your experience at nataki school you may be able to organize conference call even if they dont come away from that phone call saying you have convinced but they will be one step closer viii residence course ray we are going to have residence course the last weekend of july or over labor day weekend ix administrative structure regine you gave us your email is that the best way to contact you would you prefer us to go through an administrative assistant what is your management style raja steven were i raja of tennessee florida georgia alone i would be happy for email but as i have china that is primary focus and maharishi did say to that i should ideally be speaking to chief ministers of my different countries if you start to engage with all the ministers of the different countries you will drive yourself insane we dont at present have enough full time teachers to align ourselves with the structure maharishi would like to create 12 ministries and then minister he said clearly chief minister would select the ministers let them make their selections then support them since we dont really have enough people to create 12 ministers and chief minister for whole south eastern area we can have state director for each state it might be in south carolina joe state directo r someone who would have awareness on state as whole i would be communicating one call week with all governors and we will refine process and also call on some periodicity with the 4 or 5 state directors so that i get some sense from them of what activities are going on there has to be some degree of selfsufficiency most of the us governors have countries that on paper they are responsible for but they are not actively dealing with them i am expecting to be dealing with china australia and new zealand on daily basis if there is anyone in any of 7 the states that you would like that responsibilit we are talking an awareness responsibility rather than management responsibility send an email saying i would be interested i will finalize who is domain director for vedic tours regine i think all of us are used to being pretty selfsufficient based on inspiring comment about acting sometimes when we dont have problems acting except when we come up against policy decisions i see you as spread really thin really quickly of course you dont want to be bogged down raja steven send an email to the assistant but cc when he responds to you he can cc you will find i am excessively conscientious and detail oriented i have been in business 25 years i dont like people to wait obviously maharishi puts you in the gap and he wants you to go through that process when you think about it there are only two directions maharishi can take you he can take you from silence to dynamism or from dynamism to silence what is brahm seamless coexistence of both of those values he wants everybody to have those values all the time he takes us out of long deep program into activity more unified activity to more diversif ied he is constantly stretching your boundaries in december of 99 bevan told maharishi had said life is festival of disruptions disruption is constan t fluctuation that iswhy you have to have that silence maharishi is never out of balance in any possible way it doesnt matter what comes to him he is never out of balance that is what draws us we want all of those opposite values balanced that are perceptually contained in maharishi i have heard bevan make note of this bevan is prime example of this flexibility lots of times maharishi will give responsibility of that project not to person who has experience to do it but to someone who will have experience you have to keep in mind the project is not the project as we look at it but the person getting that perso n enlightened when he gives responsibility of project to someone who has experience starting school or hospital or business just like parent this is what i will have the child do today even though the older child may do it better what is the experience he wants to givesilence dynamism expansion contraction then one is at home with absolutely everything just as maharishi is the 12 ministries that are the new structure of administration of world peace all of them have that common theme we are going to go out through that channel and we are going to enliven the organizing power within silence within religion within agriculture within education maharishi is seed planter he throws an infinite number of seeds if any one were to really and truly succeed it would create heaven on earth he keeps throwing seeds out in all these different areas alcine shall we initially send you report on what we are doing raja steven that would be fantastic i want to express my appreciation for all you are doing it is such pious profession all of you have such great experience dedication for what you are doing maharishi appreciates all you are doing he speaks very personally for those in the field and his desire for them financially and their life i have picked up in the one phone call the level of dedication and professionalism i 8 am pleased just from this one call my email address rajasteven maharishi net we will get direct or in next 24 hours you will send your emails to him with time difference it will be little difficult sunday 245 stuart weekend is teaching time for us any weekday at this time we can schedule around regine i have full time business i am available on friday raja rogers friday at 245 should we do once week or once every two weeks stuart given your level of responsibility i would be comfortable with once every two weeks regine as long as we have some intermediary person to field for some time sensitive project raja steven just email dont wait for calls calls should be to think collecti vely why dont we do this we will do the friday after next friday june 15 at 245 if when we speak it becomes apparent we need to speak more often we can adjust we can adjust on given week am i correct that in order to do call
