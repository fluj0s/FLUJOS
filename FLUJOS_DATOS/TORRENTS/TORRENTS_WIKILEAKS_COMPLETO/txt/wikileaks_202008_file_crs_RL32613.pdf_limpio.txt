lower courts are likely to have ruled erroneously on the issue the question becomes when may defendants convicted or sentenced on the basis of these errors claim the beneÔ¨Åt of the new decision and have their convictions or sentences overturned generally new decisions of the supreme court will apply retroactively to defendants currently on trial or on direct appeal also defendant may take advantage retroactively of new court rule in few other limited situations for example decisions which construe criminal statute to exclude certain acts or conduct new decisions of the court sometimes apply retroactively to those on collateral review and rarely apply retroactively to those petitioners on second or successive collateral reviewshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32613congressional research

criminal law september 28 2004 paul starett wallace jr specialist in american public law american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32613standards for retroactive application based upon groundbreaking supreme court decisions in criminal law summary the supreme court is said to have nnounced new rule when it hands down decision that addresses an issue of law in new way or for the first time in criminal law new rules apply prospectively but they also apply retroactively sometimes whether new rule provides the basis for overturning past case depends on the nature of the new rule and where in the review process past case is located when the new rule is announced if the new rule is substantive one that is if it declares that conduct previously outlawed may not be criminalized it applies retroactively if the new is procedural the issue is more complicated the new rule will not apply to any case in which the defendant has waived the right to the benefits of the new rule the new rule will not apply where the failure to apply it in pa st case was harmless procedural defects that undermine the very structure of the trial pro cess secret trial denial of the right to lawyer biased judges and the like are never harmless new rule will apply to past case if the case is still on direct appeal and if the defendant raised the issue in timely manner before the ne w rule was announced if case is still on direct appeal but the defendant failed to raise the issue in timely manner the new rule will only apply retroactively if the defendant can cla im the benefits of the plain error doctrine those defendants who have reached the state of finality with their sentence which is an indication that they have exhausted their criminal appeal procedures are not in as favorable position as those defe ndants who are on direct appeal errors raised on collateral review essentially means that the defendant is attacking the sentence or conviction in manner other than through direct appeal are reviewed under the more difficult harmless error standard for habeas corpus cases as general framework for analyzing the appli cability of new rules to convictions that have already become final new substan tive rules apply retroactively but new procedure rules do not procedural rule applies retroactively only if it is watershed rule of criminal procedure th at implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding in teague v lane the supreme court answered questions of retroactivity for cases on collateral review in teague the court held that as general rule new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which ve become final before the new rules are announced there are two exceptions 1 teague held that the new rule should apply retroactively if it places cl ass of conduct beyond the power of the state to proscribe and 2 teague held that new rule should apply retroactively if the new constitutional rule is watershed rule of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness of the criminal proceeding thus if court determines that the constitutional rule at issue is new procedural rule it must determine when the defendants conviction becam final even if habeas petition survives teague analysis its claim to new rule may be impaired by restrictions on stale or repetitious petitions

decision which overrules number of other decisions sometimes these decisions may provide relief for defendant who has already been convicted generally the courts have held that new rules of procedure will not be applied retroactively hence unless the case is on direct appeal at the time the decision is rendered the defendant cannot take advantage of it 2 in direct appeal the court is limited to revi ewing the record from the trial court it will not consider evidence which was not submitted in habeas corpus the same limitations are not present and the court may consider additiona l evidence in direct appeal almost any violation of law may be addressed this can in clude violations of statutes and rules in contrast habeas corpus is generally limited to constituti onal claims as result the violation of statutes or rules cannot generally be basis for relief in habeas proceeding 3 bousley v united states 523 us 614 62021 1998 4 schriro v summerlin 124 sct 2519 2522 2004standards for

apply retroactively to those on collateral review and rarely apply retroactively to those petitioners on second or succe ssive collateral reviews4 waiver there are number of significant restrictions on the ability to raise error after the fact the most common problem appears to be waiver waiver may be accomplished either affirmatively or by in action by pleading guilty for example defendant waives jury trial confrontation and selfincr imination rights and therebyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32613crs2 5 cf parke v raley 506 us 20 29 1992 6 wainwright v sykes 433 us 72 8889 1977 7 386 us 18

by inaction may be less debilitating here the doctrine of waiver recognizes that court should have an opportunity to ru on claim at time when it can be remedied the effect of this means that i ssues must be raised at the first opportunity to do so6 depending upon the circumstances of the case and the nature of the error failure to interpose timely and consistent objection may limit defendants ability to benefit when the supreme court late r confirms the validity of the objection harmless error prior to chapman v california7 most courts understood that constitutional error in criminal case could never be harmless and always warranted relief either on direct review or in federal habeas corpus that understanding changed after chapman when the court held that some constitutional errors at trial could be ignored if it could be said with relative assurance that they had effect on the ultimate verdict8 in justifying this change in constitutional law chapman weighed the cost of automatic reversal against the risks of rroneous conviction and concluded that the system could tolerate some additional risk9 to ensure that the idea of harmless error remained within close bounds however th court held that error could be considered harmless unless the prosecuti on demonstrated bey ond reasona ble doubt that the error had not influenced the verdict10 the rule pronounced in chapman remains the governing rule with two exceptions first its reach is limited to direct appeals thereafter upon collateral review different standard applies when the government has the burden of addressing prejudice as in excusing preserved error as harmless on direct review of the criminal conviction it is not enough to negate an effect on the outcome of the case see chapman v california 386 us 24 1967 the court must be able to declare belief that constitutional error was harmless beyond reasonable doubt when the government has the burden of showing that constitutional trial error is harmless because it comes up on collateral review the heightened interest in finality generally calls for the government to meet the more lenient kotteakos standard11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32613crs3 11 continued 124 sct 2333 2339 n7 2004 12 328 us 750 1946 the test under kotteakos is whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdict under this standard habeas petitioners may obtain plenary review of their constitutional claims but they are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice brecht v abrahamson 507 us 619 637 1993 in oneal v mcaninch 513 us 432 1995 the court further refined the brecht harmless error standard holding that this standard does not place the burden of proof upon the petitioner to show that trial error substantially affected the verdict rather wh ere the issue is evenly balanced and the judge has doubts about whether the error had substantial and injurious effect on the jurys verdict then the judge must treat the error as if it were not harmless and must rule for the petitioner see also california v roy 519 us 2 45 1997 13 499

meaning of the principal harmless error case kotteakos v united states12 second it does not apply to structural errors structural error in arizona v fulminante13 the supreme court distinguished trial errors from structural errors in the context of constitutional rights violations stating that the former are subject to harmless error analysis but the latter requires automatic reversal trial error ccurs during cases presentation to the trier of fact and may therefore be quantitativ ely assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admi ssion is harmless bey ond reasona ble doubt14 structural defect on the other hand ffects the framework within which the trial proceeds and therefore defies harmless error analysis15 the court in fulminante noted that

to convince the court that th unlawful presence of alternate jurors during the jury deliberations that led to their convictions seriously affected the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings19 the defendant in johnson had more success with the contention that the failure to present the issue of materiality of false statement to the ju ry satisfied the standard not because such an error might never satisfy the substantial affect standard but because in johnson the evidence of materiality was overwhelming and uncontested20 the cotton defendants met the same fate the erroneous failure to include within the drug trafficking indictment allegations of the sentencingdetermining quantity of the drugs involved did not satisfy the substantial ffect standard because the jury had been presented with overwhelming and esse ntially uncontroverted evidence of the quantity of drugs involved21 application on collateral review in schriro v summerlin 22 the court held that ring v arizona23 did not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review in ring the court concluded that in the capital sentencing context the existence of an aggravating factor must be proved to jury rather than judge summerlin was tried nd convicted before ring however and thus under arizonas sentenci ng scheme judge found the aggravating factors that made him eligible for the death penalty in his federal habeas petition summerlin argued that he was entitled to the benefit of the ring rule but the court did not concur the court in an opinion written by justice scalia outlined the general framework under teague v lane24 for analyzing the applicability of new rules to convictions that have already b ecome final new substa ntive rules generally apply retroactively but new procedural rules generally do not procedural rule applies retroactively only if it is wat ershed rule of criminal procedure that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceedings25 with this overview the court disregarded any suggestion that the ring rule applied to summerlins case because it wa s substantive rule the ring rule does not alter the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes26 it merely assigns decision making authority for essential f acts bearing on punishment it regulates only the manner of determining culpability

habeas corpus claims which makes it clear that the finality of convictions cannot be brought into question by every change in the law for example under teague v lane new rule in general cannot be app lied retroactively to cases on collateral review unless the rule fa lls within one of two narrow exceptions to the general rule of nonretroactivity27 the first exception permits retroactive application to new rules that place certain kinds of pr imary private indivi dual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe28 the second exception allows retroactive applicati on of new rules that involve procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty29 the socalled watershed exception30 teague analysis asks whether partic ular supreme court decision announced new rule and if so whether either of the two teague exceptions apply so as to allow habeas petitioner to claim the benefit of the new rule the supreme court addressed the new rule issue of retroactivity in capital sentencing context in beard v banks 31 in mills v maryland32 the court held invalid capital sentencing scheme that required juries to disregard mitig ating factors that they had not found unanimously in beard the court held that the mills rule does not apply retroactively in its analysis the court considered whether the rule was dictated by existing precedent relative to whether the unlawfulness of mills sentence would be apparent to all reasonable ju rist after tracing the jurisprudential roots of the mills decision the court concluded that reasona ble jurists could have differed as to whether the prior cases compelled the results in mills as confirmation the court noted that the mills case and late released case had dissents the beard court also provided guidance on the two teague exceptions the first exception is reserved for primary private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe33 this beard observes as would schriro thereafter is matter appropriately considered retroactive by its substantive nature rather than an exception to the procedural teague rule34 elsewhere the court has suggested

less of the procedure followed35 in providing guidance as to what might fall within the wate rshed exception the court has repeatedly referred to the rule of gideon v wainwright 372 us 335 1963 right to counsel and only to this rule36 i n c n t r s t t gideons solitary standing the court has identified more than few decisions concerning procedural rights that may not claim watershed status for

rule announced by the supreme court however the period begins to run when the decision is handed down if th court has made it retroactively applicable for purposes of collateral review42 generally the federal c ourt cannot grant relief on habeas corpus claims unless the state supreme court has first had an opportunity to rule on the same federal claims this is called exhaus tion of state court remedies43 the supreme court explained the exhaustion requirement in osullivan v boercke 44 because the exhaustion doctrine is designed to give the state courts full and fair opportunity to resolve federal constitutional claims before those claims are presented to the federal courts we concl ude that state prisoners must give the state courts one full opportunity to reso lve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the states established appellate review process in the same vein the court entertains procedural default doc trine under which it is reluctant to pass upon constitutional claim pressed by state prisoner who by his own default is barred from presenting the claim to state courts it will do so however when the prisoner can satisfy the courts cause and prejudice requirements45 if the petitioner does not bring all of hisher federal claims which are related to particular judgment in single federal habeas corpus action heshe will not be able to bring second action without first obtaining permission to do so from the federal circuit court of appeals46 there is one relevant exception to the general maxim that prisoner may not raise ne w issues in second or successive habeas petition prisoner may do so if the supr eme court has expressly made new rule of constitutional interpreta tion retroactively applicab upon collateral

collateral review and rarely apply retroactively to those petitioners on second and successive collateral reviews there were two supreme court deci sions during the 20032004 term which dealt with the retroactive application of previous court rulings on the death penalty and the ability of death row petitioners to have court review their claims in schriro v summerlin the court ruled that deat h row inmates cannot benefit from 2002 supreme court ruling that crucial findings of fact should be made by jury not judge in capital cases the court held that the earlier decision in ring v arizona was not retroactive and therefore coul d not be applied to summerlin and the death row inmates in five ot her states affected by the ring ruling justice scalia writing for the majority held that the ring decision represented new procedural rule for the ma nner of determining the defendants culpabilitywhether defendant is worthy of being sentenced to deathand these new procedural rules are generally not applicable retroactively unless they meet very narrow watershed exception justice scalia concluded th at the evidence that juries were more accurate factfinders than judges was too unconfirmable to support the conclusion that the ring decision was watershed rule the dissent argued that ring did announce watershed rule and focused on the jurys role in serving as the community standard for determin ing whether the conduct of the defendant merits death sentence in beard v banks another case involving retroactivity the court held that 1988 opinion that invalidated deathsenten cing schemes in which jurors were required to be unanimous in finding the existence of mitigating factors was not retroactive justice thomas writing for the majority concluded that although the courts decision in maryland v mills announced new rule that rule did not fall within the watershed exception for new rules that are retroactively applicable the court emphasized in both summerlin and beard that these new procedural rules will only be retroactive unde r extremely limited circumstances
