1990s these include such questions as wage rate determination procedures reporting requirements under the copeland act an appropriate threshold for activation of the statute interagency relationships with respect to davisbacon enforcement and compliance activity adminis trative or judicial appeals procedures the use of helpers and other lowskilled workers on covered projects and the right of president to suspend the statute as well as the conditions under which such suspension may occur that the fundamental premise of the act remains in contention after 60 years may be itself part of the

economics domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94408the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy summary in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration congress adopted the davisbacon act the measure set certain minimum labor standards for workers employed in federal contract construction notably that contractors must pay their employees not less than the locally prevailing wage the threshold for coverage is currently 2000 and up construction crafts are divided into four components commercial buildings highways residen tial and heavy cons truction locality in this case is normally the equivalent of county though other options are possible in addition the copeland antikickback act of 1934 sets re porting requirements intended to aid in davisbacon enforcement and compliance through the years the davisbacon requirements have been applied to dozens of program statutes that involve federal nd federally assist ed construction davisbacon has been amended over the years to expand its coverage and to strengthen enforcement it has generally enjoyed strong bipartisan support throughout its history but the act has also spar ked continuing cont roversy and opposition especially from nonunion contractors i ssues of policy concerning the act raised initially in the 1920s and 1930s conti nue to be debated into the 21st century seventyfive years after its enactment questions remain about its economic impact its scope and pattern of c overage and its administration since the early 1950s the act has been variously the focus of rulema king litigation and legi slative interest and through the past quarter century of all three in 1934 and in 1971 the act was genera lly but temporarily suspended by presidents roosevelt and nixon fr om october 1992 until march 1993 it was suspended by president george hw bu sh but only for locations affected by hurricanes andrew and iniki from september into november 2005 it was suspended by president george w bush for areas affected by hurricane katrina into the early 1990s bills were introduced that would have repealed the davis bacon and copeland acts outright had they been adopted eliminating the prevailing wage and reporting requirement s from program statutes into which they have been incorporated in the mid1990s shift in political control in congress seemed to forecast victory for those fa voring repeal but ultimately the prevailing wage issue proved to be bipartisan and the statut davisbacon and copeland remained unchanged prevailing wagedavisbacon provisions have continued to be included in federal program statutes where cons truction has been program component with the advent of the 21st century the davisbac on debate has continued sporadically but its focus increasingly has been upon the prevailing wage standards of program legislation given the experi ence of the past seven decades it seems likely that davisbacon will remain an issue of public policy

became part of federal contract practice during the middle 1950s however it gained more visi bility as the davisbacon prevailing wage principle was added to various fede ral program statutes for more than 4 decades now and continuing into the 21st century davisbacon has been almost constantly focus of public policy concer n as legislation through administrative rulemaking and in litigation before the courts1 as amended the davisbacon act of 1931 requires among other things that construction contracts ente red into by the federal government specify minimum wages to be paid to the various classes of laborers employed under those contracts2 minimum wages are defined as those determined by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the c oncept of wage was expanded in 1964 to include fringe benefit component th act has coverage threshold of 2000 in addition to direct federal construction contracts the davisbacon prevailing wage principle has been written into more than 50 federal program statutes the act is supplemented by the 1934 copela nd antikickback act which requires weekly reporting of wages actually paid nd an affirmation from employers that any deductions from wages due to employees have been proper and by federal overtime pay and health and safety standards statutes further some states have enacted little davisbacon acts within their respective jurisdictions the rhetoric for and against the act has changed little through the years does the act protect workers

not can it be administered in an equitable fashion is there sufficient objective information concerning the act to allow for fair assessment of the statute and its impact this report examines policy

act historically the act has enjoyed strong bipartisan support but at the same time especially since the middle 1950s it s provoked militant critic ism federal agencies have disagreed publicly concer ning the usefulness and administration of the act it has been subjected to judi cial review and interpretation each new application becoming in turn matter for further examination although the department of labor dol has made certain changes in the acts administration the statute itself has re mained largely unchanged since 1935 through the years however congress has extended the acts provisions to cover an ever wider segment of federa l and federally assi sted construction and at least during the past several decades such extensions of coverage have provided an opportunity for renewed debate concerni ng the act and its impact on the one hand critics of the act argue even were th statute justified in 1931 that it has now been rendered obsolete through market chan ges and enactment of other federal labor standards laws notably the fair labor st andards act of 1938 further they argue that the act is inflationary adding to the cost of public construction and thereby potentially reducing the volume of c onstruction and the number of federal construction jobs finally they suggest that it is anticomp etitive di scriminates against smaller firms and is difficult to administer repeal or significant modification of the act they note w ould reduce the paperwork burden of doing business with the federal government and would allow contractors more flexibility in manpower utilization on the other hand the acts defenders hold that davisbacon is as important now as it was in the 1930s it prevents they assert competiti on from flybynight firms that undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors for federal work it helps stabilize the industry an advantage they suggest to workers and to employers in addition davisb acon may assure the consuming agency of better craftsmanship if when firms are required to pay not less than the locally prevailing wage they tend to employ mo re highly skilled wo rkers and supporters of the act add it may reduce both the initia l cost of federal construction through greater efficiency and decreas the need for repair andor rehabilitation at the same time they point out it deters

spect to construction of federal hospital in bacons new york district local contractors he explained had submitted bids on the project that reflected local standards but the contract was awarded to an alabama firm the latter bacon noted brought some thousand nonunion laborers from alabama into long is land ny they were herded onto this job they were housed in shacks they were paid very low wage and the work proceeded in bacons view the least g overnment could do when contracting was to comply with the local standards of wages and labor prevailing in the locality where the building construction is to take place his measure did not seek to inflate wages artificially but rather to assure that government respected the existing local standard6 the bill was not adopted similar legislation was in

putting teeth in it15 in the end the act was adopted wit hout roll call and on march 3 1931 signed into law by president hoover16 modifying the davisbacon act 19311961 dissatisfaction with the act was soon rife both with labor and contractors the initial enactment had been brief and relatively simple statement of policy armand thieblot who has written exte nsively about the act suggest s that it lacked effective mechanisms for either policing or enforcing its requirements and that provisions were made for in forming laborers of the prot ections afforded them under the new statute17 trade unionists were concerned that the scope of the act might leave too many workers unprotected the threshold had initially been set at 5000 sparking labors fear that contracts might be fragmented in order to escape the acts requirements matter of special concern for the painting and decorating crafts the afls executive council noted that the davisbacon act will prove great benefit so far as it goes adding that amendments to further benefit the building trades will be submitted at future sessions of congress18 among industry objections perhaps the most critical was the fact that wage rate

made deal with the secretary whereby if the president would issue an executive order on the davisbacon bill they would be against any further legislation on the matter by the committee on labor21 president hoovers executive order provi ded that all davisbacon contracts contain the following stipulations that wages be paid in full not less than once week in lawful money of the united states nd without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account that every person while performing work of laborer or mechanic on the public work covered by this contract is to be regarded as employed as

largely to be explored changing realities new perspectives underlying the davisbacon act was the concept that the united states as consumer has the right to require certain standards by contract when doing busine ss if contractor chose to engage in federal construction work th he had to abide by the stated specifications including labor standards in 1936 this principle was extended to the contract

teed by the federal government mr truman noted that the methods adop ted by the various agencies for the enforcement of labor standard s vary widely in character and effectiveness as result uniformity of enforcement is lacking and the degree of protection afforded workers varies from agency to agency to give order to this patchwork the president authorized the secretary of labor to coordinate the administration of legislation relating to wages and hours on federally financed or assisted projects 46 emphasis added change and priorities in presenting the plan to the congress the president acknowledged since the principle objec tive of the plan is more effective enforcement of labor standards it is not pr obable that it will result in savings but he added it will provide more uniform and more adequate protection for workers through the expenditures made for the forcement of the existing legislation47 coverage issues however raised durin g the truman era reorganization on the one

responsible contractors against unfair competition from contractors who base their bids on wage levels lower than those actually prevailing in the area but he also toke note of the protections that the act affords workers his views were concurred in by senator jacob javits rny who seemingly hark ening back to the concerns of the 1930s warned that we must guard against the breaking down of the

congress continued to preserve th act and to extend davisbacon coverage through the provisions in vari ous federal program statutes changing perspective on the davisbacon act from quick review of legislative activity during the eisenhower era one might reach several tentative preliminary observations first attaching davisbacon provi sions to program statutes seems to have been more

craftsmen from unfair contract bids he added that davisbacon provision was necessary to eliminate existing unfair bidding advantages of contractors who pay low wages in areas where union rates prevail the tacoma republican affirmed that the davis bacon act had assured all contractors equality of bi dding opportunity it protects contractors against unfair competition nd restricts the area of

the act based upon economy how about the increased cost of highways if the davisbacon provision were added it is variously estimated at 2 to 4 billion which means less highway for the money expended the unfortunate part is that the administrative and bureaucratic redtape which federal wage fixing entails causes waste from which one benefits and for which the taxpayer must bear the burden54 source was provided for the project ed cost estimate and conversely representative mack of washington declared that the act simply keeps wages at the prevailing rate the act he argued does not raise wages but it does prevent wage cutting and it is wage cutting and labor standard lowering that we wish to prevent55 mr mack stated that the washington state highway commission had endorsed the davisbacon provision promptly gardner withrow rwisc declared his complete agreement with mack that davisbacon would not make the cost of highway construction any greater than it is now representative w ithrow

aerospace construction the work was more than simply bricks and mortar were worker to install technical electronic equipment for example wa s the work part of the process of manufacturing and covered

general construction was batch plant some distance from construction site still part of the site of work for davisbacon purpos these issues were not to be easily resolved complicating matters further congress adopted the mcnamaraohara service contract act in 1965 mandating labor standards for servi ce workers but standards different from those in either davisb acon or walshhealey thus technical installation might be cons truction or manufacturing or it could be service operation62 in this way both employers and employees could suddenly find themselves on unfamiliar regulatory ground there were also collective bargaining agreements to consider how work was defined as to craft or skill might determine which union had jurisdiction the roosevelt subcommittee in 1962 special subcommittee on

for tour of defense and space installations in order to gain firsthand knowledge of the administration of the davisbacon act then formal hearings commenced the agenda was threefold 1 how the secretary of labor makes his determinations as to prevailing wages and what criteria he uses in making these determinations 2 whether some type of review should be provided for prevailing wage rate determinations made by the secretary of labor and 3 any other constructive proposals as to how the act may be improved or made more explicit63httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94408crs18 63 continued 68 11 and

now but which had been deferred pending these hearings so as to get the benefit of the viewpoints expr essed here the proposal was for the creation of some internal review machinery within our own structure to review some of the determinations that are challenged64 it quickly became apparent that creation of review mechanism would be controversial various proposals each with constituency of its own were presented some thought review by pane l within dol would be adequate others argued that such system would never be wholly free from the hand of the secretary whose staffs decisions were being reviewed judicial review was urged but it was argued that it would be unworkable that it would be cumbersome and costly and that decisions would not be timely an inconvenience to all involved and possibly causing delay of vital fede ral projects review by gao was yet another option but that in itself became matter of controversy since the comptroller general and dol seem frequently to have been at odds over davisbacon administration if there were to be an inhouse board various pr actical administrative questions would need to be dealt with for example who woul d appoint its members where would it be housed what would be its relationship to th secretary to the administrator of the wage and hour division within dol and to the office of the solicitor within dol if internal administrative appeal and review did not resolve matter in dispute would there be further options as hearings continued through 1962 nd 1963 legislated review procedure had been finalized then on

president believed wa s more responsible wageprice policy he observed it is evident now that decisive government action is needed to protect the public interest while labor and management continue their efforts to attack the causes of this problem80 many questions arose were inflationary wage settlements in the construction industry of which federal c onstruction was only part what congress had in mind in crafting the acts national emergenc provision did the president have authority under that provision to set as ide not only davisbacon but also the prevailing wage provisions of the federal program statutes enacted by the congress through several decades and could the pr esident preempt the various little davis bacon acts of the states we believe hodgson noted that th suspension should help produce more reasonable settlements throughout the indus try and restore better balance to the bargaining process while he defined neither reasonable nor better balance his intent seemed clear if the unions would moderate their demands and accept less costly wage settlements then balance could be restored and with it perhaps davis bacon meany branded the suspension as punitive against workers and an open invitation to unscrupulous employers to exploit workers81 and labor analyst john herling wrote that suspension had br ought cheer to the us chamber of commerce which for decades has

prevailing wage legislation gao enters the fray the bills that evolved into the davisb acon act of 1931 were crafted in part in response to rulings from then comptroller general j r mcca rl of the general accounting office gao to the effect that the federal government when contracting for construction work was forced to accept the lowest responsible bid the concept of responsibility during the period generally related to fiduciary matters and the ability of the bidder to produce the work fo r which contract was let wages and working conditions were not factors to be considered given th is interpretation as labor secretary doak explained the only course we had was to resort to legislation87httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94408crs24 88 congressional record february 28 1931 pp 65046508 89 special

period from the early 1960s to the early 1980s however seems to constitute discernable periodcomptroller general mccarl had reviewed early versions of the davisbacon legislation not altogether favorably and had suggested cer tain refinements although his advice was not immediately act ed upon the issues he raised remained and provided basis for continui ng gao interest in the statute88 under davisbacon the general acc ounting office has responsibilities with respect to debarment of contr actors found to be in violation of the statute and in that context with management of certain asp ects of federal expenditures 40 usc 276a2 in addition it has f unctions related more broadly to oversight of federal spending thus beyond historical circ umstance the agency has reason to be interested in the act oversight testimony 1962 on june 12 1962 j welch gao deputy general counsel appeared before the roosevelt subcommittee which was then conducting oversight hearings on the davisb acon act welch affirmed that since 1935 we gao have examined or passed upon practically every davisbacon act case in which irregularities have been re ported he stated that gaos experience indicates that the methods nd procedures adopted by dol for administration of the act have not kept pace with the requirements of the pe riod but he assured the panel that gao was neutral on whether t he davisbacon act should be either continued or repealed89 lengthy exchange attempted to cl arify the relationship between gao and dol where davisbacon was concerned though precise conclusion seems to have been reached it quickly became clear that the two agencies were not operating in complete harmony welch pointed to an ongoing series of negotiations between the comptroller the solicitor at dol and their aides which had seemed more nearly to define areas of disagreement than to resolve conflicts we feel welch concluded that if the depar tment of labor is to be given final responsibility with respect to davisbacon that should be accomplished by appr opriate amendment to the act90 both gao and the subcommittee appear to ve set the issue aside at this point however gao added as supplement to its oral testimony extended documentation questioning dols administration of the act91 gao urges repeal of davisbacon 1979 beginning in the early 1960s92 gao issued series of reports that we re

it was appropriate for the general accounting office to challenge in so direct manner policy which congress had reaffirmed through nearly half century94 nonetheless this latter study together with the several earlier reports provided rich resource for critics of the statute to draw upon95 in urging congress to reverse its s upport for davisbacon gao set out series of arguments first significant changes in economic conditions and the economic character of the construction industry si nce 1931 plus the passage of other wage laws make the act unnecessary second after nearly 50 years dol has not developed an effective program to issu and maintain current and accurate wage determinations it may be impractical to ever do so third the act results in unnecessary construction and administrative costs of several hundred million dollars annually if the construction projects reviewed by gao are representative and has an inflationary effect on the areas covere d by inaccurate wage rates and the economy as whole96 although the 1979 gao report was influen tial judging from the frequency with which it has been cited it did not win universal acclaim during hearings in june 1979 several members of congress puzzled over gaos activist stance representative frank thompson dnj fo r example asked comptroller general elmer staats how much of gaos work was undertaken at its own initiative staats

desirable for contr actors to bid on federal projects121 the regulations issued on may 28 1982 may be viewed as distillation of policy questions remaining from the initial discussion of the act in the 1920s and 1930s and reviewed variously since that time they dealt primarily with five areas first under the prereagan system wage rate paid to 30 of the workers in craft in locality absent more broadlybased rate could be termed prevailing for davisbacon purposes the 30 percent rule was now to be replaced by 50 percent rule second it had been charged that dol in setting locally prevailing wage rates had been importing urban rates for projects in rural areas the new regulations placed strict limits upon this practice third in determining davisbacon wage rates dol was said to have included within its data base wages pa id on other federal davisbaconcovered projects which it was charged could have the effect of ratcheting up the base rate fourth the new regulations expanded the potential use of helpers unskilled general utility workers on federal construction projects industry argued that this would reduce the cost of federal construction open work options for the unskilled and allow employers greater flexib ility labor argued that it could lead to craft fragmentation decreas employment of trained workers and reduce the pay of workers employed on federal contract construction work fifth under the copeland antikickback act of 1934 contractors are required to file weekly payroll reports nd an affirmation of compliance with the davisbacon pay requirements the new regulations retained the affirmation of compliance but required submission of payroll records only in enforcementcompliance actions all of the changes were opposed by organi zed labor but it appears the provisions dealing with the helper regulations nd the copeland acts reporting requirements were of primary importance to the unions122 the new regulations challenged in court on june 11 1982 the building and cons truction trades department bctd of the aflcio with others filed suit to block implementation of the new regulations123 on july 22 1982 just as the regulations were to be given effect

secretary donovan that the secretary had acted properly in substituting new 50 percent rule for the longstanding 30 percent rule with that single exception however he declared the regulations invalid and permanently enjoined the secretary and his agents from enforcing or giving any effect to the new rules fifteen secretaries of labor serving eight presidents have never altered the regulatory scheme the present secretarys claim to have di scovered wholly different congressional intent judge greene affirmed rings hollow in the light of history124 both parties appealed in january 1983 the department of justice on behalf of the dol challenged judge greenes decision in parallel move the bctd announced that it would appeal that porti on of judge greenes decision that was favorable to the secretary ie the issue of the 30 percent rule125 on july 5 1983 the us court of appeal s for the district of columbia issued split decision it stated that the legisla tive history of the act though not crystal clear suggests that congress contemplated that the secretarys authority to determine prevailing wages extended to finding the best way to do so in general the court deferred to the authority of the secretary first the secretary was permitted to implement the 50 percent rule andor an averaging procedure second the right of the secretary to exclude distant urban data from rural wage rate calculations was sustained third the secretary was allowed to exclude wage data from federal projects except in cases where suitable alternative data were available fourth the appeals court par tially approved and partially denied the new rules on the use of helpers directing that dol amend the proposed regulation dol promulgated revi sed final rule dealing with helpers on january 24 1989 which won c ourt approval congress however then refused to fund implementation of th helper rule and it rema ined as an open issue fifth the appeals court concurred with the district court that the changes in the reporting requirements of the copela nd act would weaken davisbacon enforcement would conflict with statutory intent and therefore would be beyond the authority of the secretary the department continued to experiment with language to alter the copeland reporting requirements and the issue became the subject of various legislative proposals none of them enacte d gradually the c opeland reporting issue seemed to disappear from the policy agenda the prior requirements remaining in tact126httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94408crs32 127 dlr january 17 1984 pp a11a12 128 dlr april 22 1992

during the first 6 decades of the acts history in 1934 president roosev elt suspended the act briefly for reasons that seem to have amounted to administr ative convenience in 1971 president nixon suspended the act again briefly justifying his action in economic terms to apply pressure upon construc tion contractors and building trades unions as part of his wageprice control strategy in early 1992 there were published reports that third suspension of the statute might be under consideration this time under the authority of president george bush such consideration seems to have commenced during the first months of that year in june it was reported that nationwide suspension was more likely than not128 but months passed and the issue seemed to drop from view the bush partial da visbacon suspension on october 14 1992 president bush by proclamation 6491 ordered davis bacon suspended for certain jurisdictions in the states of florida louisiana and hawaii taking note of hurricanes that had recently struck those states the president declared i find the conditions cau sed by hurricanes andrew and iniki to constitute national emergency within the meaning of section 6 of the davis bacon act the suspension was to continue until otherwise provided129 in suspending the act president bush added several elements to the concept of national emergency which variously defined had served as the basis for presidential action first suspension might enhance employment opportunities the dol it was noted had estimated that suspension could result in the creation of as many as five to eleven thousand new j obs in the construction industry in these states explanation of the basis for this estimate was given second suspension might be viewed as an ec onomy measure payment of the locally prevailing wage the davisbacon rate set by the administrations secretary of labor would increase the costs of rebuilding facilities in the several areas again more construction companies

remain the 19921993 davisbacon suspension had been urged upon president bush as matter of policy through the spring of 1992 long before the hurricanes struck his early reaction reportedly had been mixed140 whether his ultimate decision to suspend the act was primarily response to stormrelated velopments or reflection of broader policy c onsiderations may now be moot point other issues however remain what constitutes national emergency for purposes of suspension of the davisbacon act what wa s the intent of congress in this area does the concept of national em ergency under davisbacon allow the president to suspend the act for regional or local emergencies that may have only tenuous impact upon the nation at large for example an earthquake or floodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94408crs35 141

my distinguished associates level against it nevertheless its purpose of protecting the jobs of our nations cons truction workers must persuade us to reform rather than repeal the act senator hatfield explaine d that the bill was the product of long and arduous discussions that had commenced in oreg on among representatives of industry and labor and had continued in washington during the summer of 1995 he proposed three amendments to the existing statute first the threshold at which the act becomes applicable to federal projects would be raised from 2000 to 100000 second the frequency with which contractors are required to file wage and benefit schedules would be changed from weekly to monthly third train ees and apprentices would be excluded from the prevailing wage standard if they are enrolled in training program that is registered with the department of labor the bill contained other provisions as well tightening here expanding or redefining coverage there rather than repeal davisbacon he suggested s 1183 would rewrite that measure so that it can rve its original and laudable purpose149 companion legislation offered in the house as the summer of 1995 wore on consider

repeal would jeopardize the quality of life of every construction worker in this country152 although both bills s 1183 and hr 2472 died at the close of the 104th congress the movement for repeal of the davisbacon and copeland acts came to an abrupt halt it was reported that when repeal had actually seemed possible more than 14000 contractors have joined co alition with construction unions

although the davisbacon ac t has been in place for 75 years it remains focus of controversy through the closing years of the 20th century and into the 21st century aspects of its administration remain in contention but most areas of dispute have roots in the actments of 1931 and 1935 when the initial davisbacon gislation was under considerati on few appeared to have entertained doubts that the department of labor w ould be able rather easily to render wage rate determinations wh enever the stakeholders employers and workers were unable to agree with respect to what the locally prevailing wage actually was in practice wage rate determination has remained core issue with respect to the davisbacon act and remains as yet unresolved similarly classification of workers has remained an issue emerging most notably with proposals from the late 1970s to define treatment of helpers and to assess an appropriate pattern of utilization of apprentices two quite distinct groups of workers how workers are classified largely determines the rate at which they will be paid it may also reflect the attitude of the employing firm toward trade unions and collective bargaining other classification issues have arisen along with the definition of various statutory provisions what for example is meant by the site of the work for davisbacon purposes how should offsit work however defined be treated should truck drivers be da visbacon covered what ought to be the inter relationship between davisb acon and the other procurem ent statutes ie the walshhealey act setting labor sta ndards for goods produced under federal contracts and the mcnamaraohara act setting labor standards for service workers engaged under federal contracts annexation of the davisbacon act to variety of program statutes or inclusion of davisbacon prevailing wage provision within such statutes has added further complexities and opportunities for di spute pro and for example does davisbacon prevailing wage provision added to program statute insure protection for the workers involved it may or it may not depending upon the phrasing of coverage and th relationship of the davisbacon provision to the core statute

encourage higher quality of workmans hip enhanced productivity and reduced need for remedial work is there connection between skilltransfers apprenticeship training and davisbacon how are various groups of workers women minorities the unskilled nonunion workers affected by the operation of the statute after 75 years as one reads through the hearings and floor discussions it would seem that the verdict is still out indeed there would also seem to be very little solid data upon which to base an assessment still often normally on several occasions during each session of the congress the issu of davisbacon is raised anew amid largely unqualified asse rtions of impact pro and c on frequently without supporting empirical evidence concluding comment since the 1930s doubts have been raised about the need for the davisbacon act and about the ability of th department of labor to implement the statute in reasonable manner through most of its history however such criticism seems to have been muted in the 1950s as davis bacon provisions were increasingly added to program statutes critics became more vocal and increasingly so during the 1960s through the 1980s in the mid1990s there s eemed to be some suggestion that critics were making inroads on the act and that re peal or significant revision was likely then suddenly the climate changed and th rough the past dozen years debate has cooled though criticism has not entirely disappeared the act has been the focus of numerous h earings scores of floor debates and has sparked an extended body of literature studies reports analyses but the thrust of congressional policy has been consistently toward expanded coverage and strengthening of the act through the years certain policy issu with respect to davisbacon have remained under discussion and to the exte nt that these questions continue to be raised they can be said to be unresolved indeed some issues that were subjects of debate in the 1930s continued to be deba ted largely in the same terms and to provoke similar demands for ad ministrative andor legisl ative action the growing davisbacon literature pro nd with refutations and countercritiques seems to offer little that is new and appears to have left critical aspects of the act its administration and its impact unilluminated172 the davisbacon act has now become an institutional part of wage structure and contracting practice within the construction industry what the impact of repeal or significant modification of the act mig ht be is not entirely clear should

walshhealey act and the mcnamara ohara act this may be an area in which further study could be productive as the 21st century advances several additiona l elements may be added to the debate over davisbacon or have an effect upon the ch aracter of that debate first some perceive gradual weaken ing of the trade union movement both in actual membership and in political influence this could translate into diminished public and c ongressional support for davisbacon and if that perception is accurate it could result in some refocusing of labors legislative priorities at the same time it should be recalled that the davi sbacon act was intended to promote stability within the constructi on industry as well as to protect labor standards might eliminati on of davisbacon adversel impact industry producing uncertainties with respect to wages as an element of the bidding process alter manpower utilization patterns increase the risk of accidents in the workplace or render less effective skill development and transfer now commonly resolved through apprenticeship programs where th ere is davisbacon coverage173 second there has been gradual change over time in demographics members of congress policy analysts tr ade union leaders with others may longer fully share or appreciate the experience of the preworld war ii era with the retirement of the generations of the 1930s and 1940s and attendant loss of certain historical perspectives there may longer be broad understanding of the rationale for certain statutes fo r protection of workers that an older generation may have taken for granted thus if these labor standards statutes such as davisbacon are to survive they may need to be justified anew either through education or through experience some of it perhaps painful but on the other hand might it be that there may really be longer need for statutes such as the davis bacon act or might it be feasible to recodify davisbacon with the several related statutes as more general fede ral contract laborma nagement standards enactment third the reemergence of the federa l deficit and budgetary constraints resulting from security concerns may provoke more critical review of assumptions made during earlier periods of our national experience as result where certain statutes are criticized as imposing unnecessa ry costs or as presenting significant enforcement and compliance problems there may be increased willingness to alter or to dispense with these older perh aps less well understood laws and to replace them with programs and regulations judged to be more vital to younger constituencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94408crs45 174 see also crs report rl32086 federal contract labor standards statutes an overview september 22 2003 by william g whittakerfor all of these reasons it may be useful to review the evolution of the davis bacon act and of other federa l contract labor standards st atutes as well in order to provide rational foundation for their reassessment and for the development of future directions of public policy174
