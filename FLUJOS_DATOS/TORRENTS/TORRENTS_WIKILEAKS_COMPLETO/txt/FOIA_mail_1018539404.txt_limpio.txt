from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to edward cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu subject re your letter to science date thu 11 apr 2002 113644 0400 cc esperwslch kbriffaueaacuk tosbornueaacuk pjonesueaacuk tcrowleydukeedu rbradleygeoumassedu jtouarizonaedu srutherfordvirginiaedu mannvirginiaedu ed it will take some time to digest these comments but my initial response is one of some disappointment i will resist the temptation to make the letter to science available to the others on this list because of my fears of violating the embargo policy i know examples of where doing so has led to science retracting piece form publication so thanks for also resisting the temptation to do so but i must point out that the piece by malcolm and is very similar in its content to the letter of clarification that you and i originally crafted to send to science some weeks ago before your coauthor objected to your involvement if there is objection on your part id be happy to send that to everyone because it is not under consideration in science quite unfortunate development as far as im concerned the only real change from that version is the discussion of the use of rcs that is in large part malcolms contribution but i stand behind what malcolm says i think there are some real sins of omission with regard to the use of rcs too and it would be an oversight on our part now to comment on these finally with regard to the scaling issues let simply attach plot which speaks more loudly than several pages possibly could the plot takes epser et not smoothed but the annual values and scales it against the full northern hemisphere instrumental record 18561990 annual mean record and compares against the entire 20th century instrumental record 18561999 as well as with mbh99 and its uncertainties suppose that esper et is indeed representative of the full northern hemisphere annual mean as mbh99 purports to be to the extent that differences emerge between the two in assuming such scaling i interpret them as differences which exist due to the fact that the extratropical northern hemisphere series and full northern hemisphere series likely did not covary in the past the same way they covary in the 20th century when both are driven predominantly in relative sense by anthropogenic forcing rather than natural forcing and internal variability what the plot shows is quite remarkable scaled in this way there is remarkably little difference between esper et and mbh99 in the first place the two reconstructions are largely within the error estimates of mbh99 but moreover where they do differ this could be explainable in terms of patterns of enhanced midlatitude continental response that were discussed for example in shindell et 2001 in science last december so i think this plot says lot its say that there are some statistically significant differences but certainly grounds to use esper et to contradict mbh99 or ipcc 2001 as sadly i believe at least one of the published pieces tacitly appears to want to do it is shame that such plot which i think is far more meaningful comparison of the two records was not shown in either esper et or the briffa osborn commentary ive always given the group of you adequate opportunity for commentary on anything were about to publish in nature or science i am saddened that many of my colleagues and i have always liked to think friends didnt affort the same opportunity before this all erupted in our face it could have been easily avoided but thats water under the bridge finally before any more backandforths on this i want to make sure that everyone involved understands that none of this was in any way ever meant to be personal at least not on my part and if it ever has at least on my part seemed that way than i offer my apologiesit was never intended that way this is completely about the science to the extent that i andor others feel that the science has been misrepresented in places however i personally will work very hard to make sure that more balanced view is available to the community especially because the implications are so great in this case this is what i sought to do w the nyt piece and my npr interview and that is what ive sought to do and malcolm to as far as im concerned with the letter to science being bit sloppy w wording and omission etc is something were all guilty of at times but i do consider it somewhat unforgivable when it is obvious how that sloppiness can be exploited and you all know exactly what im talking about so in short i think are some fundamental issues over which were in disagreement and where those exist i will not shy away from pointing them out but i hope that is not misinterpreted as in any way personal i hope that suffices mike ps it seemed like an omission to not cc in peck and scott rutherford on this exchange so ive done that i hope nobody minds this addition at 1057 am 41102 0400 edward cook wrote hi mike and malcolm i have received the letter that you sent to science and will respond to it here first in some detail and later in edited and condensed form in science since much of what you comment and criticize on has been disseminated to number of people in your mikes somewhat inflammatory earlier emails i am also sending this lengthy reply out to everyone on that same email list save those at science i hadnt responded in detail before but do so now because your criticisms will soon be in the public domain however i am not attaching your letter to science to this email since that is not yet in the public domain it is up to you to send out your submitted letter to everyone if you wish i must say at the beginning that some parts of your letter to science are as flawed as your claims about esper et hereafter ecs the briffaosborn perspectives piece points out an important scaling issue that indeed needs further examination however to claim as you do that they show that the ecs 40year lowpass temperature reconstruction is flawed begs the question flawed by how much it is not at all clear that scaling the annually resolved rcs chronology to annually resolved instrumental temperatures first before smoothing is the correct way to do it the ecs series was never created to examine annual or even decadal timescale temperature variability rather as was clearly indicated in the paper it was created to show how one can preserve multicentennial climate variability in certain long treering records as refutation of broeckers truly flawed essay as ecs showed in their paper table 1 the highfrequency correlations with nh mean annual temperatures after 20year highpass filtering is only 015 that result was expected and it makes meaningful difference if one uses only extratropical nh temperature data so while the amplitude of the temperaturescaled 40year lowpass ecs series might be on the high end but still plausible given the gridded borehole temperature record shown in briffaosborn scaling on the annually resolved data first would probably have the opposite effect of excessively reducing the amplitude i am willing to accept an intermediate value but probably not low enough to satisfy you really the more important result from ecs is the enhanced pattern of multicentennial variability in the nh extratropics over the past 1100 years we can argue about the amplitude later but the enhanced multicentennial variability can not be easily dismissed i should also point out again that you saw fig 3 in ecs before it was even submitted to science and never pointed out the putative scaling flaw to at that time with regards to the issue of the late 20th century warming the fact that i did not include some reference to or plot of the uptodate instrumental temperature data cf briffaosborn is what i regard as of omission what i said was that the estimated temperatures during the mwp in ecs approached those in the 20th century portion of that record up to 1990 i dont consider the use of approached as an egregious overstatement but i do agree with you that i should have been bit more careful in my wording there as you know i have publicly stated that i never intended to imply that the mwp was as warm as the late 20th century eg my new york times interview however it is bit of overkill to state twice in the closing sentences of the first two paragraphs of your letter that the ecs results do not refute the unprecedented late 20th century warming i would suggest that once is enough ecs were also very clear about the extratropical nature of their data so what you say in your letter about the reduced amplitude in your series coming from the tropics while perhaps worth pointing out again is beating dead horse however i must say that the of omission in the briffaosborn piece concerning the series shown in their plot is bit worrying as they say in the data file of series used in their plot and in keiths april 5 email response to you briffaosborn only used your land temperature estimates north of 20 degrees and recalibrated the mean of those estimates to the same domain of landonly instrumental temperatures using the same calibration period for all of the other nonborehole series in the same way i would have preferred it if they had used your data north of 30n to make the comparisons bit more onetoone however i still think that their results are interesting in particular they reproduce much of the reduced multicentennial temperature variability seen in your complete nh reconstruction so if the amplitude of scaled ecs multicentennial variability is far too high as you would apparently suggest it appears that it is also too low in your estimates for the nh extratropics north of 20n i think that we have to stop being so aggressive in defending our series and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each in order to improve them that is the way that science is supposed to work i must admit to being really irritated over the criticism of the ecs treering data standardized using the rcs method first of all ecs acknowledged up front the declining available data prior to 1200 and its possible effect on interpreting an mwp in the mean record ecs also showed bootstrap confidence intervals for the mean of the rcs chronologies and showed where the chronologies drop out even allowing for the reduction in the number of represented sites before 1400 ecs fig 2d and the reduction in overall sample size ecs fig 2b there is still some evidence for significantly above average growth during two intervals that can be plausibly assigned to the mwp of course we would like to have had all 14 series cover the past 10001200 years this doesnt mean that we cant usefully examine the data in the more weakly replicated intervals in any case the replication in the mwp of the ecs chronology is at least as good as in other published treering estimates of largescale temperatures eg nh extratropical covering the past 1000 years it also includes more long treering records from the nh temperate latitudes than ever before so to state that this is perilous basis for an estimate of temperature on such large geographic scale is disingenuous especially when it is unclear how many millennialong series are contributing the majority of the temperature information in the mannbradleyhughes mbh reconstruction prior to ad 1400 lets be balanced here i basically agree with the closing paragraph of your letter the ecs record was never intended to refute mbh it was intended first and foremost to refute broeckers essay in science that unfairly attacked tree rings to this extent ecs succeeded very well the comparison of ecs with mbh was logical thing to do given that it has been accepted by the ipcc as the benchmark reconstruction of nh annual temperature variability and change over the past millennium several other papers have made similar comparisons between mbh and other even more geographically restricted estimates of past temperature so i dont apologize in the slightest for doing so in ecs the correlations in table 2 between ecs and mbh were primarily intended to demonstrate the probable largescale lowfrequency temperature signal in ecs independent of explicitly calibrating the individual rcs chronologies before aggregating them the results should actually have pleased you because for the 20200 year band ecs and mbh have correlations of 060 to 068 depending on the period used given that ecs is based on great deal of new data not used in mbh this result validates to reasonable degree the temperature signal in mbh in the 20200 year band over the past 1000 years given the incendiary and sometimes quite rude emails that came out at the time when ecs and briffaosborn were published i could also go into the whole complaint about how the review process at science was flawed i will only say that this is very dangerous game to get into and complaints of this kind can easily cut both ways i will submit an appropriately edited and condensed version of this reply to science regards ed dr edward r cook doherty senior scholar treering laboratory lamontdoherty earth
