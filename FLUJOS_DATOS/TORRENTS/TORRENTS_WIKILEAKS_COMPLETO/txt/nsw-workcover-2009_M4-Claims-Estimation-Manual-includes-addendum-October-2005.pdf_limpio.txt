of the claim is after one of the scheduled review points then base the estimate on the next review point see the examples below example 1 next review point is 26 weeks if you receive the first notice of clai m 13 weeks after the date of the injury you calculate the initial estimate as if you were completing 26 week review see rules 37 to 40 you next review the claim at the 26 week review point or

review period method b was created at the request of insurers that wished to be able to spread the workload more evenly throughout the year insurers that choose method b must conduc t the reviews in

estimate what if notification of the injury is delayed 28 if the initial notification of the injury to the insurer is more than 7 days after the worker notified the employer of the injury minimum of 3000 is to be estimated if you have information that indicates 3000 will not cover the expected cost of the claim then make the estimate usin g that information if the first time you are notified of the injury is after 10 weeks from the date of the injury then base the estimate on the next review point see rule 152 for examples of the next review point how do you estimate what weekly com pensation benefits to include 29 for the initial estimate you need to include the total amount of weekly compensation payments for the number of weeks that the evidence you have suggests the worker will be off work to do that you need to gather informati on from multiple sources including as many of the following as possible the current injury management plan duration and review dates the current medical certificate review dates and the expected period of incapacity the anticipated duration or the injur and cost of any return to work plan the anticipated duration and cost of any treatment plan physiotherapy chiropractic osteopathy psychology etc any medical reports provided by the treating doctor and any treating specialist interviews with the em ployer worker doctor and

recovered after those injuries the availability of rehabilitation if you have clear evidence about the length of that period use the period shown in schedule one for the type of injury the worker has if period of incapacity is expected to be less than 1 2 weeks 292 if the period shown in schedule one for the injury is less than 12 weeks you must monitor the file during the first 12 weeks and

effective 1st february 2002 schedule one estimated injury recovery periods what is the aim of schedule one 30 schedule one provides guide as to the period of provisional weekly payments that is reasonably likely to arise for each type of injury you use those periods with the information specific to the workers situation to make your initial estimate what if the workers injury is not li sted 31 if the workers injury is not listed then base your initial estimate on the scenario that is reasonably likely to arise you may consider an injury type in schedule one that is similar to the workers injury for example worker who has suffered third degree burns is reasonably likely to take more than 12 weeks to recover so although you may approve provisional payments for the maximum 12 weeks you need to base your estimate in accordance with the many factors that may influence the workers re covery and eventual return to work what if the workers experience differs from the expected period 32 the periods for each injury shown in the table represent the optimal time it may take for an injury to heal the table provides benchmarks that are based on the assumption that the injury is not complicated by multiple medical physical psychosocial cognitive or environmental factors also many workers will return to work within the expected recovery period on the other hand few may not you need to base your estimate on the sound information you have available to you rule 29 suggests some sources of information you can use to make your decision chapter i temporary total incapacity initial estimates 32 workcover nsw claims estimation manual effective 1st february 2002 how does the availability of suitable duties at the workplace affect the workers estimated return to work 33 the type of injury the worker has and the type of duties available at the workplace will affect the time it takes for worker to return to work some workers with certain injuries may be able to return to some kind of work before they ve fully recovered some workers will not be able to return to any kind of work until they have fully recovered you will need to consider this when making your estimate for example worker with epicondylitis who performs clerical duties may take lon ger to return to work than labourer because of the type of duties they perform the availability of suitable duties is
