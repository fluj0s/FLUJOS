anyone has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc12 renum 12 12 jun 61 emeter actions errors in auditing emeter actions errors in auditing lecture given on 12 june 1961 based on clearsound only thank you wuff well thank you for giving an opportunity to have little rest and relaxation you know what what most people consider work i dont and when i get cases running off the rails far off on administrative lines trying to prove conclusively that the organization cannot possibly survive it seems an awful long way to have to audit and thats just about what it amounts to somebody presents with the fait accompli of auditing is absolutely vital and necessary twelve thousand miles away or eight thousand miles away thats generally what administrative things break down to by the way people do odd things to you they present you with emergencies enormous emergencies and they think i dont know yet that theyre just trying to reach thats their idea of reaching if i appeared on the ground it would be very very simple to straighten out the thing its almost the heroic effort necessary to keep things running wrong its almost fantastic its almost fantastic i just think the people in these governments just absolutely must be just sweating just sweating blood day and night i mean how can they manage it you know they just i can see them up now at 10 downing street and state department seventeen hundredandsomething pennsylvania avenue i can just see those poor fellows you know trying to hold things in disorder because youd be surprised the ease with which things will snap into order it isnt an automaticity particularly but order is always easier to achieve than disorder you have to work at disorder and yet the world at large is so in disagreement with this principle that i wrote story one time about fellow who went ashore trying to under hellfire and brimstone captain and he went ashore in china trying to and the captain had given him big lecture about the ease it was you know to drift into the ways of wrong and all of that and how easy this was and how simple this was for young man to have all this happen you know and the fellow goes ashore and he just overtly you see tries desperately to get into some trouble or have some excitement you see and its all complete flop well what is this this is junio the 12th sesenta all right if any student has any question he cannot live without being answered speak up you mean all of your questions have been answered female voice they arent coming up till i start auditing what was that again got one coming up female voice i said mine are going to come up when i start auditing oh i see all right yes mike male voice i dont know if its off the point but one of the questions we were asked was phd i have idea what that is hm male voice phd you dont know what phd is well now lets see who was here when mary sue gave the very adequate demonstration of that all right madge would you be good enough to show him how conclusively you can demonstrate that the cat has pdhed him will you do that for him thatll tell you all about it thats the easiest one thats easier to demonstrate than talk about nobody would believe it until they see it you see everybody has been pdhed according to the meter if you dont know how to ask questions its wonderful example in how to get wrong information i want to repeat something speaking about meter just mentioning it in passing now are you having better luck using instant read than latent read audience mmhm yes is there anybody still in flat one about this whether you use yes male voice i have problem ron uh when the pc answers say is it all right to audit in this room you dont get any motion on the meter whether the pc says or yes and then say he says yes and then you get drop after he says yes this is the latent read that youre referring to thats latent read male voice latent read that is latent read meter reading on the pcs reply or response is latent read male voice do you exploit it hm male voice do you exploit this one try to find out what it is brother id drop that one so hard it goes plop you know id just pay attention to it male voice okay now thats what i want to know just attention to it he didnt know from nothing your meter knew so he says it isnt all right now i wont act on it but im still in twoway communication with the pc you see its code break not to be so i handle this thing two ways 1 im not going to handle it and 2 i make the pc feel all right about it i usually handle these things somewhat on this order is it all right to audit in this room pc long comm lag looks around nothings happening you know meter dead calm at the instant i asked the question pc says im not so sure and i say well well probably get more used to it as we go on thank you doesnt create an arc break the pc kind of perks up and says well all right youre gonna be overbearing now this latent read is licking lot of organizations right now and lot of auditors in the field its licking them they dont dig this one and their security checks are going up toward the hundredhour mark we had been very successful in handling people in johannesburg in the course and we had terrific course and it was fine and when peter williams went back down to australia he was utterly stunned at the length of time it was going to take to do anything in the way of an assessment or security check or anything else now this was the dog datum that had slid in unnoticed it had just crept in under the door everybody was reading latent reads see that was the difference nobody was getting the show on the road and he hadnt actually noticed this essential fact i didnt notice it myself until id been sitting around here for about month watching what you were doing and it suddenly occurred to theyre doing something wrong but i cant put my finger on it and mary sue in watching what you were doing and in giving checks and that sort of thing and trying to demonstrate it suddenly came up with the datum she said auditors are reading an emeter that falls after the fact she didnt say it that precisely but that was it she had lot of other things to say about it but this is the way this thing goes you see if you dont get response on the emeter within something on the order of tenth of second of your question everything thereafter is noresponse you got it its noresponse now we dont care if it whistles dixie its noresponse in the first place you are not auditing the analytical mind and if all that was wrong with people was the analytical mind then youd have it made you see because guy could think his way straight so fast itd make his head swim he is responding to the reactivity of the reactive mind and therefore all the auditor is interested in is the reactive mind and the only thing which responds instantly on the meter is the reactive mind thats all anything else his blood pressures responding or his sudden memory that he didnt put out the cat oh my god and theres the cat home all day in the apartment this kind of thing you see gets in now we have another order of read of this character and these two things are similar we have to give this other one name now we got several orders of magnitude of read that are really high school emeter reading one of those is the rise you dont pay any attention to rise now we have some new students here and im very happy with you and youre all welcome and nobody is going to be cross with you well try to teach you everything we know how to teach you until you report to us that somebodys needle rose why dont you report that there is air on earth or some other astonishing fact why not send telegram to the prime minister concerning the fact that farms in sussex are covered with dirt i mean its just the same thing so it rose well why do you ignore this phenomenon of rising needle and say nothing about it you cannot establish what started it rising because the preclear did not observe what it was started it rising and you might have had five words in your sentence and any one of them may have started it rising or the fact that bee just buzzed past the window could start it rising its anything the pc would be unwilling to confront but to establish what it was would require perhaps fifteen minutes to half an hour search of going over every possible element all to what event to find out that the pc cant confront well man everybody knows that if he could confront everything he wouldnt in the least bit be having any trouble in existence anywhere at all so all the rising needle has said is that the pc is not clear and you know that and i know that so why should we research it see what triggers the rise of the needle and theres some old nursery rhymes and so forth that go along with this thing that i dont remember very well but they have oh yeah i think theres some character by the name of chaucer wrote one about it so what i mean youre not announcing knowable factor see youre announcing an unknowable factor so theres point in it now what stops needle from rising you can establish this fellow is able to confront cats and something lord knows what an electronic circuit going off at the north pole causing difference in the variation of the intensity of earth could start needle rising so what he can confront cats so we say to him cats and the needle stops rising and we stop saying cats the needle keeps on rising so we know cats stops the needle now similarly in giving security check if you ask question and the fellow has rising needle youre not reading the rising needle youre reading change of characteristic and you ask him have you ever illicitly diamondbought you say and the needle stops ah but thats change of characteristic it didnt fall it didnt theta bop it didnt rock slam but if youve got an instant read on did you ever illicitdiamondsbought you press it you see the instant read is instantly it stops if just for second see its going up very nicely and all of sudden you say did you ever illicitly diamondbought man thats change of characteristic get your jackrabbit ears flapping that means he has illicitly diamondsbought at some time or another probably in this lifetime probably got them in his pocket right now but youll find pc who is having very rough time who reads on very very high sensitivity knob here will very often just rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and up goes the needle and you just ask them security checks and you know that theyve done practically every question in the security check they have major crime on for which theyre being looked for by interpol see and you sit there in fascinated amazement irresponsibility on all dynamics is so low that they have reality on an overt or withhold so you of course get needle reaction of any kind whatsoever because the individual must to some degree connect with the reactive mind to spark it off you see there must be connection between the individual and that area of the reactive mind thats why you cant take somebody who has bad neck and all of sudden say well im going to cure your bad neck and you work on him for days and then you happen accidentally to ask the question of hows your neck and he says how would i know and you say well isnt your bad neck getting any better he says well its never been bad see his heads always over this way you see never been bad theres nothing wrong with my neck its fact i mean the guy has reality on it its out of his reach so you can only reach those things in the reactive mind that the individual himself is capable at that time of becoming responsible for or aware of and the emeter tells you what he is capable of becoming responsible for or aware of it spots this responsibility factor for you which gives you reality factor therefore you can audit find exploit things that appear on the emeter but you cannot audit find or exploit things that wont appear on the emeter because theyre beyond the zone of responsibility of the pc completely beyond it do you if you were to go down here to dartmoor scrubs and fish out the warden or somebody else and put him on the emeter and you say well have you ever beaten up any prisoners have you ever been mean to any prisoners and so forth and hed say we just do the best in this best of all possible worlds and so help look at his knuckles you know and theyre bleeding well you say how about those knuckles bleeding well what about that have you done anything with any prisoner lately oh well fellow got in my road coming up here to see you but of course he was in my road and he shouldnt have been there you see it was his fault and i didnt do anything to him at all this becomes utterly pluperfectly fascinating theres the evidence the evidence is right there and the fellow has reality on it so dont be dismayed because its this responsibility factor hes incapable of taking responsibility for the action even potentially the emeter only reads on what an individual is responsible of taking the reaction for and thats all that itll only read on that if hes potentially responsible for taking responsibility if hes potentially responsible then and only then youre going to get an action on the meter so it doesnt you see read catalog of crime like an ibm machine you know every crime he has on the whole track between now and the beginning of track are not all cataloged and will not all fall out with certain degrees of read if you have an idea that an emeter is going to do that kind of thing then disabuse yourself of it the emeter will eventually do it but just as the emeter reads the reactive mind and reads reactivity and nothing but reactivity so it also ergo perforce must read what the individual can be potentially responsible for therefore when you give repetitively security check of an individual when you potentially have that individual capable of being responsible for certain of the crimes on the security check hell come up with withholds on them suddenly and mysteriously that he never came up with before so this is an instant and immediate test of whether or not you are advancing the responsibility factor of the pc by auditing if the pc has become more capable of taking responsibility then and only then are you making progress in auditing and then and only then will you get new withholds so dont be surprised when the meter starts reacting on security check that you just finished giving ten hours of auditing before you finished security check now youve been auditing person and now all of sudden hes got whole new set of withholds and you say well what fool i am that i didnt catch these in the first place this might be an amateurs response why didnt i catch all those withholds in the first place well you know the guy has to be potentially responsible for withholding on those exact things before they register see he doesnt even consider them an overt and as you process preclear who is going motivator motivator motivator how mean they all were to how mean they all were to motivator motivator motivator when theyre going along this line dont be amazed that they have never done anything to anybody and that you cant find it on the emeter that they ever have done anything to anybody anyplace ever dont be surprised see its simply an index of the responsibility of the pc and its terribly bad you process him for little while on the prehav scale one way or the other and what happens when you process him he gains in responsibility and as soon as his responsibility is up any way shape or form all of sudden it isnt motivator motivator motivator the pc did something amazing you dont hear about the husband beating them day and night just standing there wearing his arm out the pc at least comes up to the point of where well it must be very tiring i must have worn the man out and so forth theyve come up that high and eventuallyafter youve been auditing them for hours and hours and running general prehav levels or sop goals or something you give them another security check of one kind or another and you find the astonishing fact that the way these fights start is she usually takes hot iron and takes his best shirt or any of his clothes and starts pressing them and then leaves the iron on you see and thats usually the way these fights start now we get it going little further and we theres more hours of auditing and we give security check and we find this astonishing development that the person calculatedly plotted to make the husband mad it wasnt an accident the person has become aware of the mechanical processes and is taking responsibility for the mechanical processes which make them turn an iron on and put it on new shirt or something like that and burn straight through it theyre getting even with him and now they will begin to wonder whats wrong with them that theyre doing something like this and there youre really seeing case start operating and when you dont see case start operating at least that much watch out because youre not making progress if somebody is going motivator motivator motivator motivator fifty hours of processing later motivator motivator motivator motivator good youre not making any advance now if case for instance is given security check and then given general run just routine 2 and then given another security check and you dont now find new withholds on the security check watch it because something happened there you goofed theres something wrong with that general run the case didnt make advance that means youre running the pc with the rudiments out thats what it means theres something you can do about it yeah well run through your security check on the basis of instant read and when you get to the end of the run its just you know give it lick and promise look for instant reads thats about it its almost as fast as you can read security check by the way you arent going to find very much on it when you get an instant read clear it up and go on to the next question get right back to auditing and now what is the present time problem what is the arc break what external activity is the pc engaging in that is countering the auditing lets get real curious you know these great big fruit horns that they sometimes display you know theres one up in the monkey room by the way theres monkey sitting there with mexican hat on with one of these horns of plenty well its just like turning one of those things upside down only the fruit squashes all over the floor crash yeah well outside of the fact theyve been getting drunk every night before they came in to auditing sessions and outside of the fact theyve been trying to ruin your reputation while youre auditing them and outside of the fact that they had already had bet with somebody that they wouldnt get any gain in processing the case is good the case is making progress see aside from that and its gross dont look for little tiny things it will be gross error all auditing errors which can suspend case today are gross and what do i mean by gross auditing error complete stupid stumbling unfamiliarity with the trs and model session and the emeter it really has to be bad next complete and utter disregard of the rudiments just wholehog not paying any attention whatsoever to tone arm reads when the person leaves the session and tone arm reads when they come back into the session not not even being vaguely curious about it assessing the prehav scale for instance by only assessing the level for compete well they read in bulletin that when you assess the level on the primary scale why then you go over into the secondary scale and that is one level so you just what you do of course is just take every word in the secondary scale and not only that if person would do that that stupidly they would also do this well you just run one leg of the bracket like what has your husband done to you thank you what has your husband done to you thank you what has your husband done to you thank you now when you get errors of auditing adding up like that you get gain and im telling you and youre going to learn it and youre going to get subjective reality on it just like i had the blunders which prevent cases from advancing are so gross as to stagger you they are so gross that you wont believe them therefore you dont look for them when youre training auditors or something you just dont look in an hgc or something like that for errors this gross youre taking it for granted that the errors are minor that the pc had little arc break at the beginning of session with the auditor and therefore didnt advance in the session and thats what this is all about you ask about this and you try to clean up this little arc break and everything is ooooh somehow or another pc doesnt still make any gains and you go along and you just flounder and fumble and you wonder where youre going and what youre doing the error there is the auditor never shows up for sessions you think im kidding but thats the order of magnitude of error its big you see i mean itll be big itll be something on the order of well every night after the auditing day the auditor has date with the preclears wife see you take my tip you look for gross errors just as were running at tenthousandhorsepower today plus so it takes tenthousandhorsepower error to combat it and dont you go looking when youre training auditors or supervising processing or trying to look dont you go around trying to find that little tiny little thing that wouldve held it all up because youre asking the same silly question as how can you put matchstick in front of the twentieth century limited and stop the train well you cant it has to be another twentieth century limited and it will be too but youd be amazed ive done some crosschecking of this character that is just would stoney you just gone over it and over it and over it trying to find out why we werent making gain why we werent making gain and i just got one the other day we had an auditor who just wasnt getting good results thats all wasnt getting good results and look what he learned about running an emeter was the totality of running an emeter few days ago and he thanked very carefully look the guys been assessing on the prehav scale he has been running security checks but he didnt know anything about setting up meter what he had learned is the thirdofadialdrop test he learned several things about meter and he told what these things were that hed learned about meter hed learned how to set up meter hed learned to set it up and he knew now that you read by the needle you talk about gross error i mean how could the guy have gotten any gains at all running assessments when he couldnt read meter you get the idea so this is as gross as the errors are thats all theyre just horrendous i i see that you really dont probably believe you dont have much reality on what im saying there but you will have you will have its grim and you sweating your brains out you know the worst thing that person who is supervising auditing can do is start inventing unusual and gargantuan solutions because the auditor hes giving them to just cant seem to make gain on the case so the auditor keeps coming in and saying that didnt work well actually this is the old whizzeroo on the california response theres thing called the california maturity test and the california this and california that well actually theres an in dianetics there was the california response inevitably if you said something about new process when i was working out there somebody would say oh yes thats very interesting i was using that last year sounds strange you see you said well theres this new scale and theres the well i was using it last year they always used it last year you see now i listened to this for over year before i finally got proper response to it and that was became the california response and that is what were you using year ago well thats corker theyve even forgotten what you said practically see they dont remember anything that you said and they come out with some wild rendition and youve just told them about the noeffect scale you see all right and they say well yes well what were you using year ago exactly what was it and they say well just what youre talking about what exactly were you using year ago and they say well well we put these phonograph records on phonograph and we clamp the earphones on the pc you see and wed say be calm be calm be calm thats what we were doing year ago and it was just exactly what you said you try to get any sequitur out of this you see thats the way to handle those characters anyway similarly the most common failure that you have in managing several cases at the same time is this one person comes in and says you know that that you told to do yesterday and you say yes uh well uh that was your mistake right there you see they say well triumphantly see well it didnt work and you say well i dont know what is it doing and they give you big rundown you think up new and extraordinary solution you see and you give them that and they go away and they come back the next day they say it didnt work ohho it didnt work for god sakes get bright enough sooner or later to say to them directly and positively what didnt work and you inevitably get some outpouring of sewage that has nothing to do with anything you have ever been talking about well i keep standing the pc on his head in the corner and he the blood keeps rushing to his head and its obvious that he isnt clear because he can experience physical effect i mean itll be some gross nonsense of this character and you have been pounding your brains out trying to get this case moving you see thinking putting it on automatic that your instructions and advices were all going to be followed and if you get that type of repetitive action that is one of your gross errors that you must be alert to that you must wake up to listen if youve figured out case from to izzard knowing scientology and you ask somebody to run this on the case ill sw ill promise you something is going to happen it isnt going to be well it didnt work see so obviously its gross error you keep looking for something that works on the pc when the first order or instruction you gave which is take the pc up to the auditing room hasnt been followed yet im not getting 15 on the subject of auditors im talking about auditing failures and auditing failures always stem from gross very gross errors and they are so gross that you will overlook them and when you start giving extraordinary solutions on top of these gross auditing errors of course youre just getting place at hell of rate the thing for you to do is pick up bulletin and say now lets see it says something here about routine 1 now describe to in few words what routine 1 is and the person says well thats tell person to be three feet back of his head isnt it yeah well he has never read that bulletin and youve been telling him to put it into effect and hes never read it ive got wonderful example of that right now on the administrative lines i was just making crack about i have report through the lines that certain area was utterly disregarding all bulletins because they were so busy in the middle of an emergency they couldnt put any of them into an effect you see because of the emergency they were having with finances and other things you see i got that report through from an independent source that they just didnt know anything about any bulletins and sure enough about three days later i get total 11 piece of nonsense about how everything is going broke and its all big emergency its just total glee of insanity all the way through this report how do you like that just glee of insanity backing up the hearse telling you how bad it all is and so forth well look if these characters have never followed any instructions of any kind whatsoever i can guarantee you theyll be in trouble see theyll just be in over their heads particularly if they had carefully reversed every instruction they had heard rumor of you see how that goes hand in glove so it happens on administrative lines and its something for man in business to know if somebodys department is going all wrong and you just cant seem to put it right and you just cant seem to issue orders that put it right and you just cant seem to do anything to put it right its about time you looked for the gross error because its not little error of he has one too many motions in feeding the stuff to the accounts machine see its not that at all its the fact that every time he receives the mail he dumps it in the waste basket see its that kind of an error and this is goes hand in glove with he feeds you bad news and he says he cant do the job and there isnt any way possible to get the show on the road and usually goes along with he needs more appropriation for his department and more help all these things sort of fit in in package see all right you say well the poor guy hes struggling there and maybe he isnt very bright and you are being very very kind patient and so forth about this and so you try to give him help by giving him instructions and he keeps coming back and telling you the instructions didnt work and the department doesnt get any better well the whole thing about it is you never gave instructions that had anything to do with what was wrong in the department what you should do about the time something really starts to run real wrong is to go look for the gross error and just keep looking for the gross error because youll find so many minor errors that they will trap your attention and so you never see the gross error get the idea you look at these little errors naturally such person in auditing case would have all of his rudiments out or something like this naturally but look look for the gross error what is the error here when youve got case that just doesnt advance or things just arent going what is the error it its big be something like the order of he just hasnt clue you might discover it by looking at him to find out he holds the emeter upside down i mean itll be something weird like this you know and it almost exceeds your imagination but it also comes out of the impulse to make nothing out of something theyve got to make nothing out of something and this comes back to subject known as productivity which businessmen are very interested in and which russias going to pieces on and which england can do much better with and the united states is going down for the third time on the effort to produce is onehalf of the dichotomy and all strikes and everything else are on single button and the that is the effort not to produce and youve got people all over the place who are totally dedicated to nonproduction totally dedicated to results im afraid thats fact totally dedicated to the nosurvival of situation well it comes about naturally you come its as half the dichotomy you keep telling them all right the organization has got to survive the organization the state the nation the group mankind got to survive got to survive and it just runs it gets into stuck flow and you develop bunch of people that quite automatically go on the basis of the organization must not survive and are just thinking day and night how to put it out of business thinking day and night how to put the government out of business theres one department in the united states that just must sit up all night long just trying to figure out ways and means how to stop the united states from surviving if they just sat back and relaxed or they all went home or all went and played golf or drowned themselves in the potomac or something like that youd be surprised probably united states international relations would right themselves instantly because theres an enormous amount of guys doing business all over the world who probably are far far more competent than anybody in the state department similarly we look down here in the treasury department or we look down here at the chancellor of the exchequer and we find him all the time trying to figure out something new extraordinary and strange and different and the only time when it really got to going good in the last few years is when i think he got sick or something and it was just going dandy there for while and there were whole bunch of graphs published showing during the period of minimal restriction that everybodys savings increased the purchasing power of the country almost doubled and so forth until they all got active on financial planning the plan balanced economy thing by the way they get that from marcab marcab always had plan balanced economies everybody was broke and starving all the time and so what happened they put on bunch of restrictions because all of sudden everybody got into panic now jersey right now is little tiny dot of rock over here and jersey had lot of hot money coming in it was tax money and if you had the money in jersey you didnt have to pay income tax on it so here was this flood of hot money coming into jersey jerseys broke its poor it doesnt have very much to do with has nothing much to build with all of sudden people borrowed this hot money and started building hotels and doing other things around and right away everybody in jersey almost without exception got around and started to complain and groups started to form to stop this hot money because it was somehow or another bad because the balloon might suddenly be pricked and there might be tremendous crash now did they sit around and think how to employ that money did they sit around and think how to fix up community here with all the available capital they needed so that everybody had good show and they were all nicely employed and it was all running off gorgeously did they put in moment of time doing this they sure didnt they just said how can we stop this flow weve got to make this prosperity stop man or weve had it weve had it but whats had it the ambition not to produce has had it and that ambition would cease to exist and therefore would die and perish you see how this could be so you get strikes and never kid yourself much about strikes strikes will eventually slaughter free enterprise strike in the last halfcentury has drifted these nations over into greater and greater socialisms oh im sure there was there was some recourse to low wages and working twentyfour hours day and all this sort of thing im sure but im equally sure that nobody found the remedy yet that im equally sure of im sure communism isnt the remedy socialism isnt the remedy none of these things are that im sure of because all it is is this button of noproduce it is hot button its production you will find it there on your create scale if it isnt in your secondary scale which i havent looked over finalized yet or checked against everything it certainly is wide hole missing on your secondary scale so you ought to put this button produce in there and you ought to put nonproduce right in alongside of it and that one i know isnt in the scale ive just been exploring this nonproduction our goal is nonproduction if we can just keep everybody fooled enough well have it now the goal can also be results if anybody obtains any results around here itll be over my dead body personally my primary goal and ambition will have utterly ceased and that will be the end of it if anybody ever makes gain you got the idea well that could be psychotic state of mind and when you see errors of gross magnitude continually occurring we all make mistakes i can make mistakes you can make mistakes everybody can make mistakes the trick is to be right majority of the time most of the time be right dont ever try to be 100 percent perfect just try to be right most of the time and boy youre batting so high above the national average that you really succeed see lot of people go around with total perfection you know they cant get anything done because well it wouldnt exactly be right i had guy like this on board yacht one time and he managed to try to burn the boat down couple of times and i finally decided id better send him ashore i wasnt around he was just boat guard see but he would start monkeying around with washing bulkhead and he would get into frantic state about the bulkhead you know and youd go into the yacht and you would find this bulkhead has been washed and hed say well not yet im not finished with it and youd happen to come back couple of days later and this bulkhead is still in the process of being washed and week later the bulkhead is still in the process of being washed and you say what in the name of common sense is going on here youre washing one bulkhead he said yeah but its not clean yet you see his idea that if he did anything it had to be absolutely perfect and if it wasnt absolutely perfect why then he couldnt just leave it youll find artists down in greenwich village theyve got canvases around that are twoinches thick with paint because theyre trying to paint the perfect picture and theyre trying so hard to paint the perfect picture that they never paint picture its good discipline sometimes for yourself that after youve done sketch of something or after youve planned something out its actually good discipline sounds weird sounds anti any training you have of just say abruptly thats thats finished and thats complete and thats the way were going to do it and never work out the final details you know and say well well do it that way just to teach yourself that not everything in the world perishes because you left out one little tiny detail on something now people get too panicstricken at making mistake and they get so panicstricken at making mistake they become unreasonably tense and unreasonably upset about learning the right way to do something and they cant relax you understand so if they figure anything is worrying them this hard then its very easy for them to go over the borderline and just start insisting nothing get done and theres very thin line between total perfectionism and accomplishnothing thats very thin boundary and it is very very easily crossed ill tell you that sitting back with cigar in your mouth one of you girls with your feet on the on the other chair reading an emeter occasionally but perfectly willing to sit there and audit actually could get results on pc actually you could actually do it thats an interesting view of it isnt it in view of the fact were talking about perfection perfection youve got to do them absolutely perfect the trs and all that sort of thing its only after you can do them all perfect that you can relax and put your feet on chair and smoke cigar and get results on the pc you got the idea because your anxiety is longer present your anxiety is longer present and is longer communicating to the pc resultats you are in the clear so what you say counts as matter of fact i can audit with tremendously precise formality and i can do tone 40s with great precise formality but i can also with my pen still in my hand midway toward writing letter someplace or another pick an emeter up stand it on its edge at the desk make somebody sit down and pick up the cans and do good job of assessing them and then turn the emeter off and thank them very much and tell them im not assessing them and ill go back to writing letter but thats because they havent got any feeling of anxiety about it and i havent got any feeling of anxiety about it and i can do the job and they know it and there isnt any monkey business about it get the idea but this tremendous strain of to get everything right get everything absolutely right if i can just get this absolutely if i can just get my little finger held just right as im gripping the emeter you see and i look at the pc just just right and i dont make any mistakes of any kind whatsoever why maybe ill get result you wont get any result because the gross thing about auditing is missing you dont have any confidence you dont exude any confidence and whats the primary thing in dianetics the old thing the one thing that you could always do you can give people hope and you with all this tension have given them hope at all now im not trying to make big bunch of nonsense here and build up this idea of gross auditing error and then tell you lot of minor auditing errors and tell you theyre gross but look being one of the fundamental purposes in dissemination or one of the fundamental actions which you can undertake to make anybody well how about omitting it from the sessions huh now lets just omit it totally pc comes in sits down we dont pay any attention to what hes doing and so forth and we make sure that our feet are planted right on the floor and were getting all set to do tr 0 we arent even aware of who the pc is or their trouble or anything else they sit down in the chair and you say is it all right lets see wheres my paper yeah well is it all right with you if i begin uhm this uhm the session this session the session thats not right see the fundamental has been neglected the fundamental is simply that you are there to make somebody better in view of the fact that goal is all out then the results you receive from there on are quite minor because youre not trying to do anything for them see what youre doing is trying to be perfect so if i can teach you how to do all these things perfectly and get you to point of insouciant confidence so that you could put your feet on the chair and cigar in your mouth and balance the emeter and wiggle the tone arm with your big toe and still get results and not have the pc feel that this is the least bit strange you get the difference of frame of mind the pc wouldnt feel this was strange if you really knew your business why hed say thats the way he audits of course now he makes his fatal error he goes out he asks you covertly what brand of cigars do you smoke the same old gag you see the fundamental error you can make of course is not wanting to help the pc and not helping the pc that would be the fundamental error isnt it well you you can get over worrying at all about your technology see worrying at all about model session just do it standing on your head you know trs pang trs you can do them man when you can confront somebody leaning over rail on ferry boat and do better job of confronting than anybody else on that ferry boat you could audit in that position see in order to break the rules you have to be able to be acquainted with all of them and then you can go ahead and break all the rules you want to as long as you dont commit any one of these fundamental errors like not being present at the auditing session you see or auditing with dead meter or auditing with one thats got one of these grains of dust into its pot so that it does nothing but rock slam and you just go on auditing the rock slam out of the pc and of course the pc hasnt been rock slamming on anything and then justify it all by saying well ron says that rock slams persist often and did you know one of these meters will rock slam if it gets grain of dust in its pot mmhm you know the way to cure it is just to shake the tone arm around little bit and if that doesnt cure it drop little bit of lighter fluid in it and shake it around couple of times and it wont do it anymore all right ive given you very random discourse but i hope ive given you something to operate with instant reads if right now you can get accustomed to this instant read thats another brand of confidence and youll get this brand of confidence sooner or later youll get it straight you right now are im sure in slightly leery frame of mind about well lets see did he say onetenth of second lets see was that onetenth of second or onetwentieth of second or was it really half second how long did it take the needle to react well well well spread it out to three seconds and well call that instant and then well be safe you wont and then youll feel very funny about going across question and you read this question and theres reaction on the meter and youll feel very funny about leaving the question youll say well thats being very unthorough so you read the question again you get latent response well maybe your latent response is something on this order you read the question this restimulated something in the pc that really isnt on the subject of the question but is borderline you got the idea all right you restimulate the borderline when you read the question now you read the question again just to be sure because youre unconfident you see and the moment you do that you wait for it for moment and all of sudden it reacts you have not got an answer to the question what youve got is some allied activity of some kind or another you got it way over in left field and youll get that when you get to it see your security check is thorough enough now youll get it someplace on the security check youll get it as an instant response got the idea but you could spend hours cleaning off all the fringes of the chicken house without ever getting the chicken to eat you could just spend hours and hours and hours cleaning off these latent responses theyre all elsewheres all right you just have to give yourself some experience of watching that meter and if it doesnt go pang you just skip it that works with goals assessments too you know you read off the goal and then you say and one and two and three and four and fall and you say well that one is still hot i dont know whether that one is hot or china is hot or anything else its the same question as what did the needle start to rise on your latent response is what did the needle start to fall on you cannot answer the question so therefore you might as well neglect it youre not sure youre liable to leave the pc in total flub and fog why is that needle falling he will say and youll still get latent responses if youve got the question he always gets an instant response it works like this you say well did you ever illicit diamondsbuy and he illicit diamondsbought believe you havent got buy out of your mouth bu you got fall okay thats it and until he gives you that one on joburg it will just keep falling instant response you ask the question get an instant response you ask the question you get an instant response it wont erase itll just stay there it doesnt matter how many times he thinks of it hes actively withholding it from you but youll get these latent responses on and on and on and on now i want to point this out as gross error not only in auditing generally but in my communication of auditing and that gross error is simply this and only this you were auditing the analytical mind and i hadnt noticed it you werent auditing the reactive mind you were auditing the analytical mind therefore your auditing target was off and that all by itself could explain clears see instantly i dont know how fast you can do an assessment now how fast you can do an assessment now using only instant responses and erasing only instant responses you do it the same way by elimination i dont know how fast you can do it but its probably something on the order of hundredth of the time you have been using to do it okay that was the main thing i came down to tell you today dont immediately think im trying to blame you or giving you bunch of stuff here and saying well hes proving us all wrong it hasnt done any harm to take off all the fringes it hasnt done any harm its advanced the case sort of the hard way it hasnt done any harm to assess case the long way you understand and take all the ramifications and all the latent responses off it that has not done anything at all that is bad it has wasted less auditing time than you think because you were trying to run the whole case on the instant response and the latent response and you were trying to run the reactive mind and the analytical mind and its only that time which you devoted to straightening out the analytical mind which was all right anyhow that you wasted so it hasnt been any vast catastrophe but on the contrary has been considerable win because i know now what youre trying to do see and it was different than what i was trying to do im trying to knock out of the reactive bank those helddown fives which person cant think about and which add themselves into every equation and if you just knock out those helddown fives the case will get all right fast see and if you go on worrying with the pc about why the fives are held down but never under any circumstances really go looking for helddown five of course youre going to get minimal results and minimal recoveries and minimal profile gains and all the rest of it so its all to the good i mean weve speeded up auditing right now thousand for one again if we keep doing this well have to watch it because person will write us letter but two days before that he got clear they know when they were going to write us letter because they went clear suddenly okay all right ive held you rather overlong there were some things i wanted to cover with you i hope you think they were important enough to stay for thank you end of lecture
