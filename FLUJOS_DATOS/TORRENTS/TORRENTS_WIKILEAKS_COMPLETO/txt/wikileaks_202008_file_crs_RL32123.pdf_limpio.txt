summary the united states has pursued variety of ballistic missile defense concepts and programs over the past fifty years ce the 1970s some attention has focused on directed energy weapons such as highpowered lasers for missile defense today the airborne laser abl program is the furt hest advanced of these directed energy weapons in relative terms nd remains the subject of so technical and program debate the department of defense dod has re mained strong advocate for the abl and its predecessor programs the defense department and most missile defense advocates argue that the abl which is designed to shoot down attacking ballistic missiles within the first few minutes of th eir launch is necessary component of any broader us ballistic miss ile defense system until r ecently congress has largely supported the administr ations abl program funding for the abl began in fy1994 but the technologies supporting the abl effort has evolved over 25 years of re search and developmen t concerning laser power concepts pointing and tracking nd adaptive optics delayed now for many years the abl program plans to conduct lethality test now scheduled for august 2009 assuming successful test the defense department has said that this test platform could then be made available on an emergency basis for future crisis to date about 43 billion has been spent on the abl program including 632 million for fy2007 for fy2008 the administration requested 5488 billion which was cut substantially in the house and senate defense authorization bills total abl program costs are not available because the system architecture has not been defined program skeptics continue to raise several issues their questions include the maturity of the technologies in use in th abl program and whether current technical and integration challenges can be surmount ed if the abl is pr oven successful there have been questions about the number of platforms the united st ates should acquire seven aircraft have been ntioned previously and appa rently this number remains the programs objective but is this number appropriate what stresses might continued abl program sli ppage or delays place on th supporting industrial base how does the abl compare to alternativ concepts to what degree should the united states invest in alte rnative missile defense technol ogies in the event that the abl program may not prove successful this report examines the abl program an d budget status it also examines some of the issues raised above this re port does not provide detailed technical assessment of

issues for congress introduction the united states has sought to develop and deploy ballistic missile defenses for more than 50 years since president reagans strategic defense initiative sdi in fy1985 congress has provided about 110 billion for ballistic missile defense programs and studies nationa l missile defense nmd has proven to be challenging and deployment of an effective nmd syst em remains uncertain until recent years nmd was divisive political and national security issue debate has focused on the nature and immediacy of foreign missile threats to the united states and its interests the pace and adequacy of technological development the foreign affairs and budgetary costs of pursuing missile defens and implications for deterrence and global stability in the mid1980s and into the early 1990s congress reacted to these concerns and questions by reducing requested missile defense budgets and providing legislative language to guide the devel opment of missile defense programs and policy during this time many in congress appeared more concerned than the defense department and the military about nearterm threats to forwarddeployed us military forces posed by shorter range ballistic missiles congress demonstrated those concerns by supporting the development and deployment of theat er missile defenses tmd1 oftentimes over the objections of the defense department since the end of the 1991 persian gulf war and especially over the past several years congress generally has supported larger missile defense budgets for fy2007 congress appropriated 93 billion for miss ile defense programs making it the largest defense department acqui sition programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs2 2 prior to the early 1980s the united states had pursued missile defense concepts that largely employed nucleartipped missile intercep tors because high degree of accuracy was not required some conventional explosive warh eads were used to develop the patriot pac 2 system used in the 1991 persian gulf war advanced and exotic concepts such as various lasers are now being considered 3 kinetic kill interceptor would seek to destro its intended target through direct collision at relatively high speeds the force of the im pact would then destroy the attacking missile or warhead render it inoperable or divert it fro m its intended target with such an approach however nearmiss has the same practical ffect as large distance miss the target is not destroyed 4 see crs report rl33240 kinetic energy kill for ballistic missile defense status overview by steven hildreth 5 there is considerable ongoing technical bate outside of government regarding ballistic missile countermeasures and the design or pr ocedural measures by which an adversary might seek to defeat or mitigate missile defenses see especially the report by the american physical society report of the american physical society study group on boostphase intercept systems for national missile defense scientific and technical issues july 2003 6 see crs report rl30185 the airborne laser antimissile program by michael davey and frederick martin 7 the defense department defines the boostphase as that portion of the flight of ballistic missile or space vehicle during which the booster and sustainer engines operate this can last up to several minutes during this time ballistic missile is relatively large and continuedthe primary technological concept for missile defense since the early 1980s2 has been hittokill interceptor missiles3 the utility of hittokill as ballistic missile defense bmd concept over the past 25 years remains mixed4 alternatives to the hittokill concept have also been pursued one is the development of laser technology and the platforms on which sers might be based for most missile defense advocates the airborne laser abl program represents the most promising nearterm effort although the air force cont ends that the abl is mature technology some observers have questioned whether this technical assessment is accurate pointing out that the various abl component s have yet to be fully integrated and tested considerable debate also continues over whether the abl will be capable of dealing with likely future ballistic missile threats5 the effort that led to the abl dates to the early 1970s when the air force began development of an airborne laser laboratory all modified kc135a aircraft to demonstrate that highpowered ser mounted on an airc raft platform could destroy an attacking missile after 10 year s of research development and field testing culminating in 1983 the all prog ram announced that sers had managed to destroy or defeat five sidewinder airtoair missiles and simulated cruise missile6 at short range the all aircraft was retired in 1984 because its research purpose was considered longer necessary although the all test targets were not ballistic missiles the air force and the defense department became increasingly inte rested in the possibility of using high powered lasers aboard aircraft to dest roy enemy ballistic missiles during their boost phase7 through the 1980s and mid1990s furt her research on various ground laserhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs3 7 continued vulnerable its rocket engine plume makes th ballistic missile highly visible the missile is under tremendous pressures and it is slow er relative to later portions of the flight trajectory 8 because the abls predecessor the all came under the air forces space and missile systems center smc the abl at first also came under the responsibility of the smc after prototype model was complete d abl personnel management functions were transferred to the air forces aeronautical systems center asc in 2001 both smc and asc are under the air forces materiel comma nd based at wrightpatterson afb ohio also in 1991 abl funding and program mana gement was transferred to bmdo the ballistic missile defense organization which was mdas precursor organization asc is responsible for abls personnel and mda is responsible for program execution or carrying out the program 9 useful technical review of the abl program at that time is crs report rl30185 the airborne laser antimissile program by michael davey and frederick martinconcepts and designs and tracking and b eam compensation tests convinced pentagon officials to proceed with the conditiona l development of the abl in june 1998 although lowlevel funding for the progra m began as early as fy1994 currently the abl program is the primary focus of the missile defense agencys mda boost defense program8 the abls lethality test monstration which is designed to test the various subsystems and target and destroy ballistic missile has been delayed many times according to the missile defense agency that lethality test which was initially schedul ed for late fy2003 is now planned for august 2009 congress has provided strong funding s upport ballistic missile defenses in the face of growing concerns about the prolif eration of missiles around the world of all the current efforts most missile defens advocates believe the abl shows the best nearterm promise for destroying enemy ballistic missiles durin g their boostphase while the missile is still in the earths atmosphere the airborne laser would seek to rupture or damage the targets booster skin to cause the missile to lose thrust or flight control and fall short of the intended target before deco ys warheads or submunitions are deployed the expectation is that this would occur near or even over the enemys own territory second although the united states has primar ily pursued kinetic energy kill mechanisms for missile defense some 25 years many defense analysts believe that if the united states chooses to pursue increasingly effective missile defenses for the longer term future then alternative concepts such as highpowered lasers may be the answer this report tracks the current program nd budget status of the airborne laser program in addition this report examines several related issues that have been of interest to congress it will be updated occasio nally as necessary this report does not provide technical overview or deta iled assessment of the abl or airbased boost program9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs4 10 the laser beam exits the aircraft through bulbous turret on the front of the aircraft but the coil chemical oxygen iodine laser is cated in the aft section of the aircraftsystem overview it is envisioned that the abl would us highpower chemical laser mounted in the aft section of m odified boeing 747 aircraft10 to destroy or disable all classes of ballistic missiles during the initial portion or first several minutes of their flight trajectory from shortly after launch and before they leav the earths atmosphere analysts indicate that during this period up to several minutes the missile is at its most vulnerable stage it is slower relative to the rest of its flight it is easier to track because the missile is burning its fuel and thus has very strong thermal signature and it is much larger target because any warhead has not yet separated from the missile itself analysts also point out the advantages of destroying the missile before any warhead decoys or submunitions are deployed and potentially over the enemys own territory the abl program will integrate wea ponsclass chemical laser aboard modified boeing 747400 series freighter airc raft 747400f the chemical laser has been assembled in the system integrati on laboratory sil 747200 fuselage and tested the air force acquired the 747 400f in january 2000 directly from the boeing commercial aircraft assembly line and flew it to wichita kansas where boeing workers made extensive modificati ons to the aircraft among other things they grafted huge sheets of titanium to th planes underbelly for protection against the heat of the laser exhaust system and added 12000pound bulbous turret on the planes front to house the 15 meter telesc ope through which the laser beams would be fired this plane made its maiden flig ht in july 2002 it logged 13 more flights in 2002 before relocating to edwards air force base in california since 2002 the focus of the abl program has been on system integration an effort that is considered challenging officials have reported completing ground integration and testing of the beam control fire control bcfc segment and most of that segments integration into the abl aircraft additionally six laser modules in the sil have been integrated and tested further integration and testing of the bcfc laser modules in the sil nd communications links took place in 2005 however the primary goal to have achie ved lethality test by 2005 was not met that test has now been moved further to august 2009 program officials said the delay was due largely to pr ogram restructuring and budget changes others suggested that technical and integration problems c ontinue to prove more challenging than anticipated in 2006 boeing announced successful surro gate lowpower laser testing from the abl aircraft in october 2006 boeing rolled out the abl aircraft in wichita kansas announcing successful completion of major system integration milestones in preparation for some flight testing that will lead to the lethality test in august 2009 as of january 2007 abl had completed ove r 50 flight tests in march 2007 the abl successfully completed the first in series of inflight tracking laser firings athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs5 an airborne target officials argue this is an important step toward demonstrating the aircrafts ability to engage an airborne target major abl subsystems include the lethal laser tracking system and an adaptive optics system the kill mechanism or lethal laser system as distinct from the other onboard acquisition and trackin g lasers is known as coil chemical oxygen iodine laser coil generates its energy through an onboard chemical reaction of oxygen and iodine molecules b ecause this laser energy propagates in the infrared spectrum its wavelength travels relatively easily through the atmosphere the acquisition tracking and pointing system also composed of lasers helps the laser focus on the target with sufficient energy to destroy the missile as the laser travels to its target it encounters atmosphe ric effects that dist ort the beam and cause it to lose its focus the adaptive optics system compensates for this distortion so that the lethal laser can hit and destroy its target with focused energy beam the current abl program began in november 1996 when the air force awarded 11 billion pdrr contract pro gram definition risk reduction phase to several aerospace companies the contr actor team consists of boeing lockheed martin and northrop grumman formerly trw boeing integrated defense systems seattle wa has overall responsibility for pr ogram management and systems integration development of the abl battle

and production of abl target acquisition and beam control and fire control systems northrop grumman space technology redondo beach ca is responsible for the design deve lopment and production of the abl high energy laser number of s ubcontractors are also involved it is envisioned that fleet of some number of abl aircraft would be positioned safely in theater then flown closer to enemy airspace as local air superiority is attained although the defense department once indicated that fleet of five aircraft might s upport tw 24hour combat air patrols in theater for some unspecified period of time in crisis there has been public discussion in recent years as to how many aircraft might eventu ally be procured or deployed as part of future bmd system it is likely however that current plans are to acquire seven production aircraft program status the current abl development and acquisiti on strategy is desc ribed in terms of several blocks or twoyear periods of re search development testing and evaluation activities the program goals for abl block 2006 20062007 are to continue integration and ground and flig ht test activities for the fi rst abl aircraft or weapon system test bed

the first time company representative stated that the airborne laser team has successfully transitioned to the next major test phase completing the first in series of inflight laser firings at an airborne target11 the goals for abl block 2008 20082009 are for further ground and flight testing of the first abl weapon system nd studies defining the second abl weapon system additionally integration of the abl into the wider ballistic missile defense system is expected and the initiation of ground support activities for the abl the lethality test of the abl is anticipated during this period in block 2010 programs officials plan to evaluate broader spectrum of ballistic missile threats as part of the overall ballistic miss ile defense system in place at th at time during this period the primary focus will be on the second abl ai rcraft more specifically this includes completion of design ac tivities and initial fabrica tion of weapon components the total abl program cost cannot be given or estimated because of the acquisition strategy adopted by mda for ssile defense nor has the final system architecture been identified meaning that the total number of abl aircraft to be procured has not been termined prior to adopting this new evolutionary acquisition or spiral velopment strategy12 however there were couple points of reference as to what the pentag on envisioned in its fy1997 annual report to congress dods office of test and evalua tion envisioned seven abl aircraft for total program cost of 612 bi llion then year dollars the objective to acquire seven production aircraft likely remains the most recent cost estimate from the clinton administration was 107 billion lif ecycle costs for the same number of aircraft other system cost data are available in march 2007 mda director lt gen trey obering testified that it is too early to tell how much the abl will cost to operate because program managers do not know what technical achievements will be made in the coming years13 until recently congress has largel supported the abl program by appropriating the defense partments requests whic h have totaled about 43 billion see table below which shows the pr esidents budget pb request and the amount congress appropriated for fy2007 the bush administration requested about 632 million for the abl program which congress approved for fy2008 the bush administration requested 5488 billi on for the abl program in the house version of the defense authorization b ill hr 1585 the request was decreased to 298 billion the senate decreased the ab l

continues to face technical cha llenges second in january 2002 the mda dropped the traditional re quirementssetting process in favor of capabi litiesbased approach intended to more quickly field system capable of responding to some if not all of the current ba llistic missile threat third on june 13 2002 the united states withdrew from the anti ballistic missile abm treaty thus removing numerous barriers to potential antimissile pl atforms fourth the mda is exploring alternatives to the abl for the boost ph ase intercept bpi mission finally recent changes in funding profiles for both the abl and for the mdas new kinetic kill vehicle reinforce the uncertainty related to the abl program specific issues that may confront congress include the verity and implications of the abl programmatic and technological challenges how the abl might be employed if and when it is fielded the potential for industr ial base problems th scheduled lethality test and considerati on of boostphase altern atives to the abl technology and program challenges as new type of weapon system the abl has faced technological challenges throughout its history14 the gao has pointed out the ch allenges of developing and fielding new type of weapon system when it noted that only one of the abls five critical subsystems the ai rcraft itself represents mature technology15 in october 1997 the

solve abls weight gain defense news march 3 2003 p 6 some press accounts assert that the 6 laser modules are 25000 lbs over the weight budget marc selinger airborne laser on track despite weight gain official says aerospace daily march 7 2003operational test and evalua tion called the abl high technical risk program and outlined number of technical challenges to be overcome16 there is some consensus on the abls current technical challenges in congressional testimony the gao pointed out that the abl program office agreed with its assessment of the technological ma turity and technical challenges in most instances only disagreeing about the adap tive optics maturity and challenges17 however consensus appears to break dow n when evaluating how these challenges might affect budget and schedule the gao asserts that problems with maturing technology have consistently been sour ce of cost and schedule growth throughout the life of the program18 but the abl programs new requirements setting process and its focus on developing less sophisti cated system based on currently available technology may result in less risk of co st and schedule growth in the future19 the missile defense agency asserts that pr ogram adjustments made in february 2004 have put the program on budget and schedule gao subsequently found that changes in the abl program would result in know ledgebased approach that was likely to result in more costeffective program20 two technical issues have long challe nged the abl program beam control and adaptive optics and system integration21 the essentials of these two challenges have not changed that much in recent years the abl systems weight has been nother concern the abl was designed to carry 14 laser modules that were planne d to weigh total of 175000 lbs the six laser modules produced thus far already exceed this weig ht budget by at least 5000 lbs22 abl proponents admit that the laser modules are currently heavier than anticipated nonetheless they argue that they are within the requirement for the whole weapon system to fit within the 747s maximum takeoff weight 800000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs9 23 abl officials argue that given system in tegration lab ground results in 2005 the abl is expected to provide an operational viable capability with six laser moduleslbs with the six laser modules on the aircraft23 abl critics remain skeptical that with fewer modules the same level of lethality can be ach ieved thus raising questions as to whether the abl will be required to fly closer toward its targets in hostile air space and whether weight tradeoffs will re sult in reduced fuel capacity and increased need for aerial refueling to perform its mission recent military operations in afghanistan and iraq suggest that dod s aerial refueling fleet is already overburdened concept of operations conops another group of abl questions that ma confront congress pertains to the aircrafts concept of operations or conop s as the program nears procurement and potential fielding questions remain about the number of aircraft to be procured where the aircraft might be deploy ed and how they would be used number of questions are likely to be asked regarding this size of the abl inventory the abl will be highly visible asset it is very large and will be escorted by fighter aircraft its high altitude will also help to distinguish it from other widebody aircraft long intheater on station time for the abl is premised on forward basing these forward bases woul d likely not have chemical replenishment capabilities which would necess itate return flights to the united states if the laser is used it appears plausible that an enemy could wait until an orbiting abl is being refueled or is absent before initiating missile attack thus force of seven aircraft might only be expected to provide 24hour theater ballistic missile tbm bpi coverage of one theater dods decision in the spring of 2006 to postpone the purchase of five abl aircraft brings the issue of exactly what small number of abl aircraft in this case tw could achieve operationally past doctrine and current realworld even ts suggest that us interests could be threatened simultaneously in more than one theater and by more than one country with tbms would seven aircraft be fficient to adequately address potential threats to address grow ing deployment requirement s and to improve personnel retention the air force has organized itsel f into 10 air expeditionary forces aefs that rotate on predictable schedules how would force of seven abls support the 10 aefs the air force and other servi ces frequently complain about the onerous and disproportionate perations and support co sts of high demand low density hdld assets such as jstars and u2s would procurement of only seven aircraft create anothe r hdld problem for the air force on the other hand buying more aircraft would require mo re people to fly and maintain them it is currently unclear what impact the abl might have on the air forces already strained aerial refueling fleet while based at some yettobe determined us base abls will likely deploy to forward operating locations such as guam diego garcia raf fairford england and elme ndorf afb alaska during crises although these bases are likely closer to tomorrow s hot spots than the continental united states they are still hours of flying time away from the persian gulf the koreanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs10 24 see for example testimony of ltgen rona ld kadish director ssile defense agency hearing before the house armed services committee military procurement subcomm ittee june 27 2002peninsula and central asia abls will require refueling to get to the crisis theater refueling to maintain combat air patrols intheater and refueling to return to base what effect will the abls current weight gain have on its fuel load might increased payload mean less fuel and ther efore an even greater aerial refueling requirement some observers have ques tioned how the abl would be employed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms the consensus is that russia and china currently field icbms that could plausibly threaten the united states there is such consensus on the future ability of north korea or other socalled rogue states to field such missiles some believe that such capabilities will emerge in the distant future if ever others see the proliferation of such missiles as inevitable and that it could occur sooner rather than later cu rrent estimates suggest that the abls 400 km range about 250 miles is too short to stand outside russian or chinese airspace and still engage those countries icbms in boost phase would the abl fly into these countries airspace durin g crisis to address poten tial icbm launches in boost phase or would the abls laser need to be more powerful or will some alternative be deployed to supplement or re place the abl for these scenarios another set of questions pertains to using the abl in or near commercial airspace how will the aircraft be opera ted and what rules w ill be established to eliminate or reduce the potential of accide ntly hitting commercial aircraft the abl should fly above the altitude of most commercial aircraft which should help mitigate this potential problem however th abls laser is designed to shoot over long distances and the target abl is attempting to engage may be within the same altitude as most commercial aircraft it appears that abl conops questions are also affected by mdas decision to abandon the traditional requirements pr ocess mda has adopted flexible requirements process that is driven as mu ch by technological maturity as it is by operator needs thus it is difficult to assess how the abl might be employed because it is not currently clear what the abls capabilities will be once fielded industrial base issues final set of issues revolves around th abl industrial base missile defense officials have cautioned that the abl is pursuing very specialized technologies that are not routinely pursued in civilian or ev defense industries turbulence in abl funding or schedule they maintain je opardizes the abl industrial base because these specialized vendors will seek ot her business if abl business appears threatened the industrial ba supporting advanced optical components of the abl is most frequently cited as fragile24 the criticality of these vendors to the health and progress of the abl prog ram has not been clearly tablished dod may or may not for example find expertise in the optical telecommunications industry that would be applicable to abl needs once the health of the ablspecific contractorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs11 and subcontractor base has b een established congress may be asked to help preserve some of the critical path tec hnologies that enable the abl if this take place key calculation to make may be the break point at which keeping number of specialized companies in business outweighs the potential value of fielding the abl it is also argued that cancelling the abl could harm the laser i ndustry writ large rather than just those subindustries ssociated with the abl this is because abl supporters assert the abl program is far and away the largest of its kind and pathfinder for other laser programs cancelling the abl could slow down the entire us laser development industry th ey say others may disagree with this argument and argue that abl survival or cancellation should be based on its own merits the dearth of laser programs outside of the abl they could argue indicates that the abls cancellation would have little affect on other programs because there arent many to affect lethality test and contingency capability issues the lethality test now scheduled for august 2009 some six years later than original plans is seen as critical next step in the abl programs development the objectives of this test include to demonstrate an actual shootdow n of missile over the pacific ocean possibly scud missile to test the irst the infrared search track system to see if theabl can find hold and track the intended target and to demonstrate that the adaptive optics systems is able to compensatefor atmospheric distortion the lethality test is considered important for number of reasons many of which have to do with the long advocated potential for this abl test aircraft to provide limited capability for emergency or contingency missions immediately after the lethality test first the test will demonstrate whether or how well the various abl subsystems and component parts are wo rking together the fact that this test has been delayed several times and for several years now suggests to some that continued systems integration problems are forcing this delay depending on the test results additional system integration tests may be required if significant technical problems arise or additional technical challenges are identified the availability of this abl platform for neart erm emergency missions w ould likely be questioned second depending on the nature and outcome of the lethality test itself use of this abl test aircraft may not be appropriate in an emergency or contingency mission for instance if the lethality test fails to hit or destroy scud or other ballistic missile military planners may not want to rely on test aircraft deployed during crisis additionally if the lethal test is not considered significant for example the test is conducted against very short range missile at very close range military planners similarly may not have confidence in actually using the abl test platform during crisis some in the abl program have suggested that the platform could be made available only as airborne sensor and for battle management purposes others have questioned whethe r meaningful testing protocols can be developed if the abl system is not yet integrated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs12 25 robert wall debugging abl aviation week and space technology september 1 2003 pp 5556 26 amy butler abl shooting for 2008 demonstration aviation week

investigative test considering these increased costs pr ess accounts suggest that the latest lethality test contract contains flaw s that may inhibit the test26 alternatives to the abl these programmatic and technological ch allenges lead to another family of questions regarding the abls current and potential standing in missile defense vis avis other missions and platforms might ot her

abl officials believe the programs t echnical challenges are being overcome27 mda is simultaneously pursuing however kinetic energy interceptor kei that has come to be viewed as potential alternative this program was established in 2003 and early statements by mda focuse d on the interceptors commonality rather than its possible use as an abl alternativ for instance former mda director air force lt gen kadish told reporters that the agency finds kinetic interceptor attractive because given that we long er have the constraints of the 1972 anti ballistic missile treaty and the way the services have put together operational requirements documents i think it is now possible to think and actively pursue commonality that makes sense and common interceptor with common type of kill vehicle28 changes to budget and schedule however have brought the abl and kei into much more obvious competition mdas fy2004 rd request for kei then called common boost and midcourse interceptor represented sixfold increase in funding for this technology and was perhap s the first sign that mda had some doubts about abls ultimate feasibility29 slippages to both pr ograms schedules

the fy2007 budget request for kei was 386 million future budgets for kei climb so about 852 million fy2009 to 165 billion fy2011 at issue is whether the kei represents prudent hedge against potential slippages the abl schedule or drain on funds and other resources that could be devoted to the abl or other mda progra ms this question was probed at length in march 15 2005 house armed services

to the abl uavs have been studied as bpi platforms since the mid1990s at the time uavbase d boost phase intercept approach was viewed as backup to abl in case that program encountered difficulties congress provided 15 million in fy1996 for joint us israeli advanced concept technology demonstration actd progra m to study the feasibility of using up to 20 uavs with three to six lightweight

estimated 6 billion 10year life cycle cost for the abl and 17 to 23 billion 10 year life cycle cost for spacebased laser33 in addition to potentially lower cost possible uav advantages include the ability to operate closer to tbm launch points than the abl and the ability to conduct the bpi mission without endangering thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs14 34 thomas fuddy study to define

recent advances in uavs and their operational success however some analysts believe it may be time to revisit the uavbased approach and weigh its efficacy relative to the abl program in the mid 1990s the air force also studied outfitting f15s with special airtoair missiles to destroy tbms in boost phase some in cong ress have expressed their preference for uavs over manned aircraft in this role in its report srept 104112s 1026 the senate armed services committee wrote that to the extent that kineticenergy bpi systems hold promise for tmd applications the committee believes that reliance should be placed on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs some constraints on shipbased missile defenses have been eliminated by the bush administrations decision to withdraw from the 1972 abm treaty shipbased systems are attractive to missile defense planners because ships often can be maneuvered close to hostile areas number of bpi experiments are planned for fy2004 combining modified standard antiai rcraft missiles with the kinetic kill vehicle kkv34 in july 2004 the congressional budget office published report in which five bpi options were explored two of these five options were space based while spacebased options had some advantages over terrestrial options such as greater global coverage they also were much more expensive perhaps prohibitively35 although platforms other than the abl might conduct tmd bpi it is also possible that the abl might be capable of performing additional or alternative missions when in charge of the program the air force studied alternative roles for the abl including cruise missile defense destroying or disabling enemy satellites or intercepting high altitude surfacetoair missiles in november 2002 the air force scientific advisory board recommended that the air force also consider using the abl to attack time critical targets on the ground in may 2005 the commander of the us strategic command reportedly advocated that alternative uses for the abl be studied36 potential alternate missions that have been discussed in 2006 include shooting down manned aircraft cruise missile s airtoair missiles and surfacetoair missiles in addition to destroying these alternate threats the abl some argue could also contribute to variety of command and control missions such as airborne command and control combat identificati on cid electronic support measures and bomb damage assessment37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32123crs15 today the only alternative albeit similar role that mda is considering for the abl is bpi of intercontinental ba llistic missiles as opposed to theaterrange ballistic missiles mda officials state that they need to concentrate on developing the abls technology to conduct its prima ry mission of theater ballistic missile defense before ancillary roles can be considered others may question whether abandoning the assessment of alternative uses for the ab l is prudent congress has appropriated about 43 billion for the abl thus far some are likely to maintain that more should be done to investigate potentia l returns on this investment the abl is dods most mature high power chemical laser program if mda determines that uavs or shipbased kkvs offer more poten tial in tmd bpi studying alternative uses for the abl might be way to expl oit the advances made by the program
