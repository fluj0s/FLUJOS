and improve the predictability of the review process representatives of animal drug research and development companies say that an animal drug can take 7 to 10 years to develop at cost of 100 million or more1 predictable and timely review is important to these companies companies that make generic animal drugs which are not currently covered by user fee program want review of their products to be timely and predictable as well2 moreover veterinarian s animal producers pet owners and consumers have an interest in the safety availability and affordability of animal drugs including their safe ty when used in livestock production animal drug user fee authority sunsets october 1 20083 if the program were not reauthorized by then fda would have been prohibited at that time from collecting user

submitte d by industry had slowed the approval process to an unacceptable rate the fda report noted that if congress were to consider legislation authorizing fda to impose nd collect user fees approximately 11 million in fees would be needed annually the committee reported that as of 2003 the situation had not improve d and may have worsened in its report on the senate bill the senate

do not include any postmarket activities and expressly prohibit the use of user fees to review advertising and labeling afte r an animal drug has been approved fee triggers author ity to collect fees congress established in adufa i three funding triggers that prohibit fda from collecting user fees for animal drug review unless certain conditions are met each year this was done to ensure that us er fees supplement rather th an replace appropriated funds two of the triggers set fy2003 as baseline minimum level of nonuser fee appropriations adjusted for inflation th at must be maintained

appendix b for description of the fda pproval process for animal drugsyear one of these triggers requires that this level be maintained across the agency the other requires that it be maintained specifically for animal drug review activities the third trigger prohibits fda from coll ecting user fees unless an explicit amount for such fees is authorized in annual ppropriations the triggers are as follows fdas overall appropriati on for salaries and expenses for given fiscal year excluding fees must exceed the agencys overall appropriation for salaries and expe nses for fy2003 prior to the user fee program excluding fees and adjusted for inflation10 fda must spend for animal drug review from appropriated funds an amount not more than 3 below the amount spent for animal drug review from appropriated f unds in fy2003 prior to the user fee program under certain condi tions under condition may such amount be more than 5 below the fy2003 amount amounts in either case are adjusted for inflation11 fees shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in annua l appropriations acts12 in its annual financial re ports to congress for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 the most recent availa ble as required by adufa i fda reports that each of the fee triggers was met each year13 types of fees experience from the human drug and medi cal device user fee programs showed that because the number of applications varies from year to year basing user fee program solely on application fees did not provide predictable funding streams from the outset adufa i authorized seve ral types of user fees the act also authorized the total revenues for each fee type that may be collected each fiscal year which are to be adjusted annually for infl ation and workload the act required the secretary to set annual fees at least 60 days before the start of each fiscal year and to publish the fees and methodology in the federal register the types of animal drug user fees and the fee amounts for fy2008 are as follows application fees onetime fees for new animal drug applications nadas and supplements for wh ich safety or effectiveness data are

about the required ad ministrative procedures the annual performance reports do not provide qua ntitative information regarding anada submissions and review times they note that fda maintains separate staffing and queues for anadas and has defined ba seline performance levels from fy2001 through fy2003 against which to measur current performance in its annual performance reports fda says that anada review times did not increase in fy2004 but did increase in fy2005 and fy2006 which the agency attributes to understaffing table 2 compiles cvm workload data for the animal drug program overall ie for

proposed target is 270 days the agency did not propose any agdufa performance goals regardin g the backlog of reviews or other matters in congressional testimony in june 2008 witness representing gada testified that according to its agreement with fda regarding an animal generic drug user fee program as reflected in fdas agdufa proposal the pe rformance goals for agdufa do not return generic

been sent to the president who is expected to sign it house action hr 6432 the animal drug user fee amendments of 2008 as introduced would reauthorize adufa largely in line with fdas proposal rather than the inflation adjuster in curr ent law the bill would authorize total of 98 million for the program over the fiveyear period from fy2009 through fy2013 as requested by fda and depicted in table 4 the bill would extend among other provisions 1 existing authority for the collection of application product establishment and sponsor fees with aut hority to collect larger aggregate amounts of each type of fee in each successive fiscal year 2 the fee triggers and 3 requirements for annual fiscal and perfo rmance reports program authority would sunset on october 1 2013 and reporting re quirements would sunset four months later on january 31 2014 the bill would not explicitly establish performance goals rather it refers in finding to goals as laid out in letter from the secretary to the

proposal34 unless the goals were modified during passage hr 6432 as introduced contains two provi sions that were in neither adufa i nor the fda reauthorization proposal the first are new requirements for public involvement in the reauthorization planni ng that would begin prior to the fy2013 sunset provisions in section 4 of the bill would require the secretary to 1 seek public input before beginning negotiations with indus try to reauthorize the program 2 hold periodic consultations with ot her stakeholder groups eg consumer representatives during such negotiations and 3 publish transcripts of all negotiation meetings between the fda and the regulated industry these requirements would be in addition to the cu rrent requirement to seek public input at the conclusion of negotiations with industry the second new provision in section 5 of the bill would alter the reporting period for required drug experience reports ie reports that companies must make to fda if they are aware of product problem or defect as currently required by regulation the bill as introduced would not authorize fda to use program fees for postmarket activities and would not establish any new data repor ting requirements for industry hr 6433 the animal generic drug user fee act of 2008 as introduced would establish new animal generic drug user fee program largely in line with fdas proposal the bill would establish authority to collect application product and tiered sponsor fees but not establishment fees and would establish fee triggers feesetting requirements workload adjustments and

passed by the full house energy and commerce committee on july 16 2008 the committee amended hr 6432 adufa reauthorization to make several technical and minor changes and two substantive changes first animal drug sponsors would be required to provide annual reports to fda regarding any of their animal drugs that contain an antimicrobial active ingredient such reports must include specified information about drug distribution proposed usage nd other matters and the secretary would be required to publish such information in manner that is consistent with national security and business conf identiality concerns second the secretary would be required to refuse admission to any imported animal drug that appears to be counterfeit and to destroy any ch items under certain conditions36 hr 6433 was amended to make seve ral technical and minor change s but substantive changes on july 30 2008 the house passed an amended version of hr 6432 under suspension of the rules the engro ssed

have been satisfied that adufa i has eliminated the review backlog for brandname animal drugs improved the timeliness and pred ictability of reviews and improved communication with fda throughout the pr ocess the industrys focus for adufa ii was to continue the enhancement of f da review capacity including more support for increasingly complex reviews als at the public meeting in march 2008 both fda and industry speakers discussed grow ing backlog of premarket inspections of foreign animal drug producing facilities which has not been remedied by the current user fee program adufa program costs the centerpiece of fdas reauthorizati on proposal as negotiated with industry was an increase in user fee revenues to reflect cost growth in excess of authorized inflationary adjustments38 the proposal would authorize fda to collect almost twice as much in animal drug user fees during the fiveyear adufa ii program period fy2009 through fy 2013 as it c ould during adufa i fy2004 through fy2008 much of the growth in program co sts that fda cited is driven by factors outside of the agencys control such as growth in the costs of employee salaries and benefits and rents39 although backlog of premarket foreig n facility inspections was discussed at the march 2008 public meeting the fda propos did not explicitly address the cost of these inspections given recent concerns about the safety of imported drugs and foods fda has been under pressure to expa nd its oversight of foreign facilities that manufacture products it regula tes fda has not however signaled any particular safety concern about foreign plants that manufacture animal drugs or any changes to the premarket inspections of these plants that are conducted for purpose of application review at present establishment fees may be assessed for these plants when applicable but the fees are not dir ectly linked to inspection costs and do not distinguish between domestic and foreign

to speed the evaluation of drugs for safety and effectiveness without shortchanging the rigor of the evaluation or compromising the actual safety and effectiveness of approved drugs critics have charged that the user fee program for human drugs pdufa places too much influence in the hands of industry and speeds drugs to market w ith inadequate safety review they note that the industry is actively involved in establishing performance benchmarks for example also some feel that consum er confidence in fdas review process is important and that percepti on of conflicts in the user fee programs may undermine this confidence40 it has been difficult to measure the effect of pdufa if any on the safety of human drugs and unequivocal evidence of such an effect is lacking the law has

adufa fdas proposal for adufa ii as negotiated with industry did not seek authority to use animal drug user fees for any postmarket activities it is reported that during adufa reauthorization negotia tions fda sought to have authority to spend user fees on some postmarket antimicrobial resi stance activities discussed further below but drug companies objected42 antimicrobial resistance concerns about the effects of adufa on animal drug safety often play out in different context than that for the safety of human drugs some critics of the law are concerned about the safety of drugs approved for animal agriculture with respect to public health and the environment rather than safety for the treated animal in particular they are concerned about antimic robials eg antibiotics used in food

and purity as with approved human drugs sponsors of approved nadas are required to notify fda regarding an approved drugs postmarket performance including any adverse events the animal drug approval process diffe rs from the process for human products in two important ways first to support the requirement for monstration of safety in humans if an animal drug is intende d for use in foodproducing animal the sponsor must develop methods to test fo r drug residues in the human food product eg meat milk eggs honey fda determin whether the drug can be used safely in foodproducing animals with respect to public health if approved the drugs label must address withdrawal time if necessary ie period of time that the drug must be withheld before an an imals products can be marketed for human consumption allowing drug residue s to fall below vels of concern51 second although cvm requires clinical trials to dem onstrate an animal drugs safety and effectiveness these trials are necessarily and as matter of regulation somewhat different from clinical trials re quired for the approval of human drugs an approved animal drug ma be labeled for use only in the species for which trials were conducted however veteri narians are permitted under cer tain conditions to use approved drugs for unapproved uses soca lled extralabel uses such as use in species other than those on the label or for indications other than those on the label52 also clinical trials for animal drug approval need not be as extensive as trials for human drugs among other things initial testing of the animal drug may begin in the target species whereas candidate human drugs are studied to determine their safety in animals first before human trials are begun cvm also has authority to approve generic animal drugs53 sponsors seeking approval of generic inve stigational new animal drug jinad must submit anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34459crs25 54 see fdacvm information at httpwwwfdagovcvmgadaptrahtmlabbreviated new animal drug applica tion anada the generic product and its uses must be the same as those of an approved animal drug w ith certain exceptions and it must be demonstrated that the gene ric product is bioequiva lent to the approved product54 holders of approved or pending nadas must submit certain patent information to cvm cvm publishes pa tent information on approved nadas and requires anada applicants to certify that their product would not infringe upon current patent or that any such current pa tent is invalid sponsors seeking to market generic version of an approved animal dr ug for substantially different use than that currently approved such as labe l indication for new species often must conduct clinical trials and typically need an investigational exemption pursuant to ffdca section 512j in order to ship the drug interstate finally cvm has authority for the cond itional approval of dr ugs to treat minor animal species eg fish and uncommon di seases in major animal species this allows sponsors to market drug before collecting all necessary effectiveness data but after proving that the drug is safe
