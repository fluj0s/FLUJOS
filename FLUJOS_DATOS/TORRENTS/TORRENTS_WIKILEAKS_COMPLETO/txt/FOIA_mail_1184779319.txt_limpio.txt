from pjonesueaacuk to davidparkermetofficegovuk subject re uhi corrections date wed 18 jul 2007 132159 0100 bst cc jenkins geoff geoffjenkinsmetofficegovuk jones phil pjonesueaacuk geoff david is essentially right in 1986 we rejected 38 if my memory from 1986 is correct i dont recall the number we looked at so i cant give percentage as im not that much of trainspotter the would be small though as we looked the homogeneity of about 2500 then also some which might have been affected by urbanization might have been rejected for other reason im half asleep here in my hotel room in beijing same hotel as the ipcc meeting david as it is just gone 8pm i have the pdf of the 1986 paper and 38 rejected for urban warming trends 31 in n america and 7 in europe none elsewhere out of 2666 239 were rejected for other reasons brohan et is the best reference we included urbanization as one of the biases one sided as urban should lead to warming so if you look very very closely at the error range in the paper youll see it is slightly onesided ive been giving some talks here and have more tomorrow at cma ive found they have homogenized dataset of 745 stations for the country which they are preapred to give at some point for inclusion they have adjusted for all site moves but not for urbanization it seems that it is almost impossible for sites here to be rural maybe only 1 of the total sites move out of the city at regular intervals as the cities expand so beijing has 67 site moves since 1951 also china seems to be the only country that doesnt use airport sites none are located at airports im going to give them my chinese sites in return so they can do some comparisons ill talk with their person mr li more tomorrow another interesting bit of work here is that they also have an homogenized set of monthly wind speed data from 1951 not sure how they homogenize this for site moves but almost all the sites about 200 show declines in mean wind speeds since 1951 ncep and era40 also show this for wind speeds at 1000 925 and 850hpa as well odd thing is that they think the decline in wind speeds is due to urbanization lis english isnt great though so i could be wrong another person ive been talking to has been looking at precip trends from 1951 again they think declines in n china are due to urbanization odd then that there are increases in s china which is also urbanized at similar rates air quality here is awful i saw the sun for the first time since arrival on sunday after long downpour cleared the air this morning the haze will be back tomorrow apparently they will closing the worst factories and getting half the cars off the road next august for the olympics traffic might flow better for the latter but cant see the former doing that much good what they need to do is to get heavy downpour every early morning cheers phil geoff it is correct that phil jones removes stations that appear to have urban warming unlike hansen et who correct them i dont know the percentage of stations that phil removes details were probably originally given in the jones et 1985 and 1986 usdoe reports see references given in jones and moberg 2003 attached the reports are probably only available on paper and are not now in my collection of boxfiles and could take some time to collate but to do this might not be useful as phil could have rejected further stations from the additional datasets he accrued since then nevertheless i expect the rejection rate is small brohan et is the best reference for discussion of the urbanization uncertainty in land surface air temperatures i hope this helps somewhat regards david on wed 20070718 at 1146 0100 jenkins geoff wrote david if i understand phil right there are stations which are corrected for uhi effects but there are several roughly what percentage which are removed i would be grateful if you could give the best ref to this is it brohan et 2006 to pass to an outside sceptical enquirer one nigel lawson remember him he already knows about yr recent windycalm comparison paper via the briefing booklet i did thanks geoff original message from pjonesueaacuk mailtopjonesueaacuk sent 16 july 2007 2159 to jenkins geoff subject re uhi corrections geoff in china this week and away next week best ref is really ch3 of ar4 ipcc we dont make adjustments just remove the stations affected best if you contact david parker there is also some stuff in brohan et 2006 in jgr also david p has couple of papers on the subject we incorporate possible residual urban effects into the error estimates of global t cheers phil phil sorry to keep bombarding you what is the best ref to your corrections of land surface temps in crutem presumably for heat island effects please geoff dr geoff jenkins manager climate change
