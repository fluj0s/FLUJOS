aljazeera an overview origins aljazeera which means the peninsula or the island was founded in 1996 in qatar after the new emir of qatar shaykh hamad bin khalifa althani purchased the rights to the arabic tv division of the british broadcasting corporation bbc news service the bbc had been trying to develop an allarabic television station in conjunction with the saudiowned orbit radio and television service the joint venture failed after the two parties could not agree on issues relating to the new station s editorial independence1the qatari monarchy which also has closely aligned itself with us policy in the persian gulf region was embarking upon limited course of pol itical liberalization and believed that modernizing arab media was central to its reform effort the emir of qatar provided aljazeera with an initial grant of 137 million2allowing the station to retain many of the bbcs recently hired arab correspondents many of whom are prominent egyptian and lebanese journalists with western training prior to aljazeera arab audiences could receive their news from either state owned media or from several arab satellite variety channels that broadcast both entertainment and news programming the news on all of these channels was and still is to some degree censored and controlled by state authorities even transnational subscriptionbased arab satellite channels tend to reflect the viewpoints of the governments of the countries in which they are located3therefore many analysts considered aljazeera to be novelty in the arab world not only because it was the first 24 hour allnews ar abic television station but also becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31889crs2 4in the line of fire washington post april 3 2003it allowed its commentators and guests more latitude in expressing their opinions including criticisms of arab governments than had been previously regarded as the norm in the arab media in fact the creator s of aljazeera modeled the stations format after western news services such as the cable news network cnn and the bbc professing admiration for western sta tions roundtable discussion programs oneonone interviews and documentaries although aljazeera borrowed the format of cnn its creators set out to differentiate aljazeera from its west ern counterparts many of aljazeeras correspondents were drawn to work for the station because they felt that american and british coverage of the 1991 gulf wa r was not evenhanded in that it paid insufficient attention to topics of interest to arab audiences such as the plight of iraqi civilians during the conflict thus aljazeera believes that it provides an alternative perspective particularly to the american and british news media jazeeras motto the view and the other point of view reflects its desire to be an uncensored authentically arab news source for arabs programming although aljazeera like most 24hour news networks intersperses news updates with headlines sports and financia l news broadcasts throughout the day its regularly scheduled programming is unc onventional when compared to other arab networks aljazeera has programs such as the opposite direction without borders the other opinion and open dialogue each of which features well known host who facilitates lively discu ssion with some callin questions and comments viewers of aljazeera have noted that the stations staff often try to encourage confrontation by pitting guests with opposite viewpoints against one another in debate this approach has prove n to be informative and entertaining for many viewers however some arab intellectuals have criticized the approach as being too sensationalistic and heated beyond aljazeeras programming many western critics have accused the station of creating inflammatory leadin segments to news reports which often feature montages of violence in the west ban k and gaza strip afghanistan or iraq these short snippets contain flashes of provocative pictures usually of human suffering accompanied by dramatic b ackground music aljazeera called its coverage of operation iraqi freedom th war against iraq and used leadins that showed civilian casualties in iraqi hospitals exploding bombs in baghdad and us soldiers on patrol in civilian areas some suggest that aljazeera is merely following middle eastern tradition of dramatizing news events by appealing emotionally to the viewer according to aljazeeras washington bureau chief hafez almirazi there is feeling in our newsroom that you need to be as realistic as possible and carry the images of war and the effect that war has on people your population shouldnt just eat their dinner and watc h sanitized images on tv and video games produced by the technological whizzes in the pentagon and say this is

breaking many of the taboos of selfcensorship in the arab media new york times columnist tom friedman wrote that aljazeera is not only the biggest media phenomenon to hit the arab world since the dvent of television it also is the biggest political phenomenon5indeed many middle eastern experts have praised jazeera for creating forum in which ar ab opposition movements can freely criticize their host governments without fear of retr ibution according to edmund ghareeb an expert on middle eastern affairs it has raised the level of debate and opened the door for freer and more accurate news in the arab world aljazeera has helped satisfy hunger in the arab world its bates and discussion programs are tumultuous even by western standards6 however for all of the praise aljazeera has received there has been an equal amount of criticism regarding the network s perceived lack of objectivity many western media analysts have asserted that jazeeras westernstyle format is merely cover for reporting style that is slante d toward popular panarab panislamist viewpoint according to critic fouad ajami of johns hopkins university matter how many americans show up on aljazeera the station will pursue its own oppositional agenda aljazeeras reporters themselves as antiimperialists these men and women are convinced that the rulers of the arab world have given in to american might these

has argued that aljazeera feigns its objectivity by inviting us and israeli officials to present their views while carrying provocative analysis in the studio or onesided news stories lacking

the events it is presenting for analysis and discussion with aljazeera what you often get is several people but all at one end of the spectrum so theres work to be done to induce more balance but on the whole the advent of aljazeera and other arab satellite stations has been great step forward in opening up the intellectual and cultural life of the arab world9 in may 2003 britains sunday times

documents which were obtained in baghdad by the iraqi national congress indicated that alali made clear to iraqi agents that coverage would favor the saddam hussein regime alali will continue to serve on aljazeeras board of directors defenders of aljazeera have decried criticism of the station noting that all newspapers and television stations have so degree of bias and that aljazeera has at least given air time to dissenting opinions according to the beirutbased daily star in its coverage of the intifada palestinian uprising and the war in afghanistan aljazeera has actually given voice to every side in the conflict and done nothing more than televise the images its reporters are seeing11in an interview with the christian science monitor the chair of the department of journalism and mass communication at the american university of cairo remarked that sure the news we get in the arab world is slanted in the same way the news received in the us is biased12 aljazeera and qatar there has been considerable speculation as to why the station has been able to report the news freely given the restrictiv media environment in neighboring arab states many commentators have attempted t answer this question by pointing to the nature of the qatari state as well as to the efforts of the emir of qatar to liberalize qatari society while using these political and social reforms to promote qatar itself and increase its regional and global inf luence qatar is one of the most stable countries in the middle east with per capita income of over 25000 for population of 800000 people only 170000 of w hom have citizenship the majority of the rest are foreign workers from south east asia and the phillippines analysts have pointed out that aljazeeras openness and itsmaverick reporting style serves to promote qatar as progressive modern state in the middle east indeed although the qatari government has publiclysought to distance itself from aljazeera in terms of ownership organization and editorial output both the state and the station enjoy mutually beneficial relationship in which the visibility of aljazeera has led to an increase in the prominence of qatar t hus

misses and ricochets asian times december 25 2002some experts question whether in the long term aljazeera can maintain independence if it is unable to wean itself off of qatari state financing originally aljazeera executives believed that jazeera would be profitable by 2001 two factors have prevented the station from generating more revenue first general market conditions in the middle east adver tising industry have not been favorable there are alreadyseveral arab satellite television channels and as more stations come online and the situation in iraq remains uncertain advertising revenue will remain uneven second there is hesitation on the part of arab conglomerates to advertise on aljazeera as they are fearful that aljazeeras shaky relationships with arab governments could harm their business interests because of these obstacles the station is still running nnual deficits despite its rather lean workforce of 775 employees worldwide cnn has 4000 and bbc has 3300 several us companies have run advertisements on aljazeera including general motors gillette and procter and gamble14 aljazeeras continued dependence on qat ars financial backing has blurred the line between its status as private or pub lic news organization aljazeera has demonstrated characteristics of both privatized and staterun news network as qatar exerts little editorial control over daytoday news reporting while subsidizing aljazeeras annual budget although aljazeera may subtly promote qatars political outlook it does so under the umbre lla of regional news provider making it appear less tied to anyone arab government nevertheless aljazeeras executives have promoted their channels independe nt image which raises the following questions as aljazeera remains in an am biguous position regarding its private or public status will some analysts start to overlook that status and treat aljazeera as just another staterun media outlet albeit one more sophisticated and popular than the rest or will aljazeera secure the necessary advertising revenue to cover costs perhaps leading to looser arrangement with the qatari government although aljazeera has drawn praise for its willingness to discuss aspects of arab politics previously considered off limits in arab discourse15critics continue to point out that aljazeera does not treat qatar with the same degree of scrutiny as it does other arab governments aljazeera executives have countered that qatar is relatively free of political strife and therefore does not require much attention however according to the asian times it aljazeera softpeddles its domestic critique aljazeera has been dogged in its coverage of financial and political deals cut between arab governments and israel but when allegations came out that qatar had opened trade office in tel aviv th station did not go after the story16other commentators have asked why the statio n has not fully explored qatars friendly relationship with the us military alt

washington post april 3 2003 op citissues of concern for us foreign policy iraq aljazeeras coverage of iraq has drawn both praise and criticism aljazeeras first foray into the iraqus confrontation came in 1998 when iraq and the united states were in standoff over the removal f weapons inspectors from iraq jazeera outmaneuvered other netw orks most notably cnn by having correspondents in iraq once the united sta tes and britain launc hed air and missile strikes as part of operation desert fox ljazeera also obtained an exclusive interview with saddam hussein who reportedly wanted to deal with station that could reach wide arab audience some observers have contended that aljazeeras popularity and credibility in the middle east was established at that time on the other hand aljazeeras detractors accused the network of portraying iraq as victim during the standoff focusing more on the d etrimental effects of economic sanctions than on saddam husseins disregard f united nations resolutions aljazeeras coverage of the 2003 war in iraq has become story within the wider story of the war following previous patterns aljazeera has been recognized for its access inside iraq17while being criticized for being sensationalistic and slanted in its coverage of the us military operation some observers have praised aljazeera for keeping several reporters and camera crews on the ground in baghdad mosul and basra and delivering live feeds of wartime footage to which several us news networks including cnn have access through partnership agreements18 according to businessweek during the iraq war aljazeera had more reporters in iraq than any other major news station19 aljazeera also is one of the few stations that has aired press briefings from iraqi officials as well as video footag whose authenticity has been disputed of saddam hussein in meetings with other senio r iraqi leaders several us officials and independent analysts have appeared on the station to give commentary on the us war effort prior to the start of the war the pentagon granted aljazeera four embedded slots with the us military however most of aljazeeras reporters on the ground have remained independent

aljazeeras iraq coverage is often introduced by short series of image s depicting us soldiers in negative light afghanistan the war on terrorism although aljazeeras coverage of oper ation desert fox brought the station much notoriety in 1998 it was its proximity to osama bin laden and the qaeda terrorist organization that brought the news network into the global mainstream when the united states began operatio n enduring freedom in afghanistan on october 7 2001 aljazeera was the only major news network with field office in kabul as was the case in iraq many obser vers were impressed with the stations ability to get the scoop as western network s were forced to rebroadcast aljazeera transmissions with their now identifiable gold logo in the corner of the screen however aljazeeras considerable access to the taliban and qaeda also brought it high degree of scrutiny from western governments particularly after it aired taped speeches of osama bin laden aljazeera had been airing taped interviews and footage of osama bin laden since 1998 as part of its regular coverage of the region26however after the attacks of september 11 2001 and jazeeras airing of bin laden tape only

that qaeda was attracted to aljazeeras large arabicspeaking audience observers also speculated that aljazeera eager to make headlines and without rigorous governmental scrutiny was in position to broadcast the bin laden tapes as opposed to the more cautious arab state media some analysts considered that qaeda would have found aljazeera to be sympathetic to its cause based on the networks past coverage of iraq in 1998 one theory explaining the aljazeera bin laden connection comes from aljazeeras london bureau chief yosri fouda who interviewed two of qaedas top leaders khalid sheikh mohammed and ramzi bin alsheeba both are now in us custody fouda had been chosen by qaedas leaders to tell their story according to fouda i asked them qaeda first of all why and they said that there are other journalists both inside and outside of aljazeera who are thought of as having some sort of degree of sympathy with their cause so for that very reason they said they wanted to have this story done by someone more secular in his professional approachso that their message would carry more credibility it confirmed my initial impression that there is someone who understands media and particularly television inside qaeda29 qaeda may have b een looking for an ou tlet like aljazeera knowing that the station was eager to break big story and would be willing to present their point of view without editorializing its content in new york times magazine feature on fouda author peter maass noted that fouda is chameleon he mixes easily at both mosques and pubs he is in this way an excellent

politically divisive conflicts in the world the israeli palestinian conflict has been source of contention for the worlds media challenging the objectivity of western and nonwestern media outlets alike within this context many observers believe that aljazeera is different like other arab networks and newspapers it has covere d the conflict from distinctly arab perspective according to one aljazeera correspondent based in the west bank to be objective in this area is not easy because we live here we are part of the people of here and this situation belongs to us also and we have our opinions32 in contrast to statecontrolled arab media aljazeera has taken the controversial step of broadcasting interviews with and statements by israeli officials practice shunned by many arab channels ljazeera has invited israeli leaders such as shimon peres and ehud barak on air for tv interviews israel also has sent officials some of whom are fluent in arabic from its foreign ministry to appear on aljazeera indeed some arab governments newspapers and even palestinian hard liners have accused aljazeera of being in league with israel and acting as an extension of israeli intelligence aljazeera has noted that arab governments tend to vocalize accusations of aljazeeras colla boration with israel during times of tension between the station and foreign arab governments33 despite the novelty of israeli officials on arab television some analysts have pointed out that in covering the israelipa lestinian conflict aljazeera follows similar approach to its coverage of the war in iraq and the war on terrorism in afghanistan it uses vivid violent montag of palestinian suffering to introduce news segments it employs language which describes suicide bombings as martyrdom operations and it calls the i sraeli army an occupation force this approach has caused some experts to suggest that aljazeeras personalization of the news in which it emphasizes arab and muslim victimization is

2002 david duke former leader of the klu klux klan appeared on the aljazeera talk show without borders claiming that israeli intelligence knew in advance that the worl d trade center was about to be

broadcasting talk show with the title is zionism worse than nazism in addition to hosting callin show which discussed the validity of the protocols of the elders of zion both shows did present different viewpoints unlike other arab media outlets however some observers claim that the antisemitic viewpoint was given an unfair amount of attention supporters of aljazeera believe that th stations coverage is not biased but merely reflects different perspective of the conflict in which palestinians are locked into war of independence with the israeli military according to jazeeras washington bureau chief hafez almirazi the first palestinian intifada uprising was covered by cnn which directed its coverage to western public and ended up dehumanizing the palestinian struggle and cause but because of our coverage and that of other arab satellite television channels the second intifada influenced arab public opinion more36aljazeera also has drawn praise for its strong presence
