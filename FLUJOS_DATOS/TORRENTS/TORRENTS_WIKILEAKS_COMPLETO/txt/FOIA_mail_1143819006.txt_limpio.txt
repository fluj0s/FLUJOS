from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to brooks hanson bhansonaaasorg subject re data request to science for 1120514 date fri 31 mar 2006 103006 0100 cc jesse smith hjsmithaaasorgkeith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed dear brooks hanson of the two additional questionsrequests the first one is quick to respond to and so i can do that immediately in fact my previous reply answers the first question already as does our paper itself in very clear way it is something of waste of time therefore to have to write another answer but here goes anyway we clearly state in the som to our paper what the data sources were and esper et was not the source for the four series in question there is therefore need for anyone to surmise that this is the case because we explicitly state it further we state in our paragraph d that we replaced athabasca with new betterreplicated series from luckman and wilson betterreplicated clearly indicates that there are more data in the new series than were available to esper et as is also clear from even cursory read of the luckman and wilson paper so it should be obvious that you cannot expect to reproduce the results using the fuller data set by using only the more limited data available from esper et otherwise what would be the point of going out and collecting all that new data the other three series are covered in our paragraph c the data sets contain some nonidentical treering series derived from the same sites we have favoured series from s3 because they are based on greater number of tree core measurements than the series generated by s1 so we clearly did not use the esper et data s1 and it should also be clear that the series we did use can not be reproduced using the esper et data because they are nonidentical and there are fewer tree cores in the esper et data the source we gave for these three series is briffa 2000 we did not use treecore measurement data in our paper only chronologies that had previously been assembled by others from core measurement data i dont have any core measurement data and therefore have none to give out and in my first reply i explained why i didnt think that this was appropriate anyway since i consider that our obligation is limited to providing data to allow the replication of the steps reported in our paper none of which involved any processing of core measurement data i will reply next week regarding the second questionrequest best regards tim at 2035 30032006 brooks hanson wrote dear dr osborn thank you for your assistance in resolving the request for data for your recent paper i have passed along the relevant information you have provided i assure you not your email in response ive received two additional questions im wondering if it would be possible to clarify these in 4 cases the osborn site chronology differs from the esper site chronology although in the other cases the versions are identical in some cases the date ranges do not match i do not believe that it is possible to replicate the osborn version from the esper measurement data in these 4 cases and surmise that osborn used different measurement data set i therefore request measurement data used by osborn for the following sites polar urals tornetrrask taymir and athabaska the hadcru2 data set contains temperature data for the gridcell 375n 1175w commencing in 1870 however the gridcell information provided by osborn commenced only in 1888 and the differences are material to the final result 0045 versus 018 reported what is the reason for commencing this comparison in 1888 rather than the available 1870 since there is material difference in this example could you please provide the gridcell temperature sets in comparable format for the other 13 osborn and briffa series i appreciate that the latter request may take some additional effort as you noted im hopeful that this will provide resolution to this matter sincerely brooks hanson dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email tosbornueaacuk phone 44 1603 592089 fax 44 1603 507784 web httpwwwcruueaacuktimo sunclock httpwwwcruueaacuktimosunclockhtm xflowed
