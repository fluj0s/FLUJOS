executive summary we are producing an update to the historical surface temperature dataset hadcrut providing com prehensive error model as well as range of data and technical improvements we are using marine data and uncertainties from the new hadsst2 dataset this provides better coverage and assessments of marine uncertainties and biases we have added some extra stations to our land observations database we have further improved this database by doing additional quality control we are producing comprehensive uncertainty estimates for the land data including assessments of mea surement and sampling error and the eﬀects of various biases together with the hadsst2 data this gives us uncertainty estimates for the global data we have improved our methods for data blending and gridding so we can make gridded datasets on any spatial resolution we are reﬁning the statistical methods used for homogenising and averaging the gridded data testing these methods against pseudoinstrumental data derived from gcm results is allowing us to verify their capabilities and limitations 1 introduction the historical surface temperature dataset hadcrut 1 2 is extensively used as source of information on surface temperature trends and variability one noteworthy use is the provision of timeseries of global and hemispheric annual average temperatures this dataset is produced through collaboration between the hadley centre who provide the marine data expertise and the climatic research unit cru at the university of east anglia who provide the land data and expertise since the last update which produced hadcrut2 2 important improvements have been made in the marine component of the dataset 3 these include the use of additional observations the development of comprehensive uncertainty estimates and technical improvements that enable for instance the production of gridded ﬁelds at arbitrary resolution this document is report on work to produce new dataset version hadcrut3 which will extend the advances made in the marine data to the global dataset the work is being managed in the hadley centre but part of the work to be done needs expertise from cru so contract has been placed with cru to fund them to work on the project in collaboration with hadley centre staﬀ 12 aims of the work the work being done falls in ﬁve main areas improved land data additional data extra quality control comprehensive land error model add estimates of observation errors extend existing sampling and bias uncertainty estimates to arbitrary grid resolutions flexible gridder make gridded ﬁelds on any spatial resolution better landsea blending combine land and sea data in coastal gridboxes in way which uses our knowledge of the uncertainties for each data source better statistical processing the gridded ﬁelds are reﬁned using two important statistical processes variance correction removes the eﬀect of the changing number of observing stations optimum averaging make global and hemispheric timeseries from the gridded ﬁelds these processes will be checked for correctness and simpliﬁed and reﬁned where necessary the resulting dataset will be made available on the web and the work will be published in time for the results to be available to the ipcc 4th assessment report 3 progress and plans 31 improved land data some new station data has been added mostly for stations in mali and the congo switzerland and antarctica also lot of quality control has been done comparison 4 of the cru temperature data with the era40 reanalysis found several areas where the station data was doubtful and this was augmented by visual examination of individual station records looking for outliers many bad values were identiﬁed and either corrected or removed number of duplicate stations were found in the archive and these were rationalised also the station normals and standard deviations were regenerated and checked figure 1 shows the locations of stations where changes have been made 32 flexible gridder earlier versions of hadcrut 1 2 were produced only on 5x5 degree resolution recent work on marine datasets 3 has enabled us to produce them on any resolution this is valuable for regional studies and for comparison with model results we have developed the same functionality for gridding the land temperature and so we can make hadcrut3 gridded ﬁelds at any spatial resolution figure 2 shows the land temperature anomalies for sample month on the hadcm3 model grid figure 3 shows north american land temperature anomalies for the same month at the higher hadgem1 resolution

diﬀerent sorts of uncertainty to be considered uncertainties in the station data measurement error following 5 we estimate this as 004c on monthly average temperatures uncertainty in homogenisation corrections we are estimating this by examining records of corrections performed at cru and by examining diﬀerences between corrected and uncorrected data provided by the austrian and canadian national met services uncertainty in the climatologies this is only important where station data is incomplete over the climatology period we are estimating it by exploring the eﬀect of removing data from stations with complete coverage uncertainties in the gridded ﬁelds eﬀects of the station uncertainties the combined eﬀect of the uncertainties described above sampling error we are adapting the methods of 6 to work on ﬂexible grid uncertainties in the bias corrections following 5 we are considering two bias corrections instru ment exposure changes and urbanisation we are adapting the methods of 5 to work on ﬂexible grid we have not yet made ﬁnal estimates of all the uncertainty components but we expect the sampling error to dominate the uncertainties of monthly gridded ﬁelds figure 4

island grid boxes 34 better landsea blending previous versions of hadcrut blend land and sea data in coastal and island gridboxes by weighting the land and sea values by the area fraction of land and sea respectively with constraint that the land fraction cannot be greater than 75 or less than 25 to prevent either datasource being swamped by the other the optimum way to average two values is to scale them according to their uncertainties so that the more reliable value has higher weighting than the less reliable as we have full uncertainty estimates for both the land and sea gridded data we will make hadcrut3 by blending the components like this to get further insight into the uncertainties in the blended dataset it is useful to look at the diﬀerences between land and sea data in coastal and island gridboxes figure 5 gives timeseries of global average landsea diﬀerences which show interesting structure the landsea diﬀerences are larger than the uncer tainties would suggest and have trends we believe that these trends are caused by uncorrected biases in the land and sea data sets we dont propose to pursue this further as part of the hadcrut3 work but such comparisons may be useful in future work on land and marine temperature bias estimation 35 better statistical processing 351 variance correction because the number of observations on which they are based varies gridbox and larger scale temperatures based on observational data have standard deviation that varies through time most analyses of the data do not allow for this eﬀect so we need to correct the data to behave as if the number of observations were 615oe40on 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 year00051015sd oc 0100200300400 number of observations180oe45on 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000

blue actual sd black also shown is the number of obeservations constant methods for this variance correction have been developed for previous versions of hadcrut 7 but doubts have been expressed over their suitability so we want to test and perhaps simplify them we are testing this statistical method using similar technique to the pseudoproxy method recently used to investigate statistical problems in paleoclimate reconstruction 8 we have taken surface temperature data from an allforcings hadcm3 run degraded it by removing data where we have observations and added noise to mimic the noise expected in hadcrut this gives us pseudoinstrumental dataset where each gridbox shows variance ﬂuctuations of the kind seen in the instrumental data if we apply our variance correction methods to this dataset and they work correctly we should recover the original model data so by comparing the corrected pseudoinstrument data with the model data we can test the eﬀectiveness of our statistical processing the results of this test are encouraging the correction process introduces biases into the temperature trends and makes good job of removing the artiﬁcial variance ﬂuctuations reconstructed variances are very close to the original variances the change in variance is typically reduction of up to 50 to within few of the correct value figure 6 shows the results of this test in four sample gridboxes 2 sea and 2 land the timeseries of standard deviation from the original model data is the black curve the uncorrected pseudoinstrumental data gives the red curve and the variance corrected pseudoinstrumental data the blue curve 352 optimum averaging instrumental datasets have incomplete global coverage especially in the 19thand early 20thcenturies in spite of this we want to make estimates of global and regional temperature anomalies we do this by optimum averaging oa 5 process which ﬁrst estimates the local covariability of the data and then 7uses this covariance information to estimate values for regions with missing data and so their contribution to the global average we intend to test this process also on the pseudoinstrumental data if the oa method is working the oa of the pseudoinstrumental data will be the close to the simple average of the spatially complete model data so we will be able to check that the oa technique is not introducing biases 4 summary we are making good progress towards the production of an updated version of the global historical surface temperature dataset hadcrut this new version will be based on improved observational data will have comprehensive error estimates and will have associated local and global average timeseries that are produced using fully tested methods references 1 jones p d 1994 hemispheric surface
