includes about 54 of all civilian aviation activity within the united statesencompasses wide range of airports aircraft and flight operations because ga plays small but important role in the us economy improving upon ga security without unduly impeding air commer ce or limiting the freedom of movement by air remains significant challenge however policymakers have received mixed signals about the relative security risk posed by ga due to its diversity and general lack of detailed information regarding the threat and vulnerability of various ga operations while some recent highprofile breaches of ga security point to persisting vulnerabilities and limited intelligence information suggest continued terrorist interest in using ga aircraft it is evident that ga airports aircraft and operations vary considerably with regard to curity risk while the small size and slow speed of most ga aircraft significantly limit the risk they pose some experts still fear that they could be used as platform for chemical biological ra diological or nuclear attack certain sectors of ga such as crop dusters and larger business aircraft present more specific risks because of their unique capabilities and aircraft characteristics because various segments of ga differ significantly in terms of their perceived risk mitigation strategies should arguably be tailored to some degree based on risk based on an analysis of risk variety of options exist for mitigating security risks specific to ga airports and flight operations these include surveillance and monitoring airport access controls background checks and vetting of pilots airport workers and others having access to ga facilities and aircraft and physical protections for airports and aircraft steps may also be taken to address unique security risks in agricultural aviation at flight schools and among business and charter operators besides these steps to enhance ga security at airport and operator sites homeland security efforts since 911 have focused extensively on restricting access to airspace around sensitive locations and more recently stepping up monitoring and inspections of international ga flights entering the united states airspace restrictions imposed on ga aircraft have been highly contentious because they have direct impact on the freedom of movement by air they are costly and resource intensive to implement effe ctively and their effectiveness in preventing terrorist attacks has been questioned by some ga security has been topic of continued interest to congress the fy2006 department of

general aviation ga is mentioned the image most likely to be conjured is one of small singleengine airplane droning over americas farmland on tranquil summers day in the post911 context this pastoral image of ga has been tarnished to degree by knowledge that the 911 hijackers trained in small general aviation aircraft in the united states and amid lingering concerns that ga aircraft could be used to carry out future terrorist attack while some recent highprofile breaches of ga security have pointed to persisting vulnerabilities and limited intelligence information may suggest possible terrorist fixation 1 on using aircraft to attack us interests ga aircraft vary considerably with regard to the risks they pose the security risk posed by small singleengine airplane operating in rural settings is intuitively quite different from the risk characteristics of large business jets operating in and near major metropolitan areas most experts agree that an adaptive riskbased approach to securing ga aircraft and airports that takes into account the unique characteristics of the various distinct components of ga is needed to assure that security needs are adequately met and balanced with economic and operational considerations of the ga industry 2 policymakers have received mixed signals about the relative risk posed by general aviation while the 911 commission asserted that major vulnerabilities still exist in general aviation security3 the commission did not further elaborate on the nature of those vulnerabilities nor did it make specific recommendations pertaining to ga security the faa has noted that while the dhs has specific information that terrorist groups are currently planning to use general aviation ga aircraft to perpetrate attacks against the united states it remains concerned that in light of completed and ongoing security enhancements for commercial aircraft and airports terrorists may turn to ga as an alternative method for conducting operations 4 in other words while ga aircraft and airports may not be optimally suited for terrorist objectives the hardening of commercial operations may make them an attractive alternative to terrorists seeking to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in aviation security in this context ga airports and aircraft are viewed as comparatively soft targets that may be exploited by terrorists because of known weaknesses and vulnerabilities this vi ew focuses primarily on the vulnerability of general aviation and does not systematically assess risk with regard to the interaction between these vulnerabilities the threat posed by ga aircraft and the potential consequences of terrorist attack using ga aircraft in fact there is considerable debate over the threat element of the risk equation for ga operations while ga advocates argue that the threat is minimal some policymakers and security experts have expressed concern that to the contrary ga may pose significant security threat part of the difficulty in resolving this debate is the diversity of 1 see associated press us uncovers alqaida plot in pakistan the terrorist group allegedly planned to fly an airplane into the

civil aviation activity within the united states measured in terms of overall airport flight operations5 therefore it is often easier to frame general aviation in terms of what it is not rather than what it is in this context ga refers to most aviation operations not conducted by scheduled passenger airlines large air cargo operators or the military to add to the confusion commercial charter operations are often grouped in with ga and nonrevenue flights such as maintenance test flights and repositioning flights conducted by passenger and cargo airlines are usually operated under regulations often regarded as general aviation flight rules 6 thus virtually all flight activity outside the scope of scheduled passenger or cargo air carrier flights and military operations may be considered ga this encompasses wide variety of aircraft types and flight operations table 1 shows the distribution of aircraft and flight operations formally categorized as ga

personal flying and flight instruction the typical activities one might expect to see at small to midsized ga airports account for close to half of all ga operations and comprise about 79 of all aircraft in the total ga fleet business and corporate flyingwhich encompasses anything from small businesses flying cancelled checks or regional salesmen flying to customer sites in small singleengine aircraft to companies ferrying crews to offshore oil rigs by helicopter to operations of large corporate jets and professionally managed fractionalownership fleetsmakes up about onequarter of all ga operations and slightly less than onequarter of all ga aircraft ondemand charter services referred to as air taxi services along with air tours and chartered sightseeing flights are also considered ga operations and these types of flying activity combined account for about 13 of all general aviation operations in addition to these major categories there are wide variety of additional ga operationssuch as aerial advertising eg banner towing and skywriting aerial application eg cropdusting aerial observation and other work eg aerial photography aerial mapping and data collection

considered under the broad definition of general aviation ga encompasses wide spectrum of aircraft types registered general aviation aircraft in the united statesnumbering slightly more than 220000range in size and purpose from very light sport aircraft with maximum takeoff weights of less than 1320 pounds used strictly for recreational flying to very large business jets weighing more than 100000 pounds used for long range transcontinental and international travel the composition of the current ga fleet along with total hours flown in each aircraft category is shown in figure 1 singleengine piston aircraft make up the large bulk of the fleet 66 the large majority of these aircraft are comparably small in size most weighing less than 5000 pounds maximum takeoff weight including payload experimental aircraft mostly small homebuilt airplanes make up an additional 11 of the current fleet thus while ga is quite diverse the typical image of ga aircraft as small light singleengine airplane is an accurate portrayal of the large majority of ga aircraft accounting for slightly more than threequarters of all ga aircraft

singleengine airplanes twoseat light sport aircraft and small homebuilt experimental airplanes will continue to make up more than 73 of the ga fleet spurred by large projected growth of the fledgling light sport aircraft category8 security experts recognize that both the threats and vulnerabilities of these smaller aircraft are significantly different from the threats and vulnerabilities of medium and large sized ga turbojets and turboprops another segment of the ga industry is helicopters rotorcraft which make up only about 4 of the total ga fleet but are involved in several diverse and unique flight operations that introduce their own distinct set of security threats and vulnerabilities the diversity of ga aircraft types and operations flown suggests that onesizefitsall approach to

operations and aircraft types general aviation airports also vary significantly in their size and purpose and range from unpaved private airstrips with runways less than 2000 feet in length located in remote unpopulated areas to busy general aviation reliever airports situated in major metropolitan areas and converted military airbases with runways of sufficient length to handle the largest of jets in the united states there are more than 19000 total landing facilities including both publicand privateuse facilities only about 450 of these airports serve regularly scheduled commercial passenger

almost 600 aircraft are based on the field including 56 jets and 13 helicopters contrast this with red stewart airfield 40i in waynesville ohioa 2400 foot long grass strip located roughly midway between dayton and cincinnati the airportconsidered an uncontrolled field because it has operating control towersees less than 50 operations per day the airport is home to only 42 aircraft40 small singleengine airplanes and two glidersthat account for most 89 of the flight activity at the airport while airports like red stewart airfield do not appear to pose any particular security risk security concerns may be raised regarding similarly sized airports located near critical assets consider potomac airfield vkx in friendly maryland which is located about 12 miles southeast of washington dc the airport houses about 80 based aircraft almost all of which are small singleengine airplanes and sees only about 33 aircraft operations per day however because of its close proximity to critical national assets in washington dc background checks are required for all pilots operating to and from the airport and special aircraft identification and tracking procedures have been established to closely monitor flight activity at the airport thus location in relation to major national security assets and other potential terrorist targets is key factor in determining appropriate security measures for ga airports as implementing measures like this at large numbers of small ga airports would likely be impractical and in many cases would not be possible to implement effectively given currently available resources most security experts agree that applying identical or inflexible security measures at ga airports that vary so widely in their characteristics is likely to yield an unsatisfactory solution that could either overburden small airport operators or fail to mitigate potential vulnerabilities unique to specific airports or specific types of airports therefore riskbased strategy implementing security measures tailored to the unique characteristics and vulnerabilities of specific airports is generally thought to be preferable and has been advocated by aviation security experts and representatives from the ga industry 12

pilots and mechanics to serve the airline industry additionally ga operations provide wideranging capabilities critical to our economy such as emergency medical services overnight package delivery to small and midsized communities helicopter transport to support oil drilling in offshore and remote locations and the aerial application of pesticides to support agriculture the potential economic impact of security on ga could be quite significant since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 ga airport operators and the industry have largely relied on their own initiatives and resources to implement security enhancements these efforts have been somewhat limited because large scale security enhancements to protect ga assets across the country are expected to be rather substantial for example responding to criticism over perceived lack of security at ga airports aircraft owners and pilots association aopa president phil boyer speculated we might be talking about 40 billion to fence every small airport in this country where in the world is that money coming from16 while 40 billion estimate may appear somewhat extreme and erecting fences at every airport in the country may not be the most appropriate course of action boyers concerns highlight the ongoing challenge of adequately funding ga security initiatives balancing these initiatives with other homeland security needs and doing so in manner that does not create an undue economic burden on the ga industry at the same time the ga industry has vested interest in implementing security measures to adequately secure and protect airplanes from theft and vandalism an article in ga trade publication noted that while the intent of tightening ga security has largely been seen as means to prevent terrorism more immediate benefit could be stronger bottom line for ga 17 the aviation security advisory committee asa c working group on general aviation airport securityan industry group assembled to assist the tsa in developing security guidelines for ga airportsconcluded that flexible commonsense approach to general aviation airport security is mandatory if the industry is to retain its economic vitality and

because ga is highly diverse geographically dispersed and relatively open compared to commercial airports servicing passenger airlines and other protected infrastructure such as nuclear reactors and chemical plants the security threat is not so much to ga assets themselves but rather from terrorists seeking to exploit ga assets to attack critical infrastructure or highprofile targets however some ga assets could themselves be terrorist targets for example some corporate aviation operators have expressed concern that aircraft carrying highprofile business leaders and executives such as presidents of major us corporations could be targeted particularly when 15 federal aviation administration faa aerospace forecasts fiscal years 20052016 p v1 16 jim hoffer security practically

the primary threat identified regarding ga both overseas and within the united states is the concern that aircraft may be used by terrorists to launch an attack against critical facilities or infrastructure secondary threat is that terrorists may infiltrate or otherwise exploit ga to gain knowledge andor access to the airspace system in the united states it is known that some of the 911 hijackers trained in small ga airplanes in the united states before carrying out their attack using commercial jets consequently following 911 there was specific focus from both law enforcement and policy perspective on the security of flight schools within the united states the aviation and transportation security act tsa pl 10771 originally called on the department of justice to implement program to conduct background checks of all alien applicants seeking flight training in the united states in aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds and mandated security training for flight school employees vision 100 pl 108176 placed the responsibility for these flight school background checks in the hands of the tsa and expanded the program to include notification requirement when foreign students initiate training in lighter aircraft weighing less than 12500 pounds these measures were enacted in direct response to the perceived threat that terrorists may infiltrate flight schools in order to gain operating knowledge of aircraft and the us national airspace system since september 11 2001 policies and approaches for protecting ga aircraft and airports from being exploited in terrorist attacks have focused on providing general guidelines and establishing cooperative arrangements between the ga industry and the tsa for carrying out security enhancements without imposing rigorous statutory or regulatory framework the ga industry has argued that inflexible statutory or regulatory measures could impose unnecessary burdens on certain sectors of the ga industry and could be extremely costly to carry out effectively legislative actions addressing ga security have focused primarily on the vetting of foreign flight school applicants ga pilots and more recently prospective charter and lease customers regulatory actions have primarily focused on airspace restrictions and protections mostly around the nations capital in addition to addressing statutory mandates for vetting certain individuals with access to ga airports and aircraft physical security of ga airports and aircraft has largely been left to aircraft owners and pilots airport operators and local authorities while aircraft owners and pilots have generally favored this approach to avoid potentially restrictive federal security regulations it has created perceived burden on airport operators and local authorities to identify and address security needs at the airport level the tsa has issued guidelines largely based on industry recommendations but the federal involvement in terms of both regulatory activity and funding for ga security initiatives has been relatively limited this approach has led the media and some policymakers and security expert s to voice concerns over what they perceive to be persisting vulnerabilities at some ga airports g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g24g158g149g151g142g155g138g139g146g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 some media reports have raised

incidents pointing to vulnerabilities in ga security have attracted considerable attention and raised concerns among some policymakers and security experts in the first of these highprofile incidents following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 student pilot intentionally crashed small single engine airplane into skyscraper in downtown tampa florida on january 5 2002 the pilot described as troubled youth reportedly had expressed support for osama bin laden and the 911 terrorist attacks but acted alone and had known ties to any terrorist groups 21 more recently on july 22 2005 small ultralight crashed near the german parliament building and chancellors office in berlin in what was described by german air traffic control officials as suspected suicide22 the crash prompted german officials to establish nofly zone over central berlin and again raised concerns in the united states over protecting key assets from possible attacks using ga aircraft as this incident occurred just over two months after highprofile breach of the protected airspace around washington dc by an unauthorized singleengine airplane that prompted evacuations of the white house and the us capitol 23 on october 11 2006 the accidental crash of small singleengine plane piloted by new york yankees pitcher corey lidle into new york city highrise condominiumkilling lidle and his flight instructor and severely injuring one building occupantrenewed post911 concerns over the safety and security of ga flights operated in closed proximity to major population centers following the crash the faa took action by restricting aircraft access to the east river corridor narrow wedge of airspace between manhattan and brooklyn where ga flights had been permitted at low altitudes mostly on the grounds of safety rather than for security reasons however following the crash some policymakers resounded their calls for enhanced security measures such as ga flight restrictions in the vicinity of new york city 24 while these various incidents have received significant attention given the focus on aviation security following the attacks of september 11 2001 ga aircraft have been used maliciously in earlier incidents most notably in the early morning of september 12 1994 suicidal individual with history of mental illness reportedly despondent over personal and business problems intentionally crashed stolen small singleengine airplane on the south lawn of the white house 25 while the airplane was completely destroyed and the perpetrator was killed in the crash property damage was minimal and the incident posed threat to those in the white house although these events have attracted substantial media interest such incidents are relatively rare while they identify real vulnerabilities in ga security ga advocates caution that they should be properly viewed in the broader context of risk assessment which fully takes into account the security threat and potential consequences to critical

each of these cases highlights potential threat involving general aviation aircraft it is important to note that in each of these cases damage caused by the aircraft was relatively limited and injuries or deaths to persons on the ground occurred second while the incidents in tampa and berlin and the 1994 white house incident point to legitimate concern over suicidal pilots an examination of national transportation safety board ntsb aviation accident data spanning from 1962 through 2007 revealed that suspected suicides using ga aircraft have been extremely rare occurring at rate of less than two incidents per year 26 perhaps more notably none of these incidents resulted in any deaths of persons on the ground two widely reported thefts of ga aircraft in 2005 raised concerns among several policymakers because they were viewed as indicators of vulnerabilities in ga operations that could be exploited by terrorists for example in an incident that occurred on june 22 2005 20yearold connecticut man allegedly stole an aircraft from danbury connecticut flight school and took two teenage accomplices on latenight drunken threehour joyride before landing on taxiway at the westchester county new york airport 27 later that year on october 9 2005 22 yearold georgia man stole cessna citation vii business jet one that he had served on as copilot but was not qualified or authorized to fly on his own from the st augustine florida airport the individual took his friends on latenight joyride of more than 300 miles landing the jet at its base airport gwinnett county georgiabriscoe field airport near atlanta 28 this incident raised security concerns because the jet aircraft was flown in close proximity to several florida and georgia cities without raising any suspicion because aircraft operating below 18000 feet regardless of size or capability typically are not required to file flight plans or establish communications with air traffic controllers when operating under visual flight rules while thefts of jet aircraft are extremely rare in another incident that occurred on december 15 1997 an individual with falsified faa credentials stole lear jet from the fort lauderdale executive airport in florida and piloted the airplane to nicaragua to use the plane for charter flight operations 29 like suspected suicides using aircraft thefts of small ga aircraft are relatively rare and thefts of jet aircraft are practically unheard of the aopa notes that historically only about dozen ga aircraft are stolen each year and recent trends suggest that owners and operators of these airplanes are taking steps to reduce their vulnerability to theft30 statistics from the aviation crime prevention institute inc indicate that thefts of ga aircraft have declined considerably since 2000 see figure 2 31 since the declining trend in thefts of aircraft and aircraft parts like expensive avionics components was evident prior to the 911 terrorist attacks it is

not necessarily indicate that ga aircraft are now less vulnerable to theft but rather may simply suggest that existing vulnerabilities in ga security are less frequently exploited perhaps because of general perception that security is now tighter while airplane thefts may be rare highprofile thefts like the cases cited above provide some anecdotal evidence that individuals with knowledge of ga

information that has been made public suggests co ntinued terrorist interest in using ga aircraft to carry out attacks both domestically and overseas for example crop duster pilot in florida identified 911 suicide hijacker mohammed atta as an individual who had approached him in early 2001 inquiring about the purchase and operation of crop duster aircraft32 similarly us authorities presented evidence that zacharias moussaouiwho was arrested prior to the 911 attacks after raising suspicions surrounding his desire to train in large aircraft simulators and pleaded guilty to conspiring with the 911 hijackersmade similar inquiries about starting crop dusting company while living in norman oklahoma evidence was also presented that moussaoui was in possession of computer disk containing information regarding the aerial application of pesticides 33 this evidence raised concerns at the central intelligence agency cia that qaeda has considered using aircraft to disseminate biological warfare agents34 the cia also suggested that in initially planning the 911 attacks one of osama bin ladens associates proposed that the world trade center be targeted by small aircraft packed with explosives but bin laden himself altered the plan to use large commercial jets instead35 if true this suggests that terrorists engaged in some deliberative process of weighing the pros and cons of using small general aviation aircraft as compared to commercial airlines in planning the 911 attacks while the terrorists favored commercial aircraft in carrying out their attack on september 11 2001 in the post911 environment heightened security measures at commercial airports could make ga assets considerably more attractive to terrorists than in the past while it is unlikely that small ga aircraft packed with co nventional explosives could cause the amount of destruction inflicted on september 11 2001 large jet aircraft in the ga fleet or smaller aircraft carrying chemical biological radiological or nuclear cbrn wea pons may pose more formidable threat although publically available intelligence on terrorist operations since september 11 2001 has indicated any specific threat involving ga aircraft domestically evidence indicates that qaeda has maintained continued interest in using small aircraft to attack us interests overseas for example on april 29 2003 pakastani authorities apprehended waleed bin attash aka khallad tawfiq bin attash the suspected mastermind of the uss cole bombing and known associate of the 911 hijackers and five other suspected qaeda operatives in karachi pakistan soon after the arrests authorities uncovered plot to crash small explosivesladen airplane into the united states consulate office in karachi illustrating qaedas continued interest in using aircraft to attack us assets 36 the dhs subsequently issued security advisory indicating that qaeda was planning to use ga aircraft to attack warships in the persian gulf

security risk posed by aircraft that could be utilized in suicide attacks or as launch platforms for conventional weapons the threat posed by general aviation aircraft is largely function of aircraft weight payload capacity including fuel capacity and speed other factors would likely play relatively small role in the overall threat posed by particular aircraft for example aircraft agilitya rough measure of its capability to maneuver and evade countermeasuresmay be considered factor in the risk equation albeit relatively minor one small twoseat sport aircraft might be quite agile but its small size relatively slow speed and limited payload capacity may significantly limit the threat posed by such an aircraft ga interests point out that most ga aircraft are capable of carrying less payload than typical light car 38 for example both the cessna 172 and piper warriorvery popular singleengine aircrafthave maximum takeoff weights of less than 2500 pounds and useful payloads including fuel and occupants of less than 1000 pounds39 by contrast the truck bomb used in the april 19 1995 oklahoma city bombing was believed to have contained about 5000 pounds of improvised explosives and the truck bomb involved in the february 26 1993 bombing at the world trade center in new york city was believed to contain 1300 pound device while these events involved unusually large explosive devices typical light ga aircraft would only be able to carry device small fraction of this size thus at least with regard to being used as platform for conventional explosives the threat posed by light ga aircraft is relatively small compared to trucks which have significantly larger payload capacities40 however as ground based security measures such as setbacks barriers and access controls are implemented around critical infrastructure terrorists may view ga aircraft as possible means to circumvent these defenses while many forms of ground transportation especially trucks can accommodate significantly larger payloads than almost all ga aircraft some observers fear that aircraft may be used in terrorist attack because they cannot be as easily thwarted by blockades barriers or other physical security measures nonetheless executing an attack that involves loading ga aircraft with large quantity of explosives may be difficult without raising some suspicion at the airport at least domestically where airport operators and pilots have been instructed to be vigilant for such unusual activities while the threat posed by light ga aircraft carrying conventional explosives is limited by the size and speed of these aircraft some experts argue that small aircraft may pose significant threat if used as platform to launch chemical biologic radiological or nuclear cbrn attack over densely populated area in these cases payload capacity and speed may not be considered as 37 ibid 38 aircraft owners and pilots association general aviation and homeland security security brief by the

the cbrn threat the most significant element associated with small ga aircraft appears to be their unique capability to fly at relatively low altitudes above densely populated areas and large congregations of people on the ground in fact the slow speed of these smaller aircraft and the ease at which doors and windows on nonpressurized airplanes and helicopters can be operated in flight may actually pose greater threat from certain types of attacks such as chemical and biological attacks as compared to larger faster aircraft agricultural aircraft used for spraying crops with pesticides and fertilizers pose unique threat as platform for biological or chemical attack because they are specifically designed for aerial dispersal and could be exploited by terrorists for this specific purpose however the chemical and biological threat usin g ga aircraft may not be as ominous as some casual observers may fear first many chemical agents must be released in rather high concentrations some such as cyanides may only be effective as chemical weapon if dispensed in an enclosed area therefore greatly limiting the threat of aerial dispersion 41 while other chemical agentssuch as caustic mustard agents and military nerve agentsmay be effective in open air settings the limited payload of small ga aircraft may limit the scope of an aerial attack using such agents second aerial dispersion of either chemical or biological agent over populated areas or large congregations of individuals is likely to be easily detected if suspected aerial dispersion of chemical or biological agent is promptly reported timely public health response could significantly limit the impact of such an attack in general experts believe that if any chemical or biological attack were to occurwhether using small airplane or some other method to attackit would likely be on small scale physically but nonetheless it may have large psychological impact on the population 42 more specifically in terms of using small ga aircraft to carry out such an attack the greatest threat appears to be to large openair assemblies such as major outdoor sporting events and concerts in fact one of several homeland security planning scenariosdeveloped by the white house homeland security council in partnershi p with the dhsdescribes the potential effects of an adversary using light aircraft to spray chemical blister agent into packed college football stadium holding 100000 people43 the scenarios predicted impact includes 70000 hospitalizations due to exposure including many permanent impairments and 150 deaths but notes that expedient decontamination could reduce injuries by one half this would likely be worst case scenario in which an extremely large assembly of people could potentially be victimized even in densely populated areas this degree of impact from an aerial attack not specifically targeting large outdoor assembly is unlikely because it might be expected that many individuals would be indoors or adequately protected by buildings and other structures nonetheless while such an attack may be limited in terms of its physical impact it may cause widespread

not arouse any particular suspicion at an airport however the threat from such devices is not unique to ga aircraft as these devices could reach their intended target by other means including being carried in small car or even being carried by pedestrian most experts concede that once in the hands of terrorists it may be difficult to stop an attack with radiological or nuclear device because many options are available to deliver the weapon to its intended target using ga aircraft is one of many means for launching such an attack however there is reason to believe that ga aircraft are any more appealing to terrorists nor any more vulnerable than other possible methods to carry out such an attack concerns have also been raised over the potentia l threat that an aircraft attack may pose to nuclear power plant chemical plant or other potentially vulnerable infrastructure where terrorist attack could inflict widespread damage and mass casualties review of security measures at nuclear reactors prepared by the office of representative markey identified several perceived vulnerabilities at nuclear reactor sites suggesting that these facilities may be vulnerable to 911style attacks using general aviation aircraft based on information provided by the nuclear regulatory commission representative markeys office issued report on nuclear reactor security that included an assessment of the vulnerability of these facilities to an attack by aircraft 45 the report noted that while 21 out of 103 reactors in the united states are located within 5 miles of an airport 96 of us nuclea r reactors did not factor the impact from even small aircraft into their design four reactors were evaluated during their design to consider impacts from aircraft weighing up to 12500 po unds which would include most ga aircraft except for business jets and large twin engine aircraft three mile island in pennsylvania was cited as the only facility where portions were designed to withstand the impact of large airliners in addition to smaller aircraft in contrast the report noted that some european countries including switzerland and germany in particular incorporate safety features such as reinforced concrete walls and spatial separation of critical safety systems to withstand the crash of certain types of military and commercial aircraft other examinations of the potential threat to nuclear facilities from aircraft have focused on perceived vulnerabilities of spentfuel pools used to cool expended nuclear fuel however power companies maintain that study modeling the impact of an aircraft crash into spentfuel pool wall concluded that while such scenario could crush or crack the wall it would not likely cause release of radiation 46 report prepared for the aopa by robert jefferson nuclear reactor safety consultant concluded that the threat to nuclear reactors from small general aviation aircraft is practically nonexistent and it is unlikely that terrorist would choose light general aviation vehicle to threaten nuclear power plant47 jeffersons analysis concluded that even the impact of an airliner like those used in the 911 attacks would in all likelihood be unable

that by their very design nuclear power plants are inherently resistant to airborne attacks48 the report also concluded that the proximity of nuclear reactors to ga airports does not increase the exposure of these facilities to terrorist threats although the specific threat posed to nuclear facilities by ga aircraft remains contentious issue the faa has kept in force restrictions on circling loitering or otherwise flying in suspicious manner around nuclear facilities arguably these measures would provide little deterrent against wellplanned terrorist attack however they highlight the continued concern over possible airborne threats to nuclear facilities whatever the true risk may be more elaborate measures to protect nuclear facilities such as implementing antiaircraft defense capabilities around nuclear facilities are wrought with operational and policy complexities including high costs questionable effectiveness and potentially high risk of shooting down an errant ga pilot who meant harm while light ga aircraft appear to pose relativ ely limited threat by themselves in terms of physically damaging critical infrastructure larger ga aircraft pose potentially more formidable threat due to the size and speed of some of these aircraft particularly midsized and large business jets they could inflict significant damage to buildings and critical infrastructure if used in suicide attack these aircraft have significantly larger payload and fuel capacities which would have direct bearing on the degree of physical damage they could cause to buildings and infrastructure thus in terms of both assessing risk and identifying options for mitigating the security risk posed by ga the distinction between small ga aircraft that make up the large majority of the fleet and larger business jets has important implications while small aircraft appear to pose greater threat as possible platforms for chemical or biological attacks large business jets appear to pose more of threat from being exploited in suicide attack scenario similar to the september 11 2001 attacks using commercial airliners because the various sectors of ga appear to pose distinct threats risk mitigation strategies arguably should be tailored to some degree to address the specific security threats posed by different sectors of the ga industry as well as the specific nature of potential security vulnerabilities that also vary across different types of aircraft and flight operations

or are currently under development or consideration as previously discussed the selection of mitigation options may need to be tailored to specific vulnerabilities and threats of different sectors of the ga industry which may differ significantly in their degree and scope while wide range of options is available many of the more extensive and costly options for providing security may not be economically feasible practical or necessary at smaller ga airports away from major population centers several available options center on traditional security techniques to improve access controls and surveillance around ga facilities and better protect aircraft against theft and unauthorized use additional options include procedures for vetting individuals with authorized access to aircraft and aviation facilities and 48 ibid p 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33194g21g142g140g158g155g146g151g144g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g3g159g146g138g157g146g152g151g561 g561

enhancing ga security would be to address law enforcement and homeland security response to suspicious activities and improved intelligence tracking of such incidents to identify patterns indicative of possible terrorist activity finally in terms of adopting layered security system to augment measures put in place at airports airspace restrictions and defenses may be considered to protect highprofile sites and critical infrastructure from the threat of aerial attacks costs in terms of direct implementation and oversight costs as well as the indirect costs related to disruption of air commerce and freedom of moveme nt are likely to be important considerations in assessing the utility and feasibility of implementing specific options to enhance ga security for example implementing broadly applied security requirements for all ga airports may impose significant cost challenges particularly to small rural airports where the need for such measures may be questionable also airspace restrictions tend to be highly contentious because while they directly impact air commerce and the freedom of movement they are viewed by some experts as being of questionable value in preventing terrorist attack unless coupled with elaborate air defense capabilities deploying air defense capabilities on large scale to protect against possible aircraft attacks carries relatively high cost and involves extensive commitments of resources and collaboration between the faa the dhs and the department of defense dod the costs and benefits associated with various mitigation options can be analyzed in risk analysis frameworkexamining the threat and vulnerability of specific sectors of the ga industry as well as the potential consequences of various attack scenarios exploiting general aviationto better understand the tradeoffs between various options because of the diversity of ga airports aircraft and flight operations and the varied threats and vulnerabilities posed by different sectors of the ga industry logical starting point in mitigating security risk would be to perform systematic risk analyses or security risk assessments examining specific components of ga the fy2006 department of homeland security appropriations act pl 10990 required the dhs to examine the vulnerability of highrisk areas and facilities to possible attack from ga aircraft this mandate focused on the specific vulnerability of critical infrastructure to attack which relates more closely to the threat to critical infrastructure and other significant sites posed by ga aircraft as discussed in this report in this report vulnerability has referred instead to the specific weaknesses in security measures to protect ga airports and aircraft that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to facilities and aircraft comprehensive risk assessment and risk mitigation strategy would likely take into account both the threat and vulnerability associated with ga operations as well as the potential cost of consequences associated with possible terrorist attack scenarios g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g20g146g156g148g561g3g156g156g142g156g156g150g142g151g157g156g561 experts

likelihood that they could be exploited by terrorists and 3 the possible consequences measured in terms of predicted damage or associated cost using this risk analysis framework the relative effectiveness of mitigation options can be evaluated in terms of how specific security enhancements might reduce vulnerability and how resources could be allocated in manner to mitigate threats based on their likelihood and their potential consequences the anticipated risk reduction can then be compared to expected costs in an attempt to determine the most cost effective strategies for enhancing ga security for passenger airline operations layered approach to aviation security has been implemented this layered system includes passenger name checks against watch lists passenger and baggage screening access controls at airports hardened cockpit doors and armed air marshals and pilots on passenger airlines the layered approach has unique advantage in reducing vulnerability by adding additional safeguards to foil terrorists thereby greatly reducing the overall vulnerability of the entire system in probabilistic terms the vulnerability of the entire security system is the combined or joint probability that each individual layer could be breached or circumvented thus while the threat of terrorism still exists most experts would agree that in the case of passenger airlines the risk of terrorism has been significantly mitigated by greatly reducing the vulnerability that security weaknesses could be exploited by terrorists through the implementation of multilayered security system one challenge often cited and already noted in this report is the diversity of ga airports in many respects the characteristics of ga airports are much more diverse than those of commercial passenger airports yet recognition of this diversity is not always acknowledged in discussions of ga security risk in contrast commercial passenger airports are stratified in tiered system based on their security needs commercial airports are placed into one of five categories category x i ii iii iv based on factors such as the volume of passengers the level of international operations and the proximity to critical assets and locations like washington dc similar model could be adopted to categorize ga airports based on their security risks and the particular security needs of certain classes of ga airports or in some cases for specific operators of large fleets of ga aircraft toward this goal the tsa provided as part of its security guidelines for ga airports an airport characteristics measurement tool whereby airports are scored based on variety of factors including their proximity to metropolitan areas and sensitive sites surrounding airspace the number of based aircraft runway lengths the numbers and types of flight operations and the presence of maintenance repair and overhaul mro facilities 50 using this tool airports are scored on scale ranging from zero to 64 based on the scoring airports will fall within one of four bands and the tsa has provided suggested security enhancements for each of the four bands however because use of this assessment tool is voluntary and because the process is relatively generic and does not consider sitespecific factors it provides only rudimentary risk assessment tool nd process for ga airport operators while the requirement established under the fy2006 department of homeland security appropriations act pl 10990 mandated broad examination of the security threat posed by ga more detailed security risk assessments can be done either at the airport level or for some larger operators such as large corporate and fractionalownership fleets at the operator level subsequently the implementing the 911

standardized threat and vulnerability assessment program for general aviation airports and implement that assessment program on riskmanaged basis at ga airports also the act requires the tsa to complete feasibility study to assess the concept of providing grants to ga airport operators based on risk managed approach for security enhancements if deemed feasible the bill authorizes the implementation of such grant program due to the diversity of ga airports and the kinds of operations that they accommodate the risk picture is likely to vary widely for example some small airports in midwestern and mountain states might have few security measures in place and therefore may be considered vulnerable however because of their remote locationaway from major population centersthese airports may pose little threat on closer examination it may be found that such airports may not be particularly vulnerable to terrorist infiltration based on several factors for example remote location away from any highprofile sites or densely populated areas might not be particularly attractive to terrorists and the closeknit community of airport users in small rural communities may be more likely to spot outsiders and detect suspicious activity on the other hand busy ga reliever airport near major metropolitan airport may pose greater risk even if such an airport has implemented various security measures to mitigate risk it may still be regarded as more vulnerable than rural airport because terrorists may be able to more easily blend in with large numbers of individuals accessing the airfield and while certain access control measures may be in place they may not be adequate for preventing motivated terrorists from circumventing these measures or exploiting weaknesses in access controls the tsa s approach to risk assessment to meet the sectorspecific security plans called for in homeland security presidential directivehspd7 critical infrastructure identification

infrastructure including maritime rail bridges and mass transit and others are under development for other transportation sectors including rail and trucking hazmat 51 the ga visat is designed to be selfguided computerbased assessment tool designed to assess risk and mitigation at ga airports however this tsa approach to assessing security risk at ga airports has been criticized over its lack of understanding and differentiation of ga from the air carrier environment and its extensive reliance on standards developed for nuclear power plant security that do not adequately address the public access needs of ga airports 52 critics have argued that the tsa should instead incorporate more updated threat and risk management standards developed by fema that more fully address public access needs 53 while some of these recommendations may be incorporated into the final assessment tool issued by the tsa to assess security risk at ga airports comprehensive standardized tool to perform detailed analyses of security risks in the ga sector does not currently exist many experts believe that such tool could be extremely beneficial for identifying risks and designing security programs

the airport level several aviation security experts and members of the ga community have praised the commonwealth of virginias approach the virginia department of aviation relying on an aviation security advisory committee asac comprised of various aviation agencies and associations developed voluntary program for general aviation airports that provides incentives for capital investment to those airports that complete security selfaudits on annual basis and undergo virginia state police audits of security every three years the audits focus on access controls maintenance and upkeep of security aspects of the airport property and surveillance capabilities and weaknesses at the airport key strengths of the program highlighted by its supporters include the fact that it is voluntary incentivebased program that it is proactive in its approach and that it fosters cooperative partnership between airports and law enforcement that may prove beneficial in responding to security incidents at the airport 54 various other states such as massachusetts and ohio either mandate that all ga airports carr out security audits andor develop formal security plan or require such actions for an airport to be eligible for state funding55 based on detailed analyses costeffective security programs that address the specific degree and nature of risk at specific airports can be designed and implemented various combinations of security measures are available and can be tailored for airportspecific or operatorspecific security plans these include various approaches to surveillance and monitoring airport access controls and physical security measures to protect aircraft these specific security systems implemented by airports and operators may be augmented by broader initiatives such as the vetting of ga pilots and airport workers at the federal level and establishing specific procedures and defenses to protect airspace near critical locations such as key federal facilities in washington dc in the following discussion these various approaches and the challenges associated with applying them to ga security are analyzed in further detail

facilities in the united states only about 500 have operating control towers and most of these are located at airports with regularly scheduled commercial service only the busiest airports that cater exclusively to ga aircraft have operating control towers these airports usually are geographically large and congested making surveillance for security purposes from the tower difficult whats more even at the limited number of ga airports with operating control towers most towers are not operated on continuous basis and close during late night and early morning hours further even during times of operation the security role of staffed control towers is unclear during operating hours controllers remain busy performing air traffic separation and control functions making it difficult for them to spot unusual activity or detect unauthorized aircraft usage unless suspicions are raised by unusual requests improper phraseology or procedural violations therefore the mere presence of an operating control tower appears to provide little additional security to ga airfield smaller ga airports most of which do not have operating control towers are usually not attended by airport

daylight hours or sometimes during limited evening hours aircraft may still use many of these airports during late night and early morning hours as runway lights can be controlled from the cockpit using onboard radios airport access controls and surveillance during these unattended hours presents unique challenge to airport operators on the one hand accessability is important to meet the needs of air commerce by allowing operations such as late night arrivals and departures for business trips and overnight cargo delivery to small communities furthermore maintaining airport accessibility at night provides critical safety function allowing pilots sufficient alternate landing sites if required to deviate for weather or mechanical reasons providing adequate site security for ga airports while allowing airport access for these purposes including access for transient aircraft presents daunting challenge full time security is costly option for many small airports remote sensing and surveillance using cameras and motion sensors for example may offer somewhat more cost effective alternative but requires close coordination with local security forces and law enforcement to respond to suspected threats or security breaches uncertainty and high false alarm rates in detection systems can drive up costs associated with security response and can lead to complacency that may limit the effectiveness of these systems however these remotely monitored security systems provide an alternative to security monitoring for many airport sites where full time onsite security is cost prohibitive at least one vendor provides tailored security packages integrating alarms cameras entry and access controls fencing lighting motion detectors and acoustic sensors 56 key element of these types of integrated security systems is their monitoring capabilities including remote internetbased monitoring of cameras and other intrusion detection devices and the capability to tie into local law enforcement networks for coordinated response however these integrated systems can be quite costly to install maintain and operate consequently the ga community in coordination with the tsa has

an airport watch program at ga airports in december 200257 the airport watch program is similar to neighborhood watch program and relies on the cooperation and participation of pilots airport tenants and airport workers to observe and report suspicious activity educational and training materials have been made available to these individuals to increase their awareness regarding potentially suspicious activity and hotline1866gasecurehas been set up to log reports of suspic ious activity under the program instructional materials advise observers to call local law enforcement using 911 if they believe the situation potentially poses an immediate threat since its inception the airport watch program has been credited with alerting authorities to suspicious activities at ga airports on several occasions for example the aopa cited one peculiar incident as demonstration of the effectiveness of the airport watch concept in august 2004 two men of middle eastern appearance presented

watch program including the capture of suspected man in kansas who attempted to rent aircraft at several facilities and several cases of suspicious inquiries regarding aircraft rentals charter flights flight instruction and use of hangar storage space these incidents all resulted in responses by federal law enforcement authorities although none have been specifically linked to terrorism 59 despite the benefits and successes of the airport watch program which have been achieved at relatively low cost there are several challenges to implementing successful watch program major limitation of the airport watch program is that it may be difficultespecially for untrained observersto distinguish suspicious behavior from normal activities past terrorist attacks have indicated that terrorists are likely to use methods that avoid arousing suspicion in essence terrorists have in the past hid in plain sight and may be likely to do so in the future in the case of general aviation the all too obvious example of clandestine rendezvous where cargo is loaded from suspicious vehicle onto small aircraft at remote area of the airport may likely be regarded as too risky by terrorist groups to attempt rather terrorists may try to blend in as well as possible this could lead to two undesired consequences high false alarm rates and possible racial and ethnic profiling by wellintentioned pilots and airport tenants high false alarm rates could place strain on local law enforcement especially in rural areas and small communities where law enforcement support is limited other limitations to these types of programs are that the response time of local law enforcement is often slow and local law enforcementespecially in small rural commun itiesmay not be adequately integrated with homeland security systems to receive timely notification when an incident is reported although observers are specifically instructed to dial 911 if they believe the situation poses an immediate threat another difficulty is that local law enforcement may become complacent if large number of false alarms are reported at local airports despite these obvious limitations airport watch is regarded by

implementing an airport watch program is that it is highly dependent on the observations and reporting of untrained individuals this difficulty is compounded by the fact that suspicious terrorist

flying large jet aircraft and his obvious lack of qualifications to seek such traini ng did raise suspicions at the flight school where he sought advanced jet training terrorist behavior patterns are likely to be much more subtle none of the 911 terrorist pilots nor mossaoui attracted similar attention during their initial training in small ga aircraft qualified pilots seeking to rent light aircraft also may attract little attention and pilot loading small singleengine airplane with dangerous chemicals or biological agents may look different than pilot loading his personal effects on board for weekend getaway while single incidents like this typically arouse little suspicion aggregate behavior that might appear somewhat odd or suspicious could collectively signal possible terrorist or criminal activity an additional downside of programs like the airport watch program is that they could result in unintended racial or ethnic profiling by wellintentioned observers for example would the individuals in the st louis incident cited by aopa have raised similar suspicions if they were not of middle eastern appearance besides the potential for falsely targeting individuals in certain racial and ethnic groups there is also the dang er that conversely untrained observers may not notice suspicious behavior patterns exhibited by other individuals intelligence sources suspect that qaeda is seeking to recruit nonmiddle eastern individuals for the very reason that they may be less likely to raise suspicions more specific guidance and training to airport workers tenants and pilots could improve the effectiveness of the airport watch program and other surveillance operations possible solution to overcome some of these limitations involves the implementation of behavioral pattern recognition techniques as described in commentary on ga security behavioral pattern recognition was highlighted as being designed to maximize detection while minimizing if not eliminating issues of civil liberties 60 behavioral pattern recognitionwhich is in use at airports worldwide and has been high lighted in numerous profiles of israels airlines preboarding security screeningexamines deviations from normative behavioral patterns it has been suggested that behavioral pattern recognition could be applied in the ga environment by providing specific training to maintenance and line workers for example making them an integral part of an airports security network rather than having small number of employees responsible for security 61 one challenge in behavioral pattern recognition is that single events may not stand out but aggregate samples of slightly unusual activity may provide telltale signs of preparations for launching terrorist attack however assimilating and correctly interpreting this data remains significant challenge for this reason reporting tree 62 is recommended for guiding decisions about responding to suspicious behavioral patterns the reporting tree concept is integrated into the tsas security training for flight schools which is required security training element for flight school employees under title 49 code of federal regulations 155221 et seq but has not yet been expanded to other aspects of ga security reporting tree might include notifying supervisor such as chief flight instructor or flight school manager about strange inquires or behaviors exhibited by student pilot and escalating this information up the reporting tree to law enforcement or federal officials only if the behavior is repeatedly demonstrated and in aggregate raises enough concern that it warrants further action in this manner the airport watch program 60 robert olislagers general aviation security p 61 61 ibid

such as behavioral pattern recognition and the use of reporting trees has th potential to contribute to the intelligence gathering function at relatively low cost by enlisting the support of broad

reasons first as already discussed few general aviation airports are continuously attended or monitored and doing so is likely to be costly and resource intensive second general aviation airports support wide variety of operations and consequently must provide extensive access to airports aircraft and facilities to support and sustain these varied operations including late night cargo operations training flights and maintaining adequate numbers of landing facilities that are continuously available for safety in the case of diversions due to weather or mechanical difficulties providing airport access for transient operators also presents unique security challenge for ga airports especially during hours when the facility is not attended however restricting airports from transient access has significant consequences both for air commerce and for safety for example restricting access after hours may impede air commerce and business especially in remote areas that rely significantly on the presen ce of ga airport professionals who use ga aircraft to conduct business in these areas may be reluctant to do so if they run the risk of being denied access to the airport because of late running business meeting that extends beyond the operating hours of the airport for example also for safety reasons sufficient numbers of ga airports need to remain accessible at least for landing aircraft to provide suitable alternate airports in case of emergency or diversion due to weather supporting airport access during nonattended hours poses significant security challenges access control measures must adequately accommodate transient users or the airport runs the risk of becoming inaccessible to certain users various options exist for providing both local and transient operators with adequate access to the fl ight line for example at airports implementing access controls to aircraft storage and operations areas keypad locks can be installed to control access to flight lines codes could be provided to transient operators in case they need to access aircraft after hours and could be changed frequently to prevent unauthorized access alternatively more sophisticated access controls can be implemented using key code or card reader systems where transient operators are provided with codes or cards that expire and cannot be used after certain period display of identification badges in aircraft operations areas may also improve security by identifying those individuals with authorized access to these areas this can alert observers and security personnel to possible unauthorized access tsa security guidelines for ga airports suggest that airport identification credentials include features such as photograph showing full face image the holders full name the airport name employer information unique identification number the scope of access and movement privileges through easily interpretable means such as colorcoding and clear

require standardized identification that is easily recognizable at all airport facilities presently faa certificates do not contain photographs of the certificate holder however current regulations require pilots to carry governmentissued photo identification such as drivers licence and present that identification along with their pilot credentials upon the request of law enforcement officer or federal official atsa pl 10771 directed the faa to study ways to improve pilots licenses such as including photos while the faa in response has taken steps to make newly issued pilot certificates more tamperresistant and more difficult to forge many pilots still carry older style paper certificates that can be easily forged the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 sec 4022 requires the faa to begin issuing improved pilot certificates that include photograph of the holder and have the capability to accommodate digital photograph biometric identifier and any other unique identifiers that the faa may determine to be necessary while specific plans for issuance of the new pilot certificates with photographs have not yet been announced by the faa statutory language provides for the use of designees such as designated pilot medical examiners to issue these new licens in an effort to minimize the burdens on pilots 64 advocates for ga pilots have pushed for the use of designated aviation medical examiners for issuance of the new certificates noti ng that forcing pilots particularly pilots in rural areas to travel to an faa flight standards district office would be in their opinion an unacceptable burden 65 while these new pilot credentials must include the capability to store biometric information the use of biometrics for identification purposes and access controls in the ga environment introduces many complex technical and policy questions implementing biometric access controls at ga airports may be feasible in some cases but presents significant challenges because of the need to obtain and encode biometric information for transient operators as well as those local tenants pilots operators and airport workers who are authorized to have unescorted access to the flight line 66 while biometrics have distinct advantages in terms of logging and tracking access to restricted areas privacy issues cost and logistics may make them difficult to implement effectively in the ga airport environment however biometrics may play more significant role at the ga operator level of security where they could be implemented to control access to operator facilities such as aircraft storage and maintenance hangars biometrics may also be used on more limited sets of individuals and integrated into id card access systems for local aircraft owners operators pilots and airport workers doing so may allow security efforts to focus more directly on those individuals at an airport that pose more of an unknown threat such as charter passengers not known to their flight crews and other airport visitors g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g5g145g142g140g148g156g561g138g151g141g561g24g142g157g157g146g151g144g561 because ga airports must maintain level of reasonable accessibility to facilitate the freedom of movement by air and air commerce surveillance access controls and physical security measures to protect aircraft and facilities if needed must be designed to accommodate diverse set of legitimate airfield uses for this reason implementing access controls and physical security on par with commercial passenger airports is likely

airports is seen as possible technique for assessing potential threats and also as possible means to focus security resources on conducting surveillance and applying access control measures on visitors who are of an unknown risk vetting of transportation workers and others who routinely access transportation facilities has been cornerstone of several statutorily mandated projects related to transportation security for example the tsa is required to conduct background checks of workers at commercial passenger airports and the tsa has several ongoing projects such as the transportation worker identification credential twic program and various airport access control pilot studies that are attempting to integrate background checks and vetting with the use of biometric access credentials while it may be some time before these would be mature enough to be considered for application in the ga environment there are already several statutory requirements for vetting ga pilots pilot applicants and more recently prospective aircraft charter and lease customers the most widely known of these ga programs is the tsas alien flight training rule title 49 usc 44939 title 49 code of federal regulation part 1552 which requires the tsa to conduct background investigations of nonus applicants seeking flight training in the united states for aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds and requires flight schools or flight instructors to notify the tsa whenever nonus applicant wishes to initiate flight training in smaller aircraft weighing less than 12500 pounds us citizens seeking any type of flight training including proficiency checks and periodic flight reviews by flight instructors must present valid birth certificate and governmentissued photo id such as drivers license or passport to demonstrate that they are not subject to these background check requirements in response to law enforcement and intelligence information revealing that the 911 hijackers and accomplice zacharias moussaoui received flight training in the united states and amid concerns that foreign terrorists could further infiltrate flight schools in the united states the aviation and transportation security act tsa pl 10771 initially placed the department of justice in charge of conducting fingerprintbased record checks for alien flight school applicants seeking training to fly aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds under vision 100 pl 108176 this responsibility was moved to the tsa the proc ess was streamlined to limit the impact of the process on legitimate flight

taken in response to what the tsa determined to be security threat critics argued that the rule gave the tsa significant power over the issuance of pilot certificates an d other aviation credentials without any oversight or redress for the tsa to demonstrate the specific evidence or basis for its decision to identify certificate holder or applicant as security threat68 in response to concerns raised regarding the tsa s power over securityrelated certificate actions and the lack of an adequate redress process vision 100 pl 108176 sec601 mandated the tsa to establish redress and remedy process entitling us citizens subject to certificate action on the basis of security threat assessment to formal redress hearing before an administrative law judge and an appeals process before panel convened by the transportation security oversight board the tsa has not yet issued revised rulemaking to conform with the statutory requirements set forth in vision 100 and therefore existing regulations to enforce faa certificate actions on the basis of security threat assessments longer apply to us citizens 69 however security threat assessments for alien faa certificate holders and applicants remain unchanged it has been reported that despite the fact that tsa cannot prompt certificate actions solely on the basis of security background checks faa databases of pilots mechanics and other certificate holders are routinely culled to identify any individuals with known or suspected links to terrorism70 although security threat assessments for citizen pilots mechanics and other faa certificate holders and applicants have been suspended until the tsa develops process and issues rulemaking to conform with statutory requirements for redress and remedy regulations still require fingerprintbased criminal history reco rds checks for charter pilots who fly aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds71 however other ga pilotswho make up the majority of the almost 600000 active pilots in the united statesare not required to submit to any formal background screening or checks some critics of background checks and vetting maintain that they are costly and an unnecessary intrusion into the privacy of citizens on pragmatic level some question whether background checks for ga are needed at all particularly at small rural airports where pilots ramp workers and others who frequent the airport are largely known to each other nevertheless background checks and other vetting activities have been looked upon favorably by policymakers as core component of layered security system and could be further expanded in their application to ga operators one area where background checks and security threat assessments is being incorporated into ga operations is for the vetting of prospective charter and lease customers under statutory provisions set forth in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 sec 4012 the tsa is charged with the task of setting up mechanism for charter and aircraft lease operators to voluntarily submit the names of prospective clients seeking access to aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds for screening against the consolidated terrorist watch list aircraft operators may deny individuals access to aircraft if their name is found to match watch list records while the legislative lang uage limited the

initial experience with larger aircraft was debated during consideration of this legislation while terrorist database screening of prospective charter and lease customers as legislated is voluntary policymakers may also consider whether mandatory screening of aircraft charter and lease customers is warranted however because the capability to screen names against terrorist watch list information is tied to the functionality of the controversial secure flight program for prescreening airline passengers implementation of charter and lease customer prescreening mechanismwhich is currently not operationalmay be further delayed by ongoing difficulties in meeting congressionally mandated safeguards for data and privacy protections and redress and remedy for aggrieved individuals who are

transactions and preventing money laundering 72 however because many other largescale financial transactions such as the sale of houses boats and cars must be similarly reported the volume of transactions may make it difficult to quickly identify suspicious aircraft transactions the main intent of these regulations is to spot potential attempts to launder illegal funds in support of terrorist or criminal activities and therefore the regulations are not specifically designed to vet purchasers of ga aircraft against terrorist watch lists the capability to detect aircraft sales to suspected terrorists or their associates and vet aircraft purchasers against terrorist watch lists under these reporting requirements remains unclear

background checks there are variety of other options for enhancing the general physical security of airport facilities one of the most obvious of these measures is erecting physical barriers such as chainlink perimeter fencing around security sensitive locations on the airfield however the tsa cautions that while physical barriers such as fencing walls electronic boundaries and even natural barriers can protect airport areas from unauthorized access these methods by themselves will not prevent determined intruders from gaining access the tsa further notes that excessive spending on extensive perimeter enhancements may actually be detrimental to an airports overall security posture to the extent that these efforts take away from opportunities to improve upon other aspects of security 73 besides fencing protective lighting can often serve as an effective deterrent against theft vandalism unauthorized access and other illegal activity at night74 while various combinations of physical barriers and lighting may deter unauthorized access at airports the tsa notes that storing aircraft in hangars provides one of the most effective methods 72 see title 31 code of federal

and physical security measures at airports can provide effective deterrents these measures may be costly and challenging to implement at many ga airports especially smaller airports measures to physically secure aircraft can be viewed as either an additional layer of security to prevent theft and unauthorized access to aircraft at airports with extensive surveillance and access controls or as primary means of security at some airports with more limited security capabilities physical security measures for aircraft may include cabin and ignition locks that may already exist for certain aircraft as well as supplemental immobilizing devices such as propeller throttle control surface and tiedown locks the tsas security guidelines for general aviation airports recommends storing aircraft in locked hangars consistent use of aircraft door locks using keyed ignitions when appropriate and not leaving keys in aircraft as some basic steps to secure ga aircraft the guidelines also recommend using an auxiliary lock such as commercially available propeller throttle or tie down locks to further protect ga aircraft the tsa suggests that pilots should employ multiple methods of securing their aircraft to make it as difficult as possible for an unauthorized person to gain access to it while building or renting secured hangar space may be cost prohibitive to many light aircraft owners locks and other security devices may provide common sense costeffective means to reduce the vulnerability of ga aircraft to theft given that aircraft are high value assets locks may offer relatively lowcost means to reduce vulnerability purchasing and installing secondary locks could benefit aircraft owners and operators by providing added protection against theft and unauthorized access in the absence of explicit federal standards or requirements some states have taken initiatives to require specific actions for securing ga aircraft new jersey for example has implemented stateside twolock rule requiring any aircraft parked or stored at ga facility within the state for more than 24 hours to either secure the aircraft with two distinct locking devices or disable the aircraft in manner to prevent theft or illegal use 76 propeller locks and throttle locks may provide relative low cost relatively effective deterrents to unauthorized use and theft of

and law enforcement evidence pointing to qaedas interest in crop dusting aircraft in the months leading up to 911 suggests that the agricultural sector of general aviation should be particularly alert to suspicious activities because agricultural aviation operations largely take place in rural environments away from highly populated areas increased awareness of this threat coupled with operators increasing their vigilance and taking steps to secure their aircraft may serve as an adequate deterrent however the unique capabilities of aircraft both airplanes and helicopters used in aerial application make them specifically attractive to terrorists for this reason the tsa recommended to operators of agricultural aircraft that they use multiple security devicessuch as throttle and control locks propeller locks and hidden ignition switchesto secure aircraft store aircraft in hangars with electronic security systems and steel doors and when hangars are not available park heavy equipment in manner to prevent the movement of aircraft 77 the national agricultural aviation association has provided additional guidance to operators of agricultural aircraft advising them to secure pesticide storage areas implement procedures for the shipping and receiving of chemicals secure facilities and limit access post security signs improve lighting of storage areas secure fences and

operations another sector of ga flying that has raised security concerns has been flight schools flight schools have been spotlighted in large part because of intense media coverage of the apparent relative ease that some of the 911 hijackers were able to obtain flight training in the united states and the reported lack of safeguards to prevent incidents like the intentional crash of small

new hires must receive initial security awareness training within 60 days of employment and employees must complete annual recurrent training in security awareness the tr aining indoctrinates flight school employees on fundamentals of security awareness security practices and appropriate responses to suspicious events in addition to the statutory requirement for security awareness training the tsa has issued several recommendations for flight schools in its security guidelines for ga airports80 these recommendations largely focus on increasing surveillance and supervision of students and 77

in addition to agricultural aviation and flight schools another sector of ga with unique security needs is business aviation larger faster business jets introduce unique security concerns because of their size and speed as well as their relatively high value and in some instances the prominence of passengers carried on board these aircraft while business jets make up relatively small percentage of general aviation aircraft their larger size heavier payload and faster speed introduce unique risks chartered business jets and turboprops also pose unique risk because unlike corporate or privately owned aircraft flight crews often do not know their passengers in coordination with the tsa the national business aviation association has implemented program promoting aviation security best practices among business aircraft operators 81 the program focuses on various facets of operator security including identifying security roles within an operators organization providing security training to flight department personnel establishing sound physical security measures to control access to facilities and aircraft issuing photo ids for crew members conducting preflight security inspections of aircraft matching baggage to passengers maintaining positive control of baggage and developing and keeping up to date sitespecific security and emergency response plans

best practices the tsa initiated pilot program called the tsa access certificate or tsaac program for business aircraft operators in the spring of 2003 the tsaac program was initially offered to operators based at teterboro airport teb in new jersey and was later expanded to include operators at westchester county airport hpn in new york and morristown airport mmu in new jersey while the specifics of the tsaac program are regarded as security sensitive information the program generally requires operators to implement security procedures similar to the operational security measures required for charter aircraft operators who fly aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds elements of the program include various physical security measures for aircraft vetting of customers and other visitors control of passengers and baggage access controls for the flight line and aircraft operations areas and the utilization of threat intelligence aircraft operators approved under tsaac are allowed entry into the united states from all foreign destinations whereas nonparticipating aircraft had been restricted to entry into us airspace from only limited number of portal countries these restrictions were rescinded in august 2006 for aircraft weighing less than 45500 kg roughly 100000 pounds effectively eliminating the incentive for tsaac participation as result there is presently

procedures allowing certain ga operations to resume at the ronald reagan washington national airport dca were mandated under vision 100 pl 108176 because dca is in such close proximity to washington dc it had generally been off limits to ga operators for almost four years following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 however on august 18 2005 dca reopened to ga operators on very limited basis under an interim final rule detailing extensive security requirements for ga operators to gain access to the airport 83 these security requirements are collectively referred to as the dca access standard security program dassp in addition to adhering to security protocols similar to those outlined in the tsaac program operators wishing to fly to and from dca under dassp must have their flight crews cleared by background checks submit passenger and crew member names for vetting against terrorist watch lists submit to physical screening of passengers crew members and baggage transition into dca from designated gateway airport of which there are presently 17 and post armed security officers on board each flight to and from dca operators must reimburse the tsa for the direct costs associated with these security measures which in effect makes access to dca cost prohibitive for most ga operators as currently implemented the security provisions for access to dca are designed primarily to accommodate larger charter operators and highend corporate aircraft the program is not currently available to privatelyowned aircraft but the tsa indicated that the program may be expanded in the future 84 g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g145g138g155g157g142g155g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 while corporate and privately owned aircraft primarily deal with passengers known to the pilots and operators passenger charter aircraft present unique security challenges because customers are sometimes unknown or unfamiliar charter aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds maximum takeoff weight must adhere to specific security regulations referred to as the twelvefive security program in reference to the aircraft weight criteria85 twelvefive security program requirements include passenger identification checks fingerprintbased criminal history records checks for flight crew members application of specific bomb and hijacking notification procedures and requirements and implementation of tsaapproved operator security program each operator must designate security coordinator within the organization provide training and information to employees with securityrelated duties and have procedures in place to coordinate with law enforcement entities responding to security threats although

program operators of passenger charter flights in aircraft weighing more than 100300 pounds maximum gross weight or an aircraft with 61 or more passenger seats must implement additional security measures laid out in the tsas private charter standard security program pcssp including requirement for physical screening of passengers and accessible baggage86 also regardless of aircraft weight if passengercarrying charter flight loads or unloads passengers at designated sterile area of commercial airport that is beyond the security screening checkpoint that operation must also adopt the private charter security program the private charter program prohibits passengers from carrying weapons explosives and incendiary devices and requires that metal detectors and xray systems used in the screening of charter passengers meet standards established by the tsa however physical screening of passengers can be conducted by tsaapproved private screeners and is not typically carried out by federal screeners unless arrangements are made to enplane and deplane from the sterile area of commercial airports private charter operators of these larger aircraft must establish procedures to prevent unauthorized access to aircraft and other access controlled areas as specified in the operators security program and must carry out security inspection of aircraft whenever access control measures such as posted security guards or adequate access controls to aircraft are not maintained in addition to flight crew members other employees of private charter operating large aircraft that have unescorted access to aircraft and secured areas must submit to fingerprintbased criminal history records checks and security coordinators and crew members must complete annual recurrent security training while the twelvefive and private charter security programs specifically apply to charter operations the tsa requires ga operators authorized to enplane or deplane into the sterile area of commercial passenger airports to conduct tsaapproved physical screening of passengers flight crew members and their carry on items 87 while these regulations are in place to make allowances for certain ga operations that might be permitted to enplane and deplane at sterile airport areas while preventing the introduction of weapons explosives or incendiary devices into the commercial passenger aircraft environment corporate and privately owned ga aircraft are rarely granted access to sterile areas also while the required adoption of twelvefive security program is only required of charter operators regulations stipulate that ga operators of aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds maximum takeoff weight could be required to conduct preflight security searches and screen passengers crew members and carryon items before boarding in accordance with security procedures approved by tsa if notified to do so by the tsa 88 while these security measures have never been implemented they could become effective upon notification to operators through means such as the notices to airman notam system and may be carried out for example upon receipt of specific credible

narcotics and human smuggling in the post911 context concerns have been raised that terrorists may infiltrate the us borders using ga aircraft to transport operatives and weapons including possible weapons of mass destruction there is also concern that terrorists could launch 911style suicide attack using large ga aircraft flights that originate outside of us borders to attack ground targets current cbp regulations for private aircraft designed largely to counter crossborder narcotics trafficking require advance notification one hour prior to an inbound border crossing aircraft entering us airspace are required to file flight plan establish radio communication with air traffic controllers and must be assigned unique squawk code to identify their radar blip to air traffic controllers and others that may be monitoring airspace for security purposes aircraft transiting from mexico or other countries in central and south america must fly to the first designated airport of entry nearest to their border crossing point to clear customs prior to continuing their flight unless they receive waiver from this requirement aircraft entering from other countries including canada however may proceed to any designated airport of entry while these procedures are designed to identify and track inbound flights they provide only limited capability to vet inbound flights because information on passengers is currently provided in the required advance notification transmissions provision of the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 110 53 required the bureau of customs and bord er protection cbp to develop system under which all ga aircraft entering us airspace must submit passenger information as part of the advance notification to check against appropriate government databases this information can be vetted against terrorist watchlists and faa aircraft and pilot registry databases to detect any anomalies that may be indicators of increased risk associated with specific flight cbp published proposed rulemaking to fulfill these notification requirements on september 18 2007 90 in addition to meeting the mandated requirements for vetting inbound international flights the cbp proposal would also require advanced notice and departure manifests to be transmitted one hour prior to outbound international flights while ga advocacy groups like aopa generally support the premise of enhancing security regarding international flights utilizing ga aircraft they have raised concerns about the proposed notification procedures which would require electronic filing of all such flight information via the internet under the proposal pilots that do not have internet access at their point of origin would be required to land at facility outside us airspace having internet access to file the appropriate electronic notification prior to proceeding into us airspace aopa considers this requirement overly restrictive noting that many pilots operating into the united states particularly those originating in remote areas of canada may not have internet access at their point of origin the aopa has suggested that telephone and cockpit radio transmissions be continued as acceptable alternative means for notifying cbp the aopa has also suggested that pilots be allowed to provide their passenger information upon arrival during their facetoface meetings with customs as they do today 91 however this request to delay transmission of passenger data appears to contradict the statutory requirement in pl 11053 that requires passenger information to be submitted before entering us airspace the cbp proposal notes that while the pilot is ultimately responsible for 90 ibid 91 aircraft owners and pilots association regulatory brief us

else to submit the information this leaves open the possibility that third party vendors could set up systems for receiving the required information via telephone or other means and submit it electronically to cbp private flyers and ga advocacy groups may nonetheless oppose this alternative because of the possible costs and privacy issues associated with third party receipt and transmission of passenger and crew data besides the vetting of flight crews and passengers on inbound international flights by ga aircraft tracking those aircraft is also an issue of considerable concern tracking flights along the northern border has been particular challenge because it lacks the extensive low altitude radar coverage that is available along the southern border in some locations drug smuggling along the northern border has been persistent problem including smuggling activity using small ga aircraft that can operate into and out of remote landing strips without detection there is some concern that terrorists could use similar tactics to transport weapons including weapons of mass destruction and operatives across us borders without being detected while cbp and immigration and customs enforcement ice air and marine branch amb aircraft patrol the northern border and interdict suspicious flights monitoring of flight activity particularly low altitude flight activity along the northern border remains significant challenge the dhs aviation operations capabilities along the northern border are more limited in size and scope than those along the southern border particularly along the usmexico land border in addition to manned flights to patrol both the southern and northern borders cbp initiated unmanned aerial vehicle ua v patrols along the southern border in 2004 and is expanding southern border ua v operations and initiating ua v patrols along the northern border these unmanned systems are viewed as having high endurance capability meaning that they can stay airborne for extended periods of time thus significantly augmenting the surveillance capabilities of existing ground radar and manned aircraft patrols of the us borders 92 the aopa however has raised considerable objections and safety concerns over the dhs utilization of unmanned aircraft noting that airspace restrictions to keep ga flights away from ua v operations cause inconvenience to ga operators and may impact safety particularly in and near mountainous areas where small aircraft may be forced to operate over rugged terrain to avoid restricted airspace 93

lowaltitude flight restrictions have been in place for many years around sensitive locations for reasons of national security the number and scope of these restrictions have expanded significantly since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the most comprehensive of these restricted areas is the airspace around washington dc which consists of flight restricted zone frz 15nautical miles in radius and larger 30mile radiusreferred to as the washington dc air defense identification zone adiz94where flights must adhere to specific flight plans and air traffic communications and surveillance requirements the airspace in the national capitol region ncr around washington dc has been placed under close surveillance and special flight restrictions primarily affecting ga aircraft ever since september 11 2001 previously the airspace around washington dc was relatively open and accessible to ga as well as commercial aircraft while the airspace directly above some sensitive locationslike the white house and the capitolwas then and still is prohibited airspace ie generally offlimits to all civil aircraft this comprised relatively small portion of the total airspace in the ncr before september 11 2001 ga aircraft were routinely permitted to operate over washington dc and the surrounding area so long as these prohibited areas were avoided and applicable air traffic procedures were follow ed washington reagan national airport dca which is located in close proximity to downtow n washington dc and key federal facilities was open and accessible to most ga aircraft however following the 911 attacks airspace restrictions in the washington dc region have gone through several significant changes to address heightened security concerns

february 2003 additional steps were taken to secure the skies above washington dc by establishing an outer area beyond the frz where ga flights must operate under close surveillance and in constant 2way radio contact with air traffic controllers this area is known as the washington dc air defense identification zone adiz and its existence has been highly controversial because of the operational requirements it imposes on ga aircraft the adiz came into existence not immediately following september 11 2001 as many mistakenly assume but rather as part of operation liberty shield an operation launched by the dhs to enhance homeland security during the buildup toward the war in iraq the washington adiz was established as temporary flight restricti on and similar adiz was established around new york city for brief period during the winter and spring of 2003 smaller scale restricted area was also put in place over downtown chicago during that time the temporary restrictions in new york and chicago have since been rescinded but the washington dc adiz has remained in place largely in response to criticism that the special procedural requirements for flying inside the dc adiz were overly burdensome to operators including some whose flight paths brought them closer than 50 miles away from washington dc landmarks the size of the adiz was reduced in size to 30mile ring around dca

airspace air def ense identification zone adiz and flight restricted zone frz source crs analysis and grap hi c based on pplicable faa notices to airmen notams prior to this resizing of the adiz the area covered by the adiz consisted of the 30nautical mile ring around dca plus the additional airspace extending for 20 nautical miles around both dulles international iad and baltimorewashington thurgood marshall international bwi airports during that time the adiz has lateral extentnot including the frz which it completely encapsulatesof more than 3000 square nautical miles as result of the august 2007 change made by the faa the size of the adiz was reduced to an area roughly 2000 square miles in size thus the area included in the adiz was reduc ed by roughly onethird as result of this change like the frz the adiz extends from the surface to 18000 feet and this has remained unchanged along with this reduction in the size of the adiz the faa implemented new speed restriction around washington dc limiting aircraft operating below 18000 feet outside the adiz but within 60 nautical miles of dca to speeds belo w 230 knots the rationale for this being that faster moving aircraft would offer less time to prepare and launch defensive measures to prevent possible terrorist attack using aircraft by imposing speed restriction airspace security monitors

defensive response the ga community has not voiced any particular opposition to this measure in large part because only relatively small percentage of ga aircraft are even capable of speeds greater than the 230 knot limit while the adiz in both its previous and current fo rm has been established as temporary flight restriction it is expected that the faa will seek to make the current adiz airspace configuration and special procedures permanent however when the faa proposed to make the adiz in its prior form permanent in august 2005 it was barraged by more than 20000 public comments almost all opposing the plan98 the aopa in particular strongly opposes making the adiz permanent and contends that the adiz confuses both pilots and controllers diverts controllers attention from their primary aircraft separation duties causes considerable departure delays for ga flights and confines training flights to limited airspace creating potential safety hazard 99 the aopa also asserts that flight activity at airports within the adiz has decreased by about 30 to 50 percent since the adiz was put in place and fuel sales at area airports have declined by as much as 45 percent100 implementing adiz procedures also involves sizable federal investment costing about 11 million annually according to faa estimates for additional air traffic controllers and equipment to monitor flights in the adiz101 the aopa has consequently voiced concern that if the adiz is not eliminated or modified it will permanently jeopardize the economic viability of general aviation operations in the washington area 102 critics of the adiz have viewed the reduction in its size as positive step toward reducing the operational burden associated with the special flight procedures required to operate inside the adiz although the aopa and others maintain that the adiz should be completely eliminated and replaced with less burdensome measures that can provide an equivalent level of security

other than the airspace restrictions around washington dc various securityrelated flight restrictions have been put in place to protect national security interests and ostensibly to protect potential highprofile terrorist targets from aerial attacks at various times since september 11 2001 flight restrictions have been imposed to protect airspace around major us cities and other potential terrorist targets for example during the build up toward the war in iraq in early 2003 additional airspace restrictions were put in place around new york city chicago and disney theme parks in addition to establishing the adiz around washington dc to augment the frz that had already been put in place following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 flight restrictions around major cities besides washington dc were lifted but have been reinstated for brief periods during times when the national security threat level has been elevated or when special events warranted the establishment of temporary flight restrictions however the flight restrictions around disney theme parks have continuously remained in effect and are now mandated in statute in addition to these restrictions the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 pl 108199 sec 521 establishes permanent flight restrictions over stadiums and motor 98 see dot docket faa200417005 available via dmsdotgov 99

facility extending from the surface to 3000 feet ga aircraft are generally prohibited from this airspace but exceptions may be made for flight operations directly related to the sporting event broadcast coverage of the sporting event or to provide safety and security for the event exceptions may also be made in cases where the venue is in close proximity to an airport in which case aircraft may enter into the restricted area if necessary to land or takeoff from the airport using standard air traffic procedures these restrictions have been criticized by some because they are selective in the events that are covered by the statutory mandate and therefore do not encompass all largescale outdoor assemblies the restrictions have also been criticized because the relatively small size of restricted airspace while often interfering with flight operations is considered by many to provide an inadequate perimeter for establishing adequate airspace protections to the sites they are intended to protect g18g155g142g156g146g141g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g3g146g155g156g153g138g140g142g561g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 in addition to the stadium and theme park overflight rules the temporary flight restricted areas put in place around sites visited by the president are particularly troublesome for many pilots unlike the stadium and disney theme park areas which encompass relatively small footprint the flight restrictions put in place for presidential visits encompass much wider area the area of these restrictions has grown from 3mile radius extending 3000 feet in altitude before 911 to 30nautical mile radius reaching up to 18000 feet in altitude this effectively increased the footprint of the restricted airspace around the president from just over 28 square miles to more than 2800 square miles and increased the cubic volume of protected airspace around the president by 600 typically during presidential visit ga flights are completely prohibited within 10nautical miles of the designated site between 10 and 30 nautical miles from the designated site flights below 18000 feet must be on active flight plans and in constant communication with air traffic controllers the fact that these airspace restrictions to protect the president are often put in place with little advance notice has the potential of catching pilots off guard because these presidential movement temporary flight restrictions tfrs change dynamically with the presidents schedule pilots can be easily misinformed or confused about the specific location of the restricted airspace and the effective times of the restrictions which usually includes block of time around the presidents expected presence but can change on short notice also these restrictions are often defined in terms that may not be meaningful to ga pilots whose aircraft may lack the navigational capability to identify the boundaries of restricted areas the faa and user groups such as aopa have worked to increase pilot awareness regarding the movements of the president and provide pilots with up to date information regarding presidential movement tfrs including graphical depictions of affected airspace nevertheless identifying these airspace boundaries continues to be challenge particularly to pilots flying primarily by visual means and relying on landmarks on the ground to avoid airspace incursions the aopa and other ga advocacy groups have questioned the need for restrictions over such wide area and have lobbied to keep the impacts of these security measures on airspace

these specific objections to securityrelated flight restrictions many aviation interests and homeland security specialists have raised broader policy questions about the effectiveness of these various airspace restrictions and special operating procedures noting that enforcing airspace restrictions is costly and resource intensive and providing protection to defend sites against aerial attacks is an even greater challenge the resource requirements and associated costs for monitoring restricted airspace and providing airspace protection around critical sites raise policy questions regarding the appropriate balancing of these measures with efforts to address other homeland security threats and the effect of these measures on air commerce and the freedom of movement by air

surveillance and monitoring capabilities present significant challenge for protecting airspace this is in part because detailed information on specific ga aircraft is not provided to air traffic controllers and airspace monitors unless the aircraft is transmitting unique identifying code to air traffic radar sites under the current radar system providing ga aircraft with unique identifiers and tracking all ga aircraft could at times prove overwhelming for air traffic controllers under present day air traffic control procedures pilots must file flight plans receive unique identifier codes to transmit and make radio calls to air traffic controllers to establish radar contact allowing controllers to identify and track specific flight under normal circumstances in clear weather many flights never file flight plan nor contact air traffic controllers because they are not required to do so but to operate inside certain restricted airspace like the washington dc adiz pilots must follow the aforementioned procedures for filing flight plans transmitting unique identifying codes and communicating with air traffic controllersprocedures that are often workload intensive for both pilots and controllers technologies may provide solution that could ease pilot and controller workload associated with these transactions for example mode s transponders are capable of automatically relaying detailed aircraft identifier information to air traffic radars but most smaller ga aircraft do not have this technology and it is expensive to install similarly emerging technology called automated dependent surveillancebroadcast adsb can transmit detailed aircraft information to ground stations and other aircraft but this new technology is only beginning to become available and surveillance capability is not yet available in all parts of the united states while adsb shows significant promise for improving safety as well as security the faa is still developing its investment strategy in this technology in the meantime surveillance of ga aircraft must rely on current radar capabilities involving close coordina tion between pilots and air traffic controllers this imposes additional workload on both pilots and controllers this increased workload has direct bearing on faa resources for example the faa estimates that making the air defense identification zone adiz around washington dc permanent will cost about 11 million per year mostly linked to increased labor costs associ ated with processing flight plans and providing air traffic services to aircraft operating under visual flight rules vfr that would otherwise present little or impact on the air traffic control system 104 104 aircraft operating under vfr may on occasion request traffic advisories or flight following from air traffic controllers on workloadpermitting basis however excep t for regulations established for security monitoring purposes vfr aircraft are not required to interact with air traffic services unless flying in specially designated airspace near towered airports or above 18000 feet

within the restricted airspace curtailing frequent inadvertent airspace violations by unauthorized aircraft that complicate surveillance and defense efforts is an ongoing challenge according to ncr command center statistics there were almost 3500 airspace incursions between january 27 2003 when the center first opened and july 17 2005a rate of almost four incidents per day on 655 of these occasions government assets were deployed or diverted to intercept the intruding aircraft based on this experience about one in every five to six incursions requires an intercept and this occurs about five times week however all but one of these incidents was inadvertent in three highprofile incidents all inadvertent the us capitol was evacuated raising concerns over the adequacy of airspace protections among lawmakers curbing inadvertent violations is likely to become increasingly important as more ga operations return to dca and the three maryland airports within the frz making the task of surveillance and tactical response all the more critical pilot training is likely to be an important tool for mitigating these inadvertent airspace violations in fact significant efforts have been made by user groups such as the aopa in coordination with the faa to increase pilot awareness and understanding of the airspace restrictions and provide training materials via the internet to pilots regarding securityrelated flight procedures including training on operating in the washington adiz airspace besides this information and training additional measures to improve inflight situational awareness may help curtail inadvertent airspace violations available technologies may provide ga pilots with improved positional awareness to avoid airspace violations for example global positioning satellite gps moving map displays can provide pilots with precise navigation capabilities these systems are now widely available for use in ga aircraft and could be programmed to include features to raise situational awareness regarding airspace restrictions and requirements more controversial option under consideration is stiffer penalties and steppedup enforcement for airspace violations user groups oppose additional punitive actions beyond those already available to the faa and point out that the threat of shootdown is already strong enough deterrent for pilots to take heed

associated with monitoring flights the capability to establish formidable airspace protections in restricted airspace is central issue for homeland security the effectiveness of airspace protections and interagency coordination in providing homeland security and defense is at the crux of the policy debate over effective airspace security this is because airspace restrictions by themselves are not particularly useful tools unless coordinated response to protect critical assets within those protected areas are effective merely relying on enforcement tools is not likely to be of significant benefit because terrorists are likely to care little that they are violating airspace restrictions in carrying out an attack the north american aerospace defense commands norads operation noble eagle

strayed into restricted or prohibited airspace in the environment of heightened security since the 911 attacks the faa norad and aviation user groups such as the aopa and the nbaa have made extensive efforts to heighten pilots awareness regarding airspace restrictions nd proper procedures to follow if intercepted by dhs law enforcement or military aircraft despite these intensified efforts to protect major metropolitan areas and critical sites from aerial attacks it has been reported that military officials have concluded that stopping 911style attack would be difficult unless fighter jets were already airborne106 maintaining constant airborne defense presence however would be extremely costly and resource intensive ground toair missiles have been deployed around washingt on dc but are largely seen as measure of last resort for protecting limited number of key locations against an aerial attack whether that attack may involve ga aircraft or commercial airliners 107 because of the continuing challenges in providing effective national airspace defenses the adequacy of airspace protection initiatives will likely depend on close cooperation and coordination between the faa the dhs and the dod as well as effective command and control within each of these organizations presently event response is coordinated through the faas domestic events network den continuous ly operated unclassified network for sharing critical incident information regarding aircraft deviations and violations of security restricted airspace and the tsa s transportation security operations center tsoc the central hub for exchanging information regarding aviation threats located in herndon v the function of these facilities is to provide shared situational awareness of aviation threats including but not limited to threats posed by ga aircraft besides the tsa norad and the faa other key agencies involved in airspace surveillance and protection include the coast guard and customs and border protection cbp which provide air interdiction and situation response within the dhs as well as the federal bureau of investigation fbi 108 these agencies also coordinate with federal state and local law enforcement to integrate threat response coordinated threat response was observed in the may 11 2005 event where an errant small private airplane penetrated deep into the frz around washington dc the coordinated response to this threat included deployment of fighter jets helicopters from the united states coast guard and federal and state law enforcement assets to interdict and intercept the aircraft while the response to this perceived threat was by most accounts well coordinated concerns have been raised that response to more formidable threat such as faster moving aircraft attempting to evade airspace protections and defenses may be much more difficult to interdict and may require carefully orchestrated response involving close coordination between responsible agencies while these agencies continue to assess and refine their monitoring and response capabilities congress may continue to conduct oversight of interagency coordination to ascertain whether there is an adequate level of preparedness to deal with airborne threats including threats posed by ga aircraft and assess whether steps taken to protect critical assets from aerial attacks do not unduly burden ga operators or compromise flight safety while the focus to date has been airspace protection in and around washington dc congress may also examine whether the capability and coordination between federal state and

and facilities from general aviation aircraft that could be stolen or used as weapon against those areas areas to be cons idered in the assessment included critical transportation infrastructure nuclear facilities military bases and highly populated areas with similarly situated critical infrastructure the analysis was required to identify vulnerabilities at ga airports the sufficiency of existing security measures and any additional security measures that could be implemented additional legislation introduced in the house soug ht sitespecific measures to improve security at ga airports the strengthen aviation security act hr 2649 introduced by representative markey on may 26 2005 would have required airport operators to develop sitespecific vulnerability assessments for each ga airport and develop plan for addressing vulnerabilities identified within one year of enactment hr 2649 would also have required background checks and terrorist database screening for individuals with access to general aviation aircraft the bill would have also required all ga aircraft to be secured by visible immobilizing devices such as prop locks while parked at ga airports in addition to these measures hr 2649 called for establishing nofly zones during periods of high terrorist threat levels and any other applicable times identified by the dhs around all sensitive nuclear facilities chemical facilities where release of hazardous materials could endanger one million or more lives and any other facilities designated by the secretary of homeland security also during the 109 th congress representative sweeney introduced the general aviation security act of 2005 hr 3397 this bill would have required all operators of public and privateuse airports in the united states

not in use and adequate fencing would have been required for secure areas besides these more comprehensive measures addressing ga security concerns over airspace violations that complicate the task of protecting critical assets from aerial attack prompted the introduction of legislation in the 109 th congress calling for stiffer fines for airspace violators and mandatory pilot training on airspace restrictions in response to concerns over frequent violations of restricted airspace near washington dc representative blunt introduced the capitol airspace enforcement act hr 3465 the bill called for civil penalties ranging from 10000 up to 100000 for violations of the 15mile radius flight restricted zone frz around washington dc and fines of up to 5000 for violations of security protocols while operating in the larger air defense identification zone adiz the measure also included requirement for mandatory pilot training regarding the airspace restrictions and proper operating procedures and compliance with airspace restrictions while this legislation was not passed the faa issued proposal to require special security procedures awareness training for all pilots operating aircraft under visual flight rules within 100 nautical miles of washington dc 109 this proposal however has been criticized by the aopa which believes that 1 00mile radius is too large and thus would unnecessarily mandate additional training for many pilots that never operate in or near the washington dc adiz the faa has developed washington dc adiz training module for ga pilots however this training is currently optional nationwide in the fiveyear period following the 911 attacks the faa has documented more than 6500 violations of security restricted airspace with almost 50 of these occurring in the airspace around washington dc airspace security procedures training for pilots is seen as an important step toward curtailing inadvertent violations however these statistics suggest that while the greatest need appears to be for training regarding the washington dc airspace increased training and awareness of airspace restrictions in other part of the country may also be needed 109 department

education and training for pilots flying in and near restricted airspace and have taken considerable steps on their own initiative to provide educational materials regarding the airspace restrictions they strongly oppose stricter penalties and believe that administrative actions and fines already available to the faa along with the potential threat of shoot down already serve as sufficient deterrents for inadvertent airspace violations110 during the 109th congress these groups have voiced significant concerns over the impact of airspace restrictions and homeland security regulations on air commerce and the freedom of movement by air these groups have also opposed comprehensive legislative measures such as hr 3397 that sought to mandate broad security requirements over the wide range of ga airports and operations cautioning that imposing such mandates would be ridiculously expensive is unnecessary and ignores the guiding principle of making investments in security based on risk 111 in response to this criticism attempting to tailor homeland security policy to fit the risk posed by widely varied ga operations allocating budgets and resources to address security priorities and addressing concerns about potentially impeding air commerce or compromising aviation safety are likely to remain ongoing challenges for the congress given recent indications of continued c ongressional interest in ga security issues the various legislative proposals offered during the 109th congress may be revisited during the 110th congress

commerce science and transportation senator rockefeller raised security concerns over small general aviation aircraft and urged the tsa to increase staffing and resources devoted to ga security tsa administrator kip hawley responded that more robust plan for enhancing ga security is forthcoming112 however the tsa has not yet proposed any specific regulatory changes related to ga operations in the interim ga industry observers anticipate that increased random inspections of ga aircraft particularly on ga ramps at larger commercial airports are likely to increase in the near term further congressional oversight of ga security efforts and the introduction of related legislation is anticipated during the 110th congress the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act pl 11053 includes specific section sec 1617 on requires the tsa to develop and implement standardized threat and vulnerability assessment program for general aviation airports and implement that program at selected ga airports based on risk also the act requires the tsa to complete feasibility study to assess the concept of providing grants to ga airport operators for security enhancements if deemed feasible the bill authorizes the implementation of such grant program the act also includes specific mandate requiring ga aircraft operators to submit passenger information and advance flight
