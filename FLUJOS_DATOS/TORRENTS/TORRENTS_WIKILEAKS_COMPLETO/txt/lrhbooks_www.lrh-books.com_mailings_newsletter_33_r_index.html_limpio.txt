great deal toward preventing them hubbards research identified exactly what occurs when our analytical mind is shut down by physical pain drugs or other means the subconscious or reactive mind is opened for direct recording of what is going on around us and this recording has the power to command our actions in the future just as subjects who have been hypnotized will do exactly as they were commanded under hypnosis so we react according to commands in our reactive mind hubbard named this moment of lowered analytical awareness or unconsciousness an engramand engrams can determine our fate when that recording has verbal content says hubbard it becomes most severely aberrative the accident prone person is case where the reactive mind commands accidents writes hubbard the terrible and awesome death toll taken by our automotive transport is almost all attributable to reactive mind driving rather than learned response driving engrams subtly weave their way from incident to incident and cause catastrophe in the life of the accidentprone person and those around him stress depression and anxiety as result of accidents can by themselves cripple ones ability to deal with everyday life the aberree in thousands of ways complicates the lives of others writes hubbard but with the information in the book dianetics an aberree or one affected by engrams can be sorted outthese engrams

father after twentyone years christmas after christmas while growing up in roosendaal holland frank ofman watched the heartwarming and inspiring american movies which portrayed the season as one of warmth and happiness he saw the large family the joyous laughter everyone proudly watching as father made that first slice of thanksgiving turkey or christmas hamit was idyllic and it was the exact reverse of his own life frank lived in home devoid of everything those movies represented there was little family life the father he had never known was dead his mother though she loved her was constantly ill nearly dying twice and lived with man who abused her and frank had learned to hide his feelings yet it was his mothers revelation to him at the age of 13 which set him on path that would change everything what would you do she asked him one day out of the blue if i told you your father was still alive aghast at his mothers question frank could only stare speechlessly as she haltingly explained we were young she said we got together but he had to leave to america we wanted to have kids i sent photos to him when you were born something had happened those many years ago and despite the original intention franks father never returned to his first love in holland or to the that she bore him and they lost contact over time widowed from another marriage his mother had spent the past decade of her life with this abusive boyfriendand the misery of her past what hit frank the deepest was her obvious suffering she would sit in front of the television and cry for reason frank said i wanted to change that he vowed that he would find the solution he decided to go to college and learn enough to travel to america for an internship then he would find his father and somehow set things straight the adventure really started when i first heard about dianetics in college frank relates i was 21 friend had the book and i told him i wanted to read it i read the first pages where l ron hubbard says you are beginning an adventure treat it as an adventure and may you never be the same again i thought it was very profound with these words as inspiration he moved to america and began the search for his father with little more than name and old photographs in boston he began months of fruitless calls tore through lists of names checked with the local police department and visited all the addresses he was referred to call after call house after house dead end after dead end but just as he was about to give it all up frank again found dianetics as his beacon on newbury street one afternoon he met man from the local hubbard dianetics foundation i connected him with the book i had read in college frank said at the time i wasnt happy and somehow i knew dianetics could change that frank enrolled on courses at the foundation to help improve relationships and to overcome the ups and downs of life that plagued him while also receiving several hours of dianetics counseling it was after one of those dianetics sessions that frank realized he had found the answer to his problems after that session my life completely changed frank says i became certain that i could now control my life and after that session i knew i would find my father and put together the family i had always wanted things did changeand soon one day shortly after that session man called and said i can tell you where your father is it was in fact his uncle his fathers brother and he offered to pick up frank and take him to his grandmothers house to meet the family the resulting reunion was much larger than any he had seen in the american movies he had watched so longingly in holland although his father was in new hampshire on job frank found himself in the midst of huge familyhis grandmother 48 cousins and 10 aunts and uncles who each accepted him into the family with open arms reaching his father by phone frank stated simply this is your and his father rushed back to meet him all i had was photo of him 20 years ago frank said i could see it was him but older he gave hug there was instant reality there and doubt that i was his i looked just like him in his younger photos it was the end of the search but the beginning of new adventure together they called franks mother in holland and together they paid her airfare to come to america she arrived in boston in time for the holidays frank could tell that his parents still felt strongly about each other but they had both been through failed relationships and felt they could not get back together but this is where frank put his knowledge of dianetics to work using what he had learned at the hubbard dianetics foundation he helped them to understand what had happened and to recognize that happy life together was still possible that year i got to have my first thanksgiving dinner with my new family in america frank said it was the realization of that dream in holland but franks application of dianetics didnt stop there with his new knowledge of how to handle relationships with other people frank taught his mother what to do to safely get out of the abusive relationship in holland then qualified as hubbard book auditor by reading and successfully using dianetics frank applied these principles to her ailing health and addressed the spiritual problems that were at the root of her illness after one twohour session the trauma that had been the real cause of her chronic illness was resolved and the illness that had brought her near death twice never recurred his mother returned to holland ended her relationship sold the house and returned to america to get marriedfor the first timeto franks father frank proudly gave his mother away at the wedding while on course at the
