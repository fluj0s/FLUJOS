provisions affecting the medicaid federal medical assistance percentage fmap april grady analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22333 summary the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service expenditures provisions that 1 exclude certain hurricane katrina evacuees and their incomes from fmap calculations and 2 prevent alaskas fy2006 and fy2007 fmaps from falling below the states fy2005 level were included in the deficit reduction act dra of 2005 s 1932 enacted as pl 109 171 this report provides information on these enacted dra provisions and on senate passed and housepassed fmap provisions that were not included in the final bill it will not be updated background the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service expenditures it is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa it has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 831 an enhanced fmap is available for both services and administration under the state childrens health insurance program schip subject to the availability of funds from states schip allotment2 1 for more detailed information see crs report rl32950 medicaid the federal medical assistance percentage fmap by christine scott 2 impacts on schip are not addressed in this report although the fmap is also used in determining federal share of certain child support enforcement collections temporary assistance for needy families tanf contingency funds portion of the child care and development fund ccdf and foster care and adoption assistance under title ive of the social security act budget reconciliation provisions did not affect fmaps for these programs congressional research service the library of congress crs2 when fmaps are calculated by the department of health and human services hhs for an upcoming fiscal year usually in the preceding november the state and us per capita personal income amounts used in the formula are equal to the average of the three most recent calendar years of data available from the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis bea for example to calculate fmaps for fy2007 hhs used per capita personal income data for 2002 2003 and 2004 that became available from bea in october 2005 bea revises its most recent estimates of state per capita personal income on an annual basis to incorporate revised and newly available source data on population and income it also undertakes comprehensive data revision reflecting methodological and other changes every few years that may result in upward and downward revisions to each of the component parts of personal income as defined in beas national income and product accounts or nipa these components include earnings wages and salaries employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and proprietors income dividends interest and rent and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22333 personal current transfer receipts eg government social benefits such as social security medicare medicaid unemployment insurance etc as result of these annual and comprehensive revisions it is often the case that the value of states per capita personal income for given year will change over time for example the 2002 per capita personal income data published by bea in october 2004 used in the calculation of fy2006 fmaps differed from the 2002 per capita personal income published in october 2005 used in the calculation of fy2007 fmaps fy2006 budget reconciliation the senate initially approved fy2006 budget reconciliation bill on november 3 2005 s 1932 with fmap provisions that would have temporarily increased fmaps for states affected by hurricane katrina prevented fy2006 and fy2007 fmaps for alaska from falling below the states fy2005 level and limited fy2006 fmap reductions for all states the house budget reconciliation bill passed on november 18 2005 hr 4241 also included fmap provisions that would have temporarily increased fmaps for states affected by hurricane katrina excluded certain hurricane katrina evacuees and their incomes for purposes of calculating fmaps and disregarded employer contributions toward pensions in the calculation of fmaps if they exceeded certain threshold conference report on s 1932 hrept 109362 containing some fmap provisions was filed on december 19 2005 the house agreed to the report that day but the

service the parishes 31 in louisiana and counties 47 in mississippi 11 in alabama specified in the bill appear to be those that had been designated for individual assistance following hurricane katrina as of the date the senate finance committee approved its reconciliation proposal october 25 2005 on october 27 two additional counties in mississippi were designated for individual assistance these counties are not listed in the bill b according to federal register notices from the federal emergency management agency fema 31 parishes in louisiana 47 counties in mississippi and 10 counties in alabama had been designated for individual assistance following hurricane katrina as of september 14 2005 c section 6201 of the law appropriates 2 billion for use by the secretary of hhs to pay eligible states for among other things the nonfederal ie state share of expenditures for medicaid and schip assistance provided to certain individuals affected by hurricane katrina while fmaps are not directly affected the provision allows for an increase in the federal share of states medicaid and schip expenditures d it is unclear whether the intent of this provision described in the bill as hold harmless for katrina impact is to prevent both increases and decreases in fmaps that may result from the presence of evacuees states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average receive higher fmaps and vice versa in theory if hurricane katrina evacuees have low incomes they could have dampening effect on states per capita income which could serve to increase the states fmap as written the provision would require evacuees to be disregarded even if their inclusion would increase states fmap it appears as though the first fmap year for which the provision could apply is fy2008 when 2005 per capita personal income data the first year for which evacuees and their incomes could be disregarded would first be used by hhs see text for discussion of fmap timing crs5 table 2

revisions the remaining 20 states would have higher fy2006 fmap under the provision language that limits fy2006 fmap reductions to 05 percentage points 01 in the case of and 03 in the case of ky b as the bill language reads aggregate employer contributions toward pensions would be disregarded if they exceed 50 of states total increase in personal income however the table figures assume that the intent of the provision is to disregard increases in such contributions the figures also provide an overestimate of the provisions impact on fmaps because they include employer contributions for both pension and insurance health life etc funds which cannot be identified separately from each other in statelevel bea data calculations are based on changes in employer contributions and total personal income for 20012002 and 20022003 ie the three years of data used by hhs to calculate fy2006 fmaps due to bea revisions comparable 2000 data required to calculate 20002001 changes are not available as

fy2005 level for fy2006fy2007 as result of dra prior to dra alaska had reverted to using the same fmap calculation as other states providing an fy2006 fmap of 5016 and fy2007 fmap of 5107
