his 2005 proposal the main substantive diﬀerence is that the average interest that worker would need to earn to break even would be reduced to 27 from 3 thus if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual rate of return the worker would experience reduction in overall social security income relative to current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879congressional research service the library of

administration officials concede that the individual accounts themselves do not allevi ate the solvency problem the individual account proposal would likely make the so lvency problem worse over the

the presidents 2005 individual acc ount proposal individuals born prior to 1950 would have experienced change in their social security benefits individuals born in 1950 and late r would have had the option to participate in social security individual accounts ias worker s who chose to participate in ias would not have been permitted to optout of the ia system workers would have been allowed to divert up to 4 of their payroll taxes to ias subject to dollar limit that increased over time but on average people w ould have had to earn at least 33 per year after inflation to break even this would have occurred because in addition to administrative costs their traditional benef its would have been reduced or offset by the amount of their contributions plus 3 year in interest the proposal did not include minimum benefit guarantee to ensure that participants would receive total benefit at least equa l to the poverty threshold analyzing the presidents 2005 ia propos using assumptions on investment returns and administrative costs provided by the social security administration crs found that the total of the redu ced social security benefit plus the annuity that would have been available using the actual ia ba lance would have exceeded social security currentlaw promised benefits if the account earned th 46 annual real rate of return projected by the soci security actuaries howe ver if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual real rate of return projected by the actuaries workers would have faced slight reduction in overall social security income relative to current law younger workers and those with higher lifetime earnings would have benefitted the most from ias younger work ers would have been able to contribute to their ia throughout their careers and w ould have had higher contributions as result of continued wage growth higher earners would have benefitted from being able to accrue larger account balances as the dollar cap on contributions increased this report is based on the presidents 2005 ia proposal the version portrayed in his fy2007 budget submission is not significantly different from his 2005 proposal the main substantive difference is that the average in terest that worker would need to earn to break even would be reduced to 27 from 3 thus if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annua l rate of return the worker would experience

updated version of his individual account proposal this version ou tlined in social security administration actuarial memorandum dated feb 6 2006 included three sp ecific changes 1 the proposal would become effective in 2010 instead of 2009 2 the initial contribution cap would be 1100 instead of 1000 and 3 the offset to the wo rkers traditional benefit would be based on the amount of their contributions plus 27 in interest instead of 3 of these three changes only the reduction of the offset rate lters the conclusions presented in this report based on analysis of the 2005 proposal under the 2005 proposal if the account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual real rate of return projected by the actuaries workers would have faced slight reduction in overall social secur ity income relative to current law in the january 2006 version of the ia proposal if th account earned the 27 riskadjusted annual rate of return the worker would experience reduction in overall social security income

feb 2 2005 3 president george w bush stat of the union address feb 2 2005social security reform president bushs 2005 individual account proposal introduction1 the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi program commonly referred to as social secur ity is facing longterm financial deficit in 2041 the social security trust funds will be depl eted and tax revenues will be sufficient to cover approximately 74 of benefits promised at that time given this challenge president bush made social security reform the key focus of his 2005 domestic social policy agenda on february 2 2005 the president issued document strengthening social security for the 21st century which laid out the specifications for system of voluntary individua l accounts funded out of the current payroll tax to be phasedin as part of reformed social security system administration officials concede that the individual accounts themselves do not alleviate the solvency problem2 these accounts would likely worsen the solvency problem over the next 75 years the intent of these accounts was 1 to offset at least portion of the anticipated be nefit reductions or tax incr eases that will be necessary to achieve solvency 2 to make the social security system better deal for younger workers who are most likely to be affected by these changes and 3 to provide benefit that each worker would individually own that the government could not take away the president stated that these accounts are just one piece of comprehensive social security reform package and that additional measures will be needed to achieve longterm solvency3 the president later espoused the idea of progressive price indexing as one option for achieving solvency by indexing future benefits ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs2 4 for additional information on price inde xing please see crs report rl32900 indexing social security benefits the ffects of price and wage indexes 5 in 2005 social security covered wages are capped at 90000 this cap is indexed annually to increases in the national average wage 6 social security administration memorandum to charles p blahous special assistant to the president for economic policy national economic council from stephen c goss chief actuary preliminary estimated financial effects of proposal to phase in personal accounts information feb 3 2005highwage workers to inflation while wage indexing future benefits of lowwage workers however specific details of how this proposal would be implemented were released thus this report focuse s solely on the individual account component of the presidents 2005 social security reform proposal4 the presidents 2005 social security individual account proposal individual account contributions under the presidents proposal indi viduals born prior to 1950 would have experienced change in thei r social security benefits individuals born in 1950 and later would have had the opti on to participate in social security individual accounts ias workers born in years 1950 through 1965 could have first participated in 2009 workers born in years 1966 through 1978 could have firs t participated in 2010 workers born in years 1979 and later could have first participated in 2011 those who chose to participate would have been able to divert up to 4 of their social security covered wages into an individual account5 the actual maximum dollar amount of contributions would have be gradually increased such that low earners would be able to immediately contribute full 4 of earnings to their ia while higher earners would initially have their contributions capped in the first year of account availability 2009 the cap on contributions would have been 1000 according to the social security actuari this cap would increase by 100 each year and then be increased by the growth in the national average wage6 for example in 2010 the contribution limit would be equa l to 1100 increased by the growth in average wages between 2007 and 2008 or 1145 the actuarial memorandum only covers the years through 2015 and the c ontribution limit rises using this method each year until then though it is not specified in the actuarial memorandum the february 2 document implies that this dollar contribution limit would continue to rise after 2015 but that contributions w ould never exceed 4 of covered wages individuals who do not choose to particip ate in the ia system would continue to draw benefits from the traditional social security system however these benefits are likely to be reduced to achieve long term solvency individuals who choose to participate in the ia system would not be permitted to discontinue their participation would be subject to benefit reductions ba sed on their participation in the ia and would also be subject to benefit reduc tions to achieve longterm solvencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs3 7 some have argued that this assumption may understate the true administrative costs of such system the actuaries did not provide an estimate of the costs associated with annuitization 8 an index fund is fund composed of secur ities intended to replicate the movement of specific securities index eg the dow jones standard poors 500 etc index funds are considered to be passive investments since the portfolio manager does not have to decide among various securities for investment rather the manager knows the securities that make up the index and their relative importance to the overall index and seeks to match it because the management of the investment is less active the expenses and transaction costs are low the advantage of index funds is that since most funds do not beat the index anyway the investor has greater chance of at least matching industry averages the limitation of the index fund is that it must purch ase all of the securities in the index even if the market indicates that particular security in the index is going to lose value taken from p 501 how the us securities industry works by hal mcintyre 9 robert j shiller of yale university recently conducted computer simulation using continuedaccount administration and investment individual account contributions would be collected and records maintained by central administrator private investme nt managers would be chosen through competitive bidding process to manage pooled account contributions the central administrator would be responsible for addr essing participant stions and issuing periodic account statements the social security administrations actuaries timate that the ongoing administrative costs for centralized system with limited choice of fund investment would be roughly 03 pe rcentage points or 30 basis points7 individuals who optin to the ia syst em would choose from few broadbased investment funds government bond f und an investmentgrade corporate bond index fund smallcap st ock index fund largecap stock index fund and an international st ock index fund8 in addition workers could choose government bond fund with guaranteed rate of return above inflation workers could also select lifecycle portfolio that would automatically adjust the level of risk and return of the investments by gradually reducing the portion of the tfolio invested in stocks and increasing the proportion invested in bonds as the worker aged in an attempt to avoid sudden losses closer to retirement this portfolio would be the default choice for workers reaching age 47 although the work er could optout if the worker and his or her spouse signed waiver stating that th ey are aware of the risks workers would be able to adjust their alloca tions among these funds annually lifecycle portfolios redu ce the probability of sudde n loss of capital due to decline in equity values but they do not eliminate this risk furthermore with the switch to heavier investment in bonds rath er than stocks comes reduced expected rate of return in the account balance the ra of return one earns closer to retirement has greater effect on the ove rall account balance than the ra of return earned at the start of working career because that interest rate is applied to every dollar held in the account at that point in time not just the account few years into ones career shifting the asset allocation to favor bonds does reduce the downside risk but it also limits the upside gains9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs4 9 continued financial data going back to 1871 he found that people enrolled in lifecycle acc ounts would have lost money 32 of the time under the presidents ia proposal because the rate of return earned is less than the 3 real rate of return required to break even in the proposal for additional information please see robert j shillers study the lifecycle personal accounts proposal for social security an ev aluation yale icf working paper 0506 apr 2005 available at httppapersssrnc omsol3paperscfm abstract_id703221 10 according to the social security actuari memorandum disability benefits would not be reduced 11 unlike the actual individual account which is reduced on an nnual basis by 03 of assets and results in an expected net 46 annual rate of return or riskadjusted 27 rate of return the shadow account is not re duced for any administrative fees see the methodology section for additional detailin the scenario described in the pres idents proposal the lifecycle portfolio would specify an asset allocation shif t based on workers planned year of retirement thus all workers retiring in given year have the same portfolio of stocks and bonds the primary appeal of these targeted retirement date lifecycle portfolios is the minimal invol vement required by the inve stor once the individual joins the fund the assets are on autopilot and the individual does not need to decide when or how to adjust the portfolio howeve r this one size fits all approach may not be ideal for those who have investments outside the social security ia system as it could undermine the intended overall asset allocation for th at workers age for example worker who already has great deal invested in bonds in 401k plan may not want the automatic shift toward s bonds specified by lifecycle portfolio because it could place too great portion of his or her assets in fixed income securities this approach may also not be ideal for those with different tolerance for risk for example the asset allocation specified for someone at age 35 might be 80 in stock and 20 in bonds however some individuals may be ri sk averse and prefer portfolio with 70 stock and 30 bonds offset to social secu rity defined benefit based on hypothetical individual account if worker chooses to participate in an ia in exchange for the reduction in contributions to the defined benefit social security system he or she would accept future social security be nefit reduction the benefit reduction w ould apply to the social security retirement spousal or aged widower be nefit that would otherwise be paid to him or her10 this future benefit reducti on is equal to the contributions made to the workers individual account pl us 3 per year in interest for each actual account that worker contri butes to and receives upon retirement there is also hypothetical shadow account that exists only as an accounting mechanism the shadow account records all of the contri butions made to the actual account and grows them at fixed annual real rate of return the rate one would earn after adjusting for inflation of 3 essentia lly equal to what the social security administration actuaries project these c ontributions would have earned had they continued to be paid into the social s ecurity system and invested in treasury bonds in the trust funds11 thus the 30 offset is intended to reflect the portion of the social security benefit the worker choos to forgo and replace with individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs5 12 an annuity is an insurance instrument th at provides stream of periodic payments in return for an up front payment called the pre mium in this case the premium would be the individuals account balance at retirementaccount proceeds by diverting portion of hi s or her payroll tax away from the social security system table 1 provides an example of how this w ould work in this example mary works and contributes to her individua l account for 10 years between 2021 and 2031 each year mary contributes an amount equa l to 4 of her soci security covered wages to her individual account for example she earns 15000 in 2021 and therefore contributes 600 to her ia where it is assumed to grow at 46 annual real rate of return and results in an nd of year account balance of 622 when she makes her 600 contribution to her actual ia the shadow ia reflects this same contribution amount but grows it at fixed 30 annual real rate of return so that at the end of the first year her shadow ia records balance of 617 this same process continues every year until she retir in 2031 at that point her actual ia balance is 15648 and her shadow ia ba lance is 14327 upon retirement the account balance of this hypothetical shadow account is converted into hypothetical cpiindexed monthly annuity12 this hypothetical annuity would be used to reduce or offset the social security defined benefit table 1 marys actual and shadow individual accounts yearannual

10year work history mary could expect to receive so cial security defined benefit equal to about 654 per month in 2031 marys shadow account would produce cpiindexed annuity of 82 per month this shadow annu ity is used to reduce or offset maryshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs6 social security benefit leaving her with social security defined benefit of 572 assuming that mary chooses to annuitize he r entire actual ia balance marys actual ia would produce cpiindexed annuity of 89 per month the annuity from the actual ia plus her reduced social secur ity defined benefit w ould provide mary combined social security income of 661 table 2 how marys shadow account offsets her social security defined benefit and how her actual account contributes to her social security income in 2031 marys currentlaw social security defined monthly benefit 654 minus shadow account monthly annuity based on fixed 30 annual real rate of return 82 equals remaining social security defined monthly benefit 572 plus actual account monthly annuity assuming 46 annual real rate of return 89 equals combined social security monthly income 661 source created by crs note example assumes current law pr ovisions remain in place through 2031 and that mary chooses to annuitize her entire ia balance individual account distributions workers would not be per mitted to have access to their ia balances prior to retirement upon retirement the receipt of aged widower benefits or conversion from disabled worker to retirement benefits the ia accumulation would be available to the beneficiary individuals may be re quired to purchase an annuity or take in phased withdrawals portion of the ia balance the portion required to be annuitized or taken in pha sed withdrawals would be equal to the dollar amount needed to provide the worker with tota l monthly benefit equa l to at least 100 of the federal poverty threshold when combin ed with the reduced social security defined benefit for ex ample looking back at table 2 marys reduced social security defined benefit w ould be equal to 572 in 2005 dollars in 2031 the year of marys retirement the monthly poverty vel is projected to be equal to 766 in 2005 dollars thus mary would be re quired to annuitize or take in phased withdrawals whatever portion of her ia is needed to provide monthly stream of income equal to 194 766 572 the annuity purchased or phased withdr awals taken would be required to be cpiindexed so that the annual amounts in crease with inflation and thus retain purchasing power if after the purchase of this annuity or estimation of phased withdrawals the worker still has balance in his or her ia the remainder may be withdrawn as lumpsum or left as an inheritance there would be minimumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs7 13 the plan does not specify whether the poverty threshold to be used is for the single worker for all individuals who are expected to receive benefits off of the workers record or all household members 14 not all individual accounts are likely to have large enough balances to provide monthly withdrawal amount that when co mbined with the reduced soci security defined benefit is able to provide combined social secur ity income equal to 100 of the federal poverty threshold whether provided in the form of an annuity or as phased withdrawal the currentlaw social security program also doe s not guarantee benefit amount equal to 100 of the federal poverty thresholdbenefit guarantee to ensure that participants would receive total benefit at least equal to the poverty threshold13 under the system of phased withdrawal s also referred to as programmed withdrawals or selfannuitization the work ers account balance is divided in such way as to allow the worker to withdr aw an equal amount each month indexed to inflation until the retiree dies or until th ia funds are depleted this amount is calculated taking into account projected fu ture inflation inte rest rates and life expectancy it has not yet been specified who will take the role of calculating the size of these withdrawals the advantage of phased withdrawals as opposed to an annuity is that worker who does not expect to live to projected life expectancy could withdraw whatever portion of their ia asse ts are needed to stay above poverty and upon death the remaining balance would be available to pass along as an inheritance14 when worker purchases cpiindexed annuity risks of higher than expected inflation lower than expected interest rates and of living longer than an individuals projected life expectancy are borne by the insurance company when worker opts to take phased withdrawals these risks ar borne by the worker thus if inflation grows faster than originally expected the amount of money that the worker must withdraw to remain above pove rty would increase leading the worker to deplete his or her ia assets faster th an planned under phased wit hdrawals the worker retains the responsibility for investing the individual acc ount assets in such way as to ensure rate of return that would main tain an account balance sufficient to provide the appropriate level of withdrawals until th expected date of death if the worker fails to invest in such way as to ensure the rate of return needed to maintain an account balance until they die then the withdrawal amounts would eventually exceed the balance remaining in the ia leading the worker to have insufficient resources to remain above poverty under phased withdrawal system the worker also faces the risk that they will live beyond the date of life expectancy that was used to calculate the phased withdrawal amounts the date of life expectancy is by definition the average remaining number of years prior to death thus on average about 50 of those opting for phased withdrawals will die prior to running out of ia funds and 50 will live longer than expected and run out of ia funds in this case the worker would have received larger withdrawal am ounts than could be sustained with the ia balance at retirement and the worker would risk running out of funds prior to death phased withdrawals do not guarantee that those with ia balances projected to be sufficient at retirement when the monthl phased withdrawal amount is calculated will avoid falling into povertyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs8 15 brown jeffrey olivia mitchell and james poterba the role of real annuities and indexed bonds in an indivi dual accounts retirement program national bureau of economic research working paper 7005 mar 1999if worker decides not to use inflati onindexed phased wit hdrawals of portion of his or her ia to mainta in above poverty level retiremen t income he or she would be required to purchase cpiindexed annu ity to achieve this goal although the presidents plan requires the purchase of cpiindexed annuities there is currently very limited market for these annuities in the united states although the treasury has issued treasury inflation protection securities tips since 1997 the demand for inflationindexed annuities re mains small possibly because many workers feel that they already have some form of inflation protection from currentlaw social security benefits if however these types of annuities were to be mandatory and accompanied by the required reduction in social security benefits for ia participants the experience in the united kingdom indicates that it is likely that such market would develop15 analysis of the presidents 2005 ia proposal although the presidents ia proposal w ould worsen social security solvency within the next 75 years in the long run the shadow accounts and the resulting offsets in social security defined benefits would reduce benefit costs to the current law program because of the shortrun co sts and barring othe r benefit reductions or tax increases the ia proposal is likely to increase publicly held debt and increase the unified budget deficit under the pres idents ia proposal younger workers and higher earners who can contribute to the ia for longer periods of time or contribute larger amounts to the ia would have larger ia balances and annuities than those who contribute over fewer years or contribute fewer dollars as result of the larger ia balances younger workers and higher earne rs would have lower social security defined benefit whether worker doe s better under the individual account proposal depends on whether he or she is able to obt ain higher annual rate of return net of administrative expenses than the 30 real rate of return used to calculate the shadow account although these individual accounts are lik ely to make the solvency problem worse the president has not yet specifi ed how this additional shortfall will be financed it could be financed through 1 increased government borrowing to be paid off eventually through general revenues 2 increased payroll taxes or other tax increases or 3 additional benefit reductions crs has provided estimates of combined social security income under two scenarios one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are found nd the trust fund can provide scheduled current law social security benefits nd one where it is assumed th at trust fund revenues are not found and the currentlaw benefit is reduced to payable level based on estimated currentlaw revenues however because the social security administration actuaries were not provided with the plan specifications needed to produce 75year analysis of how the presidents ia proposal would affect solvency the size of the annual benefit re ductions that would be required to maintain trust fund solvency under payable baseline is not known theref ore the results below do not take intohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs9 16 for details on scaled wage workers please refer to the methodology section 17 social security administration memorandum to charles p bla hous special assistant to the president for economic policy national economic council from stephen c goss chief actuary preliminary estimated financia l effects of proposal to phase in personal accounts information feb 3 2005account the benefit reductions on top of those required under currentlaw and under the shadow account offset that would be necessary under the presidents ia proposal to achieve solvency thus this analysis tends to overstate the combined social security income that would be available under the ia proposal compared to currentlaw payable baseline however the total social security income possible for scaled averagewage wo rker using the expected 46 annual real rate of return would be 31 higher than currentlaw payable benefits for younger cohorts16 thus if the additional benefit re ductions required to achieve solvency under the ia plan reduce benefits by less than 31 scaled averagewage workers under the ia plan would still come out ahead one important limitation of using these assumed constant annual inte rest rates is that historical rate s of return have not followed such pattern interest rate fluctuations over time and where these fluctuations occur in workers career can have large ffect on the estimated account balances of workers under an ia system effect on social security solvency administration officials acknowledge that the proposed individual accounts alone do not improve the social security so lvency problem in the shortrun these individual accounts are likely to make the so lvency problem worse the presidents plan permits individuals to contribute up to 4 percentage points up to dollar contribution limit of the current 124 pa yroll tax into individual accounts thus diverting current revenues away form the traditional social security system by itself this step would worsen the social security solvency problem because these dollars are taken from the social security surpluses and therefore the trust funds dont accrue the same balances that they otherwise would have and they also earn less interest on these reduced balances not including the lost interest earnings the cost to the trust funds between 2005 nd 2015 would be appr oximately 541 billion in constant 2004 dollars17 by the end of 2015 the ia proposal would increase publiclyheld debt by 587 billion in 2004 dollars the second piece of the presidents ia proposal the reduction in social security benefits based on the shadow account has the effect of offse tting the cost of the ia proposal and potentially improving the solvency problem in the long run however because this reduction only takes place upon workers re tirement but the contributions to the ia begin almost immediately and continue up to the workers year of retirement the savings from the benefit offset takes many years to counter the loss of revenue to the trust funds from the ia itself betw een 2005 and 2015 these offsets reduce social security benefits by only 3 billion cons tant 2004 dollars the social security actuaries estimate that the year in which so cial security costs exceed social security tax revenue would be 2012 under the pres idents proposal in stead of 2017 under current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs10 18 the default option under sen grahams plan was an individual account funded by carveout equal to 4 of the current payro ll tax with contributions capped at 1300 in 2006 and increased with the percent increase in the national average wage thereafter the benefit offset was calculated using account contributions grown at real annual interest rate of 27 19 the congressional research service crs calculation based on social security administration memorandum from chris chaplain and alice h wade to stephen c goss on the estimated oasdi financial effects of social security solvency and modernization act of 2003 introduced by senator linds ey graham information nov 18 2003 continuedif as indicated in the actuarial memora ndum disability recipients are not subject to the shadow account offset presuma bly because disabled workers would not have access to their accounts until their disab ility benefits convert to aged retirement benefits at the full retirement age then the trust funds would be made worse off because they would still have the burden of paying full social security benefit amounts to disability recipients who are by definition under the retirement age even though these individuals may have participated in the ia system thereby reducing the revenues available to pa these benefits the actua rial memorandum implies that disabled individuals would be subject to the offset upon conversion from disability benefits to retirement benefits at the full retirement age reducing the cost of their benefit payments from that point on the actual effect of the presidents pr oposal on solvency is dependent upon the number of individuals who pa rticipate in the system of individual accounts and upon their level of earnings the social security actuaries assume that approximately two thirds of all eligible work ers will optin to the account system the actuaries do not attempt to predict what types of workers eg high wage low wage etc would participate in the ia system but instead rely on estimates of the aggregate dollar amounts that would likely be diverted from current payroll taxes the larger the number of individuals who pa rticipate in the accounts the greater the dollar amount diverted away from the current social security system and the greater the upfront negative impact on social security solvency of course the greater the number of individuals who choose to participate in the ia system the greater the eventual reduction in benefits promised to these i ndividuals under the curre nt social security system and the greater the potential longterm enhancement to social security solvency the social security actuaries who estimate the effect of social security reform proposals on solvency were unable to produ ce the standard 75year estimate of the effect of the presidents proposal because they were only given specifications through 2015 however based on similar indi vidual account structure introduced by senator lindsey graham as part of larger reform proposal in the 108th congress s 1878 and analyzed by the social security actuaries it seems likely that over 75 year period the presidents individual account proposal would not pay for itself through benefit offsets nor redu ce the existing solvency problem18 in present value terms senator grahams individual acc ount proposal alone w ould have added 27 trillion in constant 2004 dollars to the 40

please refer to crs report 94593 social security where do surplus taxes go and how are they used by geoffrey kollmannsome individual account proposals such as that introduced by representative shaw hr750 in the 109th congress use the actual individual account to provide revenue to the social security trust fund to pay social security benefits the individual is still responsible for investing the ia assets but instead of reducing the social security benefit base d on contributions to the ia the actual ia is handed over to the government for use in paying for the individuals social secu rity benefits the social security benefit payments are fixed but the rate of return earned by each individual worker on his or her account and thus the account balance is subject to fluctuation thus the trust fund is subject to the risk that the individual accounts will not be invested in way that pr oduces sufficient revenue to pay for an individuals lifetime be nefits alternatively the pr esidents proposal provides the trust funds with guaranteed source of revenue in the form of reduced benefit costs which is equal to the individuals ia contributions grown at real annual 3 interest rate therefore the trust funds ar not subject to any investment risk with the lower traditional social security be nefits the presidents proposal also lowers the impact on the trust funds from the costs of unexpected increases in inflation or longevity individuals are responsible for purchasing an annuity in which case these risks are shifted to the insurance company that sold the annuity or making phased withdrawals in which case these ri sks are borne by the individual effect on the unified budget the unified budget the combined on nd offbudget could be affected by this proposal in two ways first if the government relies on general revenues to reimburse social security for the loss of re venue due to the diversion of funds for the ia the treasury would need to either in crease tax revenues reduce other government spending or increase government debt ccording to the office of management and budget the presidents ia proposal will require transition fi nancing of 664 billion over the next 10 years or 754 billion including interest if additi onal debt is issued to cover these costs20 second as figure 1 below illustrates diverting social security revenues into individual accounts reduces the social security surplus thereby reducing the offbudget surplus so cial security surplus dollars are not held by the social security trust funds rath er according to law surplus receipts are credited to the social security trust funds in the form of specialissue non marketable treasury bonds the actual surplu s dollars are held by the us treasury where they become part of the general revenue pool and can be used to increase spending reduce taxes or reduce the government debt21 in recent years social security surpluses have been used to offset increased spending or reduced taxes sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs12 the rest of the governments budget on budget has been in deficit thus any reduction in the social security surplu s offbudget would barring other changes lead to an increased unified budget deficit source congressional research service crs calculations based on the 2004 social security trustees report table vif9 and the feb 3 2005 social security

higher rate of return one expects to ear n from investing in stocks is due to the higher risk such an investment carries the differenc between the rate of return on stocks and the rate of return on government bonds is known as the risk premium the amount of compensation the market demands for taking on the additional risk of investing in stocks relative to the lower risk of investing in gove rnment bonds in this case because stocks are assumed to earn real rate of return of 65 while government bonds are assumed to earn real rate of return of 3 the risk prem ium is 35 percentage points thus the risk adjusted rate of return used in this analysis represents the stock rate of return adjusted downward by this risk premium this rate of return omits any expected return over that of government bondsslight reduction in overall social security income relative to current law22 younger workers and those with higher lifetime earnings would benefit the most from ias younger workers would be able to contribut to their ia throughout their careers and would have higher contributions as re sult of continued wage growth higher earners would benefit from being able to accr ue larger account balances as the dollar limit on contributions increases over time til it reaches the full 4 of covered wages how an individual worker would fare under the ia proposal would depend entirely upon how the actual rate of return ear ned by the workers ia compared to the fixed benefit offset rate of 3 the work er would bear all of the investment risk if workers actual account attained an annual real rate of return greater than 3 the balance of the actual account would be hi gher than that of the shadow account thus while the social security benefit w ould be reduced by the annuity based on the shadow account an annuity from the actua l account would be larger and would more than offset the reduction to the defined benefit therefore the combined actual individual account annuity plus the social security benefit reduced by the shadow account would be larger than what the wo rker is scheduled to receive under current law on the other hand if workers act ual account attained an annual real rate of interest lower than 3 the balance of th actual account would be lower than that of the shadow account thus while the social security benefit would be reduced by the annuity based on the shadow account an annuity from the actual account would be smaller and would not offs et the reduction to the workers social security benefit therefore the combined actual ia annuity plus the social security benefit reduced by the shadow account would be smaller than what the worker is promised to receive under current law because the hy pothetical account rate of return 30 is not reduced by administrative fees while the actual riskadjusted rate of return is reduced by administrative fees to 27 the hypothetical account balance will exceed that of the riskadjusted actual account in every case where the worker invests exclusively in government bonds as way to optout of the ia system according to the actuarial memorandum disability beneficiaries would not be subject to the offset and would not ve access to their ia until conversion from disability benefits to aged retirement benefits at the full retirement age the memorandum also indicates that the offset applies to all aged retirement benefits if disability recipients were subject to th offset upon conversion then these workers would experience sudden change in the co mposition of their benefit from one of guaranteed benefit to one that is partially guaranteed and par tially dependent on the proceeds from the iahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs14 23 the 2005 social security trustees report indi cates that the year of exhaustion of the oasdi trust funds in 2041 to maintain consistency with the underlying assumptions used in this analysis crs has continued using 2042 as the date of exhaustion for the payable baseline estimateslimitations of this analysis according to the 2004 trustees report the source of the assumptions used for this an alysis under current law social security will be unable to fully pay promised benefits after 204223 estimates of combined social security income are provided under two scenarios one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are found and the trust fund can provide scheduled current law social security benefits and one where it is assumed that trust fund revenues are not found and the currentlaw benefit is reduced to payable level based on estimated currentlaw revenues in the scheduled benefits scenario the benefit estimates for both the currentlaw benefit nd the social security benefit under the presidents ia assume the use of yet unide ntified sources of revenue comparison of the payable baseline to the scheduled baseline shows to what degree the current law scheduled benefits are overstated compared to currentlaw revenue sources because the individual account s would actually make the social security solvency problem worse in the short run to achieve solvency without revenue increases the presidents proposal would require larger benefit reductions than those that would be required to achieve solvency under current law unless the entire transition cost were financed through increased debt or higher taxes however because the social security administration actuaries were not provided with the plan specifications needed to produce 75year analysis of how the presidents ia proposal would affect solvency the size of the annual benefit re ductions that would be required to maintain trust fund solvency is not known thus serious limitation of the payable analysis is that it overstates the value of the total social s ecurity income available under the ia plan because it fails to take into account the additional solvencydriven reductions on top of the shadow account offset to the social security defined benefit that forms the base of social security combined income figure 2 shows that the total social security income possible for scaled averagewage worker using the assumed 46 annual real rate of return would be 31 higher than currentlaw payable bene fits for younger cohorts thus if the additional benefit reductions required to achieve so lvency under the ia plan reduce benefits by less than 31 scaled averagewage workers who achieve the expected 46 annual rate of return under the ia plan would still come out ahead however if the ultimate benefit reductions are greater than 31 workers would have higher benefits under currentlaw figure 2 also shows that the total social security income possible for scaled averagewage worker using th riskadjusted 27 annual real rate of return would be bout 4 lower than currentlaw payable benefits for younger cohorts thus any additiona l benefit reductions required to achieve solvency under the ia plan would make these scaled av eragewage workers worse off

the 2004 trustees report the source of the assumptions used for this analysis under current law social security will be unable to fully pay pro mised benefits after 204224 at that time payroll tax revenues and revenues from the income taxation of social security benefits are projected to be sufficient to pay approximately 74 of scheduled benef its and gradually declining percentage thereafter thus under current law benefit reduction of approximately 26 would be required in 2042 with gra dually increasing reductions thereafter in the examples presented below only the worker age 21 today would have any change in social security be nefits under the payable baseline as this workers year of retirement 2051 occurs after the trust funds have been depleted and annual social security revenues are sufficient to pay only 74 of promisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs16 benefits thus under the payable baseline the 21y earolds social security promised benefits are reduced by 26 for series of hypothetical workers that vary by age and earnings history the following section provides estimates of the workers actual and shadow individual account balances currentlaw promised social

differ by age and lifetime earnings estimates for hypothetical low average and highwage earners born in various years ie of various birth cohorts are provided analysis by birth cohort assuming 46 annual real rate of return younger birth cohorts particip ating in the ia system would receive larger total social security income composed of the reduced social security benefit plus the ia annuity compared with olde r cohorts of similar earnings levels eg scaled low wage worker figure 3 shows combined social security income for scaled averagewage workers of different birth cohortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs17 25 the social security actuaries assume long term average real wage growth of 39 per yearsource congressional research service estimates younger workers will have higher indi vidual account balances than will older workers of similar earnings levels as is evident from table 3 those workers who as result of their age are able to cont ribute to their ia throughout their careers have much larger account balances upon retiremen t than do those who contribute at the same earnings level but over fewer year s for example upon retirement the expected individual account balance of th average worker age 41 today is only 27 of that of the average worker age 21 today based on the assumptions used in this analysis the increased account balance for younger ge nerations is due to three variables 1 the rise in real wages for individuals of similar earnings levels and thus real contributions to the accounts 2 th higher value of interest accumulated due to these higher wages and 3 the increasin g number of years of contributions to the accounts and the effect of more years of in terest up to the point where each future cohort would have contributed to the ia for each of their 44 work years the 1990 birth cohort first under the assumptions used by the social security actuaries each future generation will earn real wages ie an increase in earnings that is greater than the increase in inflation larger than those of the generation before it25 thus the real contributions to the ia of each future genera tion will also be larger than those of the current generation second these larger real contributions create larger real account base for investment even with the same annual real rate of return applied figure 3 total social security income for scaled averagewage worker by birth cohorthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs18 eg 46 to the ia between different ge nerations the dollar value of the interest is higher with the higher real account base third the 41yearold worker participates in the account for only 22 years 20092030 whereas the 21yearold participates for 40 years 20112050 the younger workers greater of number of years participating in the ia leads both to greater aggregate contributions and greater interest earnings as result of the in creased years of investment of those contributions because younger workers will have both larger actual accounts as well as larger shadow accounts younger workers face rger offset to their social security promised benefits relative to older workers table 4 illustrates that depending on age the shadow account annuity reduces social security promised benefits by between 17 and 41 for the scaled averagewage worker the effect of the benefit offset in reducing the social security benefit is larger for younger cohorts whose social security be nefits could be reduced to achieve long term solvency table 5 provides the same information as for table 4 but for baseline of currentlaw social security payable benefits instead of promised benefits only the worker age 21 today would have any change in social security benefits under the payable baseline as this workers year of retirement 2051 occurs after the trust funds have been depleted and annua l social security re venues are sufficient to pay only 74 of promised benefits thus under the payable baseline social security promised benefits are reduced by 26 because the social security benefit is lower under the payable baseline but the shadow account offset remains the same the percent reduction in social secu rity benefits is larger than under the promised baseline thus in the longr workers would receive an increasingly smaller portion of their social security defined benefit younger workers would experience the rgest percent increase in total social security income if 46 annual r eal rate of return is achieved table 6 demonstrates that the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity that would be available using the actual ia balance would exceed social security current law promised benefits if the account earns the expected 46 annual real rate of return depending on age the percent increase in combined social security income is estimated to be between 3 and 18 for the scaled averagewage worker the percent increase in the total benefit am ount is larger for younger workers who contribute to the ia for their entire careers and thus have more years for the difference in interest ra tes between the hypothetical account and the actual account to work in their favor if on the other hand the account is only able to achieve 27 annual real rate of re turn the annual real nnual rate of 30 minus 03 administrative costs then the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity would be less than that promised under currentlaw the advantages for younger workers would be removed under this riskadjusted interest rate as there is percentage point difference to be utilized to enhance the longer ia participants account balance younger workers would experience an even larger percent increase in combined social security

annual real rate of return of 27 for worker age 21 today with three different lifetime earnings levels source congressional research service estimates note compares benefit amounts assuming funding is located to pay soci security promised benefits ia participants with higher earnings over their lifetime w ill have larger account balances when they retire than those of wer earners those with higher wages are able to contribute larger dollar amounts to their ias leading to larger account balances for example in table 3 the scaled lowwage earner age 41 today has only 44 of the account balance of the scaled highwage earner age 41 today even though these workers contribute to the ia over the same number of years and even though the highwage earner is subject to th contribution cap for 15 years out of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs20 22 spent participating in the ia 4 of the highwage workers salary is larger than 4 of the lowwage workers salary the disparity in account balances between individuals with different earnings levels increases over time as the cap on ia contributions rises to the point where the hypothetical highwage worker could contribute full 4 of wages to the ia by the time worker age 21 today retires the account balance of lowwage worker equals only 34 of that of highwage worker of the same age because of their larger account accumu lations higher earners would face larger percent reduction in their social security scheduled benefits as result of the benefit offset table 4 illustrates that depending on earnings level the shadow account annuity reduces social security pr omised benefits by between 31 and 43 for worker age 21 today low earners face smaller percent reductions to their social security promised benefits than do higher earners because the underlying social security benefit structure is progressive ie it replaces larger percentage of wages of lowwage workers compared to highwage workers thus flat percentage of each work ers wages 4 grown at flat percentage rate each year 3 to arrive at the shadow offset still maintains the progressive benefit structure by allowing lowwage workers to keep larger percentage of their social security benefit eg 69 for the age 21yearold than highwage workers eg 57 for the age 21yearold higher earners scaled high and scaled average wage workers would experience the largest percent increase in total social security income if 46 annual real rate of return is achieved table 6 demonstrates that the total of the reduced social security benefit plus the annuity that would be ava ilable using the actual ia balance would exceed social security currentlaw promised benef its if the account earns the expected 46 annual real rate of return depending on earnings level the percent increase in combined social security income is estimated to be between 13 and 18 for worker age 21 today under the 46 rate of return scenario the percent benefit increase would be larger for scaled highwage workers than for scaled low wage workers this difference would occur because the 4 of earnings that high earners would be able to contribute to th eir ias has larger dollar value and would be able to take advantage of the 16 percentage point difference between the 46 rate of return on the ia and the 30 rate of return used to calculate the ia benefit offset if on the other hand the account is only able to achieve 27 annual real rate of return the annual real annual rate of 30 minus 03 administrative costs then the total of the reduced social secur ity benefit plus the annuity would be less than that promised under currentlaw th advantages for higher earners would be removed under this riskadjusted interest rate as there is percentage point difference to be utilized to enhan ce the higher earners account balance as table 8 illustrates the reduced social security promised benefit is still large enough compared to the monthly aged pove rty thresholds to allow each hypothetical worker the option of withdrawing the entire ia balance as lumpsum at retirement rather than being required to purchase an annuity or take pr ogrammed withdrawals or passing it on as an inheritance if however additional be nefit reductions are eventually introduced as part of comp rehensive social security proposal some portion of the ia balance would probably need to be annuitized or taken as phased withdrawal in order to achieve combined monthly stream of income equal to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs21 federal poverty threshold this out come is best demonstrated in table 9 which takes into account the effect of reduction in promised be nefits for the 21 year old to provide only those benefits payable at re tirement in this case the lowwage and averagewage workers payable benefits fall below the poverty th reshold after being reduced by the shadow account annuity as result this worker would be required to annuitize or take in pr ogrammed withdrawals enough of the individual account to guarantee combined social security in come equal to 100 of the federal poverty threshold once this portion of the indi vidual account has been annuitized or set aside for programmed withdrawals the work er would have the option to take the remainder of the account balance as lump sum or pass it along as inheritance the highwage 21yearold worker would not be required to annuitize or set aside for programmed withdrawals any portion of his or her account balance because even the 26 reduction in social security benef its under the payable baseline leaves this worker with large enough social secur ity benefit to remain above the federal poverty threshold thus if benefit reductions are the primary method of achieving longterm solvency lower and averagewage workers would be less able to increase family wealth under the presidents ia plan than would highwage workers methodology all individual account estimates are ba sed on the proposal specifications outlined above to estimate the account balances of the actual and hypothetical shadow accounts for those retiring many year s in the future crs assumes that the ia contribution limit continues to increase over the full work history of each worker according to the method outlined in the act uarial memorandum if further details emerge that alter this contribution rate th estimates would need to be recalculated accordingly crs estimates the account bala nces for the actual ia which the worker will receive in full using both the expected annual real rate of return specified by the social security actuaries 49 as we ll as the lowyield or riskadjusted annual real rate of return specified by the actuaries 30 both reduced by the estimated administrative fee of 30 basis points per year t hus the annual real rate of return net of administrative costs is 46 and 27 respectively the hypothetical account balance is estimated using the 30 ra of return specified in the proposal this account balance is used to calculate th offset to the social security defined benefit because the hypothetical account rate of return is not reduced by administrative fees whereas the actual riskadjusted rate of return is reduced by administrative fees the hypothetical account balance will exceed that of the risk adjusted actual account in every case to calculate the cpiindexed annuity for both the actual and hypothetical shadow acc ounts annuity factors provided by the social security administration were used one important limitation of using these ssumed constant annua l interest rates is that historical rates of return have not followed such pa ttern interest rate fluctuations over time and where these fluctuations occur in workers career can have large effect on the estimated account balances of workers under an ia system for example negative rate of return in the years prior to an individuals retirement can significantly reduce the value of the assets in the ia similarly the rate of return prevalent at the time of retirement can lter the monthly annuity payment that ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32879crs22 26 social security administra tion office of the actuary internal rates of return under the oasdi program for hypothetical workers actuarial note 144 june 2001 the pattern in these scaled earnings histories shows re latively low earnings at the beginning of the career fairly rapid growth through the middle of the career and gradual tapering off of earnings at the end of the careerworker would receive based on the same dollar amount in the individual account the higher the interest rate assumed wh calculating the annuity amount the greater the assumed earnings on the assets used to fund the annuity and the larger the annuity payment to the worker for example based on crs analysis at an interest rate of 60 68yearold person who purch ased level singlelife annuity for 200000 would receive income from the annuity of 1852 per month at an interest rate of 40 the same sum of money would buy level singlelife annuity worth 1584 per month difference of 268 in monthly income some have argued that the establishmen t of individual accounts as well as the tax increases benefit reductions or g overnment borrowing needed to achieve solvency may affect the macroeconomy nd thus affect the interest rates that individuals could expect to obtain on their ias these estimates do not incorporate any such potential macroeconomic feedbacks the effect of the proposal is estimated bot h on workers who would contribute to the ia for their entire career as well as those whose careers would be split between the currentlaw system and the ia system to estimate the effect of the ia proposal on worker age 21 today crs assumes that the worker is born in 1984 begins work at age 21 in 2005 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2051 as result this worker spends 40 years of his or her 46 year work history contributing to the ias and reflects what the system could provide to worker once the plan is fully phasedin to estimate the effect of the ia proposal on worker age 31 today crs assumes that the worker is born in 1974 begins work at age 21 in 1995 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2041 as result although this worker also has career of 46 years only 30 of them are spent contributing to the ia finally to estimate the effect of the ia proposal on worker age 41 today crs assumes that the worker is born in 1964 begins work at age 21 in 1985 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2031 thus this worker also has car eer of 46 years but only 22 of them are spent contributing to the ia account balance estimates for scaled wwage workers scaledaverage wage workers and scaled highwage workers as defined by the social security office of

earnings of either 1 lowwage 45 of wage equal to social securitys average wage series 2 an average wagea wage equal to social securitys average wage series or 3 high wage 160 of wage equal to social

the highest 35 years of earnings indexed for growth in average wages to the year prior to benefit entitlement this concept is similar to that of the aime excep t that career average earnings for these scaled workers are indexed to the year prior to entitle ment instead of two years prior to eligibility and earnings are averaged on an annual rather th an monthly basis thus the indexing year for the 2005 retiree is 2004 and the 2004 average wage index is the basis for the career average earnings levels for each hypothetical worker56091 for scaled high earner27 these scenarios are for illustration only and are not meant to fully represent every possible scenario that actual workers may experience for example by relying on stylized workers gaps in employment are assumed if present these gaps would redu ce both the social security benefit and the ia balance of these workers howeve r because under system of individual accounts the earlier contributions are made the more interest they accrue the timing of gaps in employment has greater eff ect on individual account balances than they would on the traditional social security benefit level although the plan does not require annuitization but allo ws individuals to take programmed withdrawals from their ias crs has followed the social security administrations practice of assuming universal annuitization as it is not clear which type of worker might opt for programmed withdrawals b ecause hypothetical workers with spouses or other dependents are used the annu ity levels calculated for bot h the actual and hypothetical accounts are based on the purchase of unisex cpiindexed singlelife annuity assuming an inflation rate of 28 per year and nominal intere st rate of 5884 per year furthermore the poverty level estima tes for the
