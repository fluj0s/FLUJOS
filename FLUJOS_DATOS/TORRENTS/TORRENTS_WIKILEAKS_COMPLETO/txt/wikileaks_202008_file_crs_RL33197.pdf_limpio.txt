governor haley barbour and so members of cong ress have also calle d for additional aid the prospect for the original or revised package of additional assistance remains unclear because of fiscal c oncerns unless offset extra funds would add to the 314 billion deficit predicted by cbo for fy 2006 which many analysts now say will be closer to 350 billion other major concerns are how quickly the levees will be repaired and rebuilt and whether they would be able to withstand another major storm how best to aid victims and how to reconstruct the region4 in the nearterm many are concerned with the level of protection that will be available at the start of the 2006 hurrican season by june 2006 the army corps of engineers expects to have completed its repairs of the existing infrastructure

additional issues ma be identified as velopments warrant proposal to expand transfer authority for all agencies in the october 28 reallocation request the president proposed governmentwide general provision that would permit any agency or department to transfer funds available in fy2006 be tween or within accounts to meet an emergency requirement in res ponse to hurricane katrina if the transfer is for higher priority items and not for requested item that has been denied by law congress would be notified within 15 days of all transfers12 this proposed language would place limits on the individual or total amounts that could be transferred for katrinarelated emergencies and would permit the administration to define which transfers are for katrina emergency because congress would only be notified afterthefact the exclusion of items denied by law would allow the administration to alter and reverse the detailed programmatic decisions of the appropriations committees and congress that are generally included in repor t language aftert hefact notification does not necessarily protect congressional interests and goes against the general congressional practice of requiring prio r approval by the appropriations committees of certain types of transfers moving funds between accounts and reprogrammings moving funds within an account13 congress generally places limits on the amount and types of transfers of appropriated funds by setting total funding caps for transfers each year and caps by type of appropriation as we ll as requiring advance tification to the relevant congressional committees transfers generally are limited to small percentage of an agencys funds such as five percent or less while some agencies have transfer authority to meet emergencies such authorities are limited to partic ular purposes and other c onditions may apply such as exhausting other funds requiring replenis hment through supplem entals and advance notification to the appropriations committees for example some department of the interior agencies can transfer funds fo r emergency replacement of buildings and facilities damaged or destroyed by fire flood storm or other unavoidable causes provided that emergency funds are firs t exhausted and transferred funds are replenished through supplemental th forest service in the department of agriculture can transfer funds to the w ildland fire manageme nt account for various fire emergency purposes if the appropriati ons committees are notified and if all other wildfire suppression funds are obligated the

cont ract premiums and escalation for lpds 22 and 2323 the language in the navys request appear s to cover broad array of expenses and would allow dod to transfer funds between ships which is unlike regular defense appropriations bills where congress design ates the amounts for individual ships in report language therefore the breakdown of costs above is ssentially illustrative in other words it is an estimate which could change based on how the scope of expenses actually develop the navys to tal estimate for higher ship costs due to katrina damage is 27 billi on but apparently decisi on was made to request 20 billion from congress initially with the rema inder requested in later supplemental according to september 21 2005 memo fro m then assistant secretary of the navy john j young to the deputy secretary of defense the rationale for the navys request was to take proactive approach in order to preserve the skills of the workforce limit the schedule slips and associated inevitable long term cost increases on ships under constr uction and return the shipyards to their capability and profit opportunities prior to the day katrina hit young also noted that this approach also has the shortterm benefit of contributing in significant way to the restoration of jobs and the economy in the gulf coast24 questions about navys request several questions that could be raised about the navys request for 20 billion in funding that would go to shipbuilders primarily northrop grumma n to cover higher costs for the 11 ships under construction at the ingalls are does the navys request set any limits on the governments liability for higher costs due to busine ss interruption resulting from the damage in the shipyards and if not should language to impose limits be added could navy decisi on to reimburse contractors for most if not all higher costs due to natural disasters create new precedents for other government contractors is there some overlap between northrops claims with its insurers and the 20 billion requested by the navy if the navy agrees to cover these costs in advance what incentive would northrop have to negotiate with its insurer woul d northrop be required to reimburse the navy for any costs recovered from its insurers what are the assumptions underlyi ng the navys estimates and are they reasonable would delaying the request allow the navys estimate to include fewer unknowns and allow insurance negotiations to proceed furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33197crs11 25 frank knox secretary of the navy to the ch iefs of the bureaus offices and boards navy

fy2007 in its cost to complete line item that is designed to handle ship cost overruns is there any potential for the navy to use these funds to cover non katrina cost increases how could congress increase transparency and tracking to limit the likelihood that other types of increases will be covered with these monies is the navys current plan the most efficient business approach would full hiatus in shipbuilding efforts while the yards are fully restored be more efficient and could the delays be acceptable for ships which typically have life of 30 years or longer potential overlap between govern ment and insurance liabilities it appears that the navy may not be liable for all higher ship costs due to hurricane katrina northrop reportedly is currently in discussions with its insurer about the extent and nature of its coverage for business interruptions lost earnings due to business disruptions resulting from the property damages this could include for example the higher costs because of delays and downtime because workers are returning gradually and northrop is devi sing workarounds because equipment is not available to follow standard procedures these problems are expected to delay schedules by several mont hs and increase costs although northrop has already collected 500 million for damage to its facilities the company has not yet submitted claims to its secondary insurer which covers costs in excess of 500 million for the higher costs due to business interruption according to sec filing northrop and its insurance provider are in disagreement regarding coverage for certain losses above 500 million if the contractor can show that costs are higher because of schedule delays attributable to the damage to property from the storms then the insurance company may be liable for some costs the navy appears to be assuming that the government is liable for all higher production and overhead costs damage to quipment and escalation due to business interruption northrop is collecting from its insurance company for damages to its facilities citing wartime 1942 memo from secretary of the navy knox the navy claims that the government

questions december 5 2005 28 navy briefing to congressional staffers november 18 2005this assumption does not appear to take into account contractual limits on costs for costplus contracts the government c ontinues to pay higher costs up to the amount appropriated once that limit is reached the navy would need to renegotiate its contract based on the funds ppropriated for fixed price incentivefee contracts the contractor and the government share costs that are above th target price on 5050 basis until the total level in the contract which includes the fee or profit for the contractor is reached at that point the contractor is liable for all additional costs in the case of costplus contracts northrops insurer is apparently expecting that the government would be responsible for only part of the costs in fixed price contracts for both contract types the amount or upward limit on the governments liability is not yet decided if the navy runs out of f unds in its fixed price contracts those would need to be renegotiated for fixed prices the navy and northrop will need to reach settlement about how costs may be shared of the navys 27 billion estimate of total costs about 75 is for ships under fixed price contracts26 if the navy and northrop shared the cost overruns in the fi xed price contracts the navy may not need much of the roughly 15 billion in the reque st for those contracts and possibly some of the funds requested for costplus contracts if the navy pays northrop for such costs in advance the company would have little if any apparent incentive to engage in the complex longterm negotiations with its insurance company that are likely as proposed the language in the navys request see above does not appear to set any upw ard limits on the governments liability and does not require that northrop reimburse the government for any payments it may receive for higher costs due to business interruption uncertainties in navy estimates developed in midseptember only two to three weeks after the storms the na vys estimate includes an additional 833 million for higher overhead and labor charges based on three months of downtime and three months ramp up to the prekatrina workforce level 25 increase in the number of labor hours needed to complete sh ips and higher wages for skilled laborers because of competition for those work ers in other restoration efforts27 the 25 increase in labor hours is based on nort hrops experience with change orders originally there were 20000 workers at ingalls pascagoula and avondale shipyards after katrina there was twoweek hiatus when workers could return to the shipyards by midoctober about 16000 workers had returned to work including 2700 who were working parttime28 more recently northrop is estimating that the pascagoula yard will experience closer to one month of downtime and nine months of rampup there was much less damage in avondale the new assumptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33197crs13 29 navy response to crs qu estions december 5 2005 30 sec 402 c of the fy2006 concurre nt budge resoluti on hconres 95 31 see for example sec 8099 in pl108287 32 navy response to crs questions december 5 2005would generate different estimate of higher costs the navy and northrop are currently developing new schedules for each ship some observers would argue that give n the level of uncertainty from both ongoing insurance negotiations and the eff ect of the damage on ship schedules the navy could be better off waiting to develop its estimate of ship cost overruns the same argument could be made about the navys timates of 715 million to replace governmentfurnished and customer furnis hed equipment some of which may be repaired and some replaced and 132 million for damage to ships under construction urgency of navy request as is customary the navy is requesting that shipbuilding monies be available for five years even though the request is for emergency funding the navy argues that longer availability allows the navy to more judiciously execute available funds that some contracts may require more than six months to renegotiate nd award and that vendor issu and labor inefficiencies could also take more than year29 these rationales may not be consistent with the fy2006 budget resolution criteria that emerge ncy funds are to be used for urgent pressing and compelling needs requiring immediate action or with ombs criteria that the reallocation include only funds needed until may 200630 since substantial funds remain in the shipbuilding accounts for th ships it is also not clear that the navy needs the funds immediately some would argue that it could be more ppropriate for the navy to use its cost to complete line item designed to cover unanticipated increases in ship costs in that line congress designates speci fic funds for cost increases for individual ships that are available for oneyear31 oneyear funds are provided to ensure closer scrutiny the unanticipated costs due to katrina could be considered more extreme version of other delays experienced in shipbuilding prog rams if the navy requested funds in its fy2007 budget it could also rely on later and presumably more accurate estimates segregating katrinarelated costs as proposed the language in the navys request does not include any mechan ism that would require the navy to show that cost increases were attributable to katrina damage rather than other factors congress might want to consider addi ng reporting requirements where the navy would track and certify that ship cost increases funded with these monies were attributable to delays related to damage from katrina efficiency of navys rampup plan the navys justification does not include production schedules for ships in the two yards because those are currently being developed32 northrop grumman appears to be pushing for workers to return as quickly as possible and are looking to swapping work and workers between shipyards outsourcing work where capacity or equipment is not available andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33197crs14 33 navy briefing to congressional staff hurri cane katrina impact on gulf coast shipyards november 18 2005 34 us navy seeks hurricane aid for shipyard new york times november 18 2005 add citesdeveloping workarounds northrop required th at all workers return by october 17 2005 in order to retain thei r seniority and benefits33 the navy does not appear to have cons idered any alternative approaches such as closing down the shipyards for six months to year while repairs are underway and then starting up at level closer to comp lete operations although such an approach would raise concerns including potential loss of skills among workers it might be more efficient and more appr opriate particularly if environmental hazards and housing shortfalls remain critical and if repairs to the levees are delayed while the navy dislikes delays in receiving new ships ships typically last at least 30 years temporary delay might be acceptable if an alternative approach was more cost effective critics of the navys proposal have suggested that the funding requested may be too high that contractors should share cost s and that allocating funds for this purpose signals questionable government priorities34 hearings have been held on these issues thus far issues in dods military construction request dods request dods 15 billion request fo r military construction and family housing funding would be used to replace facilities and infrastructure in louisiana mississippi and florida that were severely damaged by the storm as well as for repair and replacement of family housing dods rationale for its family housing request is that there are not suffi cient units available on the private market that would be affordable to service personnel dods request includes 414 million for the army 570 million for the navy 439 million for the air force and 45 million for defens ewide facilities for more details see table 3 for funding by service and account air force and navy facilities suffered major damage to

appropriations accounts potential issues in milit ary construction request several questions could arise about the presidents request to reallocate 15 for military construction and family housing needs due to katrina some similar to those for shipbuilding 1 why is dod requesting funds to rebuild facilities that are being closed or significantly realigned as part of brac should all facilities be returned to their previous or upgraded status if there is capacity available at other bases to perform certain functions 2 should dod request oneyear rather than fiveyear military construction monies for emergency requests and to encourage closer scrutiny in light of the uncertainty of quicklydeveloped cost estimates would some kind of reporting requirement be merited because of the poten tial inaccuracy of estimates 3 is it wise to press to restore dod f acilities and return dod military and civilian personnel before repair of the levees is complete and utility and other services may not be restored are all projects and needs equally urgent for example is replacement of dod fitness center of equal importa nce as replacement of equipment repair facilities 4 what is the full amount of funding likely to be needed and could dod finance some of these requirements from within existing resources funds for bases affected by brac dod is requesting funds for some projects on bases that are scheduled to cl ose or be realigned for example 58 million is proposed to construct two new bach elor enlisted quarter s at naval station pascagoula ms which is sl ated for closure and 20 milli on for new central energy plant and 25 million for new diagnostic center at keesler medical center scheduled to be realigned to community hospital dod is also proposing to spend 86 million at keesler air force base and 313 million at construction battalion gulfport ms for family housing on bases where privatization initiatives are already underway it is not clear why dod would request funds for these bases which are slated for closure or realignment or where privatization of housing is already underway emergency nature nd visibility of funds dod is requesting that funds be available for the standard time peri ods for each accounts five years for military construction and shipbuilding three years for rdte two years for procurement and one year for om and military personnel account s as with shipbuilding it could be argued that if military construction funds are an emergency then they should be available for one year35 dod would argue that retain ing the traditional time periods fits with how each type of funding is typically managedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33197crs16 36 see division b chapter 10 sec 1001 and b pl 107117 sec 1001 and b pl 107206 title i chapter 3 pl 10811if congress provides the funds as reque sted the monies for katrinarelated damage will be mixed with regular peacetime funding and wartime funding that may make it difficult if not impossible to track how funds are actually used and to ensure that funds intended for one purpose are not used for another purpose to increase visibility congress could require that dod set up separate accounts and require quarterly reporting on use of the funds th is approach has been used in recent supplementals when congress provided funds for war where it was difficult to estimate expenses in advance for example the iraq freedom fund that included initial iraq war spending unlike most military construction requests estimates for these projects were developed in matter of weeks rather th an months creating questions about their accuracy requests also do not include th amount of detail ty pically provided to congress on such projects potential precedent for dealing with such uncertainty is the 15day advance notification re quirements added by congress to war supplementals in recent years in response to the uncertainties of military construction projects needed in support of iraq and afghanistan36 dod has not provided congress with an timate of the full amount that may be needed or timetable that would outline th urgency for the funds the timing of return of military personnel to bases may also depend on the time and effectiveness of repairs to the levees restoration of u tilities and dealing with environmental issues in the region department of housing and urban development
