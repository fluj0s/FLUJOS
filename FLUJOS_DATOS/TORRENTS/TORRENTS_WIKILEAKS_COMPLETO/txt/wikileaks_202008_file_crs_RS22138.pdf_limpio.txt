see crs report 95669 the individuals with disabilities educ ation act congressional intent by nancy lee jones 3 the esea definition of highly qualified applies only to teachers of core academic subjects and differentiates between new and veteran teachers and between those teaching at the elementary level and above the elementary vel thus under esea the highly qualified definition would apply

disabilities if they provided an edu cation for children without disabilities2 although much of the basic structure of idea has been retained pl 108446 does make number of significant changes among these are the definition of highly qualified teachers calculation of maximum state grants funding for highneed children with disabilities revised state performance goals and requirements for childrens participation in state and local assessments changes in the private school provisions exceptions to certain financial requirements changes in pro cedural safeguards and changes in compliance monitoring to focus on student performance highly qualified teacher pl 108446 links its defi nition of highly qualified to the definition in section 910123 of th elementary and secondary education act esea3 but modifies that definition as it applie s to special education teachers pl 108 446 provides additional re quirements and options to the finition with respect to special education teachers if the special education teachers meet the idea criteria they are considered to have met the esea requirements to be highly qualified first of all to be highly qualified under idea all special education teachers whether they teach core subjects4 or not must hold at least bachelors degree and must obtain full state special education certification or equivalent licensure5 special education teachers who have emergency temporary or pr ovisional certification do not m eet the idea definition in addition pl 108446 modifies the esea requi rements with respect to two groups of special education teachers those who teach only the most severely disabled children and those who teach more than one core subject one significant modification that pl 108446 makes is that new special educa tion teachers in these groups can meet the definition of highly qualified through state examinations such as high objective uniform state standard of evaluation i housse under esea this option is available only to veteran teachers6 maximum grant calculati on and authorizations prior to the enactment of pl 108446 the maximum amount states could receive under the part b grantstostates program was based on 40 of

population for school year 20072008 rose by 3 above its 20042005 population and its number of children living in poverty rose by 2 above the 20042005 number then its 20072008 maximum gr ant would be

for highneed children with disabilities11 provision of medical12 or other expensive services to ensure fape has resulted in very high costs for some school districts pl 108446 aims to address these high costs by permitting states to reserve 10 of the funds reserved for ot her state activities or 1 to 105 of the overall state grant to establish and maintain risk pool to assist leas serving highneed children with disabilities states taki ng advantage of this option mu st develop and annually review state plan in which the state determines which children with disabilities are high need13 sets out the procedures by which leas participate in the risk pool14 and determines how funds are distributed funds distributed fr om the risk pool must only pay for direct special education and related services for high need children with disabilities and may not be used for legal fees or related costs if some funds are not distributed for services for high need children they are to be distributed to leas according to the substate formula15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22138crs4 16 s rep 185 108th cong 1st sess 1516 2003 17 pl 10517 612a16aii and b 18 for further information on ayp see

private schools child with disability may be placed in private school by the lea or sea as means of fulfilling the fape requirement for the child in which case the cost is paid for by the lea child with disability may so be unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents in the latter situation the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the lea unle ss hearing officer or court makes certain findings however idea does require some services for children in private schools even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents exactly what these services are or should be has been contentious subject for many years the 1997 reauthorization of idea expanded the private school provisi ons and the 2004 reauthorization includes several changes to the provisions relating to children who are placed in private school by their parents the provisions relating to children placed in private schools by public agencies were not changed generally children with disa bilities enrolled by their pare nts in private schools are to be provided special educati on and related services to the extent consistent with the number and location of such children in the school district served by lea pursuant to several requirements 612a10ai this provision was changed from previous law by the addition of the requirement that the ch ildren be located in th school district served by the lea the senate re port described this change as protecting leas from having to work with private schools located in multip jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines16 pl 108446 adds requirements that the lea consult with private school officials nd representatives of the parent s of parentally placed private school children with disabilitie s in addition the new w adds compliance procedures which allow private school official to submit complaint to the sea about the consultation and if the private school official is dissatisfied with the seas response he or she may submit complaint to the secretary of education performance goals and indicators pl 108446 revises state requirements for performance goals and indicators mainly by linking these to requirements under the esea in the prior version of idea states were required to have performance goals for children with disabilities that were consistent to the maximum extent appropriate with other goals and standards for children establis hed by the state and to establish indicators to measure performance17 pl 108446 changes this provision to require that states performance goals are the same as the states definition of adequate yearly progress ayp18 including the states objectives for pr ogress by children w ith disabilities under esea19 pl 108446 also links performance indicat ors to esea requirements states indicators for measuring progress must in clude measurable annual objectives for progress by children with disabilities under esea20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22138crs5 21 under the previous version of idea states we re required to include children with disabilities in general state and districtwide assessmen t programs with appropriate accommodations where necessary for children who could not pa rticipate in these assessments states had to develop and implement alternative assessments and guidelines for participation in these alternative assessments pl 10517 617a17a 22 612a16a 23 for further discussion of assessment requirements see implications of nclba 24 pl 10517 613a2c 25 pl 108446 extends this moe exception to state that pays or reimburses all local educational agencies within the state from st ate revenue 100 percent of the nonfederal share of the costs of special educati on and related services 613jparticipation in assessments pl 108446 amends assessment pa rticipation requirements to align them with esea requirements21 idea now requires that all children with disabilities be included in all state and districtwide assessments including assessments required under esea with accomm odations or alternative assessments if necessary and as included in the childs individualized education program iep22 pl 108446 now assumes that states have developed guidelines for accommodations 612a16b and that states have implemented guidelines for alternative assessments 612a16c such altern ative assessments must follo w esea requirements most notably they must be aligned with the states challenging academic content standards and challenging student acade mic achievement standards 612a16ciii pl 108446 also provides states with the option of adopting alternativ academic standards as permitted by esea regulations if the number of those tested is sufficient to ensure statistical reliability and confidentiality the achievement of children with disabilities is to be compared with the achievement of all children and such comparisons are to be publically reported finally pl 108466 requires the state nd districtwide tests adhere to universal design principl to the extent feasible23 exceptions to local maintenance of effort like many other federal education programs idea requires states nd leas to maintain fiscal effort moe which generally in idea requires that stat and local spending on special education not be reduced from one year to the next i 100 moe prio r law allowed certain exceptions to local moe one of which allowe d leas to treat as local funds for the purpose of meeting the moe requirement up to 20 of any annual increase in their idea grant24 pl 108446 makes major changes to this ex ception first of all leas may use up to 50 of the increase in their idea grant to reduce the level of expenditure for special education 613a2ci in addition unlike prior law pl 108446 requires leas exercising this option to use the funds for activities authorized under the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 613a2cii and for early intervention services discussed below pl 108446 continues to provide state authority to prohibit leas from using this authority except that it modifies the criteria for exercising the prohibition and requires states prior law permitted states to exercise th prohibition if warranted25

children with disabilities the house and sena bills differed dramatically in their 615 language the changes made by pl 108446 include adding provisions relating to homeless children adding two year statute of limitations for the filing of complaint and two year statute of limitations regarding requests for hearing adding additional requirements for hearing officers and specifically allowing the local educational agency not just the parents to file for due process hearing one of the major changes was the addition of resolution session this is preliminary meeting between the parents and the lea and iep team held within 15 days of receiving the parents complaint the reas on for this addition was to attempt to resolve disputes prior to the more dversarial due process hearing the house report noted that the resolution session is intended to impr ove the communication between parents and school officials and to help foster greater efforts to reso lve disputes in timely manner so that the childs interests are best served26 if an agreement is reached during the resolution session the parties must execute legally binding agreement signed by both parties and which is enforceable in court the new law includes limitations on issues that are allowed to be raised in the due process hearing in an attempt to ensure that the parties know with clarity and specificity exactly what the problems are the party requesting the hearing is not allowed to raise issues at the due process hearing that were not raised in the due process complaint notice in addition pl 108446 also requires that the decision made by hearing officer be made on substantive grounds based on dete rmination of whether the child received free appropriate public ducation however if matter alleges procedural violation of idea the law would allow hearing officer to find that child did not receive fape under certain conditions congress kept the same basic structure for attorneyss fees and allows court in its discretion to award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the cost to prevailing party however the 2004 reauthorization allows for attorneys fees not only against the local educational agency but also in some situations against the attorney of parent or the parent compliance monitoring generally congress determined that the previous law on monitoring focused too much on compliance with procedures and in the 2004 reauthorization shifted the emphasi s to focus on student performance27 under the new law the secretary of education is to monitor implementation of part b by oversight of the general supervision by the states and by the state performance plans the secretary is to enforce part b as described in 616e and to require states to monitor implementation by leas and to enforce part b under pl 108446 the primary focus of federal and state monitoring activities is to be on improving educational results and functional outcomes for children with disabilities and ensuring that states meet the program requirements 616a2 the new law lists certain priori ty areas for monitoring which are to be monitored using quantifiable indicators
