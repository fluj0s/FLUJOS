total assistance adjusted for inflation provided to germanyand somewhat more than double that provided to japanfrom 19461952 for germany in constant 2005 dollars the united states provided total of 293 billion in assistance from 19461952 with 60 in economic grants and nearly 30 in economic loans and the remainder in military aid beginning in 1949 the marshall plan provided 14 billion with the specific objective of promoting economic recovery prior to that us aid was categorized as government and relief in occupied areas gar ioa adjusting for inflation the constant 2005 dollar total for marshall plan aid was 93 billion of which 84 billion was grants and 16 was loans west germany eventually repaid onethird of all us assistance it received total us assistance to japan for 19461952 was roughly 152 billion in 2005 dollars of which 77 was grants and 23 was loans most of these funds were provided through garioa grants japan repaid 490 million of the total postwar assistance of the 22 billion in total aid an estimated 655 million or almost third went to categories that would mostly contribute directly to economic recovery industrial materials including machinery and raw goods petroleum and products and transportation vehicles and equipmen t most of the rest went for agricultural equipment foodstuffs and food supplies with smaller amounts spent on medical and sanitary supplies education and clothing us assistance to germany and japan largely consisted of foodrelated aid because of severe warinduced shortages and the need to provide minimum subsistence levels of nutrition in iraq humanitarian aid has been minor part of the assistance expectations also have changed countries today have much higher expectations of what the united states should contribute to reconstruction in iraq relative to what was expected following world war ii germany and japan also are larger than iraqboth population and si ze of their respective economiesand the extent of war damage to each countrys industrial capacity was different iraq also faces an insurgency that deliberately sabotages the economy and reconstruction efforts whereas there were resistance movements in

assistance to iraq in the wake of the military action of 2003 has been adequate others whether it might be excessive one point of comparison that is often invoked is the assistance that the united states provided to germany and japan during military occupations of those countries after world war ii this report provides data through the end of fy2006 at which point us aid to iraq had surpassed us aid to germany and japan during the postworld war ii occupations the following information and attached tables compare assistance to iraq during the first three and half years after the fall of baghdad on april 9 2003 with us assistance during the occupations of those two countries in brief although the context of the military occupation of iraq is markedly different from that of the othe r two the total amount of us assistance allocated for iraq through 2006 appears to be about fifth higher than the amount provided to germany and somewhat more than double that provided to japan for the seven years after world war ii this represented the overlapping periods of direct military government and the marshall plan assistance in germany and the entire period of the military occupation of japan breakdowns for specific purposes are difficult as the costs were covered under different categories and in different ways one area in wh ich rough approximation is possible however is funding for the reconstruction and improvement of critical economic infrastructure this figure is particularly important to some members as th ey consider the tradeoffs between funding spent on iraq and funding available for similar purposes in the united states comparisons of funding for other purposes such as government education and humanitarian relief are difficult as the needs were different in each case andor the assistance was provided in different ways that do not facilitate comparison this report does not attempt to compare indirect forms of assistance such as debt relief and funding provided by other donors aid allocations for iraq appropriated from fy2003 through fy2006 all of which is grant assistance totaled 357 billion of this about 118 billion 33 was for the repair and improvement of critical economic infrastructure 1 the total figure is almost fifth higher than total assistance provided to germany from fy19461952 293 billion in 2005 dollars and somewhat more than double that provided to japan 152 billion in 2005 dollars us funding provided specifically for economic infrastructure in iraq appears to be greater than the proportion provided for economic reconstruction in both germany and japan 1 as discussed below funding of economic infrastructure in iraq is perhaps more comparable to the type of assistance provided japan and germany than is total assistance that would encompass funds for enhancing public security andor for governance and public welfare s

began were quite different from those under which the us entered iraq in 2003 germany and japan had both declared war on the united states and during at least the first year after world war ii us policymakers were inclined to provide only survival level of food and other assistance to its defeated enemies in order to avert starvation and prevent massive outbreaks of disease us objectives in the postworld war ii occupations were characterized as the four ds the united states primary objective in both germany and japan was demilitarization in japan the next two were disarmament and decentralization of the economy through the dismantling of powerful economic groups in germany the next two were denatzification and deindustralization the later in the expectation that germany could become an agricultural country the fourth d in both cases was democratization although many us policymakers and occupation planners were skeptical that the germans and japanese had the necessary cultural background and psychological disposition for flourishing democracies both coun tries were expected to be responsible for their own economic recovery within few years however the united states had recognized the need to provide assistance for economic recovery and reconstruction in germany and japan and programs with that objective commenced in 1948

political reconstruction and development priorities from the outset democracybuilding became the primary objective of us assistance to iraq very early in the occupation as caches of biological and chemical weapons were found unlike the cases of germany and japan there was massive humanitarian crisis requiring aid in iraq it is impossible to precisely compare the amount of aid that the united states has provided to postwar iraq with the amounts spent during the occupations of germany and japan for one there is record of the amount spent on political and social welfare reconstruction and development in germany and japan much of the political and social welfare institutionbuilding assistance that is being provided by us contractors in iraq now was either not provided in the cases of germany and japan was paid for by those countries which made payments to the united states for occupation costs or was done by occupation troops or others whose salary costs were not calculated 2 precise calculation of assistance for economic reconstruction can be made in the cases of germany and japan without surveying the papers from the occupations for that specific purpose as information available in the us agency for international development usaid data base the standard sour ce for figures on us government assistance is aggregated according to accounts not purposes in addition in the case of funding for iraq accounts may contain mix of assistance types and even specific grants may have multiple humanitarian political and economic purposes nevertheless very rough comparisons of assistance for economic reconstruction are possible for the purposes of rough comparison this report compared figures from the web version of the standard source for us foreign aid funding us overseas loans and grants 3 as the source for figures on us aid to japan and germany crs converted these figures to constant 2005 dollars using the gross domestic product gdp price index of the us bureau of economic analysis these aid figures do not reflect the net amount of us assistance to these countries as they do not offset amounts that the conquered countries paid in reparations nor do they account for the amounts paid by those countries for feeding and housing occupation troops the four tables at the end of this report show these figures in addition further information is supplied in the

virtually all of the funding for about the first three years although small amount of other relief aid and some military surplus property was also provided during that period the marshall plan through which aid to germany began in 19481949 and continued through 1952 provided about third of total us aid to that country some military aid grants related to the new security environment was provided in the last marshall plan years the west german government eventually repaid onethird of total us assistance to germany during this period even though loans formally comprised only 28 of total funds provided to germany 5 the marshall plan provided the first funding for germany with the specific objective of promoting economic recovery the official figure for total marshall plan assistance to germany is almost 14 billion in current year dollars 93 billion in 2005 dollars of which 78 billion was grants and 15 billion was loans6 this corresponds to the categories of usaid predecessor grants and usaid predecessor loans in the tables below the entire amount of marshall plan aid is usually considered economic reconstruction funding even though much of the aid provided in the first year particularly was foodstuff to feed workers whose productivity was compromised by malnourishment the severe winter of 19461947 in europe made hunger greater problem at that point than it was right at the end of the war and made apparent the need for increased food and other assistance the economic effect of marshall plan assistance was enhanced by the plans requirement that recipients match us funding with counterpart contributions in national currencies these were invested in the areas that national governments determined in consultation with marshall plan officials would best stimulate national economies according to an interim report to congress prepared by the economic cooperation agency the agency which administered the marshall plan food accounted for nearly half ie 46 of the commodities delivered in the first threeplus years ie between april 3 1948 and june 30 1951 7 deliveries during this period accounted for perhaps 80 of total deliveries under the marshall plan inputs to industry ie raw materials and semifinished products comprised 40 of the total of those inputs nearly 60 was cotton most of the rest was metals and chemicals petroleum and petroleum products accounted for 4 about 2½ was for machinery and vehicles and 6 ½ was for miscellaneous mostly tobacco

most of the remainder ie 23 was 490 million in related funds that japan repaid and is classified as loan there is information in the greenbook or readily available published sources regarding how much of this was provided for economic reconstruction although the intent of the occupation after 1948 was to promote economic recovery figures for japan compiled by crs analyst who examined occupation papers and related documents in that country show that about 40 of the us assistance may well be considered as having been targeted at economic infrastructure reconstruction broadly defined8 it should be noted that the total value of us aid from the occupation documents and other documents that this analyst drew on is just slightly over 20 billion in current dollarsslightly lower than the greenbook total of 22 billion this was figure that was agreed upon in the 1960s by japanese and us officials as part of the negotiations on the amount of us assistance that japan would repay the greenbook figure is for funds appropriated whereas the lower negotiated figures derives from estimates of goods actually received plus administrative costs using this as base the net value of the grant and loan aid as actually received by japan would be 19 billion after deducting for the administrative expenses that the united states charged against the funds 9 of the negotiated 20 billion in current year dollars 134 in constant 2005 dollars 655 million 43 billion in constant dollars or 32 went to categories that would mostly contribute directly to economic reconstruction that is industrial materials including machinery and raw goods 310 million or 15 petroleum oils and lubricants 95 million or 5 and transportation vehicles and equipment 249 million or 12 it is also likely that much of the funds categorized as payment of civilians 67 million and miscellaneous 63 million also could be considered as contributing to economic reconstruction especially as japanese labor was provided incentives in order to encourage production 10 the total in 2005 dollars for these payments to civilians and miscellaneous is 086 billion these categories of aid total 785 million in current dollars and 52 billion in constant dollars of the remaining 12 billion 119 billion 79 billion in 2005 dollars and 59 of the total went to agricultural equipment foodstuffs and food supplies this was aimed at helping to feed the japanese population the remainder 49 million in current dollars 324 million in 2005 dollars were expenditures for medical and sanitary supplies under 1 of the total education under 1 and clothing textiles and shoes little over 1 8 from united states aid to japan reassessment by dick k nanto unpublished paper september 1977 based on the united states role in japans postwar economic recovery unpublished phd dissertation harvard university 1976 9 the precise figure was 1937916796 this is net figure ie the total 2027657196 of total aid actually received by japan according to the occupation documents minus 89740400 that the united states deducted for administrative expenses the 490 million repaid to the united st ates by japan at 25 interest is not deducted from the total aid figure 10 nanto found that total assistance for industrial capital formation rebuilding japans factories was 14 million 94 million in constant 2005 dollars or some 007 of the total aid program this consisted of funding for industrial machinery and parts vehicles and motor parts and related miscellaneous equipment and supplies

totaled some 357 billion11 all of it is grant assistance while most funds were appropriated to special iraq relief and reconstruction fund irrf 21 billion and an iraq security forces fund 104 billion additional sums from the budgets of dod usaid and other agencies have been used for reconstruction purposes the departments of stat and defense as well as usaid are the key entities responsible for implementing iraq assistance programs about onethird of total funding roughly 118 bi llion has been aimed at restoring economically critical infrastructure including airports roads bridges railroads seaports electric power water and sanitation telecommunications and essential buildings another 83 billion representing about 23 of total aid has been allocated to as sist democratization including civil society education and health and the expansion of the private sector small amount of emergency relief and food aid was provided especially in the early stages of the postus invasion period together the infrastructure reconstruction assistancewhich best corresponds to the bulk of aid provided to germany and japanand the social economic and political development aid which is more characteristic of current us assistance around the worldmake up nearly more than onehalf of total iraq funding for economic and political reconstruction to date the remaining 155 billion in aid nearly 44 of the total is targeted at bolstering iraqi security most of it provides training and equipment to the various security forces including police and army but funds are also used to provide facilities for security and law enforcement g5g152g150g153g138g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 while the total amount of aid to iraqroughly 36 billionnow appe ars to be almost fifth higher than that spent during the occupation of germany and somewhat more than double that during the occupation of japan the total amounts and percentages of us assistance targeted specifically at economic infrastructure reconstruction for germany and japan over the fy1949 fy1952 period appear to be lower than the amounts and percentages currently directed at such reconstruction in iraq in constant 2005 dollars us aid targeted at economic infrastructure reconstruction was some 93 billion in germany or about onethird of total us assistance to that country and some 52 billion in japan or little under 40 of total us assistance there if one were to consider food aid for japanese workers as part of assistance for reconstruction there in order to make it more comparable with marshall plan reconstruction aid to germany the japan figure would be considerably higher about 131 billion in constant 2005 dollars the amount and proportion of assistance for roughl equivalent infrastructure reconstruction in iraq appears higher probably about 118 billion this would indicate that the actual adjusted dollar amounts of us aid for economic infrastructure reconstruction in iraq thus far is roughly third greater than that provided to germany and perhaps more than double that provided to japan one explanation for the difference may be that aid for economic reconstruction in germany and 11 most of this funding was contained in pl 10811 fy2003 emergency supplemental appropriations hr 1559 pl 108106 fy2004 emergency supplemental appropriations hr 3289 pl 10913 fy2005

to enable those countries to carry out their recoveries largely on their own in iraq the united states is providing not only the material assistance but also is paying for the necessary labor for these three countries infrastructure assistance is the most comparable element other aid sectors are difficult to compare because the situations varied greatly large proportion of us assistance to germany and japan consisted of food aid because of the humanitarian crisis which ensued after the war food and housing shortages were critical in both germany and japan for several years after world war ii and early us assistance focused on providing subsistence level of nutrition massive humanitarian relief was necessary in iraq humanitarian aid has been minor part of the assistance program because there was little need for food or other immediate relief assistance for most of the population democracy security and other governance efforts are also difficult to compare in germany and japan they were conducted by occupation forces and separate accounts were not maintained assistance in these three cases varied greatly not only because of the conditions in which the occupations took place the size of the country and economy and the degree of economic development is different in each of the cases as were the states of the economic infrastructure at the end of and after the war in 1940 before the united states entered world war ii it had population of 1326 million and gdp that was 2½ times greater than that of germany with population of 698 million and about 4½ times greater than that of japan with population of 73 million 12 after the war the differences were much greater us per capita in come was onethird higher than that of germany in 1940 and over 4 times higher in 1946 it was almost 2½ times higher than that of japan in 1940 and well over 6 times higher in 1946 at the end of the marshall plan period in 1952 recovery to prewar levels had occurred in both countries in 1952 us per capita income was 2¼ times higher than that of germany and almost 4½ times that of japan 13 regarding economic infrastructure some sectors of germanys infrastructure were left surprisingly intact according to recent analyses at the end of the war the industrial capacity in the western zones was in theory not markedly less than that of the same territories in 1936 the coal iron and steel industries were relatively lightly damaged whereas most manufacturing was much more seriously impaired 14 severe damage to public utilitiesespecially power stations and transportation facilities15slowed the restoration of production as did malnutrition and disease 12 the comparisons in this paragraph are based on statistics from angus maddison the world economy historical statistics paris organisation for economic cooperation and development 2003 13 the us population grew to 1419 million by 1946 and 1576 million by 1952 japans population also grew by 1946 to 772 million through 1952 to 865 million due in large pa rt to the immigration of ethnic japanese from other parts of asia germanys population shrank by 1946 to 647 million but surpassed its 1940 level by 1952 by then totaling 691 million due in part to the immigration of ethnic germans from nearby countries 14 dennis l bark and david r gress from shadow to substance 19451963 cambridge basil blackwell

infrastructure showed that overall industry was not demolished if we look at industri by sector we can see that although the rate of capacity in the consumer goods industries was damaged because many factories had been converted to war production by contrast the damage rate was relatively low in the heavy and chemical industries the steel and electric power generation industries even emerged from the war with plant capacity above prewar levels16 observers may note that the iraqi people and the international community most likely have much higher expectations of what the united states should contribute to economic reconstruction in iraq than what the united states was expected to contribute to germany and japan as the disparities are much greater between the united states and iraq than between the united states and its world war ii adversaries the united states with current population of 300 million has gdp more than 200 times greater than that of iraq population 26 million 11750 billion compared to 544 billion 2004 estimate us gdp per capita was almost 20 times that of iraq in 2004 40100 compared to 2100 17 while us military action did little damage by design to much of iraqs economic infrastructure it did damage iraqs electrical grid18 which also had an effect on the availability of water in addition iraqs infrastructure had greatly deteriorated over the previous years the existence of an insurgency in iraq which deliberately sabotages the economy and reconstruction efforts is an important consideration in comparing iraqs economic reconstruction requirements with those of postwar germany and japan which had resistance movements 16 the postwar japanese economy 19451973 by yutaka k ōsai in michael smitka ed japans economic ascent international trade growth and
