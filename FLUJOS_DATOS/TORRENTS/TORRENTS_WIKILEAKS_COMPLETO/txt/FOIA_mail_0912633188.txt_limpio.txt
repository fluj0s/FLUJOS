from bob keeland bob_keelandusgsgov to itrdbforlistservarizonaedu subject re verification and uniformitarianism date wed 2 dec 1998 161308 0700 replyto grissinovaldostaedu frank is correct in that we need to define abrupt climatic change or even just climate change using jims schulman grove example suppose that the area supported stand of bristlecone pine 9000 or more years ago hence the scattered remnants either major catastrophic event or fluctuation in climate call it climate change if you want resulted in conditions that killed the mature trees and eliminated any further recruitment for up to 1000 years this site may be near the limits of recruitment and with major or minor perhaps change in climate it could easily be beyond the limits of recruitment about 8000 years ago climate again became favorable for bristlecone pine recruitment and new stands developed and have existed ever since some or most of the material remaining from the original stand may be buried down in the valley or the original stand may have been small or sparse the amount of time between the loss of the original stand and the beginning of the new stand would depend on the period of unfavorable weather and the amount of time needed for bristlecone pine to reinvade the area i am out on limb here so to speak as i an somewhat ignorant of prehistoric climate patterns for the area and of bristlecone pine ecology but this seems like relatively reasonable scenario i guess that my point is that climate continues to fluctuate within broad bounds everything that we are now calling climate change is well within the bounds observed within the prehistoric record of climate fluctuations do we call any variation climate change or should we limit the term climate change for anything considered to be caused by humans to my mind it is not so much what we call it but rather that we keep clear idea of what we actually talking about bob keeland usgs national wetlands research center lafayette bob_keelandusgsgov
