activities of epa include the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32997crs8 expanded support for programs such as the best workplaces for commuters program which provide information and incentives for commuters to consider transit ridesharing or other alternatives to driving continued support of state and local efforts toward livable and healthy communities eg through epas smart growth program which collects and disseminates information useful in enhancing clean neighborhoods and transportation choices continued funding and coordination activ ities in various partnerships such as epas sm artway transport partnership which links hundreds of local governments community organizations and companies in order to produce knowledge that is designed to reduce vehicle miles traveled contributions to the former partnership for new generation of vehicles and current freedom car governmentdomestic autoindustry partnerships scribed previously under doe industry efforts include work ing with industries especially energyintensive industries such as cement ch emicals steel petroleum airlines and food processing commonly through technical assistance to audit and identify greenhouse gas emission sources and to help in formula ting appropriate re duction goals and strategies including removal of re gulatory and other barriers this includes working with ongoing pr ivately funded energy efficiency programs at private companies carbon removal efforts at epa were planned in coordination with the departments of agriculture and energy the epausdadoe funds for this activity are for studying ways to increase environmental storage of carbon as well as the kinds and sizes of incentives that could be given to land owners and crop growers to increase the quantity of carbon st ored on agricultural and forest lands and at the same time improve soil quality reduce soil erosion and enhance other environmen tal and conservation goals epa works with state and local governments to help find ways to reduce energy use and pollution sometimes by supporting existing state and local programs the cities for climate protection program for example involves mo re than 54 local governments in

by various us government policies since the early1980s with an emphasis on energy rd and on climate research and services20 us efforts in the george h w bush and clinton administrations toward rd in energy efficiency and renewable energy and research into climate and global change were mandated by the energy policy act of 1992 which implemented the united states voluntary commitments under the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change and by the global change resear ch act of 1990 president clintons 1993 climate change action plan linked or created partnerships among various federal agencies business state and local governments and other entities with the goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32997crs12 21
