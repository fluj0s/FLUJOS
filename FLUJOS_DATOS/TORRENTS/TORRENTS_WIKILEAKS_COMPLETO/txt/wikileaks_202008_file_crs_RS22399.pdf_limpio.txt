research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs22399 march 14 2006 recent developments in medicare affecting longterm care hospitals sibyl tilson specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division summary medicare pays about 36 b illion annually for postacute care in four separate settings longterm care hospitals ltchs inpatient rehabilitation settings irfs skilled nursing facilities snfs and in the home medi care pays for care in each setting under unique payment system that uses diffe rent patient assessmen t instruments pai to establish patients level of care ltchs often considered the most expensive post acute care setting are not required to use any pai generally medicare requires that ltchs be licensed as acute care hospitals and ve an average length of stay of 25 days although there is prior hospitalizatio n requirement in order for medicare beneficiary to qualify for care in an lt ch approximately 80 of beneficiaries receiving such care are transferred from an acute care hospital ltchs provide intensive care to patients who have mu ltiple coexisting conditions who may need hospital level care for relatively extended periods however medicares ability to assess whether patients are be ing treated in the most ppropriate settin g is undermined because there are common patient assessment tools or outcome measures across post acute care settings this report provides background information on several operational issues affecting ltchs that are currently attracting attention from congress specifically efforts to develop patient assessment tool to develop qua lification criteria that should be imposed on ltchs and to change medicares ltch payment methods for all postacute settings the overarching policy concern is how to expedite the development of methods that be st identify the postacute care tting that provides the most appropriate costeffective care for speci fic patient or par ticular condition for ltchs the debate centers around 1 the sta ndards that should be imposed in order to qualify as an ltch and 2 the criteria that should define the vel of care provided by ltchs specific rate setting proposals concer ning appropriate adju stments within the new prospective payment system establishe d in 2002 and the adequacy of medicare payments have generated animated discussion as well recommendations from the medicare pa yment advisory commission medpac regarding patient and facility criteria for ltchs or most recently supporting 0

attention also past actions from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms regarding requirements imposed on ltchs that are physically located as part of other providers also known as hospitalswithinhospitals or hwhs as well as ry2007 proposals for payments for shortstay admissions have elicited concern among provi ders and their advocates identifying appropriate postacute care settings the medicare medicaid and schip benef its improvement nd protection act of 2000 bipa required the secretary to sub mit report to congress by january 1 2005 on the development of standard instruments for the assessment of the health and functional status of medicare patients who receive hospital rehabilitation snf home health therapy or other specified services the report has not yet been received the subcommittee on health within the committee on ways and means held hearing on june 16 2005 to examine what progress had been made in that area and to discuss the status of and solicit recomme ndations on medicares current postacute payment systems in that hearing cms presented an overview of several different agency initiatives that may result in the development of standard pai common health information terminology and consis tent coding practices1 medpac and industry representatives also testified on different issues affecting ltchs2 medpac discussed the problems with integrating the current postacute patient ssessment tools and indicated that new pai is needed3 as part of its testimony medpac reiterated its recommendation made in 2004 that ltchs be defined by facility and patient crite ria to ensure the patients admitted to these facilities have medically complex conditions and good chance for improvement4 medpac also recommended that quality improvement organizations qios review ltch admissions for medical necessity and monitor facilities compliance with yettobedetermined ltch criteria5 testimony from one group representing the ltch industry spoke to

however according to cms since october 1 2004 22 of the 25 newlyes tablished ltchs are freestanding 10 this policy applies to satellite ltchs established on the same campus of other providersthe principle that patients be cared and paid for in the appropriate setting6 although generally supportive another group repres enting ltch providers focused on the challenges inherent in creating appropriate patient assessment t ools and using program safeguard methods including qios to ensure costeffective appropriate care in safe settings7 postacute care demonstration project mandated by the defi cit reduction act of 2005 dra may eventually help address so of the broader changes necessary to encourage the costeffective provision of pos tacute care in the most appropriate setting as mandated by dra the secretary of hea lth and human services hhs is required to establish threeyear demonstration prog ram to better understa nd costs and outcomes across different postacute care sites under the program individuals receiving treatment for specified diagnoses will r eceive comprehensive assessmen t on the date of discharge from an acute care hospital paid under medicar inpatient prospective payment system or ipps the assessment will evaluate clinical characteristics and patients needs in order to determine appropriate placement of the patient in postacute care site the same standardized patient assessment instrument will be used across all postacute care sites to measure functional stat us and other factors the s ecretary is required to submit report to congress on results and recommenda tions later than six months after the end of the program dra authorized the transfer of 6 million from medicares hospital insurance trust fund to carry out the demonstration defining entities as ltchs in the meantime certain operational issues have come to the forefront long simmering issue concerns the establishment of an ltch operating as part of another provider8 although the medicare statute does exp licitly address the exclusion of distinct part psychiatric and rehabilitation units of other hospitals from the inpatient prospective payment system ipps used to pay acute care hospitals comparable provision excludes longterm care units in those hospitals from ipps until recently hwhs have accounted for much of the growth in longterm care hospitals9 in 2004 cms acted to tighten the requirements by which hwhs can be established to f unction as independent ltchs10 as established in the final rule medicare will continue to provide ltch payments for patients referred from other than the host hospital with certain exceptionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22399crs4 11 the alternative payment methodology would apply to hwhs within rural acute care hospitals that have majority 51 of host hospital referrals the threshold for single urban or dominant urban hwhs those with onequarter or more of all acute care cases would be set between 25 and 50 depending upon the hosts percentage of total medicare discharges for like hospitals in the metropolitan statistical area msa pa tients transferred from the host hospital who have already qualified as ipps outliers would not be considered as host hospital referrals 12 fy2004 and fy2005 medicare data i ndicate that the 637 of the 201 freestanding ltchs receive at least 25 of their medicare discha rges from single ipps hospital 239 of those freestanding ltchs receive at least 50 of their admissions from one ipps hospital 67 of the freestanding ltchs receive 75 or more of their medicare discharges from one ipps hospital 71 federal register 4698 january 27 2006 13 71 federal register 4647 january 27 2006 14 the ltchpps uses longterm care diagnosisrelated groups ltcdrgs as its patient continuedas long as the percentage of referrals from the host hospital is less than or equal to 25 or the otherwise applicable threshold the ltch will be paid under the ltchpps for the referrals from the host hospital11 if the host hospital referrals exceed the applicable transition threshold ltch will be paid the lower of the ltchpps payment or the ipps payment for those cases that exceed that threshold the policy would be phased in over fouryear transition period for existin g ltchs and those ltchs under formation both industry advocates and members of c ongress have expresse d reservations with respect to the wisdom of this policy generally their concerns are framed in terms of its effect on beneficiaries access to needed ltch care medpac among others has expressed concern that the hwh policy could lead to an inequitable situation for co located ltchs freestanding ltchs also ve strong relationships with acute care hospitals although on average ltch hwhs receive 61 of their patients from their host hospitals on average freestanding ltchs receive 42 of their patients from their primary referring acute care hospital yet the 25 threshold applies only to ltch hwhs as mentioned in the proposed ltch rule concerning rate year ry 2007 changes cms remains concerned about monitoring the func tional separateness between ltchs and referring acute care hospitals according to cms analyses of recent ltch claims appear to confir m concerns attributed to dpac that the industry may be circumventing the intent of the 25 paym ent threshold by creating freestanding instead of colocated ltchs12 cms is considering but has not proposed appr opriate payment adjustments to address this issue mo reover cms warned of potentially fraudulent referral arrangements between acute care hospitals and ltchs hwh satellite and freestanding entities that could warrant an investigation by the office of the inspector general oig changing ratesetting methods other issues have been raised about ch anges that have been proposed for the ry2007 medicare ltch payment methodology13 as part of the prospective payment system for ltchs ltchpps cms has established special payment policy for short stay outlier cases sso cases these are cases that have length of stay less than or equal to fivesixths of the geometric average length of stay alos of the patient category to which the case is assigned14 under the existing sso policy the perdischarge paymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22399crs5 14 continued classification system 15 the regulation affecting the majority of ltchs is included at 42 code of federal regulation cfr 412529 generally most ltchs are defined by statute as having an alos of greater than 25 days as specified by section 1886d1b ivi of the social security act the act there is one subclause ii ltch authorized by section 1886d1bivii of the act which is subject to different qualification criteria in th at it must have first been excluded as an ltch in calendar year cy 1986 have an average inpatient of greater than 20 days and demonstrate that 80 or more of its annual medi care inpatient discharges in the 12month cost reporting period ending in fy1997 had principal diagnosis that reflects finding of neoplastic disease the subclause ii ltch is treated differently and receives higher payments for sso cases during the transition period 16 estimated outlier payments are limited to 8 of total projected ltch spending since the sso proposal will lower total payments cms proposed to increase the outlier threshold from 10501 in fy2005 to 18489 in ry2006 to limit outlier payments to 8 of total spending 17 the number of ltchs has almost doubled over the past three years from 200 in fy2003 to 378 in fy2005 18 according to cms payments to ltchs increase d more than two times as much as the costs continuedunder the ltch pps is the lesser of 120 of th estimated cost of the case 120 of the ltcdrg specific per diem amount multiplied by the of that discharge or the full ltcdrg payment15 cms is proposing two changes to the current policy 1 to reduce the current adjustment from 120 of the costs of the case to 100 of the costs of the case for discharges occurring on or after july 1 2006 and 2 to add fourth payment method whereby an ltch would receive payment co mparable to that in ipps key fact is that cms projects decline of 114 fo r all ltch payments or savings of approximately 440 million in ry2007 as result of the sso change cms believes that many of the sso cases could have been treated more appropriately in an acute care or ipps hos pital in fy2003 80 of all ltch fy2003 admissions came from acute care hospitals cms analysis of fy2004 ltch claims data indicates that approximately 37 of ltch discharges are paid as ssos although this represents decline from 484 found at the outset of the ltch pps the current percentage is seen as inappr opriately high also the curre nt payment adjustment for sso cases is seen as providing financial incentive to inappropriately admit shortstay patients because many of these cases are paid as ssos cms believes that the ltch patients who still need acutelevel care may indicate premature and inappropriate discharge from the acute care hospital an inappropriate admission to the ltch and second unnecessary medicare payment to the ltch16 among other changes in the proposed ru cms discussed the use of different market basket mb as part of deciding the rate increase for the following year this mb is based on fy2002 cost reports from irfs ps ychiatric hospitals and ltchs rplmb and is now used as part of the irf payment system rather than proposing the 36 increase in payments currently indicated by the rplmb cms has recommended 0 update to the ltch base rate for ry2007 th is recommendation is ttributed to certain trends such as recent growth in the number of ltchs17 growth in medicare payments per discharge relative to costs per discharge18 and changes in coding and reported casemix19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22399crs6 18 continued increased from fy2002 to fy2003 medicare paym ents per discharge increased about 17 while costs increased by only 8 from fy2002 to fy2003 the first year of ltch pps 19 using certain assumptions cms estimates that 4 of the ltch payments received from fy2001 to fy2003 could be attributed to improvem ents to documentation and coding rather than to the increase in patients severity of illness 20 medpac report to the congress medicare payment policy march 2006 p 207 21 during the same years the ltch hwh increased more than twice as fast 14 per year as freestanding ltchs 6 per year 22 medpac looks at certain agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq patient safety indicators for acute care hospitals such as the incidence of decubitus ulcers infection due to medical care postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis and postoperative sepsis to identify potential preventable advers events that might suggest compromised quality of care incidence of three of the four measures increased significantly from 2003 to 2004moreover according to cms medicare margin s were at 88 in 2003 the first year of ltchpps and increased to preliminary estimate of 117 in fy2004 in the period prior to the implementation of ltch pps from fy1996 through fy2002 medicare margins ranged from between minimum of 22 in fy2002 to maximum of 29 in fy1997 in march 2006 for the first time medpac examined the adequacy of ltch payment rates in order to recommend an upda for the upcoming year medpac found that medicare payments for ltch services are more than adequate and recommended that the update to ltch paym ent rates be eliminated for 200720 t h m d p c conclusion was based on the following factors increased access to care as indirectly estab lished by the 13 annual increase in medicare beneficiaries who use an ltch each year from 2001 to 2004 increased number of ltchs as measured by the 9 annual increase in ltchs from 2001 to 200421 increased provision of medicare services as measured by the 12 annual increase in services from 2001 to 2004 while medicare spending increased at more than double that rate 25 per year mixed evidence on the current quality of ltch care as indicated by the decrease in ltch deaths and acute care hospital readmissions from 2001 to 2004 countered by worsening of patient safety measures over the same period22 adequate access to capital as demonstrated by forprofit ltchs ability to borrow and the rapid try of both forprofit and nonprofit ltchs into medicare adequate medicare margins as indicated by the 9 medicare margin in 2004 and the projected 78 margin for 2006 which does not include proposed changes in the ry2007 payments
