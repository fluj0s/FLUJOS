chief of mission greg delawie for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary one hundred days after germanys blackyellow coalition took office strong unified government led by chancellor merkel has yet to materialize the much anticipated dream coalition comprised of merkels christian democratic union cdu its bavarian sister the christian social union csu and free democratic party fdp which promised unified conservative approach to the economy and like minded thinking on social welfare the environment and foreign policy has become bogged down in party politics with end in sight recent polls show that the bickering may be at least partly to blame for the fdps 56 percent fall in the polls with it now down to 9 percent from its historic 146 percent election results see septel and the csu plummet to an historic low of 41 percent indeed one minister is now threatening resignation sources from the three coalition parties have admitted to problems blaming the other coalition parties and downplaying their significance merkel has come under criticism within her own party for not taking strong public stands and reining in her coalition partners instead staying above the political fray the opposition particularly the social democratic party spd is trying to capitalize on this divided we rule coalition with an eye toward unseating teetering cdufdp coalition in northrhine westphalia nrw in may elections thereby tipping the cdufdp bundesrat majority in its favor merkel is counting on better economic and political indicators after the nrw election followed by the release of the annual tax forecasts to congeal the coalition if the cdufdp coalition fails in nrw coalition divisions are likely to become more pronounced end summary off to rocky start 2 c concluding coalition agreement in only three weeks prior to her november 2 departure for washington to address congress and in time for the 9 november 20 year anniversary of german unity may have been chancellor merkels first and only major success to date in marshaling coalition unity but the feat may have had consequences the haste to sign has left halfresolved differences on tax cuts economic policy afghanistan turkey health care data protection see reftel and other issues that continue to gurgle to the surface important to recognize is that each party is operating under its own political pressures from different voting constituencies the fdps main goal is to deliver on campaign promises particularly tax relief and shore up its base the csu is desperate to regain its dominance in bavaria and the cdu is seeking to rebuild its eroded voter base all three parties and the opposition are now gearing up for may 9 elections in nrw this election in germanys most populous state referred to as small national election is regarded as partial vote of confidence on the national coalition and will determine the bundesrat majority if the nrw cdufdp coalition fails to return to government the national cdufdp coalition will fall by six seats in the bundesrat from 37 to 31 seats it will lose its majority such loss could well hamper the governments ability to pass major financial or economic legislation 3 c each of the three coalition parties have pointed to the others for instigating tension cdu party contact xxxxx accused the fdp of functioning as if it were still in the opposition senior spd parliamentarian hansulrich klose attributed the coalition strains to the fdp adjusting to being in government after 11 years in the opposition fdp contact xxxxx accused the cducsu of reacting to their own internal problems for the cdu its controversy over the kunduz airstrike and for the csu its involvement in major bank scandal the fdp also points to the csus strong rivalry with the fdp with which it now governs in bavaria the csu is still trying to recover from its historic low voting results in the september 2008 state elections which forced it for the first time in 46 years to govern within coalition all parties however have downplayed the significance of the feuds with senior cdu party operative xxxxx explaining in january that the party leaderships are just now settling in after an exhausting election campaign and intense coalition negotiations he hoped more than predicted that the parties would soon settle into more cooperative relationship in january merkel called small summit for coalition leadership with westerwelle and seehofer to smooth things over and commit to new beginning while the coalitions political edginess receded for time policy divisions continue to surface cducsu vs fdp the economy 4 c while cducsu and fdp voters may be the most likely to cross over to the other party their mainstay voter bases are different with the cducsu appealing to economically conservative voters who also support the social market economy but are socially conservative the fdp base is composed of freemarket advocates who are socially liberal and strong advocates of civil liberties the fdps campaign and continuing mantra has been for much larger tax cuts in 2011 worth 2024 billion euros apparently at the expense of both coalition unity and the better judgment of economic experts the cuts would make getting the deficit back under the eu ceiling of 3 percent of gdp by 2013 nearly impossible national debt will rise from 66 percent of gdp to 80 percent there are growing public concerns over rising debt but also about perceived disarray in the coalitions tax and budget policies merkel insists that decision regarding the tax reduction plans will not be taken before may when the overall tax revenue forecast is due waiting until may also means the coalition will not have to go public with unpopular consolidation measures until after the nrw elections finance minister schaeuble cdu appears unenthusiastic at best about further tax cuts he has already said deficit reduction measures would have to start in 2011 the csu has also called the fdps call for speedy tax relief measures unrealistic despite the fact that it had included such demand during its election campaign the most recent squabble between the fdp and csu is over fdp health minister roeslers plans for health care reform which foresees more care options and the introduction of competition seehofer has rejected the proposal holding fast against radical changes to the system roesler has indicated he might resign over this issue foreign policy 5 c coalition feuding over economic and tax policy has trumped coalition divisions over foreign policy although fm westerwelle has managed few disruptions in the latter as harbinger of hard times to come as one of his first actions westerwelle opposed the naming of cdu bundestag member erika steinbach to the foundation flight expulsion and reconciliation citing possible damage to relations with poland as president of germanys federation of expellees steinbach is disliked in poland while the numbers are disputed the expellee community which mainly votes csu or cdu has exerted influence on the issue national and state cdu and csu politicians came out in support of steinbach with only merkel keeping mum the controversy continues despite ongoing attempts to reach compromise threatening to drain coalition attention and goodwill 6 c coalition strains have also surfaced on the issue of overseas deployments regarding troop increase in afghanistan westerwelles position was at first muddled as he tried to reflect his partys general negativity toward overseas military deployments while at the same time tending to his role as germanys chief diplomat in the runup to the london conference in the end he together with the opposition likely played role in achieving lowerthanexpected troop increase westerwelle also convinced the cdu to agree on gradually reducing german participation in unifil the csu also rocked the coalition boat on afghanistan with seehofer expressing general skepticism on troop increase although he later came around in addition csu secretary general dobrindt has ridiculed the federal governments reconciliation concept in afghanistan as cash for clunkers version for the taliban comment 7 c chancellor merkel may have ironically cast off the yoke of the grand coalition only now to be encumbered with new fdpcsu double yoke restrained by an fdp bent on delivering on campaign promises and csu distracted over its rivalry with the fdp and internal problems high expectations for the dream coalition are certainly in part to blame for the current polls with popularity numbers for merkel and westerwelle both having suffered worried most however are the cdu and fdp politicians in nrw who fear that the national coalitions squabbling could negatively impact their own chances in the may 9 elections the leadership threesome merkel westerwelle and seehofer may make an extra effort to get along or at least appear to get along as the nrw elections near it is not clear that westerwelle and the fdp however believe that it is the squabbling that is unhelpful or rather its own inability to deliver as yet on certain campaign promises if it is the latter more coalition tensions could ensue as westerwelle begins to expend more energy as fdp chairman and less as foreign minister gearing up his party for its nrw campaign berlin is once again becoming bogged down in political squabbles as the nrw elections near 8 u consulate munich contributed to this cable murphy
