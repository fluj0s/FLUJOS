identified as major public health problem studies report that it increases the risks for disability and may be detrimental to the developing brain minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide break the law or be victims of violence alcohol is implicated in nearly onethird of youth traffic fatalities the total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at 62 bi llion on march 6 2007 the office of the us surgeon general issued an official call to increase efforts to curb underage drinking the prevalence of alcohol consumption by minors is measured by three federally funded national surveys the national survey on drug use and health nsduh the youth risk behavior survey yrbs and monitoring the future mtf there are an estimated 108 million underage drinkers in the united states more than 2 million are classified as heavy drinkers and nearly 72 million are classified as binge drinkers meaning that they have had more than five drinks on one occasion although the consumption of alcohol by youth has dropped steadily over the past decade recent data suggest that 743 of individuals in grades 912 have used alcohol on multiple occasions 433 regularly consume alcohol and 255 engage in binge drinking underage drinking remains far more prevalent problem than the use of illicit drugs or tobacco products while most underage drinking prevention laws are passed by states there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states efforts to curb the problem issues of concern to policy makers include the ineffective enforcement of zerotolerance laws prohibiting underage drinking and the online sale of alcohol to minors according to recent research millions of minors either buy alcohol online or know an underage friend who has done so in recent years state and national policy makers have proposed restrictions on home delivery of alcohol ordered from internet sites this report describes the extent of alcohol use by youth federal

office of the us surgeon general issued an official call to increase efforts to curb underage drinking1 we can longer ignore what alcohol is doing to our children said acting surgeon general kenneth moritsugu alcohol he continued is the most heavily abused substance by americas youth2 the nation he implored must attempt to change attitudes toward drinking in light of recent research demonstrating that alcohol may harm the adolescent brain and that individuals who start drinking before the age of 15 are five times more likely to have alcohol related problems later in life the acting surgeon general announced six basic goals fostering changes in american society that facilitate healthy adolescent development and help prevent and reduce underage drinking engaging youth and all social systems that interface with youth in coordinated effort to prevent and reduce drinking and its consequences promoting understanding of underage drinking in the context of development and maturation that considers individual adolescent characteristics and environmental ethnic cultural and gender differences conducting additional research on adolescent alcohol use and its relationship to development improving surveillance on underage drinking and its risk factors ensuring that all policies are consistent with the goal of preventing and reducing underage alcohol consumption although drinking by persons under the age of 21 is illegal in all states people aged 1220 drink almost 20 of alcohol consumed in the united states 3 in 2004 there were more than 142000 emergency room visits by youth aged 1220 as result of injuries and other conditions linked to alcohol consumption4 each year data suggest approximately 5000 young people under the age of 21 die as result of underage

underage drinking rate seen in large metropolitan areas14 while nsduh and yrbs ask many similar questions regarding underage drinking the youth risk behavior survey includes several unique noteworthy findings among high school students surveyed in 2005 26 had their first alcoholic drink before age 13 one in three had ridden with driver who had been drinking alcohol and over the course of the past month 10 had consumed alcohol while operating motor vehicle and 43 had done so while on school property15 g14g142g144g138g149g561g18g142g155g156g153g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561 the 21st amendment to the us constitution gives states the primary authority to regulate the sale and distribution of alcohol within their bo rders hence most underage drinking prevention laws are passed by states today all states have set the minimum legal drinking at age 21 and have passed zerotolerance laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drive after drinking any alcohol despite their demonstrated benefits legal drinking age laws and zero tolerance laws generally have not been vigorously enforced16 alcohol purchase laws aimed at sellers and buyers also can be effective but experts believe that more resources need to be made available for enforcing these laws 17 g17g151g149g146g151g142g561g21g138g149g142g156g561g152g143g561g3g149g140g152g145g152g149g561 millions of minors either buy alcohol

doorsteps of consumersbe they adults or teenagers the tru numbers suggest that in 2004 only 9 of teens had visited website that sells alcohol however this 9 figure may be more substantial than is initially evident because only 34 of survey respondents reported knowing that it was possible to purchase alcohol online another way to frame this finding is that more than 25 of 14to20 yearolds who knew alcohol could be purchased via the internet visited websites that sell beer wine or liquor viewed in this light the tru studys estimate that 68 of 14to20yearolds report that their parents make attempt to control online activity and the report that 75 say their parents are unable to control what they do online leads some analysts to believe that more minors can be expected to purchase alcohol online in the future 19 this suggestion is consistent with 2003 report by the institute of medicine which found that underage individuals are increasingly buying alcohol online and concluded that greater use of the internet in the future will likely exacerbate this problem20 it is also supported by the significant number of teenagers who are being given creditdebit cards by their parents or guardians21 in recent years state and national policy makers have proposed restrictions on home delivery of alcohol ordered from internet sites it is unclear however whether debates over alcohol sales from the internet are driven primarily by the desire to reduce youth access to alcohol because prohibitions of home delivery from local retail outlets have not been included in the policy debates on internet sales this omission has led some political observers to conclude that policy attention to internet sales of alcohol may reflect the varying economic interests of local versus national alcohol distributors and retailersrather than concerns about teen access to alcohol 22

granted states the authority to regulate alcohol sales nearly half the states subsequently passed laws requiring out ofstate wineries to sell their products through licensed instate wholesalers resulting in m illions of dollars in state alcohol taxes however the commerce clause generally prohibits state laws that unreasonably discriminate against outofstate businesses that led to the challenges to the michigan and new york laws justice anthony kennedy who wrote the majority opinion stated states have broad power to regulate liquor this power however does not allow states to ban or severely limit the direct shipment of outofstate wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by instate producers the majority continued the differential treatment between instate and outofstate wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce that is neither authorized nor permitted by the twentyfirst amendment justice kennedys opinion was joined by justices antonin scalia david h souter ruth bader ginsburg and stephen g breyer new york and michigan defended their laws as necessary to prevent underage drinkers from buying wine without having to show proper proof of age as well as to prevent tax evasion the majority rejected these arguments finding that the states provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by outofstate wineries justice kennedy also said that the states concerns did not justify discrimination minors are just as likely to order wine from instate producers as from outofstate ones moreover he noted minors are more likely to purchase and consume wine than beer or wine coolers or hard liquor finally the majority asserted that minors who choose to disobey laws governing alcohol purchaseconsumption have more direct means of gaining access to alcohol than methods that involve direct shipping given the decision in granholm it is anticipated that any effort to regulate online sales of alcohol will face considerable political and legal hurdles because the court has ostensibly ruled that the only way to limit internet sales of alcohol is to treat outofstate direct sellers such as internet based sales and instate direct sellers equally 24 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g18g142g155g156g153g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561

reducing underage drinking concluded that underage drinking cannot be successfully addressed by focusing on youth alone 33 because minors usually obtain alcoholdirectly or indirectlyfrom adults the iom contended efforts to reduce drinking among teens should also be aimed at adults and industry the ioms recommendations discussed below included communitybased interventions and policy options to limit or prevent underage alcohol consumption

longterm exposure to alcohol advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that children will drink the iom has called on the alcohol and entertainment industries to shield youth from unsuitable messages about drinking by ensuring that programs do not portray underage drinking in favorable light the iom also suggested that congress consider restrictions on the alcohol industry analogous to those placed on the tobacco companies to prevent marketing practices that disproportionately appeal to minors

has not kept pace with inflation observed the iom thus reducing the real price of alcohol over time thus alcoholic beverages are cheaper today in real dollars than they were in the 1960s and 1970s research indicates that increases in alcohol price are associated with decreased underage drinking 34 increasing excise taxes on alcohol according to the iom could provide revenue for strategies to reduce underage drinking35 33 richard j bonnie and mary ellen oconnell eds reducing underage drinking collective responsibility institute of medicine committee on developing strategy to reduce and

educating the public about the consequences of underage drinking as well as the existing laws regarding alcohol consumption by minors could curtail underage drinking the iom recommended that the federal government fund and support development of national media effort as major component of an adultoriented campaign to reduce underage drinking for these public education efforts to be effective
