levels since 1954 legislative branch staff include congressional staff who work in the house or senate and legislative agency staff who work in legislative branch agency1 all staff positions discussed in this report are funded in the annual legislative branch appropriations act legislative branch staffing levels since 1954 reflect number of trends and characteristics from the mid1950s and through the 1960s staffing levels were characterized by modest steady growth this pattern gave way to sharper increase in congressional staff throughout the 1970s primarily due to the implementation of the legi slative reorganization act of 1970 lra and the congressional budget act of 1974 cba the lr mandated enhanced congressional oversight including additional congressional staff for house and senate committees and increased staff in some legislative agencies the cba established the congressional budget office cbo and the senate and house committees on the budget agency staff levels were essentially flat from the mid1970s until the mid1980s when they began to decline in the 1980s congressional staff levels were also flat resulting in small overall decrease in legislative staff employment congressional staff levels began to decrease in the early 1990s and the rate of legislative agency decline accelerated the decreases were due in part to reductions in house committee staff the general accounting office gao and other legislat ive branch entities and the abolition of the office of technology assessment ota decreases continued in the early 2000s but appear to show slight increases in the past few years figure 1 provides an overview of legislative branch staffing trends figur 1 legislativ branch staffing 19542007 01000020000300004000050000 19541959 1964 19691974

calculations since 1954 there have been changes not only in the size but also in the deployment of legislative branch staff from the mid1950s through the 1970s there were considerably more legislative agency employees than congressional staff in 1954 16051 employees served in legislative agencies compared to 5621 congressional staff by 1970 the gap decreased with legislative agencies comprising 18523 employees and congress having 11127 staff members during the 1980s legislative branch employees were effectively evenly divided between congress and legislative branch agencies with 1985 staffing levels of 18590 in legislative agency offices and 19488 in congressional offices in the 1990s both congressional staff and agency staff numbers declined significantly but the decline was higher for agency staff in 2000 legislative branch agencies accounted for 14325 employees congressional staff was 16504 in the past several years legislative agency staff numbers have cont inued to decrease but at slower pace than during the 1990s while congressional staff levels have grown slightly in 2007 the latest available data from opm show 13390 employees working in legislative agencies and 17 396 staff members in congressional offices the growth of congressional staff was likely due to number of factors these include steady increase in the volume and complexity of issues addressed by congress 4 which required the acquisition of specialized congressional staff and legislative changes including the implementation of the lra and cba it appears from available data that between 1954 and the mid1980s staff levels in the house increased at slightly higher rate than the senate during the 1990s staff levels in both chambers decreased with larger decreases occurring in the house since then staff changes have been proportional in both chambers figure 3 provides an overview of house and senate staffing trends between 1975 and 2007 figure 4 provides the distribution of legislative

agencies aoc and loc appear to reflect trends similar to that of the legislative branch as whole by contrast both gao and gpo had fewer staff in 2007 than in 1954 gao staff levels appear to have fallen until the 1970s before growing in the years after passage of the lra and the general accounting office act of 1974 relatively sma ll growth continued at gao until the mid1990s when the agencys staff levels were reduced by congress since the mid1990s gao staff levels have remained flat gpo staff levels grew continuously between 1954 and 1975 but have declined steadily since this is due in part to the adoption by the agency of less labor intensive printing technologies increased utilization of contracted printing services and reduced demands from government clients who have opted to

congress to change existing staff arrangements in congress or legislative branch agencies as policies and issues before congress continue to proliferate in volume and complexity new proposals for change in staffing levels or changes in the balance between congressional staff and legislative agency staff may emerge those proposals may also be incorporated into broader issues including how to fund additional staff resources 5 and how to accommodate more staff in congressional facilities periodically concerns have been raised that congressional buildings and facilities on capitol hill are overcrowded or inadequate to support the work of congress6 despite the recent addition of congressional facilities in the capitol visitors center expansion any discussion of adding congressional staff would likely raise questions related to the adequacy of current congressional facilities 5 see crs report rl34490 legislative branch fy2009 appropriations by ida brudnick 6 us congress house committee
