corporations only on their us source income an inversion can thus potentially reduce firms us taxes on foreign income other tax savings apparently result from earnings stripping or the shifting of ussource income from taxable us components of the fi rm to the taxexempt foreign parts in the long run inversions may be accomp anied by some increased level of us investment abroad firm th at inverts reduces its tax burden on foreign investment however any such shift may be small and the recent corporate inversions do not appear to be accompanied by substantive shifts of economic activity from the united states this leaves the impact of invers ions on tax revenues as probably the leading nearterm economic effect as conseque nce one policy issue inversions present is that of tax equity unless offset by spe nding cuts or larger budget deficits the lost revenue is made up with hi gher taxes on other us ta xpayers several bills introduced in the 108th congress appear to have had the revenue losse s and tax equity as their primary concern and tax legisla tion aimed at restricting inversions was included in the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 an omnibus tax bill addressing business nd international tax issues in 2006 additional tax restrictions were proposed in the sena tepassed version of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act tipra pl 109222 but were not contained in the final act there are indications that the 110th congress may look to the corporate income tax as an area where revenueraising measures might be found to offset tax cuts provided elsewhere in march 2007 the senate passed tax package that included inversion provisions as part of hr 1591 supplemental appropriations bill however the measure was not included in the conference agreement on the bill some have viewed inversions as sympto matic of burden th ey believe the us tax system places on the international co mpetitiveness of us firms may 2002 us treasury report saw inversions as just one result of competitive problems posed by us taxes and called for more general reexamination of the us international tax system the reports nearterm recommendations for more stringent tax rules are confined to changes aimed at protecting the domestic tax base rather than us tax revenue from foreign income recent policy discussions of the us international tax system have included calls by some for doption of territorial tax system under which us taxes would longer apply to foreignsource income inversions can be viewed in this larger context they have been described as doityourself territoriality and present many of the same policy issues this report will be updated as events in congress and elsewhere occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444contents introduction 1 h w i

past several years have drawn the attention of policymaker s and the public to phenomenon sometimes called corporate inversions or expatriations instances where firms that consist of multiple corporations reorganize their stru cture so that the parent element of the group is foreign corporation rather than corporation chartered in the united states may 2002 study by the us tr easury department c oncluded that while inversions are not new th statutory framework making them possible has long been in existence there has been marked increase in their frequency size and visibility2 comprehensive list of firms that have inverted has not been compiled some of the more highprofile inversi ons however include ingersollrand tyco the pxre group foster wheeler nabors industries coopers industries and stanley works stanley works however s ubsequently announced that it would not undertake its planned reorganization acco rding to the us treasury department the transactions are increasin g in size scope and frequency3 firms engaged in the inversions cite number of reasons for undertaking them including creating greater operational flexibility improved cash management and an enhanced ability to access international capital markets4 prominent if not primary however is the role of taxes each of the firms in the above list expects significant tax savings from its reorganization the tax structure that permits tax savings through inversions has long been part of the us tax system the question then arises why now one plausible explanation is the decline in the stock market that followed the bull market of the 1990s as described in more detail below an inversion is accompanied by required payment of tax by individual shareholders on capital gains the capital gains tax mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs2 5 for an analysis of the reasons firms undert ake inversions see mihir desai and james r hines jr expectations and expatriati ons tracing the causes and

expa triation why not taxes vol 78 march 2002 pp 146152 the us treasury department has expressed concern over taxbase erosion but only in connection with the ability of inverted firms to shift

individual taxpayers and asks if more companies head offshore guess whos going to be stuck with the bills robert trigaux maybe evading taxes isnt such great idea st petersburg times march 10 2002 p 1h thus serve as brake on inversions wer stock prices however may mean that capital gains are smaller and capital gains taxes less onerous another suggestion has been that increased globalization of markets has exposed us firms to more competitive pressures leading them to more avidly pursue taxsaving strategies and yet another reason is simply momentum firms may have been reluctant to incorporate abroad for fear of public re lations damage once several firms undertook reorganizations the damage potential may have been per ceived to have fallen and other firms followed5 the corporate inversions apparently i nvolve little if any shifts in actual economic activity from the united states abroad at least in the near term see however the section below on policy issu for discussion of possible longrun effects bermuda and the cayman islands are the location of many of the newly created parent corporations jurisdicti ons that have corporate income tax but that do have highly developed legal institutional and communications infrastructures but the actual headquarters of inverted firms typically remain in the united states and an inversion does not pparently involve the outflow of capital from the united states abroad or the shifting of corporate jobs to foreign locations instead the chief nearterm economic impact of inversions is on us federal tax revenues which are reduced by the reorga nizations and concern has been expressed about the potential erosion of the us corporate tax base6 this has also led some to draw conclusions about their impact on ta x equity unless federa l spending is cut or the deficit is increased the reduction in tax revenue must be made up by tax increases on other taxpayers7 some policymakers have sought remedy within the existing us system for taxing international transactions as discussed below in the section on alternative policy re sponses and proposals the 107th and 108th congresses have considered variety of proposals aimed at stemming the growth of inversions the proposals range from reimposing us taxes in manner that would undo thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs3 8 house ways and means committee

incremental approaches such as denying the applicability of fore ign tax credits and net operating losses to onetime us toll taxes that may be triggered by an invers ion the latter more incremental approach was taken by the enacted version of the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 others view inversions as symptomatic of more general problems with the us tax system that have become eviden t as the world economy has become more integrated rather than disallowing i nversions they recommend more general reevaluation of the tax code that drives them to do such thing8 t h u s treasury department views inversions as evidence of competitive problems with the us tax system the administration initiate d study of inversions in february 2002 and issued preliminary re port in may 2002 the report stated that nearterm response to inversions should ensure that inversions cannot be used to reduce inappropriately the us tax on income from us operations and thus makes several proposals designed to protect us tax revenues generate d by us income9 in keeping with its concern for competitiveness however the report does not propose more stringent rules for foreignsource income and calls for reexamination of the us international tax system inversions have thus been discussed in terms of tax equity and competitiveness more detailed look at their implications for the us tax system in general is presented below in the section entitled policy issues first however it is useful to look at the mechanics of inversions and how they generate tax savings how inversions generate tax savings anatomy of an inversion although each corporate inversio n has unique features common reorganization is apparently triangular stock transaction merger where new foreign corporation is created that is charte red in foreign country with low tax rates the new foreign entity creates uschartered merger subsidiary owned by the new foreign corporation the us parent corporation is then merged into the domestic merger subsidiary and becomes s ubsidiary of the new foreign parent for stockholders of the us corporation for example individuals institutional investors and other firms shares of th old us parent automatically becomes shares of the new foreign parent10 other forms of inversi ons are asset transfers where the domestic parent transfers its assets to newly created foreign corporationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs4 11 for more detailed description of these ca tegories and specific examples of each see willard b taylor corporate expatriation why not taxes vol 78 march 2002 pp 146152 12 us taxes generally do apply however to foreign corporations income from the conduct of us trade or business and on cert ain investment income earned in the united states 13 discounting is the fundamental economic princi ple that given increment of funds say dollar is more valuable the sooner an econom ic actor has control of it for firm this is because the sooner dollar is received the sooner it can be invested and earn returnand dropdown transactions where the dom estic parent transfers its assets to foreign corporation but the foreign corpora tion transfers some of those assets to domestic subsidiary11 the basic structure of u s international taxation to see how inversions such as these gene rate tax savings it is useful first to look at the general structure of the us inte rnational tax system in the international context the united states bases its tax jurisdiction on residence it taxes corporations chartered in the 50 states or the district of columbia on their worldwide income foreign as well as domestic at the same time the united states generally exempts corporations chartered in foreign countries from us tax on their foreignsource income12 under the residence system firms us tax on foreign income depends on how the firms foreign operations are orga nized and result of the system is feature known as the deferral principle or simply deferral under deferral income that uschartered corporation earns directly through branch that is not separately incorporated is generally taxe d by the united states on current basis since the income is earned by us resident in contrast foreign income earned through separate foreign subs idiary corporation is generally not subject to us tax until it is remitted to the us parent corporation as dividends or other income it is taxdeferred becau of discounting13 this deferral confers tax benefit on income earned in foreign countries w ith relatively low tax rates the system has several additional complicating features one is the us foreign tax credit which is designed to alleviat doubletaxation where foreign countries tax us firms foreign income under its provisions the united states permits its taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they or their foreign subsidiaries pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe the foreign tax credit is generally limited to offsetting us tax on foreign and not domestic income but if firm pays sufficient foreign taxes it may use the credit to eliminate its entire us tax liability on foreign source income whether us precredit taxe s are deferred or apply on current basis another important feature is set of antideferral regimes that limit the availability of deferral in some cases the broadest and most important of these is the tax codes subpart f provisions that were enacted in 1962 as means to limit the concentration of passiveinve stment income by firms in tax havens under subpart f us parent firms can in some cases be taxed on particular types of subsidiaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs5 14 as an illustration ingersollrand reported to its shareholders that the firms payments to bermuda will be limited to fixed annual fee whose current amount is 27825 in addition bermudas minister of finance has assured ingersollrand that even if bermuda enacts an income tax it will not apply such tax to ingersollrand until 2016 see the proxy statement posted at httpwwwshareholdercomiredgarcfmpage2income even if it is not repa triated to the us parent fi rm subpart f however only applies where foreign subsidiary is c ontrolled more than 50owned by those us stockholders who own large blocs at l east 10 of the subsidiarys stock the type of income subject to subpart f is ge nerally income from pa ssive investment and certain types of income whose source is thought to be easily manipulated second antideferral regime is the pa ssive foreign investment company or pfic rules in contrast to subpart f the pfic provisions apply to foreign corporations that invest intensively in passivetype assets re gardless of the degree or concentration of us ownership and even to income that is not itself from passive investment although the pfic rules permit deferral of u s tax in some cases the rules apply an interest charge to the dela yed tax payment thus negating the benefit of deferral before explaining how an inversion within this us tax structure generates tax savings we first note that foreign taxe s are not irrelevant foreign countries frequently tax corporations chartered within their borders as does the united states thus whatever us tax savings an inversion generates coul d be offset if the country where the new parent corporation is chartered were not to have corporate tax rates lower than those of the united states indeed bermuda and the cayman islands have been frequent destination for r ecent inversions and neither imposes corporate income tax14 us tax consequences of inversions given the us tax structure inversions potentially provide tax savings in two general ways by reducing us tax on fo reign source income and by reducing us tax on us income that is shifted outside the united states in earnings stripping or similar transactions where they occur these tax savings are ongoing but only save taxes at the corporat level under the corporate income tax inversions can potentially trigger onetime tax on gain that is required to be recognized when an inversion occurs the capital gains tax can pply to individual stockholders or at the corporate level further inversions may be unable to generate tax savings to firms whose foreign tax credits have eliminated us tax on foreign income to see how these results occur we look at the straightforwar d example of firm that is initially uninverted the firm includes uschartered parent corporation that is publicly owned and traded on us stock exchanges the parent corporation earns foreign income through foreign subsidia ries under current law as long as firm has dearth of foreign tax credits at least some us tax burden applies to the firms foreign income some of the income may be taxed on current basis either through subpart f or the pfic provisions and while other foreign income may be taxdeferred it is nonethele ss ultimately taxed when it is repatriated at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs6 15

and todd tuckner financing us investments after the revenue reconciliation act of 1993 tax adviser vol 25 february 1994 pp 111117stockholder level shareholde rs who are private individua ls generally pay individual income tax on dividends from the us pa rent corporation and on capital gains when the stock is sold however some shar eholders may hold their stock in tax free vehicles for example individual retirement accounts iras while other shareholders for example pens ion funds may be tax exempt now suppose the firm inverts so th at the both the former us parent corporation and the foreign subsidiaries b ecome subsidiary to new foreign parent corporation first since the conglomera tes foreign income is now earned by foreignchartered corporati on us corporatelevel tax on the foreign income that was either deferred or currently paid unde r the antideferral regimes is eliminated thus one source of tax saving is us tax on foreign income inverted firms may also employ ear nings stripping to reduce us tax on domestic income earnings stripping shifts ussource income from us corporation to foreign parent by means of transactions between the related parts of the firm while the transactions can take variety of forms prototypical earnings stripping transaction involves foreign pare nt lending funds to domestic subsidiary the subsidiary is able to deduct interest payments to its parent from its us taxable income thereby reducing its us tax liability according to the treasury report on inversions feature common to many inve rsions is the presence of substantial indebtedness from the former us group to the new foreign parent or one of its foreign subsidiaries15 foreign corporations are generally subject to us withholding tax on ussource interest received from related us corporations the withholding tax rate is generally 30 however the withholding tax is in many cases reduced or eliminated by taxtreaty provisions thus if an earningsstripping transaction is structured so that interest payments are made to related lender in treaty country the tax can be avoided provisions designed to limit earnings stripping by foreign firms investing in the united states were enacted with the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 the provisions deny deducti ons for interest payments to related corporations but apply only after certain threshold of interest payments and level of debtfinance is exceeded16 as noted above although inversions can generate ongoing tax savings at the corporate level under the corporate income tax they may generate taxes at the shareholder level under the individual income tax on source of new taxes may be capital gains section 367 of the tax code and treasury regulations issued under that section impose capital gains tax on transfers of stock by us stockholders to foreign corporations thus for shareholder of an inverted firms domestic parent any appreciation that occurred from the time of purchase to the

capital gains tax17 the purpose of the provision is to prevent capital gains from flowing out of us tax jurisdiction without being subject to us tax at some point18 the triggering of capital gains tax suggests divergence of interests among an inverting firms stockholders with those of taxable shareholders differing from those whose stock is not taxed eg pension funds and those with holdings in iras indeed lawsuits were filed by some ingersollrand sharehol ders that sought to block the firms inversion although stockholde rs subsequently voted overwhelmingly to approve the reorganization and the lawsuits were settled19 for its part stanley works has pointed out that only 40 of its shares are in taxable accounts20 the antideferral regimes may also be factor at the shareholder level inversions

requirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs8 22 continued inversions would increase federal tax revenues by 4 billion over 10 years bna daily tax report june 3 2002 p g1inversions revenue loss has imp lications for fairness the lost revenue is made up by higher taxes elsewhere either on other co rporations and busine sses or on individual taxpayers equity is one of the ch ief grounds on which inversions critics have assailed them economic theory however points out that equity is difficult concept to apply in the case of the corporate income tax to begin corporations are not people but agglomerations of stockhol ders employees creditors and managers each of whom has his own particular income and wealth characteristics it is therefore not very informative to compare the tax burden of co rporation with that of an individual matter how eyecatching the comparison may be to make equity comparisons even more difficult the ultimate repository of the taxs burden is difficult to determine with any certainty in the short run the burden of corporate income tax or the benefit of its reduction as w ith inversions likely falls on the corporate stockholders in the long run however economic analysis suggests that market adjustments and behavioral reactions to the tax result in its burden being spread beyond corporate stockholders to all owners of capital thus inversions may reduce the tax burden on capital in general relative to the burden on labor income and to the extent capital income is associated with individuals with higher incomes inversions may reduce the progressivity of the tax system investment and competitiveness in the short run inversions probably ve little impact on real economic activity firms undertaking inversions have indicated that they are only changes in legal structure and substantive hea dquarters functions will conti nue to be conducted in the united states at the same time however inversions do reduce the corporate tax burden on foreignsource income relative to that on domestic income an inverted firm may face lower overall tax rate on inve stment in lowtax countries than it does on investment in the united states as consequence more longrun result may be for inverted firms to shift some am ount of investment and business operations from the united states to locations where foreign income taxes are low what are the implications of this possible impact on investment flows in assessing the impact of taxes on investme nt economic analysis focuses on economic efficiency and ultimately on economic welfare accord ing to traditional economic theory taxes best promote economic efficiency when they are least distorting of investment decisions when taxes do not di stort investment deci sions investment is generally employed in its most productiv location as consequence economic welfare is maximized economic theory also holds that taxes are least distorting of the location of investment when the tax burden on investment is the same in every location in the international context ta xes do not distort investment location when the tax burden on foreign source income is the same as that on domestic income in tax parlance tax policy that promotes equal taxation of foreign and domestic investment is policy of cap ital export neutrality ce inversions reduce the taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs9 burden on foreign income compared to domestic income their availability likely nudges the us tax system away from cap ital export neutrality with corresponding loss in economic efficiency and economic welfare but any loss in economic efficiency that may result from inversions is not likely to be large because features of the us tax system that exist quite apart from inversions already reduce the tax burden on foreign investment the ability of firms to defer us tax on subsidiary earnings in lowtax countries reduces the tax burden on foreign investment as do certain us fo reign tax credit rules while inversions likely do reduce the tax burden on foreign income by granting permanent tax exemption rather than just deferral of tax it is likely their incremental change in the tax burden is not enormous while capital export neutrality is thoug ht by economists to maximize world economic welfare business leaders and ot hers have emphasized the importance of taxes impact on us competitiveness and the ability of us firms to compete in world markets this analysis recomme nds policy sometimes called capital import neutrality under which the united states would not tax income from foreign business operations and would limit its tax jurisdiction to ussource income for example several european countries opera territorial tax systems that do not apply homecountry taxes to foreign inco it is argued that the united states should likewise adopt territorial system to place its firms on the same tax footing as firms from territorial countries the availability of corporate inversions introduces an element of capital import neutrality into the us system supporte rs of capital import neutrality are likely to view inversions in more positive light than supporters of cap ital export neutrality capital import neutrality recommends an exemption for foreign income and inversions accomplish that for invert ed firms and as noted above some policymakers have suggested that inversions may signal need for tax changes that would make the us tax system more competitive alternative policy responses and proposals proposed policy responses to inversions vary widely depending on what is viewed as their chief threat for example those that ar chiefly concerned about the revenue and tax equity results of inversions make little distinction between inversions loss of tax revenue from u s sourceincome on the one hand and foreignsource income on the other thei r proposals seek to reimpose us taxes on firms when inversions occu r in contrast others vi ew inversions as symptomatic of competitive burden imposed by the us tax system and have suggested more general reforms of the us method of taxing foreignsour ce income may be in order the 2002 treasury department report for example recommended more stringent treatment of us but not foreignsour ce income for example more effective measures of limiting earningsstripping and called for general reexamination of the us system of taxing foreign income httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs10 23 the inversion proposals were similar to t hose contained in the senatepassed version of the may 2003 taxcut bill jgtrra the jobs and growth tax relief and reconciliation act pl 10827 but which were not included in the conference committee billcongressional proposals the house and senate eti bills number of bills were introduced in the 108th congress that addressed inversions prominent among these were two broad business tax bills passed in 2004 by the senate and house s 1637 and hr 4520 respectively that had as primary focus the controversy over the us extraterritorial income exclusion eti ta x benefit for exporting both bills proposed to repeal the eti benefit and proposed variety of tax cuts both for domestic and overseas investment the bills contained many overlapping provisions but also contained differences including some in the area of inversi ons the differences between the bills were resolved in october by conference committee and the conference committee version of hr 4520 was enacted as the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 s 1637 senator grassley was approve d by the senate finance committee on october 1 2003 and included veral inversionrelated pr ovisions among variety of revenueraising proposals designed to offs et the cost of the bills investment tax benefits23 s 1637 proposed to impose two new tax regimes on inversions depending on ownership thresholds and on wh the inversions occurred under the first regime s 1637 would have taxed foreign parent corporation like domestic corporation if it passed continuityofownership threshold thus nullifying much of the tax benefit an inversion can generate the test woul d be met if at least 80 of the foreign corporation is owned by the former shareholders of domestic corporation or partnership that had transferred substantially all of its property to the foreign parent the threshold also required the foreign parent and its affiliates not have substantial business ac tivities in the country of incorporation and applied only to inversions that occur after march 20 2002 s 1637s second regime was based on 50 owne rship test and would potentially have applied whether the inve rsion occured before or after march 20 2002 the second set of rules would not apply however to postmarch 20 inversions subject to the bills first regime the second regime would act as type of toll tax on the shifting of the firms foreign subsidiaries from the former us parent to the new foreign parent the ta x would apply the highest corporate tax rate or the highest individual tax rate in the case of partnerships to stock received by the former domestic parent from the new fo reign parent in exchange for ownership of the firms foreign subsidiary corpora tions neither foreig n tax credits nor net operating losses would be permitted to offset the tax an additional provision of s 1637 proposed to impose an excise tax on stock options related to inversions thus addr essing an area in which the interests of corporate officers with respect to i nversions might diverge from those of stockholders see the discussion of capita l gains taxes at the shareholder level above on pages 67 under the provision officers directors and 10 owners ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs11 inverted firms would be subj ect to 20 excise tax on compensation that is directly linked to the value of an inverting cor porations stock such compensation would include stock certain stock options gener ally nonqualified stock options and other stockbased compensation for stock options the tax would apply to the value of the option at the time of the inversion deter mined by an optionpricing model specified by the treasury department the excise tax would apply however only when the inversion in question triggers recognition of shareholderlevel capital gains the bill also contained provisions that would extend current laws earningsstripping restrictions on the deductibility of interest paid to related corporations see pages 56 above to partnerships and s corporations the restric tions currently apply only to corporations according to estimates by the joint committee on taxation s 1637s inversion provisions would have increased tax reve nue by 26 billion over 10 years the house passed hr 4520 represent ative thomas on june 17 2004 like s 1637 hr 4520 included more stringent tr eatment of inversi ons in conjunction with broad set of unrelated provisions th at would repeal eti while enacting other investment tax benefits the house bills inversion provisions however were generally narrower than those of the senate bill note however that temporary inversion provision comparable in scope to that of s 1637 was included in hr 6 the housepassed energy bill as described below under current law the transfer of foreign subsidiaries or ot her assets from us parent corporation to new foreign parent corporation may give rise to corporatelevel tax sometimes referred to as toll charges under several different tax c ode provisions however tax attributes such as foreign tax credits or net operating losses if available may offset the tax hr 4520 proposed to deny the applicability of tax attributes in the case of inversions like the senate bill the house bill contained provision that applied an excise tax on stock options related to inverted corporations the applicable rate of the tax however would be 15 rather th 20 rate imposed by s 1637 unlike s 1637 the housepassed bill did not contain restrictions on interest deductions aimed at

earlier house or senate bills and provided that the prohibition can be waived in the interests of homeland security to prevent the loss of jobs or to prevent th government from incurring higher costs in the 108th congress the senate returned to the procurement restrictions issue on january 23 2003 the senate approved an omnibus appropriations bill hjres 2 that would tighten the enacted waiver conditions by making waiver of the contracting restrictions possible only if the secretary of homeland security certifies that it is essential to nati onal security the provision was included in

to inversions occurring up to approximately year earlier than the effective date specified by ajca as described above ajcas provisions apply to inversions occurring after march 4 2003 with some modifications the senate measure also applied the ajca provisions to inversions occurring after march 20 2002 the modifications were apparently signed to limit the retroactivity of the expanded date under their terms the tax regime that ajca applied to 80 inversions treatment of the new offshor parent as domestic corporation do not apply until the first year af ter tax years beginning in 2006 other approaches an approach to inversions that is similar to those contained in the legislative proposals would modify the antideferral regimes contained in subpart f or the pfic provisions these proposals have not however been introduced as legislation as with the legislative proposals these suggestions would identify reorganizations that qualify as inversions and apply their ta x rules in such situations the subpart f or pfic rules would be modified so that the stockholders of foreignchartered inverted parent corporations would be subject to us tax on at least some of its foreign income24 in contrast to the proposals that w ould apply only when inversions occur another suggested approach would modify th tax codes concept of residence such an approach would be more fundamental and might be viewed as treating the cause rather than the symptoms one analyst has pointed out that the residence test applied by the british tax system looks beyond the place of incorporation and generally establishes firms residence as the country from which the firm is centrally managed and controlled such system would appear to avoid some potential administrative problems inherent in attempting to identify inversions by means of thresholds as do the legislative proposals on the other hand the british system has apparently encountered difficulties in identifying the substantive location of management and control control can in so cases be estab lished in tax havens simply by conducting pro forma board meetings there25 the may 2002 treasury report the treasury departments may

office of tax policy corporate inversion transactions tax policy implications may 2002 p 21 27 ibid pp 2125 28 ibid p 26 29 two examples of countries with territo rial systems are france and the netherlands 30 ibid p 19 31 ibid p 2 us tax base consisting of ussource income that the current tax system may give foreigncontrolled firms competitive advantage and that inversions reduce confidence in the fairness of the tax system26 the treasury department report noted that earnings stripping is not confined to inversions but can occur within foreignc ontrolled groups in general the reports concern with the practice was reflected in number of proposals aimed at restraining the practice as described above the ta x code already places limitations on interest deductions when certain thresholds are exceeded the treasury concluded that the prevalent use of foreign rela tedparty debt in inversion transactions is evidence that these rules should be revisited the repor t listed number of specific ways the rules could be tightened27 the report also suggested that further work is needed in incomeshifting areas apart from relatedparty debt specifically the tax systems transfer pricing rules in the area of intangible assets28 as with earnings stripping the treasury reports concern for competitiveness was broader than just inversions the re port viewed inversions as being one aspect of more general result of the us tax sy stem the reports analysis concluded that the us system places uscontrolled nd headquartered firms in general at disadvantage relative to fore igncontrolled firms disa dvantage that is believed to occur because the united states taxes the wo rldwide income of its corporations while some foreign countries use territorial systems that exempt foreign income29 the report viewed not only inversions but growing number of acquisitions of us firms by foreign companies as possi ble symptoms of the disadvantage30 as result of its concern for competitiv eness the treasury report stopped short of proposals that would negate the tax sa vings on foreignsource as well as domestic source income contrast with bills liste d above instead the report stated the policy response to the recent corporate inversion activity should be broad enough to address the underlying differenc in the tax treatment of usbased companies and foreignbasedcompanies without regard to how foreignbased status is achieved measures designed simply to halt inversion activity may address these transactions in the short run but there is serious risk that measures targeted too narrowly would have the unintended effect of encouraging shift to other forms of transactions to the detriment of the us economy in the long run31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31444crs15 32 ibid p 29 33 however an inversion exempts all foreign income from us tax including income from passive investment some territorial tax proposals would only exempt income from active business operationsas more general response the repor t recommended evaluating the merits of exempting foreignsource business income and reevaluating th usefulness of the antideferral regimes and limitations on the foreign tax credit32 the report was generally confined to describing the current legal framework and presenting policy options it does not pres ent rigorous economic analysis of inversions or the broader impact of us taxes in the international context with its focus however on protecting the domestic ra ther than foreign us tax base and its concern with competitiveness the reports perspective appeared more closely akin to the capital import neutrality perspective described above conclusion the apparent recent increase in corporat inversions has aroused concern in its own right the spectacle of us corporations engaging in expatriation in tax saving technique not available to most indi vidual taxpayers may in the words of the treasury department reduce confidence in the fairness of the tax system but inversions can be viewed in broader c ontext recent tax policy debate has tended to focus on the international economy sparked in part by the european unions successful challenge of the us foreign sales corporation expor t tax benefit and in part by the perceived new challenges posed by an increasingly integrated world economy some observers and policymakers have suggested that the time is right to consider fundamental reform of the us tax system one appro ach might be to adopt territorial tax system under which the ited states would exempt foreign business income from tax inversions present many of the same policy issues as would be presented by adoption of territorial system the end result of an inversion after all is the exemption from us tax of firms foreign income33 accordingly the debate over the respective merits of capital import neutrality and capital export neutrality occur in much the same manner over inversions as they occur in debate over territoriality and the administrative problems inversions present in protecting the us domestic tax base the problems presented by earnings stripping and income shifting transactions would be presented by terr itorial tax system thus if the question of adopting territorial tax system moves to the fore of the tax policy debate the debate over inversions ma have provided preview
