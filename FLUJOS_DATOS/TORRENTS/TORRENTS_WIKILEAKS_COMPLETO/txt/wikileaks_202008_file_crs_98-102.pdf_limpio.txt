ct 1573 1580 1997below federal law precludes judi cial review of final deter mination that is subject to panel request and of itc or doc actions taken in res ponse to panel or ecc decision5 constitutional questions regarding chapter 19 panels when first proposed under the cfta the panel system was viewed by some as problematic under the appoi ntments clause article iii and the due process clause of the us constitution6 the appointments clause art ii sec 2 cl 2 requires that officers be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate but allows congress to vest the appoi ntment of inferior officers in the president the courts or heads of departments it was argued that panelists should be cons idered federal officers within the buckley v valeo definition that is individuals exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states 424 us 1 126 1976 and as such must be appointed pursuant to the clause7 the clause would arguably be violated because neither us panelists argued to be principal officers nor canadian panelists would be appointed by the president with respect to article iii which vests the judicial power of the united states in one supreme court nd in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time establish it was argued that since matters that would come before the panel were then heard before the court of international trade an article iii court congress could not direct that they be heard before lesser tribunal moreover separation of powers principles arguably prevented congress from eliminating all judicial review for the cases involved even if j udicial review could be limited however it was contended that due process ma ndated that party have meaningful hearing at minimum and the right to assert at least facial constitutional challenge to the panel system most constitutional scholars who had exa mined the proposed cfta panel system agreed however that the process appeared to be constitutionally sound it was argued inter alia that panelists would be pplying federal law as incorporated in an international agreement and thus would not be officers exercising authority

cfta implementing legislation could be viewed as an expression of combined executive and legislative foreign affairs powers it would thus be granted considerable judicial deference8 despite this general consensus differences of opinion as to whether the due process clause allowed eliminating all judicial review led congress to provide for challenges to ad and cvd determinations on the ground

llenged the cons titutiona lity of the statutory exhaustion provision acct conceded that it had not fulfilled the requirement but maintained that it had standing to bring the suit under article iii of the us cons titution the court of appeals dismissed the suit nove mber 14 1997 holding that the plaintiff did not meet constitutional standing requirements and had failed to meet statutory jurisdictional requireme nts whose constitutionality it also upheld14 in the courts view the plaintiff had faile d to meet required element of article iii standing set forth by the supreme court in defenders of wildlife v lujan namely establishing causal connection between the injury and the complainedof conduct15 the plaintiff also fell short of the standing test for organizations which allows an entity to sue on behalf of its members only if the latter are eligible to do so in their own right16 the court noted that acct had not participated in panel proceeding nor had it identified specific instances in which either panel proceeding or the system itself had injured an acct member the court found that plai ntiffs generalized statement that acct members had suffered naftare lated job losses was inade quate for these purposes the court also rejected plaintiffs strategy of asserting article iii standing to challenge the constitutionality of the panels and the exhaustion requirement itself article iii sets the maximum boundaries of permissible standing but does not preclude congress from creatin g additional statutory exhaustion requirements to be sure statute th at totally precluded j udicial review for constitutional claims would certainly raise serious due process concerns along the same lines there may well be limits to how severely congress can restrict the

establishes reasona ble requirements that ensure that plaintiffs have concrete stake in the proceedings and have exhausted their administrative remedies before they may challenge the constitutionality of the binational panel review system indeed section 1516ag4cs exhausti on requirement is so typical that striking it down as unconstitutional could render substantial portion of the united states code open to constitutional attack many agency adjudication schemes require petitioners to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing their constitutional claims to article iii courts17 conclusion the court of appeals noted that the plaintiff may still locate party who has constitutional standing and thus pursue its constitutional concerns in the future18 even were case to be successful however court decision may have only limited effect for the particular plaintiff involved were c ourt to hold the proce ss to be unconstitutional the president may use statutory authority
