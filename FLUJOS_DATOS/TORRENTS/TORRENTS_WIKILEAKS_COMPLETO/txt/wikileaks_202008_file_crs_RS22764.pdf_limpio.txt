related to royalties from federal offshore oil and gas production adam vann legislative attorney american law division summary on october 30 2007 the us district court for the western dist rict of louisiana issued ruling in kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred that rebuffed efforts of the us department of the inte rior to collect royalties from offshore oil and gas production leases based on socalled price thresholds for previously granted royalty relief1 there has been considerable interest in the impact of this ruling on ongoing congressional efforts related to certain missing royalty payment requirements in leases issued by the minerals management service of the us department of the interior mms in 1998 and 1999 including the proposed royalty re lief for american consumers act of 2007 as found at sections 75017505 of hr 3221 th house of representatives passed hr 3221 on august 4 2007 this report 1 provides background on the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act

water royalty relief act and the 19981999 leases most federal offshore oil nd gas production leases contain royalty provisions that require the lessee to pay certain percentage of revenue on the value of oil and natural gas production to the federal government as the lessor in 1995 congress passed the dwrra4 which provides an incentive for explora tion of oil and natu ral gas reserves in deep water which might otherwise be uneconomic by providing that certain initial volume of production from deep water wells w ould be exempt from royalty obligations section 302 of the dwrra provides mechan ism by which holders of existing leases can apply for royalty relief which is to be granted by the secretary of the interior if the lease would otherwise be uneconomic howe ver section 302 also provides that these lessees will not be eligible for royalty relief if the price of oil or natural gas exceeds certain threshold level while section 302 of the dwrra addresses royalty relief for holders of leases in existence at the time of the enactment of the act sections 303 and 304 address post enactment lease sales secti on 303 amends the bidding system to allow interior to offer leases going forward with royalty relief at the discretion of the department while section 304 carves out an exception to that royalty paym ent requirement for d eep water leases that were entered into within five years of the date of enactment of the dwrra pursuant to section 304 the standard royalty requirement is to be suspe nded for lessees holding these leases until certain volume of oil or natu ral gas is produced by the lessee the volumetric limitation on royalty relief varies based on the water depth of the leased tract once the volumetric threshold is exceeded lessee may be required to make royalty payments section 304 sets statutory min imum for the volumetric threshold for royalty relief the secretary of the interior is authorized to grant higher volumetric threshold at his or her discretion in 1998 and 1999 mms issued deepwater offs hore leases that were eligible for royalty suspension but did not include pricebased limitation on that eligibility as result holders of these 1998 and 1999 deepwa ter leases have obligations to make royalty payments up to the suspension volumes regardless of the market price of oil or natural gas the leases do not contai n price threshold on royalty relief the royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 on august 4 2007 the house passed hr 3221 included in this omnibus energy bill is the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 20075 one section of this proposed act bars th secretary of the interior from issuing any new leases to holders of covered leases unless said leas eholders either rene gotiate their covered leases to include price thres holds or pay conservation of resources fee as established in the proposed act6 the statute defines covered lease as lease for oil or gas production in the gulf of mexico that is i

santa fe snyder corp v norton 385 f 3d 884 5th cir 2004subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market prices that are equal to or less than the price thresholds described in the dwrra7 any holder of covered lease is forced to decide between three options 1 the less ee can keep the lease under its current terms ie without price threshold and lose the right to bid on future offshore lease sales in the gulf of mexico 2 the lessee can pay newly created conservation of resources fee as established elsewhere in the proposed act or 3 the lessee can renegotiate the covered lease to include royalty relief price thresholds many observers interpret the proposed act as legislative attempt to co rrect the perceived oversight in the 19981999 leases that lack price thresholds8 kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred around the same time that the perceive d oversight in the 1998 and 1999 leases described above was brought to the publics attention kerrmcgee oil gas corp kerrmcgee9 initiated litigation that challenged the authority of the department of the interior to impose price thresholds on leases sold between 1996 nd 2000 ie the effective period of section 304 of the dw rra according to kerrmcgee section 304 of the dwrra which addresses lease sales during the fiveyear period between 1996 and 2000 barred the inclusion of royalty relie f price thresholds to these leases and therefore the collection of royalties resu lting from the imposition of price thresholds contradicted section 304 of the dwrra10 kerrmcgee brought its claim in the us district court for the western district of louisiana after the us department of the interior issued an order directing kerrm cgee to pay royalties on oil and natural gas produced in 2003 and 2004 under eight leases operated by ke rrmcgee under the dwrra11 on october 30 2007 the court issued ruling that essentia lly confirmed kerr mcgees position and found that an order issued by the department of the interior directing kerrmcgee to pay royalties based on price threshold was in error the court based its ruling on decision issued by the u s court of appeals for the fifth circuit in 2004 that interpreted the releva nt sections of the dwrra12 according to the court the fifth circuit interpreted sections 303 and 304 of the dwrra as they pertain to new production requirements for mandatory royalty relief leases section 303 added new bidding system that gave the interior the authority to lease any water depth inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764crs4 13 kerrmcgee oil gas corp v allred 206cv0439 slip op at 78 wd october 30 2007 memorandum ruling 14 id at 89 15 id at 9 16 one concern that has been raised is whether the courts ruling if upheld on appeal would impact the authority of the department of th interior to renegotiate the covered leases because section 7504 if enacted would represent new congressional grant of authority to an administrative agency this authority would likely supercede any perceived limitations of authority under existing statutes however in order to avoid confusion on the matter congress might be well served to explicitly state that th is new authority supercedes any limitations on the department of the interiors authority with re spect to negotiating the terms of the covered leases that were previously in effect 17 hr 3221 at section 7504 18 section 204 of hr 6 as passed by the h ouse on january 18 2007 contained substantially similar provision the senatepassed version of hr 6 does not contai n similar provisionany location with royalty relief fashioned ac cording to the interiors discretion the fifth circuit found that this power however was tempered by the next section where congress replaced the interiors discre tion to fashion royalty relief with fixed royalty suspension scheme based on volume and water depth thus the royalty relief for mandatory royalty relief leases is automatic and unconditional13 based on the fifth circuits previous ruling the district court found that section 304 mandates royalty relief up to certain minimum volume of production regardless of the market price of oil or natural gas14 therefore the court c oncluded that the department of the interior had exceeded its congressional authority when it sought to collect royalties on kerrmcgees oil and gas pr oduction that did not ex ceed these volumetric minimums regardless of whether the oil and gas produced could be sold at prices in excess of the price thresholds for royalty relief that had been included in the lease terms15 the impact of the kerrmcgee ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 since the kerrmcgee ruling was issued on october 30 2007 there has been extensive congressional interest in the impact of the ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 as descri bed above specifically there is confusion as to how the ruling might affect the rest rictions that section 7504 seeks to impose on holders of covered leases as discusse d above section 7504 requi res that persons who hold covered leases either 1 renegotiate their leases to include price thresholds16 2 pay conservation of resources fee as set forth in the section or 3 forfeit eligibility for future oil or gas production leases in the gulf of mexico17 section 7504 and the legislative efforts that preceded it18 have generally been described as efforts to remedy perceive d error or oversight in the 1998 and 1999 deep water leases by forcing renegotiation of those leases to include royalty relief price thresholds or by using the conservation of resources fee structure to recover from these leaseholders amounts that had previously b een calculated to be roughly the same amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22764crs5 19 the conservation of resources fee is set in the bill at 9 per barrel of oil and 125 per million btu of natural gas both in 2005 dollars for all production years in which the price threshold is exceeded 20 hr 3221 section 7504d1as would be owed if price thresholds had been in place19 the recent ruling by the us district court for the western district of louisiana if uphe ld would effectively eliminate the distinction between the 1998 and 1999 deep water leases which do not include price thresholds and the 1996 1997 and 2000 deep water leases which contain price thresholds that are not enforceable because they are in violation of congressional intent in enacting section 304 of the dwrra if none of the leases issued pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra contains royalty relief provisions that are subject to price thresholds then it appears that all of these leases ie all deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000 would be covered leases as that term is defined in th proposed act as noted above section 7504d1 defines covered lease as lease for oil or gas producti on in the gulf of mexico that is issued by the department of the in terior under section 304 of the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act nd not subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market prices that are equal to or less th an the price thresholds described in the dwrra20 it is important to note that the definition of covered leases is not restricted to leases without price thresholds in their terms or any other definition that would be contingent upon the language in the leases if this were the case then only the 1998 and 1999 leases would be covered leases because the 1996 1997 and 2000 leases contain price threshold language however the definiti on of covered leases in section 7504d1 encompasses any lease that is not subject to limitations on royalty relief based on oil or natural gas market prices thus if the west ern district of louisiana decision is affirmed on appeal then it appears that none of the leases issued between 1996 and 2000 would be subject to limitations on royalty relief based on market price and thus all of these leases may be covered leases under the proposed act as result any entity that holds deep water lease issued between 1996 and 2000 may be ineligible for future oil or natural gas production leases in the gulf of mexico pur suant to section 7504a of the proposed act until that entity either renegotiates the lease in question or pays conservation of resources fee if congress does wish to encourage recovery of royalties on all leases issued pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra be tween 1996 and 2000 that are limited by both price and volumetric thresholds it could likely do so by passage of the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 as it is currently worded in sections 7501 7505 of hr 3221 this option could affect mo st companies operating in the deep water ocs area if congress wishes to restrict the scope of the proposed act to the 1998 and 1999 leases that did not cont ain price thresholds it might consider amending the definition of covered lease accordingly
