decade international flows of capital have skyrocketed international flows in dollars for instance now total over 19 trillion per day or nearly as much as the total annual amount of us exports and imports of goods and services these flows are the prime mover behind exchange rates nd global flows of goods and services one part of these flows is foreign direct inve stment or investment in businesses and real estate on cumulative basis direct inve stment now totals ove r 10 trillion worldwide about 20 of which is associated with the ove rseas investment of u s firms the largest share held by the firms of any nation this type of investment spans all countries industrial sectors industries and economic activitie s and has become major conduit for goods capital and chnology between the developed and the developing economies foreign direct investment has become much needed source of funds for capital formation in developing countries and fore ign investment accounts for important shares of employment sales in come and rd spending in developing countries1 the united states is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment and is the largest overseas investor in the world ow

and overseas presence however often leads to clash of cultures nd values in addition conflicts are rising within the united states and within other veloped countries over what role these global corporations should play in their respectiv home countries and over whose interests the corporations should serve traditionally cor porations have served the economic interests of narrow group of shareholders by maximiz ing the return to the shareholders or by maximizing the overall profits of the firm now broader group of stakeholders including customers employees financiers suppliers communities and society at large is pressing for comprehensive codes of conduct that recognize their interests defining codes of conduct is difficult b ecause such codes encompass broad range of issues and myriad types of official and corporate activities that have defied attempts to reach common agreement on the compositi on and nature of the codes one way to view codes of conduct is by grouping them into three main categories 1 externally generated codes of conduct that are developed by governments or international organizations 2 corporate codes of conduc t that represent an individual companies ethical standards and 3 industryspecific codes these categories often overlap and some codes that initially were adopted voluntarily by compan ies or industries have been incorporated into law by governments since congressional activities relate most specifically to the first type of codes or externally generated codes of conduct they receive the greatest emphasis in this report congress has periodically considered issues related to corporate code s of conduct in the 106th congress for instance the house considered measure hr 4596 that woul d have required us firms to adopt corporate code of conduct that covered wide range of workers rights and environmental issues similar to the set of model business practices the clinton administration proposed in march 19952 similarly the senate approved and the president signed on december 2 1999 the convention on child labor3 which addresses various issues related to children in the workforce4 the 106th congress also considered number of measures that addressed issues of child labor and the importation of goods produced with child sweatshop and prison labor in the 108th and 109th congresses congress considered various measures to prot ect children affected by poverty and natural disasters from trafficking and to protect ch ildren and minors from busive labor practices external codes of conduct since the 1970s public and private expecta tions of multinationa l corporate behavior have grown commensurate with the boom in foreign investment this change in expectations however has not resulted in cl earcut set of direc tions for governments or businesses to follow to velop codes of conduct at times purely voluntary codes have evolved into code s that were adopted as national legislation for instance in 1977 the united states adopted the sullivan princi ples and the foreign corrupt practices acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20803crs3 5 pl 95213 title i 91 stat 1494 december 19 1977 see also

initially the sullivan principles provided voluntary set of standards for firms to follow to pressure the apartheid govern ment of south africa to improve the living conditions of black workers their families and their communities in 1986 congress adopted the sullivan principles as law6 the fcpa followed series of congressional hearings and legal actions against numerous us corporations7 and specified legal standards and penalties that were meant to prevent us firms from bribing foreign officials in order to gain economic advantages while there appears to be general consensus in the united states and abroad that favors international standards governing cor porate businesses practices attempts to reach an agreement on specific standards have prove n to be less promising in some cases these efforts have fostered competition among countries for inves tment projects have highlighted the remaining differences in national policies regarding foreign investment and have created differences in the goals and objectives of nego tiations between the developed and the developing nations most developed economies favor international rules or codes of conduc t that could promote level playing field or an environment in which investment decisions are based solely on competitive market factors developing economies however often view ch efforts as attempts by the developed countries to promote rules and codes of c onduct that effectively allow them to hoard foreign investments for themselves and to deny the developing countries the means to compete internationally fo r new investment projects these and other differences have spurred nations and internati onal organizations to adopt various approaches in order to promot international rules on foreign investment one approach has been to negotiate legally binding agreements whether they are narrowly or broadly cast that impose set of standards on multinational firms and that bring large number of countries into compliance simultane ously for example after the united states adopted the fcpa it supported efforts with in the oecd to adopt the convention on bribery which focuses on narrow set of issues related to bribing public officials since the convention entered into fo rce on february 15 1999 34 countries8 including the united states9 have passed nationa l legislation impleme nting the convention similar approach that failed to gain agreement was comprehensive agreement on foreign investment known as the multilateral agreement on i nvestment mai the mai was expected to be broad legally binding multifaceted agreement that would have established an international set of rules on wide range of foreign investment issues support for the agreement eroded over the cour of the negotiations which focused on provisions that proved to be too divisive to resolve in addition citizen and consumer groups opposed the proposed agreement in part because they viewed it as too favorablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20803crs4 10 for additional information see crs report 98569 the multilateral agreement on investment brief analys is of the current status by james k jackson 11

be the social economic and political impact of the agreement10 in lieu of negotiating comp rehensive multilateral agreem ents many countries have resorted to adopting narrowly focused bilateral investment treaties that contain codes of conduct often these codes re semble general set of inve stmentrelated provisions and corporate best practices rather than gally binding agreement according to the united nations 174 countries d concluded about 2100 bilate ral investment treaties by 2001 nearly as many of these treaties were concluded among developing countries as between developed and developing countries11 often these treaties are accompanied by some form of codes of conduct that are negotiated to c over particular investment and tend to be highly specific to company project or location other agreements some nations have used other types of multilateral treaties to promote codes of conduct fo r multinational firms one ty pe of agreement attempts to bring greater conformity in the treatment of foreign investment by prescribing changes in national laws governing foreig n investment as one component of broader arrangement that is geared toward economic cooperation and integration such as the treaties that established the european community and the north american free trade agreement there are other legally nonbinding arrangem ents which cover only foreign investment the most prominent of which are the oecd c ode of liberalization of capital movements covering both longand short term capital movements and the code of liberalization of current invisible operations covering crossborder trade in services in addition the oecd has issued basic statement on foreign investment the declaration on international investment and multinational enterprises which is general statement of policy regarding the rights and responsibilitie s of foreign investors the world trade organization wto also supports the concept of common set of ru on international corporate investment as part of the 1994 uruguay round on mu ltilateral trade nego tiations the wto adopted the agreement on traderelated investment measures trims which recognized that certain investment measures restrict and distort trade required signatory countries to apply national tr eatment and required countries to provide framework for reducing restrictions on fore ign investment in 1996 the wto established working group on investment which has been studying the issue of investment rules including technical regulations and standards that govern trade and investment the doha declaration set out the goal of addressing foreign inves tment issues following the conclusion of the fifth minist erial in cancun in september 2003 so far these efforts have not succeeded in achieving the stated goal of devel oping multilateral framework to secure transparent stable and predic table conditions for longterm crossborder investment particularly fo reign direct

httpwwwworkersrightsorgcorporate and industryspecific codes of conduct broad range of factors are influencing firms to adopt code s of conduct some firms see it as enlightened selfinterest while others see it as necessary part of risk management13 corporate codes of conduct and industryspecifi c codes now exist in one form or another among most large multinational corporations and among most of the developed countries recent study by the oecd concluded that most corporate codes tend to be highly specific and to deal with the idiosyncracies of particular company project or location14 industryspecific corporate code s dealing with environment and labor issues appear to be the most common and most us manufacturers and retailers in the apparel industry have dopted corporate codes that prohibit using child sweatshop or prison labor us companies in such diverse industries as footwear personal care products photographic equipment and supplies stationary products hardware products restaurants and electronics and computers have adopted corporate codes of conduct multinational corporations generally support the concep t of codes of conduct that standardize rules of corporat behavior across broad rang of countries and industries while the motivation behind adopting corporat codes of conduct can be quite complex multinational firms generally dopt codes of conduct because th ey believe they represent good businesses practices generally multinational corporations desire national treatment as basis for any investment agreement but are concerned that standards negotiated in one agreement could be applied to their wo rldwide operations regardless of the disparity in economic conditions between locations local customs jurisprudence or differences in local business practices some firms also argue that codes which allow foreign groups to submit complaints to us regulatory bodi concerning the overseas operations of the subsidiaries of us firms could be used as competitive tool to damage the worldwide reputations of us firms industryspecific codes of conduct are as va ried and as extensive as the multitude of industries they cover labor and envir onmental issues however are the two most frequently covered areas in the codes regard less of industry nvironmental standards often comprise commitments from firms to be open to the concerns of the communities in which they locate the most common labor codes include commitments for firms to provide reasonable working environment provisions against discrimination and commitment to obey laws regarding child bor and compensation concerns over child and sweatshop labor in particul ar have spurred some public groups to take action on their own the workers rights coalition15 an alliance of 67 universities and colleges pressured nike and reebok to investigate allegations of sw eatshop labor conditions in mexican apparel factoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20803crs6 concerns of stakeholders while traditional economic theory holds that corporations strive to maximize their profits to benefit the stockho lders broad group of stake holders is pressing to have their interests represented as well these stakeholders argue that corporations have responsibilities beyond the narrow sc ope of their legal charters or that they should abide by social contract that reflects societys changing social and cultural mores the size of the group of stakeholders and the social responsibilities they expect vary with the size of the firm the industrial sector it is invo lved in and its products and operations this group of stakeholders and the associated soci responsibilities also become vastly larger for firms that operate in more than one country and can include issues beyond the common areas of workers rights environm ental concerns and business production or financing operations at times the issues soug ht by stakeholders in one country can clash with those sought by stakeholders in nother country for instance when workers in developed countries push for job security health care and other benefits and environmental issues while work ers in developing countries push for more local jobs and local managers worker training and educati on technology transfers and higher levels of local production issues for congress governments corporations and the public generally support the concept of corporate codes of conduct the complex ity of the issue and the dive rsity of foreign investments however make it difficult in practice to negotiate international agreements with legally binding codes of conduct and likely will present congress with at least two large competing groups of interests these groups basically represent the difference between economic efficiency as represented by corpor ations and equity or social justice as represented by broad coalition of soci and public groups generally economic analysis indicates that legally binding code s of conduct that eliminate marketdistorting activities promote market efficiency and thereby provide positive net benefits to consumers and to the economy as whole in most cases however there is mismatch between those who benefit from greater market efficiency and those who bare the costs of economic adjustment as result those who bare the highest costs are likely to be the most vocally opposed and to voice that oppositi on to congress whereas those who benefit are less likely to be motivated to express their support due to th perceived limited value of the benefits there is clear cut method for determinin g the most equitable distribution within the economy of the costs and benefits associat ed with international investment broad coalition of public and social groups increasingl have come to view negatively the global spread of economic activity and to argue that voluntary corporate codes of conduct accomplish little beyond narrow set of issues there is less agreement on how congress should proceed numerous bor and environmentrelated m easures that garner support within the united states are opposed abroad often by the very countries and groups the measures are intended to help moreover if consumer and labor groups grow uneasy about their own economic wellbe ing as result of slowdown in the rate of growth of the us economy they may well urge cong ress to adopt more restrictive measures concerning the labor and nvironmental impact associated with imports and foreign investment as means of pr otecting domestic us jobs
