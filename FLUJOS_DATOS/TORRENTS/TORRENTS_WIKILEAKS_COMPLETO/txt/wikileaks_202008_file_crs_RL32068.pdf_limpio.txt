iraq possibly as part of usled nato or force key european allies such as france and germany would first like to see new mandate that would include obj ectives such as timetable for turnover of authority to iraqis and transparent process for improving iraqs petroleum industry that the administration now oppos some european allies do not wish to serve under us command in iraq othe r european allies already have troops in iraq administration officials are concerned th at greater interna tional involvement in governing iraq could deflect the united states from achieving some of its stated goals for that countrys future such goals in clude establishing democracy there that would influence other middle eastern governments to follow similar course and easing of the arabisraeli conflict some europeans argue that these goals are unattainable in the framework established by the usled occupation at the same time involvement of european forces if common outlook could be worked out could free some us forces for other missions dampen international criticism of us management of iraq nd spread costs for reconstruc ting iraq to other countries and the private sector see also crs report

substantial role in broader context unresolved issues from earlier disputes among the allies also intrude in the debate over possibl nato involvement these issues include the causes of the war in iraq the role of the in nato outofarea operations the military capabilities of the allies and the effects of iraqs evolution on the middle east as whole in addition vestiges of dispute over allied assistance to turkey in february 2003 before the war with iraq remain cause for friction between the united states and several allies role for european forces this section will first briefly review the debate in nato over the last two years about allied missions outside europe it will then discuss several related issues primarily those generated by allied disagreement over the reasons for war with iraq that affect any possible decision by european governments to contribute forces to stabilize iraq there follows discussion of the evolution of the administrations position on its objectives for postwar iraq nd the necessary force levels to achieve those objectives the section closes with an examination of how many european forces might be available for iraq and the relation of force levels to costs the nato debate over outofarea operations nato members agreed in principle in 2002 that allied forces might be sent beyond europe to combat threats to member states security in may 2002 the allies agreed that to carry out the full range of its missions nato must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed sustain operations over distance and time

of isaf mask range of issues that must be resolved before the european allies might send troops to iraq some llied governments believe that the bush administration should have involved nat more closely in the conflict in afghanistan in late 2001 to build an in ternational political base for using military force against terrorism more narrow range of allied governments believes that the administration overrode their preference for allowing wmd inspections to run their course in iraq in late 2002 and 2003 that the administration pushed aside the as centerpiece for building an inte rnational coalition against the government of saddam hussein and that the administr ation went to war precipitately without establishing firm evidence of wmd in or qaeda links to iraq in february 2003 several llies resisted us effort to send nato forces to defend turkey in the event of an attack by iraq they opposed such move because they viewed it as an administration ma neuver to imply nato endorsement of the impending conflict with iraq these experiences have led the allies to demand greater share of decisionmaking and more authority for the in iraq before committing military forces to

these estimates do not cite democracy and influence on regional governments to develop representative institutions as goals of the occupation rather they generally cite stability as the key objective8 one defense analyst provides more sobering perspective noting that the us political as well as military strategy is deficient to bring stability to iraq in his view the united states lacks properly tr ained forces such as peacekeepers and military police for the job the essence of iraqs need is for civilian training for administrators and establishment of civil institutions but iraq is now being administered by the department of defens which is not prepared for such mission according to this view9 nato is providing measure of assistan ce in iraq to poland which has formed multinational force that became operational in part of its originally assigned sector september 3 natos north atlantic council decided on may 21 2003 to provide poland allied assets for force planning communications logistics and establishment of headquarters the operation is not technically nato operation poland leads contingent of 9000 troops from variet of countries some of which are not nato members from north of basra into the central part of the country the bombing of major mosque in najaf wh ich took the life of an important shiite cleric led the us government to delay polands takeover of that city which is in the polish sector for at least several weeks some observers while crediting warsaw with willingness to undertake dangerous mission believe that some of the forces are not trained to nato standards10 the united states will pay poland 250 million to cover primarily logistics and communication costs for its force on august 26 2003 nato saceur s upreme allied commander europe general james jones floated the idea that the polishled force might eventually be expanded and transformed into natoled force step that would require the approval of all allies11 how many european forces are available several factors c ould limit the availability of forces from nato countries several allies such as france italy britain and germany are already contributing to stability operations in bosnia kosovo the ivory coast and afghanistan nato secretary general ge orge robertson who favors nato force for iraq has said that maximum of 80000 troops from european nato countries might be available more realistic figure might be in the range of 4000050000 he said given nato governments ob ligations in current operations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32068crs5 12only 80000 nato tr oops available for

2003 interviews with oil company officials july 2003another key factor that could affect contributions from nato governments is the limited deployability and sustainability of most of their forces only britain and france have developed capability for deploying and sustaining forces some allies such as germany have large numbers of c onscripts that serve short periods in the armed forces such troops are not suita ble for serving in stabilization force12 forces stability and costs cost is also major factor in the ffort both to stabilize iraq and to involve allied governments there if forces sent to iraq could stabilize the country and allow the iraqis to rebuild their economy then an iraqi government could eventually assume more of the expense of rec onstruction over the long term current operational costs for us forces in iraq are approximately 4 billion per month reconstruction costs would be in add ition to this figure for fy2004 the administration has asked congress for 203 billion for iraqs reconstruction and another for 51 billion for military operations there13 before the war some administration officials had predicted iraq would stabilize quickly after the conflict nd have sufficient revenues to pay for its own rebuilding on march 27 2003 deputy defense secretary wolfowitz told congress that we are dealing with country that can really fi nance its own reconstr uction and relatively soon14 such situation might have produced an environment where functioning iraqi government could have borne more costs sold industrial assets to private investors in and outside ira q and contracted to pay priv ate companies to rebuild the country over time the world bank estimated in early october 2003 that iraq would need 36 billion through 2007 in addition to the 203 billion requested by the administration to rebuild iraqi oil re venues may reach an annual estimated figure of 14 bi llion in that period15 donors conference will be held in madrid on october 2324 where an estimate d 2 billion will be pledged european companies appear reluctant to enter iraq until stability returns and until government viewed as legitimate is put into pl ace international oil executives for example are openly doubtful of investing the 3040 billion estimated to be necessary to rebuild iraq s petroleum industry unless there is legitimate popularly backed g overnment in

backing for speedy ndover of power to iraqi people ft sept 4 2003a range of european views there is gulf between administration views and those of most allied governments on sending european forces to iraq there is also range of views among allied governments key european governments such as france and germany want strong role in iraq and new resolution to outline that role several important llies including france germany and turkey opposed the us decision to use force against iraq and instead favored continuing the wmd inspections there some nato govern ments do not want their forces to serve under us command especially under security council unsc resolution 1483 which gives the united states and brita in power as an occupying authority moreover most european governments have objectives that differ from those of the administration in general they do not belie ve that in the current context building democratic institutions in ir aq and making iraq model for peaceful representative government that will inspire peace in the region including settlement of the arab israeli conflict are attainable objectives they also place strong emphasis on multilateralism and wish to see the general stature of the united nations enhanced on the other hand some allie s particularly countries that joined nato recently support administration policy and wish to forge longterm strategic partnership with the united states administration officials had previously said that unsc 1483 was sufficient for introducing nato or broade r multinational force into iraq they continue to oppose any resolution that would dilute the coalition provisional authority cpa established by unsc 1483 as the occupying power or weaken us military authority deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz has said that new resolution would be acceptable provi ded it doesnt put limitations on what ambassador bremer the us official w ho heads the cpa and our people can do in iraq that are crucial for speeding up trans

of the country and is an occupying power under unsc 1483 at the same time britain has reportedly been more open to greater role in iraq than the administration and more rapid turnover of power to the

of views is evident in other countries the german government has said that it might send troops to iraq but that they would not serve under unsc 1483 because the resolution embodies the idea of an occupying power some german officials say however that berlin is mo re likely to seek involvement in civilian reconstruction rather than to supply forces such projects as assisting in institution building including court system or devel oping infrastructure such as water and oil pipelines might be attractive to germany norway has strong tradition of sending peacekeeping forces but its

internationaliza tion to be successful and affordable27 assessment the debate between the united states and some of its european allies over an enhanced european role in iraq pos range of problems with important implications the administration desires international troop contributions but on terms that do not dilute us political and military control over iraq administration officials wish to preserve prewar political objectives the democratization of iraq elimination of weapons of ma ss destruction and terrorist operations and residual moderating effect upon the rest of the ddle east including possible settlement of the arabisraeli conflict key europeans allies to some extent including britain seek an international force with strong voice some of these allies doubt and even disparage as unrealistic the administrations goals of democratic iraq and consequent moderation of middle eastern politics by these means they have openly doubted the existence of an active iraqi wmd program and any significant connection between the hussein regime and terrorists in broader perspective virtually all european allies wish to see international problems solved in multilateral framework and believe that the administration damaged this goal when it cut short inspections in iraq and went to war these governments wish to restore measure of credibility to the use of multilateral institutions in international affairs28 for these reasons some nato governments are hesitant to send their troops to operate under us leadership in iraq the conflicting positions of the bush administration and these allies on these points raises the question whether the administration would alter its position as compromise to obtain the 4500080000 european troops that might be available some allies such as poland and norway and most of the seven candidate states for nato membership support key elements of administration policy in iraq in part because they wish to forge an enduring st rategic partnership with the united states they do not believe that either the european union or the can provide for their own security although eu membership is vital interest for them

had bad experiences with french and british security guarantees before world war ii and the warsaw treaty or ganization was an alliance imposed upon central europe that was solely for the bene fit of

the current french government has aspirations to lead an eu that eventually develops military capability suitable at least to provide measure of defense fo r european countries president chirac advocates multipolar world with the european union acting as pole to balance us power few if any european g overnments have expre ssed enthusiasm about such french leadership and ideas and many have sharply opposed them beyond aspirations for such leadership france joined by germany has strong belief that tying themselves to us leadership in iraq augurs ill for their relations with future sovereign iraqi government29 and risks alienating broad range of arab states hostile to the us occupation frances call for p luralistic government in iraq is at least step removed from the us objective of democratic government frances position on this point is shared in most european capitals and is likely more acceptable to arab governments as well at the same time in france germany and other allied states there are influential voices that do not wish to see the united states fail to bring stability and at least measure of representative government to iraq several possible gains for european governments are apparent shoul d moderate iraq close to the united states emerge chastened iran more hesitant in the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and promotion of islamic radicalism an intimidated syria more cautious in its interference in regi onal affairs and support for rrorism and peace process free of an iraqi government adamantly opposed to settlement of arabisraeli differences failure of the us effort in iraq has potentially great negative consequences further disaffection with us leadership of nato renewal of radical islam in the middle east with regimes hostile to western governments and exacerbation of tensions in the arabisrae li peace process for these reasons these observers believe that european govern ments criticizing the united states should seek an accommodation over iraq with the bush administration30 wide range of european officials appears to be seeking compromise several options have been suggested such compromise might provide the united states with overall leadership of unapproved administration and military force in iraq but with individual allies in command of different geographic sectors as is the case for example in bosnia and kosovo it might contain elements of the french position particularly timetable for elections and establishment of an iraqi government chosen by the iraqi people or representatives of various groups in iraq in addition the compromise might include transparent ec onomic developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32068crs12 regime that provides companies from ra nge of countries access to contracts for reconstruction such compromise could fr ee us forces for availability elsewhere provide european and other government s with voice in iraqs future and legitimacy through imprimatur and shift part of the financial burden for reconstruction from the us government to other governments and to the international private sector key disadvantage for the bush administration might be the surrender of some of its political objectives in iraq such as the quest for democratic government that w ould be model for the region
