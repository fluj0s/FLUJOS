district of columbia contributes significantly to downwind nonattainment of the eighthour standard this result differs some from the proposed rule because of improved modeling epa decided in cair to create three missions caps two are annual emissions caps that address the interstate contribution of so2 and nox to pm25 nonattainment the third cap is seasonal cap to addre ss interstate contribution of nox to ozone nonattainment the three caps are implemented in two phases phase 1 begins in 2009 for the nox caps and 2010 for the so2 cap improved modeling and other considerations resulted in so changes in the final rule from the proposed iaq for example in cair epa added fueltype adjustment factor to the nox allocation formula that provides significantly more nox allowances to states that have coal fired electric generation compared with those with natural gasfired generation although changes to the proposed rule ma be important in specific cases they do not represent major shift in the thrust and scope of cair that cair has not had the visibility of the contemporaneous rcury hg rule shoul d not be interpreted to mean that the underlying issue of pm25 and eighthour ozone compliance has been solved epa is currently reviewing the stringency of the pm25 naaqs process that may result in more stringent standard given cairs lengthy schedule it seems likely that if the pm25 naaqs is strengthened efforts to revise cair would occur likewise cair does not address the most potent environmental issue surrounding fossilfuelfired electric generating facilities global warming and the possibility of carbon dioxide reductions movement on that issue over the next decade could result in modification of cair or new multipollutant control regime bills have been introduced in

downwind nonattainment for ozone cair finds that interstate transport of nox from 25 states and the district of columbia contributes significantly to downwind nonattainment of the eighthour standard to remedy the situation the rule ge nerally follows with some important exceptions the methodology ep employed in an earlier regulation that addressed interstate transport of oz one pollution the nox sip call3 in the nox sip call epa found 21 states and the district of co lumbia significantly contributed to nonattainment of th 1hour ozone naaqs4 to remedy the situation epa set statewide emissions budgets for nox missions and recommended that states achieve those budgets through highly cost effective controls on electric generators and large industrial facilities under regiona l capandtrade program states began implementing controls on may 31 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs2 5 published in the federal register on july 18 62 fr 3865238896 the standards became effective september 16 1997 with cair epa creates regional emissions caps for nox and so2 to be implemented in two phases 2010 2009 for nox and 2015 two caps annual so2 emissions and annual nox emissions pply to the region of 23 states and district of columbia found to contribute to pm25 nonattainment and one cap seasonal nox emissions applies to the region of 25 states and district of columbia found to contribute to eight hour ozone nonattainment the regional caps for the affected states are as follows so2 annual caps 36 million tons in 2010 and 25 million in 2015 nox annual caps 15 million tons in 2009 and 13 million in 2015 nox ozone season caps 580000 tons in 2009 and 480000 tons in 2015 based on methodology centered on reductions from electric generating fac ilities and adjusted for type of fossil fuel burned each affected state is assigned portion of the regional cap in the form of statewide emissions budget or cap each covered state is required to submit revised state implementation plan sip identifying measures it intends to implement to achieve its emissions budget states are free to choose whatever means they d eem appropriate subj ect to epa approval however epa strongly believes that the regional emissions caps can be most cost effectively achieved through regional cap andtrade programs focused on electric generators and strongly encourages that states choose that option model capand trade scheme for states to adopt is incl uded in the final rule that model scheme achieves states emissions budget throug h emission limitations solely on electric generating units background why did epa do it in 1997 epa finalized new naaqs for both pm25 and ozone5 the new naaqs for ozone re vised the previous ozone naaqs by tightening the standard from 012 parts per million ppm to 008 ppm increasing the averaging time from one hour to eight hours and measuring compliance by averaging concentrations rather than by counting individual peak concentrations exceeding the standard the new pm25 naaqs was set at an annual maximu m concentration of 15 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 based on the threeyear aver age of annual arithmetic mean pm25 concentrations from one or more co mmunityoriented monitors and 24hour concentration of 65 µgm3 based on the threeyear average of the 98th percentile of 24hour pm25 concentrations at each populationor iented monitor within an area epa has taken cautious approach to implementing the two naaqs attempts to coordinate the new eigh thour ozone standard with the previous 1hour standard proved difficult and subject to consider able litigation in the case of the pm25 standard comprehensive monitoring data were unavailable in 1997 to determinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs3 6 transportation equity act for the 21st century pl

the designations in 20042005 epa issued designations on attainment and nona ttainment for the eighthour ozone naaqs and the pm25 naaqs for pm25 epa analysis indicates violations of the naaqs over the eastern part of the united states and parts of california and montana specifically da ta show 39 nonattainme nt areas covering all or part of 224 coun ties in 20 states either fail to meet the standard or cause downwind county to fail all or part of 208 counties violate th annual standard few violate both the annual and the 24hour standard none violate only the 24hour standard the population of th affected counties is 90 million7 for the eighthour ozone naaqs epa analysis indicates wide spread violations of the naaqs over the eastern and midwestern united states calif ornia and texas along with scattered areas in louisiana arizona and colorado specifically data show 126 nonattainment areas covering ll or part of 474 counties in 31 states violate the eight hour ozone standard the population of the affected counties is 159 million8 the 1997 eighthour ozone and pm25 naaqs set in motion the clean air acts caa sip process under section 110 th promulgation of the revised ozone naaqs and the new pm25 naaqs meant that the sips of many states were longer adequate to bring those states into compliance by the statutory deadline under section 110k5 if epa finds si p inadequate it must require the affected state to submit revised sip that includes sufficient measures to bring that state into compliance this is known as sip call in the case of the eighthour ozone and the pm25 naaqs the process of developing effective compliance strategies is complicated by the problem of transported air pollutants under secti on 110a2d sips must include adequate provisions to prevent sources within that state from contributing significantly to nonattainment in one or more downwind states finding th at interstate transport of so2 and nox contributes significantly to ozone and pm25 nonattainment the epa issued the proposed interstate air qua lity rule iaq in december 2003 to mitigate the problem this rule was finalized as the clean air interstate rule cair in march 2005 combining the requirements of the caa with epa intentions as stated in the rule the major milestones for impleme nting the eighthour ozone and pm25 naaqs are set out in table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs4 9 section 110 requires submission of sips to attain naaqs including transport provisions within three years after promulgation of naaqs section 172b requires submission of sips in response to nonattainment designati on within three years of the designation epa argues this sequence indicates the priority gi ven to the transport sips over the nonattainment

sips before the naaqs nonattainment sips are required epa justifies the submission of transported air pollutant sips by upwind states before the submission of nonattainment sips by downwind states on the basis of section 110a12 and section 172b of the clean air act and on policy considerations9 epa argues that the upwind reductions will facilitate planning by downwind states and that downwind states will benefit from the relatively ear ly reductions because they themselves contribute to nonattainment elsewherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs5 10 section 110k5 provides for epa to issue sip call if existing sips are determined to be substantially inadequate to attain or ma intain naaqs or m itigate interstate pollutant transport as described in sections 176a inv olving interstate transport commissions or 184 involving control of interstate ozone air po llution section 110a2d requires states to submit sips to the epa that contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions of any

district of colu mbias emissions were combined with those of maryland clean air interstate rule p 25249 13 clean air interstate rule p 25247 14 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4608 how did epa come up with all its determinations cair is based on series of determinations by epa with respect to pollution transport costeffective pollution control and compliance feasibility these determinations are made within the sip process of sections 110k5 and 110a2d 10 significant contribution the pivotal finding by epa in the rule is that affected states sign ificantly contribute to nonattainme nt in downwind states this determination defines the geographic scope of the rule for states in the eastern united states epa conducted series of m odeling runs to determine the contribution various upwind states are projected to make to areas in the eastern united states projected by epa to be in nonattainment in 2010 and 2015 for ozone nonattainment significant contribution was defined by epa as the product of three factors 1 actual amount of tr ansported pollution from upwind states that contribute to nonattainment in downwind st ates 2 how often contributions over specific thresholds occur and 3 the comparative amount of the upwind transported contribution to the total nonattainme nt situation in the downwind area11 for the eighthour ozone naaqs epa modeled the missions impact of the 31 states east of or bordering the mississippi river on 40 eastern downwind counties projected by epa to be in noncomp liance in 2010 states whose maximum contribution was estimated at less than 2 parts per billion ppb andor that contribute less than 1 to total nonattainment were screened out after evaluatin g the remaining eastern states on the three criteria above on 40 eastern downwind counties 25 states and the district of columbia were found to make significant contribution to nonattainment12 these states constitute the region covered under cair seasonal nox cap and are shown in table 2 for the pm25 naaqs epa modeled the emissions impacts of 37 eastern states on 62 eastern downwind counties projected by epa to be in noncompliance in 201013 because the controlling pm25 naaqs is the annual standard epa considered only two of the three factors lis ted for ozone in determining significant contribution actual amount and comparative amount14 in the proposed rule epa suggested that the threshold for deter mining significant contribution be 015 µgm3 1 of the annual standard of 15 µgm3 in the final rule epa settled on 02 µgm3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs6 15 clean air interstate rule p 25246as the threshold15 based on that threshold epa found 23 states and the district of columbia were projected to contribute significantly to 2010 pm25 nonattainment these states constitute

which it determined that interstate transport of pollution is not significant contribut or to nonattainment in states such as california arizona or montana the proposed rule simply stated in analyzing significant contribution to nonattainment we determined it was reasonable to exclude the western us including the stat of washington idaho oregon california ne vada utah and arizona from further analysis due to geography meteorology and topography based on these factors we concluded that the pm25 and eighthour ozone nonattainment problems are not likely to be affected significantly by pollution transported across these states boundaries therefore for the purpose of assessing states contributions to nonattainment in other states we have only analyzed the nonattainment counties located in the rest of the us16 the rule provides other specific basis for epas determination that western nonattainment areas should not be subject to the rigorous modeling eastern nonattainment areas were none of the extensive modeling conducted for nonattainment areas in the eastern ited states was c onducted on nona ttainment areas in the western united states regional capstate budget with determination of significant contribution cair moves towa rd developing costeffec tive remedy maintaining the need to base its remedy on highly costeffective reductions epa examined the potential balance of local control to interstate controls along with the availability and timing of costeffective pollution control measures in upwind states projecting nonattainment areas in 2010 epa concluded in the proposed rule that for many pm25 nonattainment areas it would be difficult if not impossible to reach attainment unless transport is reduced to much greater degree and over much broader regional area than by the simultaneous adoption of local contro ls within specific nonattainment areas in addition we found that much of the air quality improvement that did occur

this st rategy was due to reductions in transported sulfate attributable to upwind so2 emissions17 epa conclusions with respect to eight hour oz one nonattainment areas were less dramatic but still significant enough for epa to conclude that further regional reductions were warranted18 calling for combination of local and interstate transport control epa developed criteria for determining highly costeffective transport control levels so2 and nox are emitted by variety of s ources sulfur dioxide is primarily emitted by stationary sources particularly coalfire d electric generators 69 of the total in 2003 and industrial combustion 14 of the total in 200319 in the case of nitrogen oxides mobile sources are the primary source although stationary sources particularly electric generators 22 of the total in 2003 and industrial combustion 14 of the total in 2003 make substantial contributi ons to the overall totals generally arguing that electric generators provided the most costeffective emission reduction source and that data were lacking on other sta tionary sources epa focused on reductions from electric generators to dete rmine emission caps in contrast for the nox sip call large industrial combustion sources were included in epas cost effectiveness calculations focusing on electric generators 25 mega watts mw or greater epa developed threshold for controlling transported pollutants by comparing the average and marginal costs of other so2 and nox regulatory actions along with other factors specifically epa compared the average and marginal costs of installing fluegas desulfurization fgd and selective cat alytic reduction s cr technologies on electric generators with the average and marginal costs of other regulatory actions including best available control technol ogy bact determinations individual state actions new source performance standards nsps and various mobile source decisions finding the elect ric generating control technol ogies to be highly cost effective epa determined the final regionwide caps for affected states by assuming these control technologies we re installed on electric gene rators the projected cost per ton removed is shown in table 3 based on the assumption that states would solely target electric generators for control epa proceeded to determine the appropriate individual statewide emission budgets as noted earlier under the sip process states are not required to adopt electricgeneratoronly strategy in complying with its emissions budget however they must if they choose to participan t in the epasponsored regional trading program set up under the model rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs9 table 3 projected control costs for electric generators under cair 1999 ton removed 2010 2009 for nox average cost2010

as noted above epa decided in its fina l rule to create three emissions caps two are annual emissions caps that addr ess the interstate contribution of so2 and nox to pm25 nonattainment the third is seasonal cap to address interstate nox contribution to ozone nonattainment each of these caps and their accompanying model trading schemes has to be integrated into the existing multilayered fabric of the clean air act caa as discussed below each cap faced unique problems in meshing with the caa reducing pm25 the so2 and nox annual caps reducing pm25 is yearround problem unlike ozone which is seasonal problem overwhelmingly nonattainment areas are in noncompliance with the annual pm25 naaqs not the 24hour standard thus the two caps are averaged on an annual basis an averaging time that provides maximum flexibility and potential costsavings to polluters so2 annual cap unlike annual nox emissions annual so2 emissions are already controlled to some degree by an existing statutory capandtrade program title iv of the caa indeed it is the success of the title iv program that has encouraged the development of other ma rketoriented programs including the nox sip call and cair title iv of the 1990 caa amendments required the reduction of so2 emissions from electric generators from about 15 million tons in 1988 to 895 million tons by january 1 2000 in add ition it mandates that the 895 million ton cap be maintained into the future requiring new so2 emitting utility plants to offsethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs10 20 clean air interstate rule p 25229their emissions with further reductions from existing facilities to implement the program title iv created comprehensive permit and emissions allowance system an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so2 during or after specific year issued by epa the allowances are allocated to existing power plants according to formulas provided in title iv the utility receives the allowances for given plant regardless of the actual operation of the pl ant for example utility may choose to shut down an existing power plant and use t hose allowances to offset emissions from two or more newer cleaner facilities generally power plant that commenced operation after enactment receives allowa nces requiring it to obtain allowances from the existing pool of allowances in order to operate utility may trade allowances nationally as well as bank allowances fo r future use or sale developing new regional capandtrade so2 program raised several issues with respect to the statutory nationwide so2 capandtrade program created under title iv among the issues epa had to re solve were 1 allocation of state budgets 2 treatment of excess title iv allowances by the more stringent cair program and 3 treatment of existing banked title iv allowances because the title iv program is bot h statutory and successful epa felt it needed to protect the program thus limiting its ability to suggest alternative allocation sche mes under cair20 based on the assumption that states would solely target electric generators for control epa proceeded to determine cairs appropriate statewide emi ssion budgets by melding cair s allocation scheme into the existing title iv acid rain program with both programs based on electric generators the effect of this allocation sc heme is to continue the grandfathering of pre1990 existing plants under cair ep recognizes this but argues that maintaining the integrity of the title iv program prevents it from pursuing alternative allocation schemes that mig ht provide relief to ne wly constructed sources perhaps the most obvious problem with cairtitle iv interface is the creation of surplus title iv allowances as sources in the regional control area reduce emissions to the more stringent cair limits while the rest of the country is under the title iv caps to prevent the buildup of title iv allowances epa mandates cair affected states require twoforone redemption of caa title iv allowances during phase 1 and 286forone rede mption of title iv allowa nces during phase 2 such redemption ratios would represent 50 reduction during phase 1 and 65 during phase 2 these title iv allowance redemptions are required regardless of whether or not the state chooses to particip ate in the epasponsored cair so2 trading scheme modifying title iv allowances could be questioned by some however allowances are not cast in concrete by the 1990 caaa as noted an allowance is limited authorization to emit so2 title iv states explicitly that an allowance is not property right and that nothing in this title or in any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of th united states to terminate or limit such authorization section 403f the nate report on title iv from which this language originated elaborates on this provision with the following httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs11 21 srept 101228 december 20 1989 p 321 22 see clean air interstate rule pp 2529125296 23 for more information on the title iv emissions bank see epas most recent annual report at httpwwwepagovairmarketscmprptarp032003reportpdf 24 clean air interstate rule pp 2528425285 25 ibid pp 2529625299the purpose in characterizing the legal or property status of allowances in new section 403f of the act is to make clear that regulatory actions taken subsequent to the issuance of allowances are not subject to the takings clause of the us constitution allowances are in large part simply iterations of each units permit under this title since the permits will be in effect legally binding statements of each units emissions limitation obligations under the pollution control program established herein the subsection makes clear that should the congress or the administrator limit revoke or otherwise modify the allowances or the underlying regulatory program established by new title iv of the act or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto the us government will not be obliged to compensate allowanceholders for loss of the allowances or any loss in their value allowances are but the means of implementing an emissions limitation program which can be altered in response to changes in the environment or for other reasons of public policy21 thus epa may have significant flexibility in modifying title iv allowances in response to changes in the environment or for other reasons of public policy epa provides detailed defense of its decision to use title iv allowances in its cair trading program in the rule22 at the beginning of 2004 the title iv allowance bank had about 76 million allowances23 epa decided that pre2010 banked t itle iv allowances may be used on oneforone basis for meeting the more stringent reductions under cair in order to encourage early reductions24 essentially this means that pre2010 allowances could double in value beginning in 2010 and n early triple in value beginning in 2015 one revision epa does make in the title iv program per as part of the cair so2 trading program is to change the unitbyunit allowanceholding requirement to sourcebysource system effective july 1 200625 epa argues that it is important to provide this additional compliance flexibility and that it does not affect the emissions monitoring and reporting requireme nts which remain applied on unitby unit basis nox annual cap unlike so2 there is statutory capandtrade program for nox emissions from electric utilities however there is regional seasonal nox capandtrade program the nox sip call that includes electric utility and other major stationary sources like the mode l trading programs suggested under cair the nox sip call trading program is the product of an epasponsored model rule and regional trading scheme that was voluntarily adopted by the affected states to achieve their emissions budgets as discu ssed in the next section cair eliminates the nox sip calls seasonal capandtrade sc heme starting in 2009 in favor of the seasonal cair nox programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs12 26 ibid p 25230 27 ibid p 25222 28 ibid p 25231 29 ibid p 25231 30 ibid pp 2528625288unlike its approach with the so2 program epa did not attempt to meld the cair annual program with the existing nox sip call by using capandtrade scheme based on the nox si p call epa calculated emission budgets for states by multiplying nox emission rate specified in the rule by the states electric generating units historical annual heat input the rule sets the nox emission rate at 015 lbmmbtu during phase 1 increasing the stringency to 0125 lbmmbtu during phase 2 the baseline for the annual h eat input is the highest annual input for any year 1999 through 2002 on unitbyunit basis26 for powerplants beginning operations after 2002 or for rewarding ear ly reductions or for assisting utilities having difficulties meeting their missions limitations epa provides for compliance supplement pool csp of 200000 llowances to be allocated to states in proportion to their reduction requirement the final annual cair nox program includes three major changes from the proposed rule first the phase 1 co mpliance deadline was accelerated from 2010 to 2009 epa believes that accelerating the phase 1 deadline for both nox and so2 is not practical but oneyear acceleration of the nox deadline was feasible27 second epa chose to weight the heat input baselin by fuel type specifically the adjustment factors are 10 for coal 04 for natural gas and 06 for oil28 this departure from the nox sip call methodology and the proposed rule is justified by epa on equity grounds29 the adjustment represents 2½ weighing of coal combustion compared with natural gas combustion providing stat with substantial coalfired generation significantly larger emissions budget than they would have received if all fossil fuel combustion were weighed the same third epa decided to offer states voluntary optin provision for nonelectric utility units that meet specific criteria30 the nox annual cap and its model trad ing program presented several issues with respect to its relationship to cairs seasonal nox program and the existing nox sip call including 1 melding cair methodology with the existing nox sip call 2 nonelectric utilities included in the nox sip call but not cair cap determinations and m odel trading programs and 3 nnual versus seasonal controls some of these problems were resolved by epas decision in the final rule to include seasonal nox cap in addition to the annual cair nox cap discussed here despite its emphasis on using nox sip methodology in developing cair the annual cair nox capandtrade scheme diffe rs significantly from the nox sip call in terms of the state budget determined nd the scope of partic ipants epas choice of focusing only on electric generators runs counter to the costbenefit analysis the recommendations of the ozone transpor t assessment group otag and epashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs13 31 otag was created by epa and the 37 easte rnmost states under the 1990 clean air act amendments to recommend ways of reducing ozone transport in the northeastern part of the country final recommendations were made in 1997 32 specifically for utility sources epa used nox emission rate of 015 lb noxmmbtu to determine budget allocations for area sources epa assumed new controls for nonutility sources epa used 70 reduction requirement for large sources and ract controls generally 2550 for smaller s ources epa calculated the highway vehicle budget by assuming implementation of existing sips along with the following federal measures national low emission vehicle standa rds 2004 heavyduty engine standards and revisions to emissions test procedures finally epa calculated the budget for nonroad engines assuming implementation of existin g sips along with the following federal measures federal small engine standards phase ii and 1997 proposed nonroad diesel engine standards see proposed ozone transport rule and appendix b otag recommendations 62 federal register 6031860420 november 7 1997 33 clean air interstate rule p 25214nox sip call31 otags recommendations to epa with respect to the nox sip call called for nox controls on large and medium nonutility stationary sources in addition to controlling utility sources in the final nox sip call epa calculated state emission budgets based on five sect ors electric utility nonutility sources area sources nonroad engines and highway ve hicles budgets were based on cost effective reductions with substantial reduc tions required from elect ric generators and from nonutility sources indeed epa used 70 reduction requirement for large industrial facilities and reas onably available control t echnology ract control generally 2550 for smaller sources32 in cair arguing lack of data epa generally released the other stationary source components from the rule epa notes it had sufficient data in 1997 to propose nox sip call that included these sources but argues it doesnt have sufficient data in 2005 to include these sources in cair because of the increased geographic scope of cair and its inclusion of so233 the methodological differences resultin g from the exclusion of stationary industrial sources from cair but not the nox sip call presents difficulties for the cair capandtrade program by permittin g only electric utilities to participate in the cair model trading programs along with the decision to eliminate the nox sip call trading program industr ial sources currently cove red under the sip call would have been left hanging with respect to the cair model trading program in the final rule epa decided to permit states to in clude nox sip call i ndustrial sources under its model seasonal nox trading program but not its model annual nox trading program final issue is the seasonal nature of the nox sip call versus the annual nature of the cair nox program in the proposed iaq epa argued this was not problem in the cair epa partly change d its approach and included third cap to respond to the seasonal nature of the oz one program however it included flow control mechanisms to prevent the exce ssive use of emission banks in meeting emission limitations such as are contained in the current nox sip call trading programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs14 34 when epa issued the final rule it also proposed to include new jersey and delaware under the annual nox and so2 caps for contributing to pm25 nonattainment 35 clean air interstate rule p 25290reducing ozone formation the seasonal nox cap in the final rule epa decided to in clude seasonal nox program directly focused on ozone nonattainment this deci sion represents reversal on epas part from its proposed rule that argued that ozoneaffected states should be included in the proposed annual nox program and seasonal program was necessary the seasonal nox trading program is co mpletely separate from the annual nox trading program in its operations and would replace the existing nox sip call seasonal trading program allowances banked under the seasonal program cannot be used for complying with the annual prog ram and viceversa likewise existing banked allowances under the nox sip call trading program can be used only with the seasonal nox program as in the nox sip call the ozone season is defined as mayseptember in the final rule ep found that five states connecticut massachusetts new jersey delaware and arkansas would be covered under the seasonal nox program but not the annual nox program34 all of these states are currently covered by the nox sip call however epas cair seasonal nox pr ograms emissions budget allocation methodology is based on its cair annua l nox programs methodology not the existing nox sip call this includes the sole focus on electric generating units employing the same emission rates and historic baselines that the annual program uses and the inclusion of fueltype adju stment factors for determining baseline heat rates the decision to include seasonal nox cap and model trading program under cair reflects desire by epa to eliminate the existing nox sip call trading program epa believes its updated modeling justified an enlarged emissions cap and that its cair costeffectiveness strategy is the most appropriate means of distributing state budgets as discusse d previously the differing scope and methodologies created signifi cant interfacing challenges perhaps the greatest challenge was the ex clusion of industria l sources covered under the nox sip call from the allocation methodology used for the cair seasonal state budgets and trading program epa essentially provides nox sip call states two options35 first the state can choose to adopt the seasonal nox programs electricgeneratingunitsonly system and assign reduction requirements accordingly as those states would be achieving their cair budgets solely through controlling electric generating facilities previously c ontrolled industrial sources would longer have reduction require ments under the eliminated nox sip call the other option for states would be to include industrial sources currently covered under the nox sip call in the seasonal trading program emission limitations for those sources would remain the same as under the current nox sip callhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs15 36 ibid p 25290 37 ibid pp 2528425286 38 ibid p 25284another melding problem resulted from the geographic difference between the 21state nox sip call program and the 25st ate cair program because of different methodologies rhode island is included under the nox sip call but not the cair nox program epa decided to give rhode island two options 1 join the cair seasonal nox trading program or 2 deve lop an alternative method to achieve its nox sip call requirements36 issues timing of reductions banking providing flexibility to participants is at the heart of the cair capandtrade implementation strategy epa hopes the adoption of th model trading program by states will achieve emission reductions earlier and less expensively than command andcontrol system incentives to achieve reductions earlier than necessary include 1 oneforone redemption of so2 allowances banked before 2010 for more stringent cair requirements 2 oneforone use of nox sip call allowa nces banked before 2009 for the seasonal nox program and 3 creation of compliance supplemental pool csp with 200000 annual nox allowances that states can use to reward early reductions by electric utilities37 however analysis of projected banking activity before nd during cair does not indicate that early reductions will be significant as indicated in table 4 none of the three trading program under cair is projected to have any net increase in banked allowances before the 2009 2010 phase 1 dates for the so2 program the current bank of 76 million allowances is projected to fall to 69 million allowances in 2010 from that point the bank declines producing the glide slope of reductions that epa wants in order to reduce costs38 however that glide slope does not appear to include any additional early reductions resulting from cair table 4 projected net banking before and during cair 2003 2007 2010 2015 2020 2026 so2 annual million tons76 69 69 43 10 0 nox annual 0 0 0 0 0 0

according to epas modeling runs the actu emissions under the seasonal nox program continue under the control requirements with banking activities the seasonal nox credits banked over the projected time period ju st continue to accumulate discussions with epa indicate the model sees the annual nox requirement as the controlling metric under cair not the seasonal cap telephone communications with epa may 5 2005for the annual nox trading program th projected banking activities indicates glide slope whatsoever there is net banking activity projected under the annual nox program for the seasonal program the model projects banking before the 2009 compliance dates but slowly accumulating bank of seasonal nox allowance after 2009 this accumulation c ontinues through the projected period the effect this activity has on emission reductions is indicated in table 5 as suggested above the so2 banking activity results in smoothing out of the phase 1 and phase 2 reduction re quirement but at the cost of emissions remaining over actual cap levels through the projected period in contrast the annua l nox emission levels follow the reduction requirement in lockst ep with smoothing of the emission levels over time finally the emissions levels under the seas onal program remain below the cap limits throughout the period table 5 projected emissions under cair million tons regional

when epa proposed the iaq it did not include seasonal nox cap for ozone mitigation its decision in cair to include seasonal nox program with separate s easonal caps appears at first to be major change from the proposed rule however the result bove suggests that the annual nox control requirement is dictating control strategies not the seasonal cap39 indeed the result indicates that compliance with the annual cap results in slight overcontrol situation with respect to the seasonal cap hen ce the slowly increasing bank of seasonal allowances if this projection proves correct seasonal allowances may have little value something states may want to consider in deciding whether to include their industrial nox sip call sources in the seasonal cair programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32927crs17 adequacy of reductions the purpose of cair is to address inters tate transport of pollutants that are hindering downwind states from atta ining the eighthour ozone and pm25 naaqs as indicated by table 6 most eastern us counties currently in nonattainment will come into compliance with the pm25 and eighthour ozone naaqs by implementing existing caa programs over the next 510 years in terms of the remaining counties cair is predicted by epa to have greater impact on pm25 attainment in the eastern united states than on eastern us eight hour ozone attainment according to epa cair will bring only three additional c ounties out of the remaining 40 into compliance with the eighthour ozone naaqs in 2010 and only total of six additional counties out of remaining 22 by 2015 in contrast epa projects cair will bring 52 additional countie s out of the remaining 79 into compliance with the pm25 naaqs by 2010 and total of 57 additi onal counties out of the remaining 74 by 2015 table 6 projected

the purpose of cair is to address intersta transport of so2 and nox not to achieve the pm25 and eighthour ozone naaqs on its own that task will require combination of interstate and local controls however the relative lack of impact of the seasonal cap on ozone ttainment raises questions if data are problem some may ask why not incl ude industrial sources for seasonal nox control only as is currently the case with the nox sip call epa has already decided to separate the phase 1 deadlines between nox 2009 and so2 2010 why not include industrial sources for seasonal nox only there are onl five states that are under the cair seasonal program but not the nox sip call so epas data concerns would be lessened in addition do epas projections of s easonal nox banking suggest that the seasonal cap could be strengthened sligh tly the seasonal nox program is separate from the annual nox program as are the nvironmental problems they address so the budget allocation schemes do not have to be identical with respect to the so2 results the lessening of progress between 2010 and 2015 may raise questions how much is th is the result of the banking activities during that time period would

balance between addressing the interstate transport component of nonatta inment and the need for local controls ultimately it may be the congress or the courts that determine whether that assessment is correct meshing with the clean air act epa does not provide any direct regula tory relief to f acilities covered under cair specifically new source review40 exemptions or safe harbors are provided to facilities that meet the requirements of cair however two provisions of cair may offer some future relief from caa requirements depending on future epa determinations th are discussed below section 126 petitions under section 126b of the caa any state or political subdivision may petition epa for finding that any major source or group of stationary sources located in another state is emitting pollutants that significantly contribute to the nonattainment of naaqs by their state epa is to respond to the petition w ithin 60 days if the petition is granted the offending sources must cease operations within three months unless the sources comply with emission controls and the compliance schedules as determined by epa to bring them into compliance with the section section 126 petitions have b een on file with epa with respect to the eighthour ozone standard since august 199741 on january 18 2000 epa indefinitely stayed findings on the eighthour ozone standard because of litigation on that standard42 more petitions have been received si nce on march 19 2004 epa received section 126 petition from north carolina seek ing reductions in upwind emissions to help it achieve the pm25

areas45 in the proposed iaq and in cair epa ts out lengthy argument with respect to cair and bart46 specifically epa argues that participation in cair should act as substitute for complying with bart however epa also decided to defer the decision on substituting cair for bart for affected units until the bart guidelines are finalized as stated by epa the results clearly indicate that the cair will achieve greater reasonable progress than bart as proposed measured by the proposed betterthanbart test at this time we can foresee circumstances under which bart for egus could produce greater visibility improvement than the cair however for the reasons noted in section ixc1 above we are deferring final determination of whether the cair makes greater reasonable progress than bart until the bart guidelines fo r egus and the criteria for bart alternative programs are finalized47 conclusion the final cair rule reflects several changes from the proposed iaq resulting from improved modeling and other c onsiderations changes include inclusion of seasonal nox emissions cap separate from the proposed annual nox emission cap accelerating compliance with phase 1 of the two nox caps from2010

48 cair has not been partic ularly controversial so major changes were not anticipated that the rule has not had the visibility of the hg rule should not be interpreted to mean that the underlying issue of pm25 and eighthour ozone compliance has been solved in particular epa is curren tly reviewing the stringency of the pm25 naaqs process that could result in more stringent standard and more counties out of compliance given the lengthy time frame of cair it seems likely that efforts will be made to strengthen its provisions well before 2015 if the pm25 standard is strengthened likewise cair does not address th most potent environmental issue surrounding fossilfuelfired electric generating facilities global warming and the possibility of carbon dioxide reductions movement on that issue over the next decade could result in modification of cair or new multipollutant control regime bills have been introduced in congress to impose such system49 finally the promulgation of cair may ra ise questions about the future of the bush administrations legislative initiative clear skies clear skies represents complete rewrite of title iv of the clean air act and would impose comprehensive capandtrade system on utility so2 nox and hg emissions in addition it would have altered deleted or held in abeyance for some time existing sections of the clean air act with respect to affected electric generating units and industrial sources that chose to opt into the program50 with the promulgation of cair that achieves nox and so2 emissions reductions from most of the countrys electricity generating facilities and of the final hg rule it is unclear what impetus remains for clear skies
