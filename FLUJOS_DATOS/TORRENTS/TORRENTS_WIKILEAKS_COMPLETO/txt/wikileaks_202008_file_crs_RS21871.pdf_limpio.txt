price competition by adapting regulatory structures to technologi cal innovations that ve transformed stock markets in recent years this repor t will be updated as events warrant the tradethrough rule on its face is very simple stocks traded on more than one exchange cannot be bought and sold for prices that are worse than other prices on offer when this happens the superior price offer is said to be traded through or ignored from the customers pont of view the rule is common sense one would certainly not want ones broker to buy shares for 40 in one market when there was seller elsewhere asking 3990 nevertheless the sec on april 6 2005 adopted set of new rules known collectively as regulation nms for national market system that modify the trade through rule having cited need to moderniz rule that had become antiquated as stockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21871crs2 1 see httpwwwsecgovnewspress200548htm the secs original version of regulation nms proposed in feb 2004 together with comments r

structure issues see crs report rl30602 the electronic stock market by mark jickling 3 also known as ecns or elec tronic communications networks 4 nasdaq is legally not stock exchange but national securities associationmarkets were transformed by com puter technology and other factors1 the original proposal published in february 2004 was very controversial and in december 2004 the sec issued for comment substantially revi sed version of rule nms the reproposal was equally controversial complicated by the fact that the sec has put forward two significantly different models for consider ation under the revi sed rule linkages among markets that trade electronically would be improved to allow brokers to sweep multiple markets in search of the best price nd all markets would ve to adopt policies reasonably designed to prevent tradethroughs the final rule requires all markets to obtain the best price for cu stomers from among price quota tions that are electronically available and immediately accessible changes to the tradethrough rule have the potential to change the way stocks are traded in us markets the stakes are not small in the short r the question is who will handle business worth hundreds of billions of dollars year in the long run the issue is whether we have stock market st ructure that provides the maximum benefits to the economy as an engine for capital forma tion investment and growth the proposed regulation nms is response to changes in ma rket structure that have been driven by new technology and the increasing dominance of large institutional investors such as pension plans and mutual funds there are three types of stock markets in the united states although the distinctions become less clear all the time2 first the traditional exchanges where most of the action takes place on trading floor where brokers nd dealers meet face to face second the nasdaq where traders are physically disperse d and dealers offers to buy and sell are displayed and executed on computer screens finally the alternative trading systems atss3 which are essentially computers that match customers orde rs to buy and sell without the intermediation of dealer for practical purposes the term traditi onal exchange means the new york stock exchange nyse the nyse accounts for 99 of the volume of all registered stock exchanges its only significant domestic competitor is nasdaq which is not technically an exchange4 the controversy over the tradethr ough rule however is not primarily matter of rivalry between nyse and nasdaq instead major issue is whether trading in nyselisted stocks will mig rate from the nyse floor to the atss which now account for over half the trading volume in nasdaq stocks but only small fraction of nyse volume inet the largest ats handles about 25 of trading volume in shares listed on nasdaq but only 1 of trading in nyselis ted shares companies do not list theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21871crs3 5 the upstairs market at the nyse has for many years served this same function brokers known as block positioners match institutional buyers and sellers so that neither order will languish on the floor as prices deteriorate th first atss replicated this function for nasdaq stocks and with modifications to the trad ethrough rule could plausibly attract many institutional trades that now go to the nyse upstairs marketshares on atss as they do on the nyse and nasdaq atss are purely trading mechanisms this disparity and the tradethrough rules relation to it is at the center of the controversy over the proposed regula tion nms opponents of the tradethrough rule argue that the rule essentially conf ers monopoly status on the nyse trading floor by requiring that orders in nys shares be exposed to the floor for 30 seconds to see if better price can be found called price impr ovement before they can be executed in other markets including atss in this view the tradethrough rule negates the advantages of ats trading which are speed anonymity and certainty of execution on the other hand the nyse and its supporte rs claim that the nyse floor in most cases offers the best price and that abolishi ng the tradethrough rule would raise trading costs to investors both these arguments app ear to be correct but in different contexts depending on the type of transaction invol ved the preferences and needs and market power of large institutional investors ar the key to understanding the dispute atss came into being to serve the needs of institutional investors they offer extremely fast execution and usually match buyers and sellers dir ectly unlike nasdaq market makers and nyse specialists who stand ready to buy or sell at any time an ats does not bring its own capital to the market ats dealing can lower transaction costs by cutting out these middlemen and in other ways when pension fund for example wishes to sell large block of st ock brokerage commissions and dealer spreads are only part of the costs it faces it must also consider the market impact of the order when it reaches the nyse floor or nasdaq d ealer if the amount of stock to be sold exceeds current buying interest in the market the price will fall perhaps significantly before the transaction is complete an ats offers the possibility of finding single institutional buyer so that market impact will not be factor5 atss also allow their customers to trade anonymously so that other traders are not influenced by the knowledge that large instituti onal transaction is underway other reasons why an institutional investor might prefer to trade through superior price offered on the nyse floor have to do with execution speed and certainty where an ats may offer immediate execution the be tter price offered on the nyse may cover only portion of the institutions order in th at case the price is not delivered and the order is not executed the tradethrough rule requires that orders in nyse stocks be sent to the floor for interaction with traders phy sically present there during which time the market price may be moving against the institutional buyer or seller problems of speed and certainty of execution have worsened fo r institutional traders with the conversion to decimal pricing when stocks are priced in pennies rather than eighths there is less buying or selling interest at any given price which both magnifies the market impact of large orders and increases the probability that prices will move before trade is completedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21871crs4 6 nasdaq is legally not stock exchange but national securities association 7 text of release at httpwwwsecgovrulesproposed3449749htmlarge institutional traders expect to benefit if the atss can capture significant volumes of nyse trading as they have in nasdaq stocks these benefits for the most part would not be shared by individual i nvestors or in many cases by smaller institutions small traders generally approach the market through multiple intermediaries so few seconds in execution time makes little difference to them their orders do not affect the market price their abiding concern is that their transactions costs will be higher than those paid by large traders and market insiders for such market participants the tradethrough rule is significant pr otection against collusion between brokers and dealers and other situations in which market insiders may take dvantage of their public customers however because the largest institutions include pension funds and mutual funds representing millions of sm all investors the tradeth rough issue cannot be framed purely as conflict between rge and small shareholders the issue can also be framed as speed versus price certain traders wish to be assured of receiving the best available pri ce at any given moment regardless of venue while for others speed is paramount and esp ecially for large trades the best price on offer may longer be there by the time their order has been s hopped around as the tradethrough rule requires the sec in its proposed rule chan ges has attempted to balance the interests of all market participants regulation nms as proposed reproposed and adopted regulation nms as origin ally proposed would have extended the tradethrough rule from exchangetraded stocks to all markets6 and would have re quired all markets to establish policies and proce dures reasonably designed to prevent tradethroughs however there would have been two significant exceptions to the rule certain investors would have been allowed to voluntarily opt out from tradethrough protections and automated fast markets where orders are executed by computers would have been permitted to trade through superior prices offered on slow markets principally the nyse where most transactions pass throug h the human hands of specialists and floor brokers at the same time the rule set limits on the ability of fast market to trade through slow market if the slow markets price was better than the fast markets by certain dollar amounts specified in the re gulation the tradethrough could not take place on may 20 2004 the sec extended the comment period for regulation nms7 in this release the sec acknowledged several difficulties attending the original proposals including the definition of fast market th definition of an automated price quote the sliding scale for the amount by which fast markets would be allowed to trade through nonautomated market prices nd other matters the second release suggested that the final rules might differ significantly from what the sec originally proposed this was the case new rule nms was published for comments on december 16 2004 several key concepts of the original proposal the optout and the distinction between fast and slow markets did not app ear in the revised tradethrough rule thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21871crs5 8 limit orders are orders to buy or sell at pric specified by the customer as opposed to market orders where the broker is instructed to buy or sell immediately at the going price 9 liquidity is the condition in which every buyer can easily find seller and vice versa when liquidity is absent price changes b ecome more abrupt and unpredictablerevised rule focused on tradethrough protection for limit orders which the secs release described as the building blocks of pub lic price discovery and efficient markets8 if limit orders are traded through the sec reas oned investors will not post them and the market will become less liquid9 the revised rule asked fo r comments on two alternative forms of tradethrough protections the first called the market bbo best bid or offer alternative would require only that the be st order publicly available not be traded through the second which is more funda mental change from present practice is called the voluntary depth alternative this proposal would extend trade through protection to all limit orders th at market chose to make public on voluntary basis how would the two alternatives actually work say customer wants to buy 10000 shares of apple the best offer in the market is for 7220 for 4000 shares limit orders to sell 3000 shares for 7225 and 7230 respectivel are on display under the market bbo alternative the customers broker would be obliged to buy the 4000 shares but could trade through the limit orders and pay higher price for the remaining 6000 shares under the voluntary depth rule all three llers orders would be protected from trade through once they had been entered into an automatic display system the reproposed tradethrough rule would pply only to bids and offers that were immediately accessible for automa tic execution in other words prices quoted manual markets such as the nyse would not be pr otected and could be traded through this provision is more sweeping than in the cs original proposal which put dollar limits on the amount of permissible tradethrough of prices quoted on slow market atss and other automated markets could trade nyselisted stocks without regard for the prices quoted on the nyse floor the final rule adopted the market bbo pproach only the best price quoted in an electronically accessible format is protected this mean s that electronic traders will not have to send their orders to the nyse floor they will be able to trade through nyse quotes unless those are automated and made available for immediate execution as they are not at present soon after the cs adoption of reg nms the nyse announced plans to merge with archipelago one of the leading atss the nyse appears to envision double market where traders would be able to choose between sending their orders to the floor or executing tr ades on the automated ats platform the new rules apply equally to all markets they eliminate the distinction between nasdaq and the exchanges the rules mandate that an improved system of intermarket linkages be developed so th at traders have access to ll automated quotations across markets and can avoid tradethroughs th new rules do not include any voluntary opt out provisions such as those contai ned in the original rule proposal regulation nms will be phase d in beginning in april 2006 with small group of stocks to demonstrate that the new systems work as intended and then will be extended to all stocks and markets in june 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21871crs6 10 etfs or exchangetraded funds are instrument s that replicate popular stock indices allowing traders to buy or sell the sp 500 or the dow industrials in single package 11 test by sec supports tradethrough critics newark starledger apr 18 2004 p 8pro and arguments the arguments in favor of the secs new regulation have been outlined in the discussion of institutional tradin g above large institutional i nvestors want to have full range of choices as to where and how to execute their trades they view the former trade through rule as an archaism which fails to consider two important factors speed and certainty of execution effectively in this view the current tradethrough rule acts as barrier to competition whose major impact is to allow the nyse to avoid adopting automatic market structures and mechanisms that have lowered trading costs in other markets they point to the etf market10 where the tradethrough rule has been waived in an sec pilot program and nyse and the at ss compete headtohead it is reported that the nyse floor handles only 5 of etf volume suggesting that significant volumes in listed shares may move to the atss as well11 opponents to the new rule who include two of the five sec commissioners have argued that regulation nms represents an unw arranted government intrusion into market structure design they point out that the markets have not been slow to adopt new technology and that customers have benefitted in rms of lower transaction costs better information and better access to markets by stepping into highly competitive situation opponents argue the sec risks putting chill on future innovation if for example the sec imposes minimum execution times in its market linkage requirements market participants may have less incentive to improve on that standard shortly following the adoption of reg nms both the nyse and nasdaq announced plans to merge with major atss this quick response suggests that competition will remain force in market structure decisions and that the impact of the new rule may be profound given the history of mistaken predictions about the impact of technology and regulation on the stock market it remains uncertain how the market will evolve over the next several years nyse floor traders and specialists may appear to be jeopardized by the new tradethrough rule but their obituaries have been written many times since the advent of computerized trading whether the new tradethrough rule will have major impact on brokers using nasdaq and ats ma rkets who were not formerly bound by the rule but did owe their customers duty of best execution also remains to be seen congress in 1975 required the c to facilitate the developm ent of single national market system regulation nms is major st ep in that direction but certainly not the final word on the subject
