congress became increasingly concerned that the executive was giving inadequate attention and effort to blocking and controlling foreign drug trafficking as result beginning with the drug abuse act of 1986 congress required the president to certify that certain countries were cooperating fully with the united states in counternarcotics efforts in order to avoid the suspension of us foreign assistance sections 489490 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended required the president to designate the major illicit drug producing and drug transit countries by november 1 of each year these sections further required the president to withhold 50 of us assistance for the designated countries for that fiscal year until he certified by march 1 of each year that the countries had cooperated fully with the united states in drug control efforts or had taken adequate steps on their own to achieve the goals and objectives of the 1988 united nations drug convention1 1 for more detail see us department of state bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs fact sheet majors list and the certification process march 1 2001 and crs report 98159 narcotics certification of drug producing and trafficking nations questions and answers by raphael f perl there were some slight modifications in the procedures in the 19862001 period earlier congress required reports on drug producing and transit countries in 1981 and it gave the president the authority to suspend assistance to noncooperative countries in 1984 crs2 in the event the president was unable to certify that country was fully cooperative or to determine that lessthanfullycooperative country should be given certification in the national interest certain sanctions applied to the countries denied certification among the sanctions applied to decertified countries were the following 1 most foreign assistance and financing of military sales for the decertified country were to be suspended with the exception of counternarcotics and humanitarian aid 2 us representatives were required to vote against loans for the country in the multilateral development banks and 3 certain trade sanctions including increased tariffs and denial of preferential trade benefits could be applied at the presidents discretion the imposed sanctions were to remain in force until the country was subsequently certified the sanctions would also apply if congress within 30 calendar days passed joint resolution of disapproval to overturn the presidential certification thereby decertifying country however any such congressional resolution would be subject to presidential veto and would require twothirds vote of both houses to override moreover section 614 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended gives the president the authority to provide assistance to country notwithstanding other provisions in the act if he determines and notifies congress that to do so is important to the security interests of the united states presidential certifications acting under the congressionally imposed requirements us presidents regularly certified the vast majority of illicit drug producing and transit countries especially countries that were friendly to the united states and that were trading and diplomatic partners in smaller portion of cases where there were serious doubts about the counternarcotics efforts of trade and diplomatic partners these countries were given national interest waivers that freed them from sanctions on the grounds that continued aid would facilitate better relations and encourage greater counter narcotics efforts2 in general the remaining countries that were denied certification or decertified were pariah states or states with which the united states had little or contact presidents ronald reagan and george hw bush decertified iran syria burma and afghanistan and gave national interest waivers to lebanon president bush decertified panama in 1988 and 1989 just before and after the united states intervened militarily to remove military ruler general manuel noriega from power in part because of his involvement in drug trafficking activities president william clinton decertified nigeria in 1994 while bolivia and peru were given waivers colombia paraguay and pakistan were given waivers in 1995 and colombia was decertified in 1996 and 1997 on grounds that colombias president had received campaign contributions from drug traffickers this determination caused considerable consternation in bogota and some disagreement in congress in 1997 1999 there was criticism in congress when the administration removed iran syria 2 see passing judgement the us drug certification process annenberg school for communication university of southern california 1998 pp 12 crs3 and lebanon from the list of major drug producing and transit countries and when north korea was not included in the majors list3 in action relating to mexico which was often the center of attention despite being fully certified each year congressional resolutions to disapprove mexicos certification were introduced in 1987 1988 1997 1998 and 19994 resolutions of disapproval failed to reach floor action in most years but both houses passed separate versions of weakened resolutions of disapproval in 1997 and senate resolution of disapproval reached the floor but was defeated in 1998 responding to domestic and international criticisms measures to modify the drug certification requirements were introduced but not enacted in 19975 on march 1 2001 in the last presidential certifications under the old provisions president george w bush certified 20 of the 24 designated drug producing or transit countries as fully cooperative in counternarcotics efforts and he granted national interest certifications to cambodia and haiti only two countries afghanistan and burma were decertified and subject to the sanctions president bushs determinations were very similar to the determinations of president clinton in the previous year except that nigeria and paraguay were elevated from national interest waiver status to fully cooperative status by the end of the 30day period for congressional review of presidential drug certifications resolutions of disapproval had been introduced to disapprove president bushs 2001 certification of mexico or any other country drug designation requirements for fy2002 congressional reform efforts lead to one year waiver and new requirements in foreign operations appropriations after more than year of efforts to modify the drug certification requirements in december 2001 and january 2002 congress passed and the president signed the foreign operations appropriations act for fy2002 pl 107115 that contained temporary oneyear suspension of the drug certification procedures along with new requirements following the july 2000 election of opposition candidate vicente fox as president of mexico bills were introduced but not enacted to exempt mexico from the drug certification requirement in fy2001 however the senate did pass sres 366 in october 2000 expressing the sense of the senate that oneyear

crs4 warranted for mexico so that the new presidents in mexico and the united states could develop more effective and cooperative counternarcotics programs in late january 2001 senator dodd introduced s 219 to suspend the existing drug certification process for all countries for two years and encourage highlevel conference to develop an effective multilateral strategy in midfebruary 2001 senator kay bailey hutchison introduced s 353 to exempt mexico from the drug certification requirement in fy2001 but require enhanced bilateral counternarcotics cooperation about the same time senator grassley and senator dewine introduced s 376 to modify the certification process for fy2002fy2004 to require the president to identify only those countries that are failing to cooperate fully with the united states in drug control efforts in midfebruary 2001 on the eve of president bushs visit with president fox in mexico the senate passed sconres 13 expressing the sense of the congress that the president should work with the president of mexico to advance bilateral cooperation the measure urged the president to seek among other things to review the current illicit drug certification process and should seek to be open to consideration of other evaluation mechanisms that would promote increased cooperation and effectiveness in combating the illicit drug trade during the joint press conference following the meeting in mexico president bush indicated that there was movement in congress to review the drug certification requirements and he expressed confidence in president foxs efforts to combat drug trafficking in late february and early march additional measures were introduced to modify the existing drug certification procedures on february 27 2001 representative kolbe introduced hr 753 to exempt mexico from the drug certification requirements in fy2001 on march 1 2001 senators boxer and gramm introduced s 435 to provide that the drug certification procedures would not apply to countries with which the united states has bilateral counternarcotics agreements and representative reyes introduced hr 841 to suspend the certification procedures for two years and encourage development of an effective multilateral strategy on march 1 2001 the same day that president bush certified that mexico was cooperating fully with the united states in counternarcotics areas the senate foreign relations committee held hearing in which several of the proposed modifications to the drug certification requirements were discussed then assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement affairs rand beers testified that the certification process had been an effective if blunt policy instrument but he recognized growing sense in congress that there may be more effective approaches he added any regime that might modify or replace certification should have an enforcement mechanism to ensure continued international counter narcotics cooperation if there were efforts to suspend the certification procedure we believe the president must retain in the interim the power to decertify or sanction individual countries using the standards of the current process we do not believe that there should be exemptions for individual countries or regions at this time crs5 future carveouts may be appropriate however for regions where there is mutually acceptable and credible multilateral evaluative mechanism in place6 on april 3 2001 the senate foreign relations committee reported out s 219 with an amendment in the nature of substitute with elements from the various proposals that would suspend the existing drug certification procedures for three years require the president to designate only the worst offenders subject to sanctions and encourage highlevel conference to develop effective multilateral drug reduction and prevention strategies on august 1 2001 the senate foreign relations committee approved s 1401 the foreign relations authorizations act for fy2002fy2003 with the provisions of the previously reported s 219 incorporated as sections 741745 in title vii subtitle d reform of certification procedures applicable to certain drug producing or trafficking countries the committee reported out s 1401 srept 10760 on september 4 2001 and the measure was placed on the senate legislative calendar but not acted upon in 2001 during president foxs official state visit to the united states on september 57 2001 the mexican president in addressing joint session of the us congress called upon congress to pass legislation to suspend the drug certification requirements as gesture of trust and faith in the new government arguing that trust requires that one partner not be judged unilaterally by the other following the bushfox talks the joint communique praised the growing law enforcement cooperation between the countries expressed support for the oas multilateral evaluation of counternarcotics efforts and noted president bushs commitment to work with the us congress on priority basis to replace the annual counter narcotics certification regime with new measures designed to enhance international cooperation in this area in december 2001 and january 2002 congress passed and the president signed the foreign operations appropriations act for fy2002 hr 2506pl 107115 that contained temporary oneyear waiver of the drug certification procedures on global basis for all major drug transit and drug producing countries in place of the old requirements the legislation required the president to designate and withhold assistance from the worst offending countries namely the countries among the major 6 this was reference to the multilateral evaluation mechanism mem developed by the interamerican drug abuse control commission cicad of the organization of american states oas following up on the hemispheric antidrug strategy of 1996 and the plan of action of summit of the americas ii 1998 in santiago chile the cicad agreed upon the multilateral evaluation mechanism mem in 1999 and cicad working group developed questionnaire with 61 indicators to which governments responded for the first time in 2000 governmental experts group made up of one representative from each country assessed achievements in 19992000 for all countries except their own country the resulting overview hemispheric report and the individual national reports make assessments and recommendations for future action critics argue that the reports are preliminary bland and without any sanctions proponents argue that the reports make important recommendations that the mem process will advance beyond the early efforts and that countries care about their performance under the agreed upon criteria for more detail on the cicad

to make substantial efforts to adhere to obligations under international counternarcotics agreements it provided however that notwithstanding poor counternarcotics performance the president could waive the sanctions and continue to provide assistance to the designated countries if he determined and reported to congress that the assistance to the countries was vital to the national interests of the united states president bushs designations under the appropriations act acting under the provisions of the foreign operations appropriations act for fy2002 president bush designated the countries

designated countries unless the president determines that the provision of assistance to that country is vital to the national interest of the united states or that the designated country subsequently made substantial counternarcotics efforts notwithstanding the general suspension of the previous drug certification and sanctions procedures subsection 7065b of the act provides that the president may apply those procedures at his discretion given the lateness of passage transition rule in the legislation provided that for fy2003 the required report had to be submitted at least 15 days before

same time the president expressed concern about the amount of illegal synthetic drugs particularly ecstasy entering the united states from europe particularly the netherlands and the amount of pseudoephedrine and high potency marijuana entering the united states from canada11 by making the identifications and the designations at the time and the way that he did the president made clear and it was so stated in fact sheet on the fy2003 narcotics certification process that he was not exercising his option to utilize the procedures and standards of the old certification system 9 according

the new fiscal year as intended by congress the countries named on the majors list were the same countries identified in the previous determination in keeping with the new procedures among the countries on the majors list the president designated two countries burma and haiti as having failed demonstrably within the last 12 months to make substantial counternarcotics efforts however haiti

act for fy2003 pl 107228 on september 15 2004 about two weeks before the start of the new fiscal year as intended by congress president bush made the annual presidential determinations regarding major illicit drug producing and drug transit countries and he authorized the secretary of state to submit the determinations to congress the president identified 22 countries as major drug producing or transit countries16 the countries named on the majors list were the same countries identified in the previous determination except that thailand was removed from the list because the countrys opium poppy cultivation is well below the levels specified in the legislation heroin processing labs have been discovered for several years and the country is longer significant source or country of transit of illicit narcotic products affecting the united states the president designated only one country burma among the countries on the majors list as having failed demonstrably within the last 12 months to make substantial counternarcotics efforts since the president did not exercise his option to make national interest waiver with regard to burma the specified sanctions would be fully in effect against burma for the last four years burma has been the only country subject to sanctions for counternarcotics deficiencies while haiti had been included with burma in the presidents designations in 2003 as country that had failed demonstrably to meet counternarcotics obligations the president explained that haiti was not included in the 2004 determinations because the new interim government of haiti headed by prime minister latortue has taken substantive if limited counternarcotics actions in the few months it has been in office even so the president explained that the us government was deeply concerned about the ability of law enforcement agencies of haiti to reorganize and restructure sufficiently to carry out sustained counternarcotics efforts in addition in the text of the

afghanistan bahamas bolivia brazil burma china colombia dominican republic ecuador guatemala haiti india jamaica laos mexico nigeria pakistan panama paraguay peru venezuela and vietnam crs10 and

drug producing and trafficking countries18 president bushs designations for fy2006 acting under section 706 of the foreign relations authorization act for fy2003 pl 107228 on september 15 2005 several weeks before the start of the fiscal year president bush made the annual presidential determinations regarding major illicit drug producing and drug transit countries and he authorized the secretary of state to submit the determinations to congress19 the president identified 20 countries as major drug producing or transit countries the countries named20 on the majors list were the same countries identified in the previous determination except that china and vietnam were removed from the list according to the presidential determination china was removed because there is insufficient evidence to suggest that china is major source or transit country for illicit narcotics that significantly affect the united states vietnam was removed because there are indications of significant vietnam based drug threat to the united states and vietnamese claims that opium poppy cultivation has been virtually eliminated could not be refuted the president designated two of the countries burma and venezuela as having failed demonstrably within the last 12 months to adhere to international counter narcotics obligations but he waived the sanctions against venezuela by determining that us programs to aid venezuelas democratic institutions were vital to the national interests of the united states burma has been decertified every year since 1988 and for the last five years it has been the only country subject to sanctions for counternarcotics deficiencies according to the presidential determination and the statement of justification 17 see the text of the presidential determination and

with traffickers of methamphetamine operating with apparent impunity venezuela was designated as having failed demonstrably to meet international counternarcotics obligations for the first time venezuela is major transit country with increasing quantities of cocaine and heroin moving through the country to the united states and europe according to the administrations statement of justification venezuela has not adequately addressed this increasing traffic it has failed to eradicate coca and opium poppy fields found near the border with colombia and it has dramatically reduced

expressed concern about the apparent increase of opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan the continuing flow of ecstasy from canada and the netherlands the weaknesses in the law enforcement and
