is an abbreviated version of crs report 98808 perjury under federal law brief overview stripped of most footnotes quotations citations and bibliography introduction although it now covers more than court proceedings the definition of perjury has not changed great deal otherwise since the framing of the constitution blackstone described it as crime committed when lawful oath is administered in some judicial proceeding to person who swears wilfully absolutely and falsely in matter material to the issue or point in question perjury under 18 usc 1623 congress enacted 1623 as part of th 1970 organized crime control act to facilitate perjury prosecutions and thereby enhance the reliability of testimony before federal courts and grand juries it nevertheless embodies most of the same basic perjury elements stripped of some of the technical requirements and carries the same penalties as the more traditional section 1621 pars ed into elements it declares that i whoever ii under oath orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98807crs2 b in any i declaration ii certificate iii verification or iv statement under penalty of perjury as per mitted under section 1746 of title 28 united states code iii in any pro ceeding before or ancillary to any court or b grand jury of the united states iv knowingly v makes any false material declaration or b makes or uses any other information including any i book ii paper iii document iv record v recording or vi other material knowing the same to contain any false material declaration shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years or both 18 usc 1623aenumeration added in most cases the courts abbreviate their description of the elements and state that to prove perjury the government must blish that the defendant 1 knowingly made 2 false 3 material declaration 4 under oath 5 in proceeding before or ancillary to any court of grand jury of the united states the forum for the allegedly perjurious d eclaration must be proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the united states an interview in an attorneys office in preparation for j udicial hearing cannot be c onsidered such an ancillary proceeding but the phrase proceedings ancillary to court or grand jury proceedings does cover proceedings to take depos itions in connection with civil litigation as well as variety of pretrial proceedings in criminal cases including bail hearings venue hearings or suppression hearings the supreme courts observation that statement that is misleading but literally true cannot support conviction under section 1621 becau it is not false applies with equal force to perjury under section 1623 simila rly perjury cannot be the product of confusion mistake or faulty memory but must be st atement that the defendant knows is false although this require ment may be satisfied with ev idence that the defendant was deliberately ignorant or willfully blind to the fact that the statement was false on the other hand defendant cannot be guilty of perjury for truthful answer to reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous question materiality is perhaps the most nettlesome of perjurys elements it is usually said that statement is material if it has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision of the decisionm aking body to whom it is addressed this definition is not easily applied to false stat ements made in civil depositions in such cases one appellate court has recently descri bed the lower federal courts as dividedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98807crs3 between the view 1 that statement in deposition is material if truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit and 2 that statemen t is material if the topic of the statement is discoverable and the false statement itself had tendency to affect the outcome of the underlying civil suit for which the deposition was taken in any event statement is less material because it did not or could not divert the decisionmaker subsection 1623c permits perjury c onviction simply on the basis of two necessarily inconsistent material declarations rather than showing that one of the two statements is false conviction does require showin g however that the two statements were made under oath it is not enough to show that one wa s made under oath and the other was made in the form of an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury moreover the statements must be so inherently contradict ory that one of them of necessity must be false subsection 1623e permits perjury c onviction without compliance with the traditional two witness rule some years ago the supreme court declined to reverse an earlier ruling that the general rule in pros ecutions for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not nough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused set forth in the indictment the two witness rule rests on common law rather than constitutional foundation nd consequently can be abroga ted by statute which congress has done in subsection 1623e without offending constitutional principles in contrast to the other subsections of section 1623 subsection 1623d offers bar to prosecution of those accused of perjury unde r the section the defense is stated in fairly straightforward terms where in the same continuous court or grand jury proceeding in which declaration is made the person making the declaration admits such declaration to be false such admission sha ll bar prosecution under this section if at the time the admission is made the declaration s not substantially affected the proceeding or it has not become manifest that such falsity has been or will be exposed 18 usc 1623d although phrased in different terms the courts seem to agree that repudiation of the false testimony must be specific and thorough perjury under 18 usc 1621 section 1621 was enacted in an effort to keep the course of justice free from the pollution of perjury when congress passe d section 1623 it did not repeal section 1621 either explicitly or by implication where its proscriptions overlap with those of section 1623 the government is free to choose under wh ich it will prosecute in many instances it affords greater protection than section 1623 it prohibits perjury before official proceedings both judicial and nonjudicial separated into its elements the section provides that 1 i whoever having taken an oath ii before competent tribunal officer or person iii in any case in which law of the united states authorizes an oath to be administered httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98807crs4 iv that he will i testify ii declare iii depose or iv certify truly or b that any written i testimony ii declaration iii deposition or iv certificate by him subscribed is true v willfully and contrary to such oath vi states or b subscribes any material matter which he doe s not believe to be true or 2 i whoever in any declaration b certificate c verification or d statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28 united states code ii willfully subscribes as true iii any material matter iv which he does not believe to be true is guilty of perjury and shall except as otherwise expressly provided by law be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years or both this section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the united states 18 usc 1621 enumeration added the courts generally favor the abbreviated encapsulation from united states v dunnigan witness testifying unde r oath or affirmation viol ates this section if she gives false testimony concerning material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony rather than as result of confusion mistake or faulty memory testimony that is literally true even if deceptively so cannot be considered false for purposes of prosecution under section 1621 on the other hand under either section 1621 or section 1623 the false statement may c onsist of testimony that the witness does not remember or does not know when the ev idence clearly demonstrates that he does the test for materiality under section 1621 is the same as it is under section 1623 whether the false statement has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision required to be made conviction under section 1621 requires not only that the defendant knew his statement was false which he does not believe to true but that his false statement is willfully presented there is but scant au thority on precisely what willful means inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98807crs5 this context the supreme court in dicta s indicated that willful perjury consists of deliberate material falsification unde r oath other courts ve referred to it as acting with an intent to deceive or as acting intentionally subornation of perjury section 1622 outlaws procurin g or inducing another to commit perjury whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornati on of perjury and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not mo re than five years or both 18 usc 1622 the crime consists of two elements 1 an act of perjury committed by another 2 induced or procured by the defendant perjury under either section 1621 or 1623 will support conviction for subornation under section 1622 but commission of an act of perjury is necessary element of suborna tion although the authorities are exceptionally sparse it appears that to subor n one must know that the induced statement is false and that at least to suborn under section 1621 one mu st also knowingly and willfully induce false statements 18 usc 1001 the general false statemen t statute 18 usc 1001 outlaws false statements concealment or false documentation in any ma tter within the jurisdiction of any of the three branches of the federal government although it limits application in the case of congress and the courts more specifically it states i except as otherwise provided in this section ii whoever in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive legislative or judicial bran ch of the government of the united states iii knowingly and w illfully iv falsifies conceals or covers up by any trick scheme or device material fact b makes any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation or c makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than 5 years or imprisoned not more than 8 years if the offense involves intern ational or domestic terrorism as defined in section 2331 or if the matter relates to an offense under chapter 109a sexual abuse 109b sex offender registration 110 sexual expl oitation or 117 transportation for illicit sexual purposes or section 1591 sex trafficking the courts description of the elements w ill ordinarily be limited to whichever of the forms of misconduct false statement c oncealment or false documentation is implicated in the particular case in addition section 1001 imposes limitation upon an offense that involves matters within the jurisd iction of either the j udicial or legislative branch b subsection does not apply to party to judicial proceeding or that partys counsel for statements representations writin gs or documents submitted by such party or counsel to judge or magistrate in that proceeding c with respect to any matter within th jurisdiction of the legislative branch subsection shall apply only to 1 ad ministrative matters including claim for payment matter related to the procurement of property or services personnel orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98807crs6 employment practices or support services or document required by law rule or regulation to be submitted to the congress or an office or officer within the legislative branch or 2 any investigation or review conducted pursuant to the authority of any committee subcommittee commission or office of the congress consistent with applicable rules of the house or senate 18 usc 1001bc matter is within the jurisdiction of federal entity when it involves matter confided to the authority of federal agency or department department or agency has jurisdiction in this sense when it has power to exercise authority in particular situation understood in this way th phrase within the jurisdiction merely differentiates the official authorized functi ons of agency or department from matters peripheral to the business of that body several courts have held that the phrase contemplates coverage of false statements made to state local or private entities but relating to matters that invol ve federal funds or regulations subsection 1001b precludes application of prohibitions in section 1001a to the statements omissions or documentation presented to the court by party in judicial proceedings this includes statements of indigency file d by defendant seeking the appoint of counsel or by defendant for probation officers presenten ce report but not statements made by one on supervised release to parole officer although the offense can only be committed knowingly and w illfully the prosecution need not prove that the defenda nt knew that his conduc t involved matter within the jurisdiction of federal entity nor that he intended to defraud federal entity instead the phrase knowingly and willfully re fers to the circumstances under which the defendant made his statement omitted fact he was obliged to disclose or included with his false documentation ie t hat the defendant knew that his statement was false when he made it or which amounts in law to the same thing consciously disregarded or averted his eyes from the likely falsity prosecution for violation of section 1001 requires proof of materi ality as does conviction for perjury and the standard is the same the statement must have natural tendency to influence or be capable of influencing the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed there is need to show that the decision maker was in fact diverted or influenced conviction for false statements or false documentation under section 1001 also requires that the statements or documentation be false that they not be true and the same can be said of the response to ques tion that is so fundame ntally ambiguous that the defendants answer cannot be said to be knowingly fals on the other hand unlike the perjury provision of section 1623 there is safe harbor for recantation or correction of prior false statement that violates section 1001 prosecutions under subsection 1001a1 for concealment rather than false statement or false documentation must also prove the existence of duty or legal obligation not to conceal
