the fcea the candidate challenging an election the contestant must file notice of an intention to contest within 30 days of state certification of the election results stating with particularity the grounds for contesting the election the contestee then has 30 days after service of the notice to answer admitting or denying the allegations and setting forth any affirmative defenses the contestee may before answering notice make motion to the committee for more definite statement pointing out the defects and the details desired if this motion is granted by the committee the contestant would have 10 days to comply under the fcea the burden of proof is on the party challenging the election and the contestant must overcome the presumption of the regularity of an election and its results evidenced by the certificate of election presented by the contestee in this adversarial proceeding either party may take sworn depositions seek subpoenas for the attendance of witne sses and production of documents and file briefs to include any material as an appendix that they wish to put on the record before the committee in accordance with the fcea the actual election contest case is

conover ii hrept 921090 1972 at 2procedures for contested election cases in the house of representatives introduction background the us constitution provides at article i section 5 clause 1 that each house of congress shall be the judge of the elec tions returns and qualifications of their own members1 under the federal system primary authority over the procedures and the administration of elections to congress within the several states is given expressly to the states in the times pl aces and manner clause of the constitution article 1 section 4 clause 1 which also provides residual superceding authority within the congress to alter such regulations concerning congressional elections2 election recounts or challeng to congressional election results are thus initially conducted at the state level including in the state courts under the states constitutional authority to administer federal elections and are presented to the house of representatives as the final judge of such elections3 under these constitutional provisions and practice the house essentially is the final arbiter of the elections of its own members as noted by the house committee on administration once the final returns in any election have been ascertained the ultimate determination of the right of an individual to seat in the house of representatives is in the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the house of representatives under article i section 5 of the constitution of the united states4 noted 19th century expert on parliamentary and legislative assemblies

prima facie right to congressional seat in the housesterns cushing explained that the final and exclusive right to determine membership in democratically elected legislature is so essential to the free election and independent existence of legislative assembly that it may be regarded as necessary incident to every body of that description which emanates directly from the people5 in his historic work commentaries on the constitution justice joseph story analyzed the placing of the power nd final authority to determine membership within each house of congress it is obvious that power must be lodg ed somewhere to judge of the elections returns and qualifications of the members of each house composing the legislature for otherwise there could be certainty as to who were legitimately chosen members and any intruder or usurper might claim seat and thus trample upon the rights and privileges and liberties of the people if lodged in any other than the legislative body itself its independence its purity and even its existence and action may be destro yed or put into imminent danger6 in roudebush v hartke the us supreme court held that under this provision of the constitution the final determination of the right to seat in congress in an elections case is not reviewable by the courts becau it is nonjusticiable political question and that each house of congre ss in judging the elections of its own members has the right under the constituti on to make an unc onditional and final judgment7 earlier the supreme court had so found that each house of congress under article i section 5 clause 1 acts as judicial tribunal with many of the powers inherent in the court system in re ndering in such cases judgment which is beyond the authority of any other tribunal to review8 under the constitutional authority over the elections and returns of its own members the house in its consideration of challenged election may accept state count or recount or other such determination or conduc t its own recount and make its own determinations and findings9 while the house has broad authority in this area there is an institutional deference to and presumption of the regularity of state election proceedings results and certifications an election certificate from the authorized state official generally referre d to as the credentials presented by memberelect therefore is deemed to be prima facie evidence of the regularity and results of an election to the house10 the consequences of this presumption of regularity would generally result in the swearing in of memberelect presenting such credentials to the house at the beginning of new congress even in the facehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33780crs3 11 it appears that in the 103 contested electi on cases considered by the

substance would amount to rejecting the certified returns of st ate and calling into doubt the entire electoral process12 house jurisdiction there are two general avenues by whic h the house obtains jurisdiction over an election that is challenged or contested in modern practice the federal contested elections act of 1969 fcea is the pr imary method by which congressional election is contested in the house of repres entatives this contest is triggered by losing candidate filing notice under the provisions of the fcea in addition the house has in the past upon challenge to th seating of memberelect referred the question of the right to seat in the house to the committee of jurisdiction now the committee on house administration for the committee to investigate and to report to the house for disposition as explained in deschlers precedents the house acquires jurisdiction of an ection contest upon the filing of notice of contest normally the papers relating to an election contest are transmitted by the clerk to the committee on house administration pursuant to 2 usc 393b without formal referral or othe r action by the house however the house may initiate an election investigation if memberelects right to take the oath is challenged by another member by referring the question to the committee13 the fcea codified at 2 usc 381396 governs contests for the seats in the house of representatives that are initiated by candidate in the challenged election14 the fcea essentially sets forth nd details the procedures by which defeated candidate may contest seat in the house of representatives the contest under the fcea is heard by the committee on house administration upon the record provided and established by th parties to the contest after the contest is heard by the committee the committee reports the results after discussion and debate the whole house can dispose of the case by pr ivileged resolution by simple majority

committee on house administration of the question of the right to congressional seat has been made after challenge by one memberelect to the taking of the oath of office by another memberelect in such circumstance the committee on house administration may investigate the matter itself or may rely substantially on the evidence and materials provided by the interested partiescandidates following similar procedures as in the statutory federal contested elections act16 who may challenge the right to seat in the house federal contested elections act fcea in contested election brought under the statutory procedures of the fcea only losing candidates have standing to initiate contest by filing notice of intent to contest house election th statute provides expressly that only candidate for election in the last preceding election and claiming right to such office of representative in congress may contest house seat17 the contestant must be candidate whose name was on the official ballot or who was bona fide writein candidate18 houseinitiated challenges and contests in recent years the committee on h ouse administration has on infrequent occasions obtained jurisdiction of an election contest by virtue of challenge by one memberelect to the taking of the oath of office of another memb erelect on the first day of new congress and the subsequent adoption of resolution instructing that the question of the right to the seat be referred to the committee19 in addition to houseinitiated referral in this manner it has also been noted that it is possible that petition from an elector of the congressiona l district in question or from any other person might also be referred by the speaker or the house to the co mmittee for investigation20 according to deschlers there are thus four

instruction or comment by the house29 in at least one instance another memberel ect has made parliamentar inquiry of the speaker concerning the swearing in of memberelect whose election has been

and correctness of official acti on that election offi cials are presumed to have performed their duties loyally and honestly and that the burden of coming forward with evidence to meet or resist these presumptions rests with the contestant31 in other words the certification of election returns by the appropriate governor or secretary of state is generally accepted by the house contents and form of notice the fcea requires that the notice of intention to contest shall state with particularity the grounds upon wh ich contestant contests th election and shall state that an answer to the notice must be serv ed upon the contestant within 30 days after service of the notice in addition the noti ce of intention to contest must be signed by the contestant and verifi ed by oath or affirmation32 proof of service the fcea provides that service of the notice of intention to contest shall be made by one of the following methods 1 pe rsonal delivery of copy to contestee 2 leaving copy at contestee s house with person of discretion of at least 16 years old 3 leaving copy at contestees principal office or place of business with person in charge 4 delivering copy to an agent

contestant may be asked by the senate rules and administration committee to file supplemental petition setting forth any specific charges of fraud or irregularities if the petition to contest is too general or ambiguous see bursum v bratton and wilson v ware srept 71447 at 1 1930 the nate contestee may also request that the contestant file bill of particulars or statement of specific amendments

fact on which the contestee relies and shall be sign ed and verified by the contestee by oath or affirmation34 the contestee also has the option of maki ng certain defenses by motion prior to his or her answer to the contestant the fcea expressly provides that any such motion would alter the time for serving an answer on the contestant35 at the option of the contestee the following defenses may be made by motion served upon the contestant prior to the contestees answer 1 insufficiency of service of notice of contest 2 lack of standing of contestant 3 failure of notice of contestant to state grounds sufficient to change the result of election and 4 failure of contestant to claim right to contestees seat36 upon such motion to dismiss the burden of proof is on the contestant to present sufficient evidence that he or she is entitled to the house seat in question the purpose of motion to dismiss is to require the contestant at the outset of the contest to present sufficient evidence of prima facie case prior to the formal submission of testimony so that the committee can determine whether to conduct exhaus tive hearings and investigations37 if the notice of contest is so vague or ambiguous that the contestee cannot reasonably be required to fra responsive answer the fcea also provides that the contestee may move for more definitive statement before interposing an answer38 such motion must specify the defects of the notice and note the details required if the committee grants the motion for more definite statement and if the contestant does not comply with the order of the committee within 10 days after notice of such order the committee may dismiss the case or make such other order as it deems appropriate39 the fcea expressly states that the failure of contestee to
