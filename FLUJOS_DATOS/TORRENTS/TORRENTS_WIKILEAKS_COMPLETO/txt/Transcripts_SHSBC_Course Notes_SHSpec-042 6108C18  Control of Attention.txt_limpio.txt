6108c18 shspec42 control of attention you might think of auditing as having hundreds of rules as long as you think of it that way you arent auditing these rules are only guideposts back of them your good heart will carry the day you are trying to help the person out all right there are certain things his mind will and wont do if that is what your rules are youre fine rituals as developed by religions represent their failure to communicate the basic truths here is what pc will not do he will not go into session with his attention fixated on something else nor will you have his interest in what you are doing all the rudiments can be covered with is your attention fixated on something is there any reason you wont talk to since these questions are little too broad you have the rudiments he can have fixation on ptp of short duration where his attention is fixed on the immediate environment in the ptp ld the pc also has his attention fixed on something in pt but he also has something subjective holding his attention something very real to him when you dont parallel what the mind is doing with auditing you fail in auditing the rate of change of attention defines relative pain and the common features of every stuck point on the track is sudden shift of attention this has been known since 1950 at least the processes being used are sufficiently strong that matter what the pcs attention is fixed on you can yank it away but doing so will result in an arc break furthermore his attention wont totally come off what it was on so you will create new identification of what he was looking at and what you pull his attention to you can of course go too far in paralleling the mind and wind up in q and lrh has never seen case progress when the pcs attention on ptps of short or long duration isnt handled if you dont handle attention fixation you eventually get an unexpected attention shift that produces an arc break it isnt the minor flub you make that really causes the arc break though it triggers it the arc break is really caused by yanking the pcs attention off his ptp and you wont find it by running ow on the auditor willing to talk to the auditor is the other requirement for the pc to be in session if the pc has an arc break or withhold his willingness is out with withhold theres another factor the pc is sitting with known where he is and an unknown where the auditor is so the auditing session is ridge in view of the fact that the pcs attention is fixed on the withhold even if only at subawareness level if you audit over it youre guilty of an attention shift the attention fix in withhold is complicated by being an outward fix with an inward pull to keep it from getting out these mechanisms take priority over all of the pcs considerations and postulates so matter what he says you cant go ahead and audit over it i order to audit him youve got to be able to put his attention where you want it if theres distracting noise outside its waste of time to ask if it bothered him you can assume it shifted his attention so ask what were you thinking of when the noise occurred until theres read and the pc feels ok about it anything that happens in the auditing session is the auditors fault if anything goes wrong in session its never the pcs fault if the auditor doesnt tell him how to get his attention off something by some acceptable gradient its not the pcs fault if he cant put it where you want it because you didnt put his attention on the things its on when he comes into session youre slow to take responsibility for taking it off but if the pc doesnt make gains its the auditors fault just as the pc must be gotten to the point where he is at cause over his life because you can get him to erase all the aberrated points in an auditing session there is another cause the auditor this is in violation of the idea that the pc is cause of all effects so youve got to be slippy because you are being cause over section of the pcs track the only way it can happen is for him to have some willingness to do what you want him to do so his cause must still be there and your direction of his cause must be acceptable to him otherwise he wont be cause over that section of track called an auditing session and if he isnt cause over it hell make gain so to keep him at cause you audit him with all his attention on the auditing not splintered elsewhere he must willingly follow your direction and have clear view of what hes doing you assume incorrectly that the pc is delicate but in fact the only thing you can really do to pc thats bad is not to give him win which can only be done by violating his attention factors auditing in the absence of the pcs attention is noauditing how do you keep his attention keep the ruds in the earliest method of clearing was highly permissive and very delicate it amounts to this repetitive question what picture would it be safe to look at the reason it was longer being done by 1950 was this attention factor it hadnt been isolated so it couldnt be articulated also everybody kept dictating what picture the pc should look at but you could clear someone with that process and it would not be long route you can speed it up by getting him to use other perceptics eg what sound would it be safe for you to hear etc people who dont get any pictures are just stuck in pt to avoid looking at the disaster just earlier but you can work him around until he can confront the bank this approach didnt run into the attention problem because its so permissive it lets the pc put his attention where it already is it does take gentle smooth auditing and it takes quite awhile the engram necessary to resolve the case is actually just the picture the pc is stuck in so you are essentially running what picture would it be safe to look at now it goes faster you handle his attention gently unstick it from ptps and arc breaks give him wins and confidence dont get into games conditions with him on goals or terminals if the session goes awry its because you missed an attention factor try to get subjective reality on this if the pc says yow yow yow arc break you say what was your ptp
