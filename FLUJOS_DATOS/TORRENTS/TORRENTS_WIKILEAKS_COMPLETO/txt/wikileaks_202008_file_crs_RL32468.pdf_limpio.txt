terminology the federal budget has its own unique vocabulary basic understanding of which is essential to understa nd the significance of defense budget figures and trends the following budget terms which will be used often in this report are frequently used yet sometimes misunderstood budget authority obligations and outlays w h n c n g r s s appropriates money it provides agencies with budget authority budget authority gives an agency the legal authority to obligate money for the provision of goods or services appropriations are the most common but not the only type of budget authority2 obligations then occur for example when agencies enter into contracts submit purchase orders and employ personnel wh those obligations are liquidated or in simpler terms when the check is written and the performance of an obligation is paid for outlays occur the term defense spending technica lly refers to outlays although budget authority and outlays are frequently confused in budget discussions the 050 vs the 051 budget function the federal budget is divided into several functions including the na tional defense budget function or 050 function the 050 function consists of thr ee subfunctions depa rtment of defense 051 atomic energy defens activities 053 and defense related activitie s in other agencies 054 thus national defense spe nding consists of more th an just the department of defenses annual expenditures although the majority of the 050 function consists of the department of defense 051 f uncti on the 050 f unction also consists of billions of dollars 1675 billion in fy 2004 appropriated to the department of energy for atomic energy defense activities this report contains figures for bot h the 050 and 051 functions depending on which is most useful to the reader current and cons tant dollars the cost of goods or services in current dollars is the value of such goods or servi ces in terms of prices current at the time of purchase for example fy1985 national

defenses declining percentage of gdp to argue that the nation can afford more for defense these observers note that even with recent increas defense spending is still at relatively low levels historically as pe rcentage of gdp as shown in figure 6 whereas defense spending reached 95 of gdp in fy1968 and 62 of gdp in fy1986 at the height of the reagan buildup it equaled only 39 of gdp in fy20045 others counterargument however is that defense spending as percentage of gdp is as much dependent on the level of gdp growth as it is dependent on the level of defense spending growth since
