introduction and overview this report provides the congress with official unclassified background data from us government sources on transfer s of conventional ar ms to developing nations by major suppliers for the peri od 1998 through 2005 it also includes some data on worldwide supplier transactions it updates and revi ses the report entitled conventional arms transfers to developing nations 19972004 published by the congressional research service on august 29 2005 crs report rl33051 the data in this report provide means for congress to identify existing supplierpurchaser relationshi ps in conventional weapons acquisitions use of these data can assist congress in its oversight ro of assessing whether the current nature of the international weapons trade affect s us national inte rests maintaining regional stability and ensuring the security of us allies and friendly nations throughout the world for most of recent american history have been important elements of us foreign policy knowing the degree to which individual arms suppliers are making arms transfers to individual nations or regions provides congress with context for evaluating polic questions it may confront such policy questions may include for example whet her or not to support specific us arms sales to given countries or regions or to support or oppose such arms transfers by other nations the data in this report may also assist congress in evaluating whether multilateral arms control arrangements or other us foreign policy initiatives are being supported or undermined by the actions of foreign arms suppliers the principal focus of this report is the level of arms transf ers by major weapons suppliers to nations in the developing wo rldwhere most of the potential for the outbreak of regional military c onflicts currently exists for decades during the height of the cold war providing conventi onal weapons to friendly states was an instrument of foreign policy utilized by the united states and its allies this was equally true for the soviet union and its allies the underlying rationale for us arms transfer policy then was to help ensure that friendly states were not placed at risk through military disadvantage created by arms transfers by the soviet union or its allies the data in this report illustrate how global patterns of conventional arms transfers have changed in the postcold war and postpersian gulf war years relationships between arms s uppliers and recipients conti nue to evolve in response to changing political military and economic circumstances where before thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs2 principal motivation for arms sales by fore ign suppliers might have been to support foreign policy objective today that motiv ation may be based as much on economic considerations as those of fore ign or national security policy in this context the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons supp liers during the period of this report 19982005 conventional arms tr ansfer agreements which represent orders for future delivery to developing nations have compri sed 668 of the value of all international arms transfer agreements the portion of agreements with developing countries c onstituted 643 of all agr eements globally from 20012005 in 2005 arms transfer agreements with developing countries accounted for 684 of the value of all such agreements globally deliveries of conventional arms to developing nations from 20022005 constitu ted 678 of all in ternational arms deliveries in 2005 arms liveries to developing nati ons constituted 699 of the value of all such arms deliveries worldwide the data in this new report supersede all data published in previous editions since these new data for 19982005 reflect potentially significant updates to and revisions in the underlying data bases utilized for this report only the data in this most recent edition should be used the data are expressed in us dollars for the calendar years indicated and adjusted for infl ation see box notes on page 3 us commercially licensed arms export delivery values are excluded see box note on page

are found in box notes on page 3 the reports table of contents provides detailed listing and description of the various data tables and summaries which can guide the reader to specific items of interest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs3 calendar year data used all arms transfer and arms delivery data in this report are for the calendar year or calendar year period given this applies to us and foreign data alike united states government departments and agencies publish data on us arms transfers and deliveries but generally use the united states fiscal year as the computational time period for these data as consequence there are likely to be distinct differences noted in those published totals using fis cal year basis and those provided in this report which use calendar year basis details on data used are outlined in footnotes at the bottom of tables 1 2 8 and 9 arms transfer values the values of arms transfer agreements or deliveries in this report refer to the total values of conve ntional arms orders or deliveries as the case may be which include all categories of weapons and ammunition military spare part s military construction military assistance and training programs and all associated services definition of developing nations and regions as used in this report the developi ng nations category includes all countries except the united states russia european na tions canada japan australia and new zealand listing of countries located in the regions defined for the purpose of this analysis asia near east latin america and africa is provided at the end of the reportconstant 2005 dollars throughout this report values of arms tr ansfer agreements and values of arms deliveries for all suppliers are expressed in us dollars values for any given year generally reflect the exchange rates that prevailed during that specific year the report converts these dollar amounts current dolla rs into constant 2005 dollars although this helps to eliminate the distorting effects of us inflation to permit more accurate comparison of various dollar levels over time the effects of fluctuating exchange rates are not neutralized the deflators used for the constant dollar calculations in this report are those provided by the us department of defense and are set out at the bottom of tables 1 2 8 and 9 unless ot herwise noted in the report all dollar values are stated in constant terms the exceptions to this rule are all regional data tables that are composed of fouryear aggregate dollar totals 19982001 and 2002 2005 these tables are expressed in current dollar terms and where tables rank leading arms suppliers to developing nati ons or leading developing nation recipients using fouryear aggregate dollar totals these values are expressed in current dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs4 major findings general trends in arms transfers worldwide the value of all arms transfer agreem ents worldwide to both developed and developing nations in 2005 was nearly 442 billion this is notable increase in arms agreements values over 2004 and is the highest total for arms agreements during the last eight years chart 1table 8a in 2005 the united states led in arms transfer agreements worldwide making agreements valued at nearly 128 billion 289 of all such agreements down from 132 billion in 2004 france ranked second with 79 billion in agreements 168 of these agreements globally up substantially from 22 billion in 2004 russia ranked third its arms transfer agr eements worldwide standing at 74 billion in 2005 up significantly from 56 billion in 2004 the united states france and russia collectively made agreements in 2005 valued at nearly 281 billion 635 of all international arms transfer agreements made by all suppliers figure 1tables 8a 8b and 8d for the period 20022005 the total value of all international arms transfer agreements 1453 billion was lower th an the worldwide value during 19982001 1488 billion decrease of 24 duri ng the period 19982001 developing world nations accounted for 693 of the value of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide during 20022005 developing wo rld nations accounted for 643 of all arms transfer agreements made globally in 2005 developing nations accounted for 684 of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide figure 1table 8a in 2005 the united states ranked fi rst in the value of all arms deliveries worldwide making nearly 116 billion in such deliveries or 456 this is the eighth year in row that the united states has led in global arms deliveries the united kingdom ranked second in worldw ide arms deliveries in 2005 making 31 billion in such deliveries russia ranke d third in 2005 making 28 billion in such deliveries these top three suppliers of arms in 2005 collectively delivered nearly 175 billion 688 of all arms delivered worl dwide by all suppliers in that year figure 2tables 9a 9b and 9d the value of all intern ational arms deliveries in 2005 was 254 billion this is notable decrease in the total value of arms deliveries from the previous year fall of 73 billion and the lowest deliveries total for the 19982005 period moreover the total value of such ar ms deliveries worldwide in 20022005 1241 billion was substantially lower in the va lue of arms deliver ies by all suppliers worldwide from 19982001 1623 bi llion declin of over 38 billion figure 2tables 9a and 9bcharts 7 and 8 developing nations from 20022005 accounted for 678 of the value of all international arms deliveries in the earlier period 19982001 developing nations accounted for 686 of the value of all arms deliveries worl dwide in 2005 developing nations collectively accounted fo r 699 of the value of all international arms deliveries figure 2tables 2a 9a and 9b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs5 the increase in weapons orders worldwid in 2005 was significant the total of 442 billion was the largest for th entire period from 19982005 global arms agreement values for the years other than 2005 ranged from 418 billion in 1999 to 293 billion in 2003 various arms orders placed in 2005 include not only the sales by the traditional major suppliers but also those of less noted suppliers in eastern as well as western europe some of the major weapons orders in 2005 reflect deferred purchases that were finally consummated by several nations increasingly developed nations have s ought to protect important elements of their national military industrial bases by limiting arms purchases from other developed nations however several key suppliers have placed additional emphasis on joint production of various weapons systems w ith other developed nations as more effective way to preserve dom estic weapons production capability while sharing the costs of new weapons developmen t the consolidation of certain sectors of the domestic defense industries of ke weapons producing na tions continues in the face of intense foreign competition meanwhile number of supplying nations has chosen to manufacture items for niche weapons where their specialized production capabilities give them important advantages in th evolving international arms marketplace the intensely competitive weapons ma rketplace has led several producing countries to focus sales efforts on prospec tive clients in nations and regions where individual suppliers have had competitive advantages resulting from well established military support relationships within eu rope arms sales to new nato member nations to support their military moderniza tion programs have created new business for arms suppliers while allowing these nato states to sell some of their older generation military equipment in refurbished form to other lessdeveloped c ountries while there are inherent limitations on these european sales due to the smaller defense budgets of many of the purchas ing countries creative seller financing options as well as the use of coassembly coproduction and countertrade to offset costs to the buyers have continued to facilitate new arms agreements here the united states and european countries or c onsortia seem likely to compete vigorously for prospective arms contracts within the european region in the foreseeable future these sales seem particularly important to european suppliers as they can potentially compensate in part for lost weapons deal s elsewhere in the developing world that result from reduced demand for new weapons various developing nations have reduced their weapons purchases in recent years primarily due to their limited financial resources to pay for such equipment other prospective arms purchasers in the veloping world with significant financial assets continue to exercise caution in unching new and costly weapons procurement programs the general rise in the price of oil while an advantage for significant oil producing states in funding their arms purchases has at the same time caused economic difficulties for many oil consuming states contributing to their decisions to defer or curtail new weapons procurem ents the state of the world economy has induced number of developing nations to choose to upgrade existing weapons systems in their inventories while reducin g their purchases of new ones while such an approach may dampen sales of ne w weapons systems for time the weapons upgrade market can be very lucrative for some arms producers thus partially offsetting the effect of loss of major new sales httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs6 finally during recent years new weapons sales have been limited in part by the practical need for some purchasing na tions to absorb and integrated major weapons systems they have already purchas ed into their force structures this requirement may increase the number of arms contracts related to training and for support services even as it reduces the number of large or ders for new military equipment more recently although overall there appear to be fewer large weapons purchases being made by developing nati ons in the near east and in asia when contrasted with sales activity over decade ago some major purchases continue to be made by select few veloping nations in these re gions these purchases have been made principally by china and india in asia and saudi arabia in the near east although these apparent trends are subject to abrupt change based on the strength of either the regional or international economies or the threat assessments of individual states the strength of individual economie s of wide range of nations in the developing world continues to be significant factor in the timing of many of their arms purchasing decisions in latin america and to much lesser extent in africa some nations continue to express interest in modernizing important sectors of their military forces despite some large arms orders by regional standards by few states in latin america and africa most nations in these areas of the developing world are constrained in their weapons purchases by their limited financial res ources so long as there is limited availability of sellersupplie d credit and financing for weapons purchases and national budgets for military purchases rema in relatively low it seems likely that major arms sales in these regions of the developing world will continue to be limited general trends in arms transfers to developing nations the value of all arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2005 was nearly 302 billion notable increase over the 264 billion total in 2004 this was the highest annual total in real term s for the eight year period since 1998 chart 1figure 1table 1a in 2005 the value of all arms deliveries to developing nations 177 billion was subs tantially lower than the va lue of 2004 deliveries over 236 billion and the lowest total for the 19982005 period charts 7 and 8figure 2table 2a recently from 20022005 the united states and russia have dominated the arms market in the developing world th united states ranked first for 3 out of 4 years during this period while russia ranked second for 3 out of 4 these years in the value of arms transfer agreements from 20022005 the united states made 333 billion in arms transfer agreements w ith developing nati ons 352 of all such agreements russia the second leading supplier during this period made 218 billion in arms transfer agreements or 243 france the third leading supplier from 20022005 made 87 billion or 93 of all such agreements with developing nations during these years in the earlier peri od 19982001 the united states ranked first with 415 billion in arms transfer agreem ents with developing nations or 402 russia made 197 billion in arms transfer agreements during this period or 191 france made 116 billion in agreements or 112 table 1a httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs7 during the years from 19982005 most arms transfers to developing nations were made by two to three major suppliers in any given year the united states has ranked first among these suppliers for seven of the last eight years during this period falling to third place in 2005 russia has been continuing strong competitor for the lead in arms transfer agreements with developing nations ranking second every year from 1999 through 2004 and first in 2005 despite its lack of the larger traditional client base for armaments held by the united states and the major west european suppliers russias successes in obtaining new arms orders suggests that russia is likely to continue to be for the short term at least significant leader in new arms agreements with developing nations alt hough russias most significant high value arms transfer agreements continue to be with two asian countries china and india russia has had some recent success in securing arms agreements with clients beyond its principal two in this regard russia s sought to expand its prospects in north africa the middle east and southeast asia it even has increased sales efforts in latin america despite having essentia lly abandoned that region in the period following the cold wars end the russian g overnment has further stated that it has adopted more flexible payment arrangemen ts for its prospective customers in the developing world including willingness in specific cases to forgive outstanding debts owed to it by prospective client in order to secure new arms purchases at the same time russia is seeking to enha nce the quality of its followon support services to make russian products more ttractive and competitive and to assure its potential clients that it can effectively service the wea pons systems that it sells major west european arms suppliers such as france and the united kingdom in particular have concluded large orders with veloping countries over the last eight years based on either longterm suppl relationships or their having specialized weapons systems they can readily provi while there is notably increased competition between the united states and the other major arms suppliers the us seems likely to hold its position as the principal supplier to key developing world nations that are most able to afford ma jor new weapons purchases even when it does not conclude major new weapons systems ag reements in given year the fact that the us has such wide base of arms equipment clients globally means that it still will be able to conclude notable number of agreements annually to provide support upgrades and ordnance for the large variet of weapons systems it has sold to its clients for decades the prospects for purchases of new and highly expensive weapons appear to be on the increase most recently with the w ealthier developing countries yet the unsettled state of the interna tional economy and the scarcity of funds in their defense budgets continues to constrain such arms purchases by the less affluent developing nations the overall level of the arms tr ade with developing nations was on the decline in the period from 2001 until 2004 the significant rise in agreements in 2004 and the notable increase in the level of arms transfer agreements in 2005 might indicate that such sales are beginning to trend upward again but significant increase in the total value of arms agreemen ts in one or two years is not necessarily predictive of the immediate years to come those arms suppliers who ranked well below the major ones such as china other european and noneuropean suppliers do appear to have increased their participation in the arms trade with the developing world in recent years albeit at ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs8 much lower level nonetheless these non major arms suppliers have proven capable on occasion of making arms deals of c onsequence most of their annual arms transfer agreement values during 19982005 have been comparatively low although larger when they are aggregated together as group in various cases they have been successful in selling older generation equipment even while they procure newer weaponry to update their own military forces these arms suppliers also are more likely to be sources of small arms and lig ht weapons and associated ordnance rather than sellers of major military equipment thus it is unlikely that most of these countries will r outinely rank with the traditional major suppliers of advanced weaponry in the value of their arms agreements and deliveries tables 1a 1f 1g 2a 2f and 2g united states the total value in real terms of united states arms transfer agreements with developing nations fell significantly from 94 billion in 2004 to about 62 billion in 2005 the us share of the value of all such agreements was 205 in 2005 down from 354 share in 2004 charts 1 3 and 4figure 1tables 1a and 1b in 2005 the value of us arms transfer agreements with developing nations was attributable to substantial number of sma ller valued purchases by wide variety of us clients in the near east and in asia rather than by the conclusion of few very expensive contracts with small number of traditional clients these arms agreement totals illustrate the continuing us advantage

during the 20022005 period russia ranked second among all suppliers to devel oping countries making 218 billion in agreements in current 2005 dollars table 1f russias status as leading supplier of arms to developing nations stems from an increasingly successful effort to overcome the significant economic and political problems associated with the dissolution of the former soviet union the traditional arms clients of the former soviet union were generally less wealthy developing count ries valued as much for their political support in the cold war as fo r their desire for s oviet weaponry many of these traditional soviet client states received substantial military aid grants and significant discounts on their arms purchas the russia that emerged in 1991 consistently placed premium on obtaining hard currency for the weapons it sold faced with stiff competition from western arms suppliers in the 1990s russia gradually adapted its selling practices in an effort to regain and sustain an important share of the developing world arms market in recent years russian leaders have made major strides in providing more creative financing and payment options for pr ospective arms clients they have also agreed to engage in countertrade offset s debtswapping and in key cases to make significant licensed production agreements in order to sell its weapons the willingness to license production has been central element in several cases involving russias principal arms clients china and i ndia russias efforts to expand its arms customer base have met with mixed results russias arms sales efforts beyond those with china and india are focused on southeast asia it has had some success in securing arms agreemen ts with malaysia vietnam and indonesia even though recurring financial problems of some clients in this region have hampered significant growth in russian sales there russia has also made combat fighter aircraft sales in recent years to algeria and yemen elsewhere in the developing world russian military equipmen t is competitive because it ranges from the most basic to the highly advanced and can be less expensive than similar arms available from other major suppliers although russias sale of milita ry aircraft continues to be significant portion of its arms exports the absence of major new research and development efforts in this and other military equipment areas may jeopardize longterm russian foreign arms sales prospects although military weapons research and development rd programs exist in russia other major arms suppliers in the west are currently well advanced in the process of developing and producing weaponry that is much more advanced than that in existing russian rd programs despite these potential difficulties russia continues to have very significant arms development and sale s programs involving china and india which should provide it with sustained business throughout this decade through agreements concluded in the mid1990s russia has sold major combat fighter aircraft and main battle tanks to india and has provided other major wea pons systems though lease or licenced production and it

with china for number of al31f military aircraft engines for 1 billion and agreed to sell jet engines for chinas fc1 fi ghter aircraft at cost in excess of 250 million these arms acquisitions by china are apparently aimed at enhancing its military projection capabilities in asia and its ability to influence events throughout the region such acquisitions in particul ar those of advanced military equipment from russia continue to be monitored by us policymakers the us policy interest is among other things ensuring that it provides appropriate military equipment to us allies and friendly states

made clear that he plans to obtain significant new weapons systems from russia4 china the iraniraq war of the 1980s provided the opportunity for china to become an important supplier of less expensive w eapons to certain developing nations in that conflict china demonstrated that it was willing to provide arms to both combatants in the war in quantity and wit hout conditions from 20022005 the value of chinas arms transfer agreements with developing nations averaged about 950 million annually figure inflated by very large agreements total in 2005 during the period of this report the value of chinas arms transfer agreements with developing nations peaked in 1999 at 3 billi on its sales figures that year resulted generally from several smaller valued wea pons deals in asia africa and the near east rather than one or two especially rge sales of major w eapons systems similar arms deals with small scale purchasers in these regions are continuing in 2005 chinas arms transfer agreements tota l was 21 billion with an important portion of that total attributable to the sale of frigates and jet aircraft to pakistan client of long standing tables 1a 1g and 1hchart 3 there are few clients with financial re sources that have sought to purchase chinese military equipment during the eight ear period of this report because most chinese weapons for export are less adva nced and sophisticated than weaponry available from western suppliers or russia thus china does not appear likely to be major supplier of conven tional weapons in the interna tional arms market in the foreseeable future its likely clients are states in asia and africa seeking quantities of small arms and light wea pons rather than major combat systems at the same time china has been an important source of missiles in the developing world arms market china supplied silkworm antiship missiles to iran credible reports persist in various publications that china has sold surfacetosurface missiles to pakistan traditional client iran and north korea have also reportedly received chinese missile technology which has incr eased their capabilities to threaten other countries in their respective

arms sales is small china views this as one means of enhancing its status as an international political power and especially to obtain access to significant natural resources especially oil controlling the sales of small arms and light weapons to regions of conflict in partic ular to some african nations has been matter of concern to the united states fforts to do so have also been topic of focus by the united nations6 major west european suppliers apart from the united states and russia the four major west european arms suppliersfrance the united kingdom germany and italyare the states that can supply wide variety of more highly sophi sticated weapons to wouldbe purchasers they can serve as alternative sources of armaments that the united states chooses not to supply for policy reasons as an example the united kingdom sold major combat fighter aircraft to saudi arabia in the mid1980s when the us chose not to sell comparable aircraft for policy reasons these nations have been close allies of the united states especially during the cold war and all are members of nato however in the postcold war era thei r national defense ex port policies have not been fully coordinated with the united stat as likely would have been the case at the cold wars height these arms supplying states particularly france view arms sales foremost as matter for national decision france has so frequently used foreign military sales as an important means for underwriting development and proc urement of weapons systems for its own military forces so the potential exists for policy differences between the united states and major we st european supplying states over conventional weapons transfers to specific countries recent example of such conflict was the effort led by france and germany to lift the arms embargo on arms sales to china currently adhe red to by members of the european union the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33696crs13 7 for detailed background see crs report rl32870 european unions arms embargo on china implications and options for u s policy it should be noted that members of the european union and others have agreed to common effort to

background see crs report rs20517 military technology and conventional weapons exports controls the wassenaar arrangement states viewed this as misguided effort and vigorously opposed it the proposal to lift the embargo was ultimate ly not adopted but it proved to be source of significant tension between the us nd the european union thus arms sales activities of major european suppliers c ontinue

of these four nations france was the leading supplier with 63 billion in agreements in 2005 substantial increase from 1 billion in ag reements in 2004 portion of frances total in 2005 was attributable

jsf program background status and issues major west european suppliers have had their competitive position in weapons exports strengthened over the years throug h strong government marketing support for their foreign arms sales since they can produce both advanced and basic air ground and naval weapons systems the four major west european suppliers have competed successfully for arms sales c ontracts with developing nations against both the united states which has tended to sell to several of the same clients and with russia which has sold to nations not traditional customers of either the west europeans or the us however the demand for us weapons in the global arms marketplace from large established client ba has created more difficult environment for individual west european suppliers to secure large new contracts with developing nations on sustained basis the prospect of continuing strong mand for us defense equipment as well as concern for maintaining their market share of the arms trade has led european union eu member states to adopt ne w code of conduct for defense procurement practices this code was agreed to on november 21 2005 at the european defense agencys ea steering board meeting currently voluntary the eu hopes it will become mandatory and through its mechanisms foster greater competition within the european defense equipment sector in the awarding of contracts for defense items the larger hope is that by fostering greater intraeuropean cooperation and collaboration in defense contracting and the resulting programs that the defense industrial bases of i ndividual eu states will be pres erved and the ability of european defense firms to compete for arms sales in the international arms marketplace will be substantially enhanced this development coincides with peri od when some european arms suppliers have begun to phase out production of cer tain types of weapons systems such suppliers have increasingly engaged in joint production ventur with other key european weapons suppliers or even client countries in an effort to sustain major sectors of their individual defense industr ial baseseven if substantial portion of the weapons produced are for their own arme d forces the eurofighter project is one example eurocopter is anot her other european supplie rs have also adopted the strategy of cooperating in defense production ventures with the united states such as the joint strike fighter jsf rather than attempting to compete directly thereby meeting their own requirements for adva nced combat aircraft while positioning themselves to share in profits resulting from future sales of this new fighter aircraft8 regional arms transfer agreements the markets for arms in regions of the developing world have traditionally been dominated by the near east and by asia nations in the latin america and africa regions by contrast have not been majo r purchasers of weapons the regional arms agreement data tables in this

choose to consider given the circumstances what follows below is review of data on arms transfer agreement activities in the two regions that lead in arms acquisitions the near east and asia this is followed in turn by review of data regarding the leading arms purchasers in the developing world near east9 the principal catalyst for new weapons pr ocurements in the near east region in the last decade was the persian gulf crisis of august 1990february 1991 this crisis culminating in war to expel iraq from kuwait created new demands by key purchasers such as saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates and other members of the gulf coope ration council gcc for va riety of advanced weapons systems egypt and israel continued thei r modernization and increased their weapons purchases from the united states the gulf states arms purchase demands were not only response to iraqs aggression agai nst kuwait but reflection of concerns regarding perceived threats from potentially hostile iran since the fall of saddam hussein for many the conventional ground th reat from iraq has diminished and the perceived threat from iran has increased this has led the gcc states to emphasize acquisition of air and naval defense cap abilities over major ground combat systems10 in recent years the position of saudi arab ia as principal arms purchaser in the persian gulf region has declined from the extraordinarily high levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s in the period from 19982001 saudi arabias total arms agreements were valued at 57 billion in curre nt dollars less than the levels of the

weapons deliveries to developing nations 19982005 other useful data for assessing arms transfers are those that indicate who has actually delivered specific numbers of specific classes of military items to region these data are relatively hard in that they reflect actual transfers of military equipment they have the limitation of not giving detailed information regarding either the sophistication or the specific name of the quipment delivered however these data show relative trends in the delivery of important classes of military equipment and indicate who the leading suppliers

four major west european suppliers as group all other european suppliers as group and all other suppliers as group tables 37 caution is warranted in using the quantitative data within these specific tables aggregate data on weapons categor ies delivered by suppliers do not provide precise indices of the quality andor quantity of the wea ponry delivered the history of recent conventional conf

use effectively the weapons delivered to them superior tr aining coupled with good equipment tactical and operationa l proficiency and s ound logistics may in the last analysis be more important factor in nations ab ility to engage successfully in conventional warfare than the size of its weapons inventory regional weapons liveries summary 20022005 the regional weapons delivery data
