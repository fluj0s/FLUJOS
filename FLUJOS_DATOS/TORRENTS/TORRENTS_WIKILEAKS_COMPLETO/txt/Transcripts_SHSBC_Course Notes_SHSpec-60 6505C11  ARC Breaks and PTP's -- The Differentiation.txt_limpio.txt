6505c11 shspec60 arc breaks and ptps the differentiation releases are being made with power processing with lrh d of ping and msh csing it is getting very routine to get keyedout clears in under fifty hours we know that we can audit anybody 34 awareness levels below level 0 note at this time the awareness scale was apparently in its present 1976 form the bulletins covering the power processes are too simple to be anything but confidential the processes are too pure and simple to be generally released they require both great deal of training and high case level therefore power is to be made confidential power processes can only be audited in organizations there is not enough control or sense among people like homer and berner to do it in the field the idea of running endwords on raw meat it just overwhelms the pc and is tough to straighten out clay table processes have been taken out of the processing lineup when people process raw meat with the clay table they neglect one thing rather uniformly getting the questions answered only few processes are left on students auditing checksheets the international situation has improved in the us the senate and house are attacking or are on the verge of attacking the fda in victoria the report on the inquiry is delayed it will doubtless fizzle out people probably thought lrh was exaggerating when he said that we were going to take the planet but he has always meant exactly that we are now just at the edge of dissemination as phase in the development of scientology having the minus0 awareness level scale is great help in dissemination the press will support you on need of change so you press this they will go along with this whatever the press says is protest revolutions are popular until you give them the change that is to be made into then they cool off the scale of awareness is scale of what person group or organization can be aware of it is new having the minus0 awareness level scale opens the door to bringing person right up the line to release on study alone because it has trick if you can locate what person is aware of on that scale you only have to tell him about the next level and he will become aware of that and experience case change therefore you can get case improvement by education dont confuse the level person is at with his conduct for instance someone dramatizing hysteria ie being hysterical isnt necessarily or even generally aware of hysteria therefore he isnt necessarily at the level of hysteria we do know that being must be aware and we mean analytically aware of something to be at that awareness level something someone is dramatizing is above where he is and is overwhelming him what he is aware of can be discovered he what he talks about or seems to be alert to there are lower levels than 34 below zero but power reaches to the bottom and gives release the two levels below level 34 unexistence are false causation 35 and reasonableness 36 these levels are below uncausing 32 the human race generally is near the bottom end of the scale person who is aware of being hysterical is pretty hightoned relatively speaking you cant pull an overt off the person at uncausing there arent any it just happens what will be will be religions fail by being below perception of god the greatest arc break operation that has ever been pulled in the history of the human race the god who is everywhere with mass total generality total unlocatability total power total causation will you please please differentiate between arc breaks and ptps ninety percent of the pcs that you are doing arc break assessments on are in fact in ptps the arc break is usually after ptp unless it is flagrant case of bpc ptp is postulatecounterpostulate the pc is at war with something he is not just worrying about something he doesnt like he is agin something for instance husband has an argument with his wife one wants to go to the movies and the other doesnt this is war not an arc break but it could lead to an arc break on both sides running the arc break wouldnt help though it would run but running the problem will help you could find the problem where you might not ever find the bpc so the sequence is 1 problem 2 overt 3 arc break if you clean up the bpc the case wont improve because the ptp is unhandled they wont necessarily even feel better you have to do something about the fractured postulate the condition of someone in ptp isnt arc broken its war postulatecounterpostulate adds up to war it would have done hitler good to have run him on an arc break he might have been on ptp though probably it would have required power processing to stop him though one commits intentional overts as solution to problem when you define an overt as solution to ptp you can solve any case when overts are defined as arc breaks they are closed to solution the resolution of the case is who have you been mean to process the pc at cause always person commits intentional overts for only one reason they are solutions to problems knowing this even lowlevel cases are open to solution but when you define an overt or series of overts as an arc break you close the case to solution because case is usually struggling along at low causelevel the question have you committed an overt will be hard for him to answer because he has never committed an overt because it was all vitally necessary and therefore totally justified you should ask the more penetrating question why is it so vitally necessary and why is it justified it is because there was problem requiring solution the solution being the overt what throws you is that the problem is so buried in the past that it is impossible to see the connection between the overts and the problem the problem is frequently on the past track often it has nothing to do with pt the person is still solving problem relating to an earlier relationship it is still pt to him hence it is still ptp to him if you trace it back you will find that it made sense somewhere earlier in screwy sort of way guy who is always smashing up his car might be solving problem with daddy who never let him use the car by making the car unuseable you look on lot of things as overts which are in actual fact vitally necessary solutions to urgent immediate problems of survival the only thing wrong with them is when you could ask guy when with finger snap and get say 1932 then you could ask what problem did you have in 1932 you will get many many manifestations but amongst them will not be disinterest if you told someone the right problem he would change his conduct having cognited that his solution was nuts these solutions are daffy because of droppedout time the solution is to an ancient problem which is gone leaving an overt to get the major problem on someones track may take power process but if the person has some fundamental problem in his life it has formed innumerable locks which have moved up to pt and they are the overts and withholds that he is dramatizing in pt if you are clever you can get at these locks you dont have to ask for overts if you ask for solutions to the problem the old process tell problemwhat solutions have you had modified to what solutions have you put into effect to solve that problem could be reworded as how have you attempted to solve that problem so you can just use tell problem what solutions did you put into effect to solve this problem this would give you ow or you could use what have you done to solve that problem how have you attempted to solve that problem or what would solve the problem or what action of yours was solution to the problem some such process would get the overts off any action the person took to solve the problem was to some degree an overt because it was against another postulate an arc break is charge that has been restimulated on the back track which hasnt moved into full consciousness and therefore hasnt been identified the pc avoids the area an arc break is bpc and hasnt anything to do with solutions to problems guy who is failing to complete comm cycle because somebody wont acknowledge it only has really the bpc of missed withhold an inadvertent missed withhold missed withhold can be inadvertent not intended it looks and feels much like an actual missed withhold if you wont acknowledge the fact that the pc has answered the question you bypass the charge of his answer but the better part of it is that you have given him problem since he intended to answer it this is ptp by definition he is trying to solve it by force then he arc breaks but that is secondary it will solve rapidly by asking what problem have you had in auditing especially on pc who has been roughed up by not being acknowledged eventually the pc would give you the problem of getting someone to listen to then to get the pcs overts on auditors ask then how did you go about solving it you get string of overts by getting ptps for instance what problem have you had with about auditing well very often you didnt seem to listen to well how did you handle solve this i stopped telling you right answers so the pc has an arc break ptp and missed withhold you can be misled by the bpc and the fact that yes there is an arc break but the arc break isnt fully cleanupable unless you find the problem that it is based on if you clean up the problem and the problems that the pc has had in his auditing whole string of arc breaks and whole string of overts will blow this is the case because awareness of problems is way south below minus thirtyfour cause overts is way north so if you try to pull problems directly with ow the pc would already have to be so hightoned that it wouldnt have any effect on him if you did pull the problems you can discuss problems with anybody it seems to be the case that where there is life there are problems where are arc breaks and bpc of course to get an arc break just throw an endword into restimulation get total generality hitting the person outside his awareness and you will see an arc break on the generality of it the whole bank is the most total generality that one can state that is still the truth when generality in the bank is restimulated the person cannot identify the threat and he feels terrible not knowing this is true arc break the pc cannot locate the source of this horrible feeling it isnt because he is sick to his stomach it is that he doesnt know why he is sick to his stomach if you give someone wrong item off gpm he will go from tone 40 to tone 40 so fast that he looks like dive bomber that is an arc break but someone who is arc broken with an instructor really has problem and some overts which were solutions auditors can get stuck in the win of successful arc break assessments and do them on people who really have ptps they will get loses that way problems are far more common than real arc breaks an experimental nontherapeutic but very educational process is invent problem you will see black masses show up as the pcs bank collapses on him if you ran invent solution and the solutions that the pc gave you were all really invented solutions the mass would also move in but if you ran think of or recall problemsolution the mass would move off you could do think of problem invent solution and the mass will move in any totally new inventedness tends to collapse the bank if you started knocking out bunch of wholetrack problems you would find the mass going away similarly with wholetrack solutions the nearfar action of it is very interesting this makes problems of comparable magnitude able to bring mass in if you are really inventing which is hard to do the main message is that you can move mental masses around with the idea of problems and solutions why because of the basic definitions of problems and solutions solution is an effort to bat problem away which usually fails the problem being postulatecounterpostulate puts the opposite postulate across from you in hurry when you think of it persons problem is thought of as mass he calls ptp it because it is an it to him mental mass that he tries to bat away postulatecounterpostulate gives you mass so whether he sees it or not when person gets problem showing up he gets mass showing up and whether he realizes it or not the thing he tries to do about it is to do something about it to move it away from him but his effort will move it closer to him so hes in situation when he has problem that he has to do something about something to get rid of the something which is moving in on him this phenomenon of mass moving in happens in life too the pc normally responds by trying to do something to it to push it away but that effort will move it closer to him the guy has huge fundamental problem you get it and ask well all right is that your problem and he will say well really the problem was something else you ask the same question again and he says my problem was so and so and so the pc denies each problem as he asises it they are asising in the course of getting down to the main problem sometimes you have problem of missingness there is nothing there to confront this leads to where is it this kind of problem fringes into generality and borders on the arc break this is where the problem fringes on an arc break that is why problems and arc breaks appear to be cousins its gone and where can i find it are borderline to the arc break so it is easy to confuse them but failures to solve arc breaks should have clued you in to the fact that there is something else wrong fifty percent of the reactive bank is devoted to the compulsion to make reactive bank on every process except r6 you should ask about problems not arc breaks unless you realize that you have goofed in the comm cycle in that case lrh would ask about specific parts of the formula not do long list you dont have overts in the absence of problem the problem may be gone but the solutions are still forthcoming you can run responsibility on problems problems and solutions and any number of things the basic mechanism of the mind is that it needs problem situation to lock up time nothing else can stop person on the time track for instance world war ii is still being fought in literature it was problem with lot of solutions and civilization is to large degree still stuck in it as witness the sunday supplements tv programs etc night club could be mocked up like an air raid shelter and make fortune world war ii was postulatecounterpostulate that is still more real to people than pt any point of the time track where civilization is stuck is seen as more real than any new period it is the same with pcs if your pc isnt paying close attention you can assume that the pc is stuck somewhere in back time you can get his attention by finding out where he is locked in time and entering that prior time period if you trigger the back time period you will find yourself there with him you get the pcs overts by going after problems but if he is below causation he wont recognize them as overts because they are necessary solutions just ask for the problem
