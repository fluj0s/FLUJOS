committeereported bill issues in the arts humanities and museum services several artsrelated issues reappear with each congress one of the recurring issues is what the federal role should be in funding the arts humanities and museum services in addition another issue is whethe r or not to reauthorize the statute for the nea and neh since it has for so long re mained unauthorized and has been carried through and sustained by annua l appropriations acts in ta ndem with this issue with regard to nea neh and oms another issue is how to address accountability and how much oversight responsibility should and does congress exercise in dealing with these three agencies and finally should there be true endowment that combines the nea and neh or is it feasible at this time in the history of the two agencies nea and neh to combine two endowments in to one these are just few selected issues that are likely to be addressed in congress federal role in funding for the arts humanities and museum services among the questions congress perennially considers is whether funding for the arts humanities and museum services is an appropriate federal role and responsibility the current climate of budget constraints and lean budget allocations for appropriations subcommittees and committees raises questions about the need for such support some argue that nea neh and omsimls s hould be abolishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33725crs10 9 giving usa publication by the american associ ation of fundrais ing counsel aafrc trust for philanthropy provides an nnual report on philanthropy according to giving usa 2006 private giving to organizations in the arts culture and humanities category totaled 1351 billion in 2005 this represents 52 of total estimated giving 26028

hoffman cindy and howard rachofsky and deedie and rusty ro to the dallas museum of artaltogether contending that the federal government shoul d not be in the business of supporting culture they also argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support9 proponents of fede ral support for the arts humanities and museums argue that the federal governme nt has long tradition of such support beginning with congressiona l appropriations for works of art to adorn the us capitol in 1817 some argue that abolishi ng or significantly reducing funding for nea neh and imls will curtail or eliminate the programs that have national purposes such as touring theater and dan ce companies radio and television shows and nationwide programs such as challenge america arts grants nea museums for america oms and the we the people initiative neh reauthorization for the nea and neh one of the primary vehicles for federa l support for the arts humanities and museums is the national foundation on th arts and the humanities act nfaha pl 89209 as amended c ongress has made veral attempts to reauthorize this statute which provides authority for nea and neh and previously provided authority for museum services under the im s institute of museum services the last reauthorization for the national f oundation on the arts nd humanities act of 1965 took place in 1990 the arts human ities and museums amendment of 1990 pl 101512 and expired in fy1993 the authority for nea and neh has been carried through appropriations language since that time the 104th congress considered but did not act legislation to reauthorize the nea and neh under the national foundation on the arts and the humanities act however newly created institute of museum and library services imls with an office of museum services oms was authorized through the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of 1997 pl 104208 merging the previous institute of museum services with library services programs see appendix of this report for the most recent museum and library services amendments in the 105th congress the senate labor and human resources committee reported s 1020 bill to reauthorize th nfaha there was further action in part because of lingering controversy over small number of questionable nea grants in the past at the time of house passage of the fy1997 interior appropriations bill the house in an informal agreement assumed that nea would be terminated in two years and neh in three years in contrast the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33725crs11 appropriations committee expressed tinued support for nea and neh and helped to maintain their funding providing 995 million for nea 110 million for neh and 22 million for museum services congress chose to focus on arts educati on instead of reauthorization for nea and neh emphasis on arts education seemed to many safer choice at the time due to nea controversies as result the language placed in the fy1998 interior appropriations strengthened support for arts educati on in res ponse to nea controversy congress enacted nea re form measures in the fy1998 interior appropriations act pl 10583 howe ver once again there was formal reauthorization the reform measures were part of the funding bill among the nea reforms was an increase in the funding allo cation to states from 35 to 40 for basic state arts grants and for grants to unde r served populations the legislation placed 15 cap on nea funds allocated to each state exempting only those grants with national impact three members of the house and three members of the senate were added to the national council on the arts but the size of the national council was reduced from 26 to 20 both nea and neh were given specific authority to solicit funding and to invest those funds interior appropriations bills in the 106th to the 109th congress have repeated many of the same nea reforms without enacting formal reauthorization accountability for nea neh and museum services congress has oversight responsibility of nea neh and museum services and has the task of keeping these agencies accountable for the federal support they receive as mentioned above through the ears there have been controversies for congress to confront including questi onable grants given primarily by nea ironically one of the nea grants given back in time 198990 was not direct grant but subgrant through state organi zation for artwork that was labeled sacrilegious by some consequently nea anticipated the congressional reaction and disallowed subgrants disallo wed broad grants for theaters season of performances and eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline except to maintain literature fellowships jazz masters and national heritage fellowships in the folk and traditional arts fields few controversial grants through the ears have called into question whether or not congress has been successful as watchdog for taxpayers money as consequence congress has been enacting annually in appropria tions law the nea reform measures as mentioned in the r eauthorization issue discussion above and these are now part of the appropriations laws and are already accepted as neas official guidelines one of the most controversial nea cases was that of performance artist karen finley on november 5 1996 federal appeals court upheld an earlier decision nea v finley ruling that applying the general standards of decency clause to nea grants was unconstitutional on june 25 1998 the supreme court reversed the federal appeals court decision for nea v finley ca9100f3d671 by vote of 8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33725crs12 10 the language used came from the miller v california case 413 us 15 1973 it provides that grant deliberations must take in to account consideration of general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the america public 11 national arts and humanities foundations hearings before the special subcommittee on arts and humanities senate committee on labor and public welfare february 24 25 26 march 4 5 1965 p 224to 1 stating that the nea can consider general standards of decency 10 when judging grants for artistic merit and the decency provision does not inherently interfere with first amendment rights nor violate constitutional vagueness principles to date nea projects have been judged obscene by the courts as reported in budget justifications to congress all three agencies appear to have avoided controversy since the 1990s the we the people program of neh has funded 725 projects including such proj ects as support for collected editions of the papers of ben franklin the first fe deral congress televi sion documentaries on andrew jackson and public programs on alexander hamilton at 40

high school student s were provided arts education toolkits as part of the neas shakespeare in american communities initiative for the office of museum services program calle d nation of learners has supported between 800 and 1000 projects serving americas youth feasibility of combined endowment for the arts and the humanities during initial passage of the national f oundation on the arts and the humanities act in 1965 ther were proposals by several members of congress including senator gruening and senator pell that would have established single endowment for the arts and the humanities however subsequent legislation treated the arts and the humanities as two sepa rate entities until fy1977 the neh and nea did share an appropriation for admin istration although there was very little published background information discussing the concept of single endowment for the arts and humanities there was testimony by barnaby keeney then chairman of the commission on the humanities who remarked that the arts and the humanities should be combined the humanities and th arts must be considered together i believe strongly that the two are inseparable 11 the proposals in the 89th congress which would have combined the arts and the humanities under one endowment were rejected the rati onale was not outlined in either the house or senate reports or in debate but the r ecommendations of the national council on the arts and government strongly favored two separate but interrelated independent agencies in the upcoming session of congress legi slation may be considered to combine the two endowments nea and neh into one part of the rationale is that duplication may exist in the two endowments in giving grants to museums forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33725crs13 example both give grants to museums however proponents for separate entities argue that the two endowments provide funding for different purposes also now that they have their own parate clientele and support
