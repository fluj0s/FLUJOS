reflecting the varied and sometimes competing uses of limited water supplies in the upper basin on april 6 2001 the bureau of reclam ation bureau which has supplied water to farms in the upper basin for n early 100 years announced that water would be available for farms normally receiving water from the upper klamath lake so that scarce water could be used to protect species listed as endangered or threatened under the endangered species ac t water was available to some farmers from other sources eg wells and other bureau sources however many farmers were not able to plant or harves t crops due to severe cutbacks in water supplies emotions ran high on all sides of the issues and the water control gates were unlawfully opened by protesters lthough the basin has received significantly more precipitation in 2002 many issues rema in in dispute in addition several judicial decisions have affected the issues with respect to the listed species as well as tribal rights on may 31 2002 the us fish and wild life service and the national marine fisheries service both issued final biol ogical opinions on the bureaus 10year operation plan for the klamath project the agencies found that the bureaus proposed action is likely to jeopardize th continued existence of the two listed suckers and coho salmon as well as result in the adverse modification of proposed critical habitat however both opinions also included reasonable and prudent alternatives for operating the project that would remove the jeopardizing effects of the proposed action however on june 3 2002 the bureau formally rejected both final biological opinions but opted instead to operate under oneyear plan that it asserts complies with the opinions independently in march 2002 the presid ent appointed highlevel working group to develop solutions congress has responded to the controversy in number of ways including holding several oversight hearings and appropriating funds for water conservation activities in

drought affected the klamath river basin in 2001 exacerbating conflicts among several interests in this californiaoregon border area farmers commercial fishermen environmental groups and indian tribes these conflicts reflect the varied and sometimes competing uses of limited water supplies in the upper basin the bureau of reclamation bureau depar tment of the interior operates federal water supply project in the upper basin which has provided water for irrigation to farmers in the upper basin for nearly 100 years the increase in irrigated acreage over the years reduced water levels in the upper klamath lake wetland acreage in the upper basin and river flows to the lower basin on april 6 2001 the bureau announced that water would be ava ilable from upper klamath lake to supply farmers in the majority of the klamath project the project area so that the limited water supplies could be used to protect species listed as endangered or threatened under the endangered species act this announcement was based on determinations in biological opinions issued on april 5 and april 6 2001 including that the bureaus proposed operations for that year would jeopardize the continued existence of endangered suckers1 and threatened coho sa lmon and would harm but not jeopardize the continued existence of bald eagles which also rely on project water many farmers suffe red economic losses as result of the restricted water deliveries emotions ran hi gh on all sides and some of the water control gates were unlawfully opened in protest water distribution and allocation in th basin are both physically and legally complex basin waters serve farmers municipal and industria l users commercial and sport fishermen other recr eationists federal wildlife refuges and several tribes consequently farmers are not the only interest with claim to waters in the basin or to experience cutback in water allocati ons and these various needs for water come into direct competition even aside from times of drought for example since the shortnose and lost river suckers were lis ted as endangered in 1988 the bureau has had to consult with the us fish and wildlife service fws department of the interior on its operation plan for the kl amath project in 2001 the fws determined that certain water levels needed to be retained in the upper klamath lake to maintain two species of endangered suckers while the national marine fisheries service nmfs within the national oceanic nd atmospheric adminis tration department of commerce determined that certain flows of clean water needed to be released to maintain downstream coho sa lmon however in 2001 there was insufficient water to meet both species and agricultural needs indian tribes have priority water rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31098crs2 in the basin and rely on salmon and the two species of endangered suckers for various tribal uses in addition commercia l fishermen and sport anglers also rely on salmon spawned in klamath basin rivers large population of bald eagles and migratory birds at the lower klamath national wildlife refuge depends on the water released from the upper klamath lake nd on irrigation return flows however under the april 6 allocation water was to be released to the refuge although some water ultimately was donated or acquired for that purpose increased listings of threatened and endangered species together with legal affirmation of tribal water rights have resulted in irrigation needs receiving lower priority than was past practice thus in years of scarce water farmers may receive less water than previously the 107th congress has held hearings on klamath basin issues and has provided so emergency relief in addition there have been important court cases that affect the issu and the president has appointed high level working group to deve lop basinwide solutions although significantly higher water s upplies have been forecast for 2002 issues remain the bureau operated under two month letter of concurrence issued by nmfs for the months of april and may nd cut flows in the lower klamath river to less than those provided during the 2001 drought despite draft biological opinion issued on april 25 2002 finding th at the bureaus proposed 10year june 1 2002 through march 31 2012 water pl an would jeopardize the continued existence of basin species in response to preliminary concurrence with the bureaus 10year plan lawsuit was filed to enjoin the bureau from lowering klamath lake levels but the request for mporary injunction was denied final biological opinions were issued by the fws and nmfs on may 31 2002 on the bureaus 10year plan again fi nding jeopardy but also recommending reasonable and prudent alterna tives to avoid jeopardy these opinions are discussed further below however on june 3 2002 the bureau formally rejected both final biological opinions but opted instead to operate under oneyear plan that it asserts complies with the opinions overview the klamath river originates in sout hern oregon and travels 263 miles before emptying into the pacific ocean in northern california the klamath river basin or watershed covers approximately 12100 s quare miles see figure 1 and for water management is divide d into lower and upper river basins the upper basin see figure 2 lies largely above upriv er and east of the iron gate dam on the klamath river and includes three major lake areas upper klamath lower klamath and tule lakes the bureau operates the klamath project in the upper basin and under contract distributes water pr imarily to farms in the surrounding area authorized in 1905 and largely completed in 1907 the project is one of the oldest us reclamation projects and is the only reclamation project in the entire drainage project

many water rights in the upper basin rights have not been quantified but an adjudication to determine pre1909 water rights in that area is in progress in oregon3 bureau facilities control water flows of the klamath and lost rivers in the upper basin between the link river dam at the outlet of the upper klamath lake and water level regulation dam at keno oregon bureau water supplies are used by multiple landowners as portion of irrigation water is returned to str eams or canals for downstream use serious concerns over the poor water quality of these return flows particularly including high nutrient levels have surfaced in recent years upper klamath lake is natural lake with water releases controlled by the link river diversion dam this lake is the primary source for project water but is not storage reservoir such as is found at other reclamation project sites it has little storage carryover from year to year and depends on current precipitati on and snowmelt for water s upply currently there is relatively little storage capacity in the klamath system compared to reclamation projects elsewhere although some sump areas might be purchased and used for water storage the link river dam controls flows from upper klamath lake sending some water downriver and so into the canal for irrigation distribution the dam is operated and maintained by pacifi corp an energy company that operates several hydroelectric and reregulating da ms on the klamath river pursuant to ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31098crs4 4 other farms in the klamath project are served by other sources such as

effects of project operati ons on the two listed suckers in 1993 fws issued recovery plan for the two species of suckers14 in 1997 the nmfs listed the southern oregonnorthern california coas ts population of coho salmon as threatened under the esa15 the 1992 fws biological opinion required the bureau to develop longterm operations plan which has only recently been completed the bureau consulted with the fws annually since 1995 on the effects of yearly project operations on endangered suckers and with nmfs for coho salmon for 1998 and 1999 however federal district court faulted the bureau for failing to formally consult with nmfs on the effects of irrigation releases on downstream coho salmon under its 2000 operating plan and enjoined prohibited the bureau fro m making further

annual operating plan was based was 41368 feet above mean sea level fws notes the bureaus proposed level is more than 2 ft below the elevation the bureau previously considered minimally necessary to protect the suckers 4139 feet and is more than 3 ft below the level that the service recommended in its formal consultation stage the minimum level established in the april 2001 biological opinions is 4140 feet unless the bureau advise s fws that anticipated water flows into the lake will not be sufficient to meet that targ et in the latter case coordination process outlined in the april 5 biological opinion is to be used the 1992 biological opinion on the effects of project operations on the suckers established minimum levels for upper klamath lake in september at 4139 feet wh ich

releasing cer tain flows from the lake to benefit the coho salmon and also the refuge and bald eagles because of severe drought conditions nmfs and fws determined that there was not enoug h water to implement both draft opinions as well as provide irrigation water for farmers the 1992 biological opinion had included an rpa that allowed lower minimum ie less restrictive lake vels than the more recent april 2001 biological opinions thereby allowing more water to flow to farms and other downstream areas than was allowed under the 2001 opinions on april 5 and april 6 2001 within 3 days of the courts ruling on the 2000 annual plan fws and nmfs each released final biological opinion that again concluded that the bureaus proposed operation of the project for 2001 would jeopardize the continued existence of the two species of suckers and the population of coho salmon and would harm but not jeopardize the continued existence of the bald eagles fws and nmfs recommended adjusting the minimum levels of upper klamath lake and klamath river flows to reflect the reduced water available for the 2001 water year fws proposed minimum lake elevation of 4139 feet bove sea level provided that minimum surface leve l of 4140 feet was sustained on long term basis18 fws maintained that this elevation level would improve water quality and increase habitat for juvenile and adult suckers and provide sucker access to spawning areas nmfs proposed range of minimum stream flows below iron gate from april through september the bureau announced its response on april 6 implementing proposed alternatives that severely limited the livery of irrigation water for the 2001 water year the bureau stated that the normal for nondry or noncritically dry year 70000 acrefeet af of water would be available for lands receiving water from clear lake and gerber reservoirs but that water would be available from upper klamath lake for deliveries to irrigators or to the lower klamath national

the shasta river29 controversy has significantly intensified since the listing of the suckers as endangered in 1988 and the listing of th coho salmon population as threatened in 1997 these listings together with judicial recognition of the senior rights of the tribes have resulted in the reprioritization of water such that in times of drought it is now the irrigators who may receive less water however with the state of oregons adjudication of water rights not yet completed and the status of the coho listing pending appeal there currently appear s to be clear resolution to the question of how and when specific amounts of water shall be allocated and to what purposes the bureau began acquiring water rights for the federal project in 1905 and filed formal application with th state of

affect klamath basin water allocations is not yet clear the ninth circuit also held that the bureau rather than the power company that operates link river dam is liable for water allocations and irrigators are not third party beneficiaries of the contract between the bureau and the operator and therefore cannot sue to enforce the terms of the operatin g contract as part of its reasoning the

quality is yet another aspect of these concerns with two distinct issues 1 in the upper basin agricultural runoff harms water quality of upper klamath lake and is addressed by the state of oregon while 2 in the lower basin water quality concerns related to low flows below iron gate dam are addressed by the state of california thus while there are actions that can be taken by the project to minimize impacts to listed fish eg install fish screens alter upper klamath lake levels modify water releases affecting downstream river flows salmon recovery will likely also require actions on private lands outside the project possibly including conservation easements or c ooperative restoration project s with private landowners until both esalisted suckers and coho salmon recover water quality concerns related to upper klamath lake levels as well as downstr eam river flow requirements could result in water shortage s for project farmers not just in drought years the result could include steps to modify farmin g practices to reduce irrigation runoff thus imposing another economic hardship on the klamath farmers and probably resulting in renewed requests for the fede ral government to assist th em in addressing these new restrictions upper basin poor water quality in upper klamath lake has killed fish and limits the ability to recover esalisted suckers52 water quality is largely influenced by the bluegreen algae aphanizomenon flosaquae which can become extremely abundant in upper klamath lake fish kills are associated with extended periods of calm conditions and high algae populations collapse of the gae populati ons and algae decay cause dissolved oxygen levels in lake water to decrease below 40 milligrams per liter mgl for 1024 hours day for as long as several days condition known as hypoxia fish kills tinue for 2030 days after the periods of hypoxia the project affects the water quality of upper klamath lake to the extent that nutrients from lands within the project area flow into upper klamath lake and promote algae growth water quality problems are also related to the loss of wetlands adjacent to upper klamath lake and to land use practices in the tributaries to the lake which are outside the project area the february 2002 nas interim report could not substantiate any connection betw een fish mortality and the surface water level of upper klamath lake in november 2001 the oregon department of environmental quality released draft state plan for improving water quality of the upper basins lakes and rivers53 focusing on reducing

achievedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31098crs20 lower basin water quality in the tributaries to the klamath river below upper klamath lake is key to concerns for coho and chinook salmon in the lower basin for example the shasta and scott rivers were essentially drawn completely dry in the summer of 2001 by irrigation wit hdrawals on principally private lands in addition salmon populations of the mainst em klamath river below iron gate dam river mile 190 are often exposed to impai red water quality that can cause stress induced or direct fish kills the state of california has identified temperature dissolved oxygen and nutrients as water quality parameters of concern in the mainstem klamath river below iron gate dam the california state wa ter resources control board swrcb is required under 303 of the federal clean wa ter act cwa and the california water code 13240 to adopt water quality standards in res ponse to these requirements the swrcb has prepared water quality control plan basin plan that designates the beneficial uses of waters to be protected along with the water quality objectives necessary to protect those uses agricultural and other land use practices that reduce riparian vegetation raise water temperatures in the klamath basin watershed temperatures periodically reach levels that are lethal to some fish speci this combined with elevated nutrient levels stimulates aquatic plant and algae growth as water temperatures rise and plants and algae decompose the level of dissolved oxygen decreases dissolved oxygen levels in the klamath river often fall below californias water quality objective of 70 mgl as result of enfo rcement of the cwa the establishment of total maximum daily loads tmdls is in progress and will be completed by 2003 for ph dissolved oxygen temperature and probably for pesticides herbicides and organic growth implementation of this tmdl process is likely to result in additional water quality measures on sources identified with these pollutants the february 2002 nas interim report did not find scientific support for nmfs proposed minimum flows below iron ga dam as means of enhancing the maintenance and recovery of the c oho population however the nas committee noted that progressive depletions of flow s in the klamath river main stem would at some point be detrimental to coho salmon through stra nding or predation losses discussion although water supply issues were made more acute by the severe drought of 2001 the water resources supply and demand in the klamath basin are such that conflicts will persist becau demands are greater than current supplies various interests have rights to klamath basin water including farmers other private interests several tribes and the us government still others are interested in waterrelated resources of the basin while the department of the inte rior through the bureau has contractual obligations to deliver available water to irrigators within the project area it also has statutory responsibilities to prot ect the ecosystems of which several specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31098crs21 54 16 usc 1531b 55 the federal government also has statutory obligations to study potential environmental effects of major federal actions although the preparation of such environmental studies has not been part of the current debate court recently expressed concern that the bureau was avoiding the usual process for considering alternatives for managing basin water via preparation of an environmental impact statem ent by not developing longterm basin wide operating plan infra note 20 kandra supra at 3536 the bureau has now released 10year planmay be part54 and to avoid jeopardizing species listed as threatened or endangered under the esa55 it may also have trust respons ibilities for certain tribal treaty and nontreaty fishing and water rights within both the upper and lower basins in addition the hydropower facilities in the area are licensed by ferc these licenses are due to expire in 2006 these considerati ons combined with the additional economic interests in the lower basin make the klamath situation far more complicated than fish vs farmer scenario outlined in numerous press reports while the water crisis in the klamath basin is itself local or regional conflict the contentions over water use in the basin re flect broader national issues first the immediate situation calls into question the adequacy of basinwide planning for droughts that diminish water supplies below levels necessary to sustain both fishwildlife and irrigation second the co mpetition for water in the klamath basin is by means unique especially in the arid west where scarce supplies remain static but human populations and demands tinue to rise such competition is increasingly concern even in more wa terabundant areas of heavy population growth where competition among alternative uses of water is becoming more intense similar conflicts are brewing in other basins incl uding the columbia and snake river system in the northwest the san joaquin and sacram ento basins in california involving san francisco baydelta the missouri river system in the northern plains states and the florida everglades in some areas existin g water needs or allocations actually exceed normal supplies in which case drought as in the klamath basin even if transitory highlights more fundamental resource allocation problem although the impacts of water shor tages and the competition for limited resources are felt primarily at the local and regional levels the institutions and rules that affect those impacts and mediate those competitions occur at all levels and often ultimately occur at the federal level the klamath situation is microcosm of similar situations at the moment of conflict the water the nd the farmers the fishermen the tribes the fish and wildlife the communities all seem to be local concerns but adjudication of water rights involves state and federal determina tions many of the wildlife are migratory which invokes treaty obligations as do some of the tribal considerations endangered species are involved invoking federal statutory responsibilities parts of the nd are federally owned many of the private lands are served by longstanding federal reclamation and farm programs and various citizens from across the nation may feel they have stake in outcomes thus competing responsibilities among local state regional and federal roles become inevitablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31098crs22 56 2001 us dist lexis 6932 17mediation efforts that began

from crafting sitespecific legislation to compensate for losses resulting from given policy to repeal or rewriting of the included in this mix are proposals to fund implementation of locally or regionally developed ecosystem restoration plans such as those developed to addre ss water management in the florida everglades and the california baydelta some believe that it is time to rethink the desirability of the federal policy of using scarce water supplies to sustain traditional crops on arid lands to the detriment of other va lues that have come to the fore since 1909 and that it is time to attempt basinwide approach to water allocation and use they contend that the endangerment of species indicates d eclining or unhealthy re source base others note further that the number of irrigated acres should be reduced to better correspond with the amounts of water likely to be availa ble for that use and some farmers in the area have offered to sell their lands to accomplish this result others however strongly object to such ideas and many wish to see the amended or special statutory provisions enacted to ensure that farming is recognized as priority in the basin congress may consider variety of responses to the situation in the klamath basin congressional developments to date are discussed below legislative activity the 107th congress has reacted to the controversy in
