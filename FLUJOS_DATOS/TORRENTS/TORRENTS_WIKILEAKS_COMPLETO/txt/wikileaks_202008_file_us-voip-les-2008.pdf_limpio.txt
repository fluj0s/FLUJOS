rough open circuits but data is transmitted wirelessly between phones and repeater towers each call follows single continuous route just as traditional telephone call does teleco traditional analog telephonepots plain old telephone system analog connectionpots plain old telephone system analog connection traditional analog telephonepstn mixture of analog digital and electromechanical signals figure 1 example of traditional phone networka circuit could be compared to pipe traditional telephone call creates single pipe from the caller to the call recipient the entire call is transmi tted through this same virtual pipe when the call is finished this virtual pipe ceases to exist t he next time the caller makes telephone call new virtual pipe is created for the new phone calltraditional phone systems cont for example john wants to make call he picks up the phone and dials number that number signals the phone company to open direct circuit to the phone number he is calling when the other phone is answered the circuit is complete until john or the other phone is hung up digital signal is broken into small chunks of data or packets that consist of 1s and 0s digits when digital signal is sent over the internet the packets are still sent in sequence but because the packets may take different routes to reach the same destination they may not arrive in sequence each packet contains sequence number howev er so the packets can be reassembled at their destination into signal matching the originalhow voip calls are made pure voip telephone call originates from voip phone or computer with voip software application voice is broken down into data packets and sent via the internet unlike traditional phone system with one connected line the packets now on the internet may travel di fferent routes to their destination the packets are received and reassembled into voice signal at the receiving voip phone voip calls dont always have to end at another voip type phone calls

phones specifically designed to place calls through the internet or traditi onal analog phones with adaptors that allow them to place voip calls using the internet voip wireless phone voip wireless phones work in the same manner as the previously described vo ip phone however connections are made through the use of wireless also known as wifi or wireless fidelity hot spots such as available in internet cafes they may also be used with wireless routers in hom or businesses figure 4 common voip mobile phonevoip phones and com puter applications voip may make use of mix of traditional public phone network circuits and the internet or may be transmitted entirely via the internet with voip there three basic ways in which to make call from voip phone or traditional phone usin g voip adaptor from voip wireless phone or from an application on computer application on computer the last method used to place voip calls is through the use of computer applications such applications utilize software dialer microphone and speakers on computer to place call all the applications utilize the internet and can place calls to others with voip software applications voip phones or even traditional phones and cell phonesvoip software figure 5 common voip computer setup why use voip voip is becoming more popular as the techno logy improves and becomes more available some of the reasons that people or organizations are switching to voip are 1 long distance calls are low cost or even free with an internet connection as the voice signal is transmitted as data over the internet voip provid ers such as vonage offer unlimited calling with flat rate plans 2 voip still provides the same traditional services that have become standard such as call waiting three way calling caller id toll free numbers and call forwarding and often provides extra features not available through traditional telephone providers 3 when voip softwar applications such as skype are used calls can be placed from anywhere high speed internet connection is available if the callers is traveling the assign ed number stays with the phone as with cell phone 4 additional numbers called virtual or vanity numbers are available in other cities allowing people to call virtual numbers without having to pay for long distancelaw enforcement sensitive23 december 2008 law enforcement sensitiv law enforcement sensitiv 5criminal applications there are currently three main criminal applications associated with voip fraudscams threatening calls and the use of some voip software applications for secure communications voip through the practice of spoofing can allow individuals to make fraudulent or threatening calls with fake caller id or identifiable caller id displayed to the recipient in placing fraudulent calls crim inals can display the number of legitimate organization or person in order to solic it personal data for nefarious purposes presenting false caller id number can enable an individual to make an anonymous threatening telephone call in some cases crimin als will utilize voip applications to make mass computer controlled calls with an automated voice recording requesting the victim call designated number to verify credit information resulting in the theft of private credit or banking data this practice is known as vishing voip e911 was developed to allow voip providers in the us the ability to support emergency services the voip e911 emergencycalling system associates physical address with the calling partys telephone number as required by the wireless communicat ions and public safety act of 1999 however subscriber participation in e911 is not required and voip users can optout or disable e911 service on their lines if desired this example demonstrates that if an individual using voip does not want to be identified or located attempting to trace voip call is unlikely to yield positive results what can do tracing actively tracing voip call to source location is extremely difficult if not altogether impossible if the voip user is trying to conceal his or her identity or location tracing voip calls is also difficult with emergency 911 calls because voip telephone numbers are not tied to geographic location in the way that traditional telephone nu mbers are 911 calls from voip phones may not be properly directed to local di spatch center as result the fcc in 2005 adopted rules that require providers of interconnected voip services to supply 9 11 emergency calling capability to their customers voice over internet protocol voip and 911 fcc public safety homeland security bureau httpwwwfccgovpshsservices911 servicesvoipwelcomehtml identifying voip in the course of an investigation in which voip has been suspected as part of crime being able to identify voip components for search warrant or seizur is vital there are four parts to identify ing voip voip phone calls with caller id voip phone calls on phone records voip ph ones and associated hardware and voip so ftware on computers caller id when attempting to identify voip call based on caller id be aware that the caller id presented number may appear the same as any other common telephone number obscuring whether the call was placed using traditional phone system or voip system however if caller is intentionally masking or spoofing phone number false number may be displayed phone numbers that do not associate with regulated number guidelines ie movie numbers 555xxxx etc may indicate that the call was voip or iginated and changed via masking or spoofing of course spoofing can also change numbers to appear legitimate in order to throw blame onto another person or organizationlaw enforcement sensitive23 december 2008 law enforcement sensitiv law enforcement sensitiv 6caller id cont number masking is also common and legitimate practice used by many businesses and government entities that use their own internal telephone systems call numbers can be masked or changed on the caller id appearance of outgoing calls for instance company may want all outgoing calls from its employees to appear as if they ca from the companys main telephone number matter what the employees actual phone number is government agency may choose to mask its outgoing telephone numb ers to obscure its identity phone records records from the phone company will not indicate that the number is from voip system traditional telephone provid ers voip providers cell phone providers and businesses or organizations can purchase blocks of phone numbers from telecommunications companies the subscr iber information on those numbers may be associated with legitimate entity that can be located or the numbers may be associated with company that utilizes that number as conduit for multiple users at this point tracing the call becomes more like tracing an email separate request subpoena must be written to get the information from the voip provider many providers are incorporated outside of us jurisdiction and therefore do not have to fulfill the request if the provider does ho nor the request in most circumstances it will provide the account information which will include payment information and may or may not include the following name address email address ip address where the account was accessed theoretically the voip provider could have re cords of other calls placed by the subscr iber however most companies will not retain those records because of the data space required the payment informati on could be like any commerce purchase thod used with the email address credit card money order electronic funds transfer obtaining the account information will depend greatly on the provider figure 6 associating telephone number

subtle consider the fo llowing when trying to locate voip phonestradi tional phones utilize cables with rj11 conn ectors whereas voip phones will utilize cables with rj45 connectors fig 8 figure 7 cable comparison personal computers both laptops and desktops can be utiliz ed for voip as long as they have internet connectivity computer with micr ophone connected can also be sign that voip is being used however only an inspection of the applications install ed on the computer will definitively confirm th presence of voip software partial but significant common voip software applications can be found at httpenwikipediaor gwikicomparison_o f_voip_software traditional analog phones can become voip capable with the use of voip analog adaptor trace the ph one cord from traditional phone if the cord is connected to device that is then connected to computer or other networking hardware device such as cable modem or dsl modem the phone s been adapted for voip use fig 7 voip mobile phones are difficult to differentiate from tradi tional cell phones by the untrained eye f ig 4 turn over suspected voip mobile phones to technical personnel for fu rther inspectiontraditional phones will continue to work if home or businesss electrical power is unavailable because the telephone companys switches pr ovide the signaling power for traditional calls voip phones must get their electrical power directly from the home or business t hat is using voip power can be supplied to the phone with power adapter by pl ugging the phone into an electrical outlet or via an rj45 cable most home voip systems will not have this capability but many business voip systems will figure 8 displays an example of voip setup utilizing an adaptorlaw enforcement sensitive23 december 2008 law

act of 1994 which previously appli ed to traditional phone companies but not voip providers calea requires that voip carriers provide law enforcement agencies the means with the proper warrants to tap into and record voice conversations and to trace the source and destination of calls made through the carriers networks however due to the international nature of the internet it may be impossible to legally wiretap conversations that are supported by foreign voip offering companies compiled by the mnjac with assistance from bca tech support if you have any questions concerns or feedback please
