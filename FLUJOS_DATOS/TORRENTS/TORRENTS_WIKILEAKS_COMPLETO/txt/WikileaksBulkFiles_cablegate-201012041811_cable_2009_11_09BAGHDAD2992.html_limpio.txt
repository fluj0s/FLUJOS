summary iran is dominant player in iraqs electoral politics and is using its close ties to shia kurdish and select sunni figures to shape the political landscape in favor of united shia victory in the january election proiran shiadominated and preferably islamist government led by united shia alliance remains irans top priority toward that end iran is seeking to increase pressure on maliki to join forces with the other prominent shia coalition iraqi national alliance led by the sadrists and the islamic supreme council of iraq isci end summary 2 s iran is arguably the most influential regional power seeking to shape and influence the outcome of iraqs election this message offers an assessment of irans efforts to shape iraqs electoral politics in anticipation of the national election in january irans policy goals and tools 3 s irans overarching political objective for iraqs january election is the reelection of shiadominated preferably islamist coalition led by tehrans closest allies notably isci and the sadrist trend under the rubric of the iraqi national alliance coalition ina reftel iraq given its proximity to iran and its shared shia heritage represents vital foreign policy priority for the iranian governments irig efforts to project its ideology and influence in the region an economically dependent and politically subservient iraq would foster greater strategic depth for tehran iranian president ahmadinejad has referred to iraq in recent press statements as shia base confronting the broader menace perpetrated by those opposed to iraqs identity and stability ie sunni states the west 4 s irans approach to its bilateral relationship with iraq ranges from political micromanagement to broad strategic guidance emanating directly from supreme leader khamenei in tehran the irig recognizes that influence in iraq requires operational and at times ideological flexibility as result it is not uncommon for the irig to finance and support competing shia kurdish and to some extent sunni entities with the aim of developing the iraqi body politics dependency on tehrans largesse while exact figures are unknown tehrans financial assistance to iraqi surrogates is estimated at usd 100200 million annually with usd 70 million going to iscibadr coffers 5 s since at least 2003 brigadier general qasem soleimani the commander of the islamic revolutionary guards corpsqods force irgcqf has been the point main directing the formulation and implementation of the irigs iraq policy with authority second only to supreme leader khamenei through his irgcqf officers and iraqi proxies in iraq notably iranian ambassador and irgcqf associate hassan kazemiqomi soleimani employs the full range of diplomatic security intelligence and economic tools to influence iraqi allies and detractors in order to shape more proiran regime in baghdad and the provinces 6 s soleimani enjoys longstanding close ties with several prominent goi officials including president talabani vicepresident adel abdalmahdi isci prime minister maliki dawa former pm jaafari and more recently speaker samarrai septel reports iranian speaker qrecently speaker samarrai septel reports iranian speaker larijanis november 47 visit to iraq at samarrais invitation khamenei president ahmadinejad speaker larijani and former president rafsanjani consult regularly with visiting goi officials as part of the irigs broader strategic council of advisers seeking to influence the goi 7 s irans tools of influence include financial support to and pressure on crossspectrum of iraqi parties and officials economic development assistance notably to religious organizations lethal aid to select militant shia proxies and sanctuary to iraqi figures fearful of usg targeting or those seeking to revitalize their politicalreligious credentials most notably moqtada alsadr this leverage also extends to lesser extent to select sunni actors including such public figures as iraqi speaker samarrai whose september visit to tehran included baghdad 00002992 002 of 003 meetings with several senior irig officials preelection jockeying 8 s predictably iran is actively lobbying and recruiting iraqis of various political stripes and affiliations including sunnis in the runup to the election to ensure united shialed coalition government given the likelihood of shialed victory in the election iran appears more concerned about the strength of united shia bloc in the postelection phase of government formation for iran rebellious maliki pursuing more nationalist vs sectarian agenda risks splitting the shia vote which in turn weakens the shia political blocs negotiating strength during the government formation period postelection irans greatest fear for the upcoming election is fractured shia coalition that is unable to coalesce and thereby dominate the next government irans worstcase election scenario increasingly unrealistic is coup detat of former regime elements hostile to tehran 9 s weak shia coalition before or after the election would further undermine the ina and their proiranian entities notably isci and the sadrist trend the kurds historically closer to isci remain the important swing vote and are unlikely to reveal their true coalition intentions until after the election as seasoned masters of the iraqi political chessboard kurdish leaders such as talabani and barzani will likely exploit their political strength among shiasunni counterparts to protect and expand kurdish influence in future government irans historic ties to the puk and to lesser extent kdp officials make the kurds an important element in ensuring proiranian shia victory in the election ina officials are confident that the kurds will join their coalition all but guaranteeing an election victory an unknown factor in national elections is the kurdish opposition party goran list under the leadership of former puk secretary general nawshirwan mustafa goran is committed to unseating the puk and talabani in suleymaniyah province but needs financial backing to ensure its longterm viability in the krg and national politics iran could conceivably alleviate gorans financial woes particularly through its close ties with the kurdish jaff tribe some of whom are goran members however doing so would undermine the irigs valued relationship with talabani while also proving exceedingly duplicitous even by irig and krg standards 10 s it is important to note that irans power in iraq although extensive is not without limitations the irigs greatest political roadblock remains the domineering authority and religious credibility embodied in grand ayatollah ali sistani despite his iranian heritage sistani is iraqs most revered shia religious and political authority critic of irans velayetefaqih rule of the jurisprudent system of theocratic governance sistanis abstemious aka quietest school approach to shia politics has kept him well above the political fray while at the same time ensuring him significant impact on those rare occasions when he pronounces on politics for example sistanis public support for an open list ballot was instrumental in prompting isci sadrist trend malikis state of law and other shia parties to follow suit despite tehrans preference for closed list domestic political realities will continue to force shia political parties like isci dawa qwill continue to force shia political parties like isci dawa and sadr trend with close historic ties to iran to balance between support for broader iraqishia agenda as championed by sistani and the alternative championed by iran that would subordinate iraqi interests to irans broader objectives septel soft vs hard power 11 s following the gois crackdown on iraniansupported sadrist militias in basrah during the charge of the knights operation in march 2008 iran has calibrated its operations in iraq to encompass more soft power economic religious educational support and investment as part of broader hearts and minds campaign note iranian lethal aid to militant proxies continues however on less visible scale end note with annual bilateral trade estimated at usd 4 billion up 30 percent since 2008 and comprised mostly of iranian imports approximately 48 percent of iraqs imports are iranian goods the irig continues to jockey for economic domination in iraq through targeted development assistance focused largely on refurbishment of shia religious shrines baghdad 00002992 003 of 003 and trade deals and bilateral agreements aimed at fostering greater iraqi economic dependency on iran this measure has been successful largely because of irans geographic proximity and access to iraqi markets that are otherwise financially or politically less appealing to other states notably the united states europe and other industrialized nations turkey on the other hand remains irans biggest economic competitor particularly in the kurdistan regional government krg implications for us policy 12 s comment concerns about longterm us influence albeit tempered by the withdrawal deadline continue to inform irig decisionmaking to ensure its strategic foothold in iraq iran views iraq as natural and more junior strategic partner as result iran will continue to flex its muscles to ensure its strategic outcomes are met this should not lead to alarmist tendencies or reactions on our part the next iraqi government will continue to cultivate close ties with iran given longstanding historical realities that precede iraqs ties with the united states on the other hand irans influence in iraq should not be overestimated as the goi continues to gain its footing points of divergence between tehran and baghdad become increasingly evident on such sensitive bilateral issues as water hydrocarbons maritime borders and political parity some prominent iraqi leaders including those with close ties to iran ie maliki ammar alhakim are increasingly sensitive to being labeled iranian lackeys 13 s comment contd our objective in iraq should be less about countering allthings iranian and more about developing viable alternatives and approaches that gradually alter the gois political economic and social worldview development of viable international alternatives in iraq is one of the most effective measures of countering iranian ambitions and ultimately integrating iraq as constructive member of the international community specifically our ongoing efforts to bolster the goi through capacitybuilding and assistance within the strategic framework agreement sfa and to remove iraq from chapter vii remain our most valuable tools in this regard given the value placed on the sfa by the goi and the iraqi public our ability to recognize enhance and exploit the value of the partnership will constitute an essential element of any effort to counter malign iranian influence hill
