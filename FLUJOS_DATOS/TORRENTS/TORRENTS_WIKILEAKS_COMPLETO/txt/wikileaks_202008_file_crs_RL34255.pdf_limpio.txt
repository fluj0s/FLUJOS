g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 on september 14 2007 president george w bush signed into law the honest leadership and open government act s 1 110th congress the bill addressed wide variety of topics such as ethics campaign finance and lobbying s 1 also made number of procedural revisions affecting the senate one which is the focus of this report section 512 of title v of the new law pl 110 81 specifically dealt with the issue of holds holds are an informal custom of the senate that until enactment of s 1 were mentioned neither in chamber rules or precedents nor in any statute hold as one senator explained is notice by senator to his or her party leader of an intention to object to bringing bill or nomination to the floor for consideration 1 their potency as blocking delaying or bargaining device is linked to senators ability to conduct filibusters or object to unanimous consent agreements or requests to be sure it is ultimately up to the majority leader of the senatewho sets the chambers agenda after consulting various peopleto decide whether or for how long he will honor colleagues hold if the majority leader cannot get unanimous consent to bring up measure or matter then he can make motion to call it up that motion is subject to extended debate but senator can under the practices of the senate prevent the majority leader from making that motion the controversy that precipitated enactment of section 512 involved secret or anonymous holds two senators in particular worked for years to end the practice of lawmakers placing secret holds on measures or matters their goal was not to eliminate holds but to infuse the custom with transparency and accountability so senators would know which of their colleagues had holds on various bills or nominations knowing which senators has hold on measure or matter enables senatorial advocates of those proposals to meet with the holder to discuss whether or under what circumstances the hold might be lifted in 2006 for example these two proponents of ending secret holds succeeded in winning adoption of an amendment to an ethics lobbying and rules reform package s 2349 that would end the practice by establishing new standing order of the senate like section 512 of s 1 their amendment required the majority and minority leaders to recognize holdcalled notice of intent to object to proceedingonly if it was provided in writing by member of their caucus moreover noted former party leader for the hold to be honored the senator objecting would have to publish his objection in the congressional record 3 days after the notice is provided to leader 2 one of the principal authors of the amendment provided this explanation of their proposal 1 congressional record vol 148 april 17 2002 p s2850 two other views of holds are provided by former senate majority leader and republican senator as the majority leader stated in many instances senators put holds on bill not to prevent its coming up but to alert the respective party floor staffs that they want to be notified before the bill is called up they may have amendments they may want to be notified when it is coming up so it is not always for the purpose of keeping bill from coming up see congressional record vol 133 december 9 1987 p 34449 the gop senator said hold is notice that senator wishes to be on the floor when the matter which is the subject of his interest is considered so he might protect his rights he added within reason it means that my leader or the floor manager or whomever is responsible is obligated by the traditions and customs of this body to call up on the telephone and say you better get over here if you want to be protected if you are going to exercise your hold that means come over here and object or come over and debate the motion it happens thousands of times year see congressional record vol 132 february 20 1986 p s1465 2 congressional record vol 152 march 28 2006 p s2458

standing order would provide that simple form be filled out much like we do when we add cosponsors to bill senators would have full 3 session days from placing the hold to submit the form to their respective party leader the hold would then be published in the congressional record and the senate calendar it is just as simple as that 3 nothing in the authors amendment required the majority leader to honor formal notice of intent to object to proceeding or hold or any other message by member that he or she intends to oppose any unanimous consent request to take up measure or matter s 2349 required enactment into law before the new holds policy could take effect but the 109 th congress adjourned before this could occur with the passage of s 1 in 2007 the senate adoptedfor the first time evera formal and statutory policy limiting the ability of senators to place anonymous holds

notice of objecting to proceeding its fundamental purpose is to promote more openness and transparency in the holds process section 512 is neither senate rules change nor standing order of the senate except as to the establishment of notice of intent calendars by the secretary of the senate instead section 512 is directive to the majority and minority leaders of the senate stating that before hold is recognized by them certain procedures must be observed by senators in effect it is the responsibility of each member to comply with the terms of the new policy there is enforcement device or method to ensure compliance except the stipulation that party leaders shall not honor notice of intent or hold if senators do not follow the specified procedures the majority and minority leaders consult regularly about the senates agenda and keep each other apprised of members who have placed holds on measures or matters section 512 states in generalthe majority leaders and minority leaders of the senate or their designees shall recognize notice of intent of senator who is member of their caucus to object to proceeding to measure or matter only if the senator 1 following the objection to unanimous consent to proceeding to and or passage of measure or matter on their behalf submits the notice of intent in writing to the appropriate leader or their designee and 3 ibid march 8 2006 p s1874 during colloquy on the proposal senator asked for clarification of the amendments intent with respect to what she called temporary hold she stated let give you specific example occasionally bills will be discharged from thei r authorizing committees these are not necessarily on the calendar they are discharged from the committee and the bill will be hotlined on both of our sides to see if there is any objection obviously putting temporary stay on the consideration of discharged bill in order to allow few hours for review or even day for review is completely di fferent from the practice of secretly killing bill by putting an indefinite anonymous hold in response one of the main authors of the amendment agreed with the senator and remarked that we make very clear that it is not our intent ion to bar those consults we like to use the word consult which is protected tool for senator as opposed to the question of hold i think perhaps another way to clarify it is consult is sort of like yellow light you put up little bit of cautionthat we need bit of time to take look at it hold is red light when you are not supposed to go forward we dont want people to be able to exercise those holds in secret in fact to ensure that we have this kind of consult procedure we call for 3 days before an individual has to put in the congressional record that they have hold on matter ibid p s1874 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34255g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g152g151 g561g515g10g152g149g141g156

submitting for inclusion in the congressional record the following notice i senator xxxx do not object to proceed to xxxx dated xxxx to summarize the formal process to curb secret holds is triggered when certain steps are followed by senator these steps apply in limited circumstances and could be bypassed in at least two ways 1 if senators on their own initiative publicly state that they have holds on measures or matters or alternatively they simply object on their own to unanimous consent request to call up measure or matter or 2 they privately inform their party leader of their intent to block floor consideration of certain measures or matters and the majority leader never requests that they come up as senator stated the mere threat of hold prevents unanimous consent requests to take up measures or matters from being made in the first place 4 the principal features of section 512 specify the exact steps for making secret hold public the process begins when any senator states that he or she on behalf of colleague is objecting to unanimous consent requestcommonly made by the majority leader or the majority floor managerto proceed to or pass measure or matter that colleague must then submit notice of intent hold letter to the appropriate party leader or their designee specifying the reasons for his or her objections to certain measure or matter 4 congressional record vol 153

intent letter the senator placing the hold submits the notice to be printed in the congressional record and in separate section of the appropriate calendar the majority leader and the minority leader or their respective designee are then obliged to recognize hold placed by member of their caucus recognition does not mean that the majority leaderwho schedules the senates businessmust honor the hold senator may withdraw his or her hold prior to the expiration of the 6session day period he or she is then under obligation to have their hold letter printed in the congressional record and noted in the appropriate senate calendar to remove their hold from the appropriate senate calendar senator submits notice for inclusion in the congressional record stating that he or she longer objects to proceeding to measure or matter worth underscoring is that under the terms of section 512 senator is required to disclose his or her hold only after another lawmaker formally objects on their behalf to unanimous consent request to proceed to measure or matter if the senator who is the true objector wants to continue with the section 512 process he or she must then submit notice of intent leader to their party leader then the sixsessionday clock begins to tick just when the sixsessionday period starts and ends may require specific parameters until an objection is made on the floor of the senate secret hold could exist for days weeks or months without any knowledge of that reality by the sponsors and advocates of bills or nominations it is also useful to note that senator wh publicly objects on his or her own behalf to unanimous consent request to proceed to or pass measure need not follow the section 512 process the disclosure has occurred publicly and members know who is the objector thus the name of the objector would not be required to be published in the congressional record or the appropriate calendar of the senate several reasons account for the sixday lapse before senators are obliged to transmit notice of intent letter to their party leader the six days gives members time to study measure or matter receive feedback from affected state agencies if any or if necessary draft an amendment to measure that addresses their specific concerns for example on bills that are hotlinedspecial telephone lines in members offices to inform them of the two party leaders intent to pass legislation by unanimous consent unless lawmakers object within certain time periodsenators might take exception to bills prompt consideration on the floor because they want several days to review the measure the six days enable senators to research and decide what their reaction to measure should be without being criticized for delaying action on bill or subjected to outside special interest pressure for having hold on groupbacked bill when the end result might be senatorial approval of the legislation furthermore although section 512s goal as already noted is to promote more openness in the holds process senators have numerous private ways to inform party leaders of their opposition to measures or matters these types of private messagespersonal letters telephone calls hallway chats emails and so oncould be characterized as the functional equivalent of secret holds if the majority leader is out running on the national mall and another senator comes running by and shouts as he passes im going to block that bill is that hold senators are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34255g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g152g151 g561g515g10g152g149g141g156

noted legislative scholar5 recent example occurred at the start of the 110th congress when senator on february 5 2007 sent dear colleague letter to all members the letters purpose was to communicate to all senators list of principles i will use to evaluate new legislation in the 110th congress i also want to give you advance notice i intend to object to consideration of legislation that violates these common sense principles6 the newness of section 512 means that there is not yet much information or evidence of how the policy for limiting secret holds is to be implemented in practice as one of the senates principal advocates for ending anonymous holds said shortly after s 1 was signed into law i have to tell my colleagues that i dont know how section 512 is going to work7 sectionbysection analysis of s 1 was inserted in the congressional record by the relevant committee chair to provide some legislative history regarding the procedures for constraining secret holds8 time experience and ongoing parliamentary familiarity with the new procedures seem likely to answer various questions that surely will arise as to section 512s practical application among several

previously and privately informed party aders that he would object to calling up s 223 the senators staff denied that the member had an anonymous hold on the bill and gop leadership aides stated that republican objections to the bill did not amount to hold11 on the other hand one senator stated that the member who objected publicly has made it plain that he is the one holding up the bill by

5000 or more to the organization12 another senator citing section 512s immediate applicability to senate proceedings said in si x legislative days we must know who it is who placed the hold on s 22313 section 512 became effective when the president signed s 1 into law three days later on september 27 the same senator who objected to bringing up s 223 asked unanimous consent to call up that bill but with the stipulation that only his aforementioned amendment would be made in order for floor consideration he observed that there are anonymous outside groups who are filing ethics complaints for political reasons and the senate needs to know that and transparency is the best way to find that out 14 senator objected to that request on behalf of the chair of the reporting committee then in first for the senate section 512 was formally invoked when the chair of the relevant committee of jurisdiction sent letter to the majority leader the letter stated in part as you know under the provisions of the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 section 512 of pl 11081 senator is required to submit notice of intent to object letter when another senator objects to unanimous consent request on hisher behalf please consider this letter as my notice of intent to object to colleagues proposed nongermane amendment to s 223 the senate campaign disclosure parity act 15 as required by section 512 the letter identified the senator placing the hold the date the objection was filed and the reasons for objecting to proceeding to measure or matter the senators letter was printed in new notice of intent section of the congressional record subsequently the calendar of business of the senate included the senators objection in the required section entitled notice of intent to ob ject to proceeding recall that section 512 calls upon the secretary of the senate to establish such section in both the calendar of business and the executive calendar since enactment of section 512 senator has come forward to state affirmatively and explicitly that he or she has hold on s 22316 moreover it is not clear if other senators have indicated to their respective party leader that they would object to calling up the campaign bill under the terms of section 512 and this point is made in the abovecited letter senator is required to disclose his or her hold only after another lawmakeron behalf of fellow colleagueobjects to unanimous consent request to proceed then the sixsessionday clock begins to tick just when the sixsessionday period starts and ends may require additional clarification until an objection is made secr et hold could exist for days weeks or months 12 congressional record vol 153 september 24 2007 p s11998 13 ibid p s11997 14 congressional record vol 153 september 27 2007 p s12207 15 congressional record vol 153 october 2 2007 p s12419 this notice of intent letter was inserted in the congressional record by the majority leader the next day the author of the letter also placed it in the congressional record p s12561 16 it might be worth noting that section 512 specifically references holds placed by senator it does not address the case of group of senators who object to pro ceeding to measure or matter if the willingness to block measure or matter is the collective decision of an informal or formal group members there might be uncertainty as to which group member is expected to transmit notice of intent letter to their party leader in such case it seems likely that the relevant party leader would lodge an objection on behalf of number of members who oppose the legislation or nomination the leaders objection on behalf of group of members would not appear to initiate the provisions of section 512 which focus on senator httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34255g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g152g151 g561g515g10g152g149g141g156 g516g497g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561

g349g561without any knowledge of that reality by the sponsors and advocates of bills or nominations to be sure senators can publicly announce their holds in whatever way or forum they prefer17 some senators have policy of always publicly announcing their holds g21g140g152g153g142g561g152g143g561g5g152g159g142g155g138g144g142g561 section 512 addresses measures or matters past practices regarding the placement of holds on measures or matters appear likely to continue in effect but this issue might give rise to questions that require clarification the senates tradition of holds has long been an informal practice so there is relatively little detailed public information about this custom for example there is official public senate record of who places holds how many holds are placed by senators on different types of bills nominations or other matters how long holds are honored by the majority leader the differences among hold requests the frequency of holds during different periods of legislative session or which senators are more or less likely to place holds such as majority or minority lawmakers senior rather than junior senators or liberal versus conservative members available public materials on the custom appear to suggest that holds may be placed on various types of measures or mattersalthough there is definitive list so far as is known of the various measures and matters that over time have been the subject of holds party records are likely to be incomplete and lack important inform ation hold letters may also be housed in the personal papers or archives of former party leaders 18 senator may remove hold at any time and section 512 specifies the procedure for removing public hold from the senates two calendars the lifting of hold by member does not prevent other senators from putting holds on the same measure or nomination with section 512s adoption it is not certain whether some or all of the past practices on holds will still be observed whether these past practices are fully known is not clear because of as mentioned the traditional secrecy surrounding the practice for example extant public information on holds indicates that they have been placed on certain privileged business such as conference reports 19 in 2002 for instance it was reported that senator had placed secret hold on justice department authorization conference report20 if section 512 applies to conference reports can holds also be placed on related bicameral matter amendments between the chambers which are also privileged matters holds on privileged business seem less likely to be honored or honored for any lengthy period because the motion to take them up is nondebatable unclear too is whether the new policy on holds would continue to apply to various non privileged business such as the selection of conferees as former senator william s cohen r wrote i wanted to be appointed conferee and armed services chairman john stennis was unlikely to add my name to the list if i made such request i put hold on the 17 see for example tim starks senate panel oks surveillance bill cq today october 19 2007 p 1 18 see an unpublished paper by c lawrence evans and daniel lipinski holds legislation and the senate parties april 2005 this report analyzed almost 1000 holds found in the personal papers of former senate majority leader howard baker tn the

conferees which upset chairman stennis21 secret holds have made it difficult at times for the senate to agree to the usually routine motion to go to conference with the house to iron out bicameral disagreements on legislation mr president i move that the senate insist on its amendments or disagree to the house amendments request conference with the house on the disagreeing votes thereon and that the chair be authorized to appoint conferees any senator can object to this unanimous consent request and the floor manager would then have to make three separate motions insist or disagree request and authorize each motion is subject to filibuster noted former senate parliamentarian and require three separate cloture votes to close debate and that takes lot of time it basically stops the whole process of going to conference 22 in 2007 on bill s 378 to improve court security proponent of the measure stated that we are being blocked from going to conference by an anonymous hold23 g22g145g155g142g142g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 first topic that might require additional clarity is whether holds can still be applied to class of related measures or matters recall that the language of section 512 requires the following notice i senator xxxx intend to object to proceedings to xxxx accordingly would it still be possible for senator to place hold on all judicial nominations or treaties pending on the executive calendar or on all measures on the general orders calendar dealing with specific topic reported by one of the standing committees or is it the intent of section 512 to require senators to disclose their reasons as to why they are objecting for each measure or matter second the majority leader as noted earlier is the decider when it comes to honoring holds often the majority leader will honor holds at least for period of time both as courtesy to colleagues and as recognition that ignoring hold could trigger timeconsuming dilatory tactics in an institution that is typically workload packed and deadline driven on the other hand if the majority leader places holds on his own behalfon pending judicial nominations for example there are few if any effective ways to override the majority leaders decision how too are members to know if the majority leader has anonymous holds on measures or matters if he does not ask unanimous consent to call them up furthermore if senator placing hold is member of the majority party the majority leader might not even ask unanimous consent of the senate to take up measure or matter the result public disclosure of which senator has hold on the bill as senator said for instance it is not clear to what would happen if the minority leader asked unanimous consent to proceed to bill and the majority leader objected on his own behalf to protect his prerogative to set the agenda but also having the effect of honoring the hold of another member of the majority leaders caucus or what if the majority leader asked unanimous consent to proceed to bill and the minority leader objects but does not specify on whose behalf even though member of the minority party has hold would the minority senator with the hold then be required to disclose the hold i dont know it is not very clear 24 21 sen william s cohen roll call one year in the united states senate new

their reasons for objecting to consideration of measure or matter in notice of intent hold letter sent to their partys leader multiple reasons influence why senators might place hold on bill or nomination sometimes hold is employed to achieve purposes completely unrelated to action on the specific bill or nominee senators may place holds on bills or nominees they support because they want to gain bargaining leverage on an unrelated matter with the administration colleague committee chair or the other chamber as one senator told colleague who asked why he had placed hold on his bill i have objection to your bill at all senator but another senator who chairs committee has hold on one of my bills and therefore i looked up and down the list to see what bills were under his jurisdiction and i found yours and so i put hold on the bill reported out of committee 25 senate party leader remarked that there have been times when holds have been applied to every piece of committees legislation by an individual or group of senators not because they wish to be involved in consideration of t hose bills but as means of achieving unrelated purposes or leverage 26 senators might use retaliatory hold against members who are blocking floor consideration of their preferred legislation senators might be requested to place holds by house members executive officials or lobbyists in specifying why they are placing holds per the instructions contained in section 512 are senators expected to have complete discretion as to how many reasons and how much detail they provide in their noticeofintent letters or might the two party leaders expect reasonable amount of pertinent informationeither stated in the notice of intent letter or through other nonpublic wayson which they can make or evaluate their scheduling decisions g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 section 512 is work in progress some time needs to pass before reasonable assessment can be made of its impact and influence on senatorial decisionmaking and behavior experience in implementing section 512 will doubt provide clarity and perspective as to how the new provision is working in practice and whether it is fulfilling its fundamental purpose to infuse greater transparency in the holds process like any new change section 512 might also have unforeseen consequences for example holds do not have to be made public for six senate session days following an objection to proceeding to measure or matter one implication is that there might be surge of secret holds during the final few days of legislative session more than enough time to effectively kill bill or nominee in complete secrecy said senator 27 senators might organize revolving hold once an objection under section 512 is made to unanimous consent request then one member then another and so on might place hold on measure or matter but then remove it prior to the expiration of the sixsessionday period each 25 congressional record vol 133 december 9 1987 p 34449 26 carroll j doherty senate caught in the grip of its own holds system congressional quarterly w eekly report august

their partys leader simply the possibility that one or more senators appear willing to stall action on measure or matter might dissuade the majority leader from even trying to proceed to bill or nomination under this parliamentary scenario none of the senators who oppose bill or nomination would have to publicly disclose that they had hold on the measure or matter it is also unclear whether an individual senatorprior to the end of the sixse ssionday periodcould lift his or her hold and then reimpose it repeatedly following colleagues objection on his or her behalf to unanimous consent request made pursuant to the provisions of section 512 section 512 also might promote greater use of public holds outside special interests for example might encourage senators to use the new holds process to demonstrate their support for the groups agenda priorities in the judgment of one congressional scholar we could easily imagine different interest groups seeking out senators to go public with objections and say this is an opportunity for you to highlight an issue thats important to our constituency 28 senators in short may welcome the chance to admit and trum pet to the press media and their constituents that they have hold on certain measures or matters the hold as political scientists would say could be form of positiontaking and creditclaiming that might enhance senators reelection prospects on the other hand section 512 might produce decline in the use of holds i assume people will think twice before it is publicly distributed that they are stopping legislation remarked former senate parliamentarian29 senator did not see it this way however if i dont agree with bill why am i going to let it go he asked the members think section 512 will intimidate people into not holding bills but it doesnt bother me30 needless to say to make an assessment of whether public holds might increase or decline given the enactment of section 512 is problematic because of its limited applicability senators have wide array of techniqueswhich are akin to secret holdsto inform party leaders of their intent to block action on measures or matters senators too have always been able to make their holds public to conclude over the years various senators and party leaders have tried different ways to infuse more accountability and uniformity in the use of holds and to make clear that they are not veto on the majority leaders prerogative of proposing measures or matters for senate consideration 31 party leaders understand that holds function as an early warning system by alerting them to potential problems in scheduling measures or matters they also recognize that holds are less than sacrosanct as legislative circumstances change such as the approach of deadlines or the need to enact must pass legislation still it goes without saying that holds are prominent feature of the contemporary senate members realize their political and policy potential both as form of silent filibuster and as bargaining device holds influence the lawmaking and confirmation processes and the statutory policy seems certain to shed additional light on this heretofore largely behindthescenes custom as key proponent of ding secret holds said about section 512 its start 32 28 brian friel wrestling with holds national journal january 13 2007 p 47 29 stephanie woodrow
