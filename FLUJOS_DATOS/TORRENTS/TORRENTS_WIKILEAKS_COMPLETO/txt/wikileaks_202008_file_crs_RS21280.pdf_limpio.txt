harmless to humans mold can cause variety of ailments some molds can produ ce allergic reactions and others which are far less common but are hardly rare can produ ce toxic effects and infections symptoms associated with allergic reac tions to mold include aggravation of asthma runny nose congestion cough and eye irritation1 molds that release mycotoxins in the air such as the stachybotrys chartarum strain must reach toxic levels before illness occurs but when they do they can cause fatigue headaches nausea asthma and the inability to concentrate2 in the most serious but scientifically uncertain cases toxic molds allegedly can cause immune system disorders chroni c fatigue organ damage memory loss and bleeding in the lungs3 second mold can cause property damage residential and work environments provide three conditions for mold to thrive 1 warmth 40ยบ to 100ยบ f 2 moisture often resulting from leaky roof s defective plumbing drai nage problems flooding and even highhumidity and 3 nutrition such as certain types of insulation wood and carpeting4 modern energyefficient buildings provide conducive environment for mold growth sealed construction techniques can re sult in insufficient flows of fresh air and reduced evaporation of moisture creating warm moist breeding grounds older buildings also are not immune from mold contamination particularly in areas subject to flooding heavy storms or high humidity remediation costs vary with the scope of mold growth in these structures5 inspection costs alone can range from the low thousands to millions of dollars6 in the most extreme cases the buildings cannot be repaired but must be stripped to their foundations and rebuilt at price exceeding the original building costs7 mold and the courts some commentators claim that toxic mold is the next asbestos under diverse causes of acti on such as negligence strict liability misrepresentation breach of contract and even mental anguish plai ntiffs have secured large

diminution of value claims and emotional distress insurance coverage whether standard insura nce policies cover losses and liabilities caused by toxic mold is significant concern for all affected by moldrelated lawsuits at the same time insurance companies have increasingly sought to limit their coverage two cases illustrate the sort of lawsuits insurance companies have faced with respect to moldrelated damage in 1999 texas homeowners sued their insurer seeking 100 million for mold damage alleging that the insurers delay in paying claim for plumbing leak allowed time for mold to grow thrive and reach toxic levels9 the mold caused the plaintiffs to become ill and forced them to evacuate their house in case involving claim for breach of contract texas appellate court found that an insurance policy covered moldrelated damage notwithst anding moldfungal policy exclusion in the disputed insurance contract10 the mold growth occurred as result of leaking roof peril covered under the policy terms and therefore the excl usion clause did not apply however had the mold been caused by pe ril excluded from the policy terms eg negligent or faulty construc tion then the exclusion clause would have applied rattled by losses stemming from lawsuits and claims and alerted to the potentially large risks posed by moldrelated perils insurance companies have sought to minimize their exposure

of 2002 and the melina bill among other things hr 5040 would require the director of the federa l emergency management agency fema to establish and carry out national insurance fund to cover risks resulting from toxic mold hazards in real properties the program w ould be designed and administered with the goal of allowing individuals to acquire mold insurance at reasonable rates the director would be the architect of the program lthough the extent of federal involvement in administering the program is uncertain more particularly hr 5040 would require the director to determine the types classes and locations of eligible properties set the terms and scope of coverage eg exclusions liability caps and deductibles establish premium rates and provide insurers reasonable rate of return for their assistance with or participation in the program the director would be required to give priority to residential proper ties designed for the occupancy of one to four families when making coverage available under the program if the director after conducting investigati ons and studies determines that it would be appropriate to extend coverage to other types of prope rties the director could make insurance available to any types and classes of 1 other residential properties 2 church properties and busine ss properties which are owned or leased and operated by small business concerns 3 other business properties 4 prope rties occupied by private nonprofit organizations and 5 properties owned by stat and local governmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21280crs5 to the maximum extent practicable the di rector would be required to encourage private insurers to participate in risk sharing financial and other aspects of the program the program would be implemented through pr ivate industry with the federal government providing financial assistance unless the dir ector determines that the program cannot be carried out through the private sector or could be materially assisted by the federal government upon such termination the program woul d be implement ed primarily as government program with industry pr oviding administrative and perhaps risk sharing assistance in order to provide toxic mold insurance at the earliest possible time the director could develop and imple ment an interim program that must end by september 30 2004
