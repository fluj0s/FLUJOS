summary of report to the committee on science1 introduction the 1990s have been time of great dy namism and change in the united states for science and technology st policy and research and development rd programs during this time there has been vigorous debate in government industry and academia regarding the fundame ntal issues affecting us science and technology many members of congress have asked what can be done to set national st priorities more efficien tly establish policies nd fund or otherwise support rd programs which best enhance us resources dynamism also characterizes the international st activities of many foreign government industry and academic stakeholders in asia ec onomic growth has been directly fed by technological innova tion and development while in europe individual nations seek to develop s t policies within national regional european union and global framework of cooperation and competition from india to israel from mexico to canada nations increasingly have linked their st policies and rd programs to improving standards of living competing in the global marketplace advancing their peopl health and safety and looking to challenges and opportunities in the next century several recent reports and analyses have addressed important domestic st issues facing the united states2 however assessment of the international context in which us rd priorities st policie s and issues are placed in comparative analysis with other nations is rare gi ven the growing importa nce of international st activities to the united states global perspective appears vital for making critical domestic decisions findings and issues there are three reasons why us st policymakers may wish to in obtain more information on other countries st po licies and rd programs first us policymakers must make decisions on dom estic st policies and rd programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs2 3george bugliarello and george schillinger

issues underpinnings third st agreements nd arrangements between the united states and other nations are being renewed termin ated reconsidered or otherwise examined by the united states and in its partners in all three areas lack of current and relevant information and data on foreign nations st policies and rd programs could affect us st policy and decisions information and data on other na tions policies and prog rams are scattered among several federal agencies and nonpr ofit st organizations many of these agencies and organizations struggle to maintain capacity to gather organize and analyze information and data for public policy analysis beyond few if very important countries like japan informati on on other nations rd programs often is not current very few agencies and or ganizations incorporate other nations rd funding data into context that also ex plains the st policies of other nations why understand other nations st polic ies and rd programs as two st policy experts recently stated the roles of science engineering and technology in creating power and wealth are by now wellrecognized the world ov er but how country supports deploys and uses most effectively these resources in order to achieve national goals is matter of enduring and critical concern the quality of life international standing and indeed the very future of the country is at stake clearly each country has its own views its own appr oaches and its own constraints and clearly every country has something to learn from how other countries address these vital issues3 summary of several nations st policies programs and issues in response to congressional interest in these issues the science technology and medicine division of the congre ssional research service prepared comparative study of intern ational science and technolog at the request of the committee on science of the house of repr esentatives the following countries st policies and civilian rd programs were analyzed the united states germany the united kingdom japan korea india israel canada the european union france russia china mexico and brazil4 they are summarized in this report countries face wide range of st po licy issues and support civilian rd in many different ways however one comm on theme appears to be developing among most developed or industr ialized nations analyzed greater reliance on non governmental usually industrial sector s to support rd among the developinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs3 5the european union eu is not included in this chart since its relationship between fifteen member states is unique regional part nership it does not provide comparable data relative to the other 13 countries countries analyzed government support for rd is substantially greater than industry or in some cases roughly about equal the relative percentage support of rd by country is presented just af ter these summaries in chart 1 p 65 in summary the authors found in the united states changing nationa l rd budget has resulted in smaller government percentage of total rd now 35 of the national total shift in emphasis from large percentage of governmentfunded rd may have

programme of 1993 designed to help set national rd pr iorities and strategy is one of the key elements of uk st policy ho wever the program has been under review by the labour party since it gained control of the government in the 1997 elections japan faces series of important if not unique challenges as it heads into the 21st century rd investments and technological innovation remain high despite sluggish economy and loss of confidence in government the japanese government funds just over 20 of all na tional rd with almost of all the rest coming from japans large industrial firms still the government performs an important role of setting policy three agencies dominate the ministry of educati on the science and technology agency and the ministry of international trad and industry japan has embarked on an ambitious fiveyear plan to boost basic research and improve university facilities although full imple mentation remains unclear in korea within relatively short time the nation has evolved from largely agrarian economy to one that has used st policy to industrialize highly centralized government plays major role as policymaker and supporter of rd but the private

development as major player in basic research into the next century however the currency crisis of late 1997 has raised serious concerns about whether the government can fund more basic research and support industrial growth and whether the koreanchaebol will support more rd while facing more competitive pressures worldwide indias form of parliamentary gove rnment places responsibility for st policymaking in the ministry of scie nce and technology currently the government funds over 73 of rd industry 17 and state governments around 10 while technological i nnovation and research development remain top priorities for indian policymakers brain drain of scientists and engineers continues to be problem one of the most important issues for us st policymakers and of primary concern to the indian government is the expiration in 1998 of the united statesindian fund for st cooperation in israel civilian st policy is an important part of the governments policies these include strategies to meet various national objectives including economic growth through valueadded exports expansion of employment opportunities for immigrants and distribution of the population into largely unsettled areas the israe li government provide s about 40 of all rd funding industry 36 academia 10 and nonprofits and international sources the rest of all of the importa nt israeli international st

is 173 billion rd priorities will include information and communications technologies life science and technologies energy industrial environmental transportation and targeted socioecono mic goals however the eu also must address concerns that its bureaucracy is too cumbersome and its policymaking process too slow to ad apt to rapid global developments in france total of 22 million was spent on rd in 1992 with the government playing primary role as funder 40 and performer 20 of all national rd however as the g overnment has decreased its support for defense spending and moved to privatize its national industries that role is starting to diminish while most of th industrial rd is performed by largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs5 firms and enterprises most of fran ces industrial rd policies are directed towards small and medium sized firms russia faces an unprecedented change in its rd funding and st policies the russian rd system has experienced real decline in rd funding of 78 from 1990 to 1995 the government funded about 75 of all rd in the past even if successful transition from the wellfinanced soviet rd system of the past to smaller russian rd system more geared towards civilian market goals may take another 10 to 15 years this overall decline has significant impact on ongoing domestic and international projects still russias contribution to global st po licy as partner and collaborator is important as is the role of intern ational funding to support russian rd the peoples republic of china prc is seeking to increase its national funding for rd while addressing i ssues of wasteful duplication and ineffectiveness in certain areas and increasing incentives and capacity for effective research particul arly in chinese industry the chinese spent about 22 billion on st activities in 1995 most of this was directed towards science education and teaching about 3 billion went for rd with the government providing 60 and industry 40 of the total bilateral

government 18 from industry and 25 from state government s and businesses owned by the states with two states accounting for twothirds of that percentage brazil faces some serious st policy issues going into the 21st century they include highly centralized and often slowly responsive federal bureaucracy lowpaid rd employees protected by tenure nd without full education credentials an education system which many cont end does not measure up to the needs of developing country lack of in centives for industry and other private sector support for rd and little c ooperation among government

1 national rd funding by percentage key themes the analyses in the twopart study for the committee on science covers several nations having differing resources opportunitie s and issues yet even with so many countries with differing rd priorities and st policies broad set of themes emerge as to why comparative study on international science and technology policy is important crs has f ound three overarching reasons with supporting examples of why understanding inte rnational st issues nd rd funding is vital importance to the us st debate first some contend that the us debate on domestic s t policy and support of rd programs is usually undertaken w ithin either an exp licit or implicit global context often us policymakers must c onsider wide range of st policies and rd programs ranging from highenergy physics to the us space program in context of international cooperation or comp etition even as some us policymakers seek to develop st policies within purel national context variety of us st stakeholders at research uni versities high technology indu stries federal laboratories and others are constantly interacting with their foreign counterparts consequently us domestic st policy has broad implications for international science and tec hnology and in turn may be affected by developments in the international community other nations st activities and policies mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs7 become part of the us st debate some may ask if us policymakers business leaders educators and other stakeholders are going to consider fundamental st policy issues eg scien tific literacy or technol ogy commercialization and competitiveness how can we better inform us st policymakers when global context is needed one example where international scien ce and technology can provide context for domestic us st issues is the governmentindustryuniversity relationship the united states is facing series of impor tant policy questions about who should fund certain types of rd and what is the rationale for their investment part of this discussion involves declining percentage of us government support for rd and how that may affect us efforts in basi c research should th united states provide incentives or otherwise encourage us i ndustry to support more basic research are there other nongovernment sources for supporting us rd and how will this affect other forms of st investme nts such as university research in many other countries the same debate is ta king place in different forms if other nations are also addre ssing dynamic changes in the government industry and academia st relationships are there ne w opportunities for the united states to forge new partnerships agreements and exchanges to meet mutual needs are there lessons to learn as well in korea national st policy has been directed towards obtaining innovative technology from abroad and domestic industr ialization most of the basic research facilities are modest and two universities receive most of the funding for science and engineering many korean st policymak ers contend that for korean industry to remain competitive in more open domestic and world markets it must support more basic research yet not all korean policymakers agree with this strategy since many of koreas best science and engineering students receive their education abroad particularly in the united states some ar gue that this arrangement should continue and that national rd resources should pr imarily support industry the currency crisis that developed in late 1997 has sparked rene wed examination of the governmentindustryuniversity st relationship in korea and how scarce resources should now be allocated germany also is facing some important questions in its governmentindustry university rd relationship ge nerally the german federal länderindependent research institution relationship has operated effectively through an elaborate yet cooperative policymaking structure cons ensus on national rd policies is usually achieved even when crossing political party lines single ministry the federal ministry of education science and re search more commonly known by its german acronym bmbf provides national st policy di rection coordina tion and funding by melding variety of german st stake holders interests and goals some may argue that the us st policymaking system which is decentralized could benefit from more centralized arrangement like germanys however currently the german st policy system is being severe ly tested by national budget constraints the perceived need to reform the univers ity research system and the financial viability of several independent research institutes to continue the outcomes of these and other st policy and rd budget issues in germany may illuminate if centralized and complex national st system can change and reform over timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs8 6for the us private sector which must compete intensely with foreign firms in product development and commercialization dir ect reaction to developments in foreign st not only occurs but may be critical to survivalother nations face similar issues in ja pan nearly decadelong recession has cast some doubt as to whether japanese government can support policies with that focus national st policies on industrial technology innova tion while also trying to increase funding for university research br azil of all of the countries analyzed in this study perhaps faces the most significant longterm st issues with what many consider to be poor fede ral st coordination an undereducated st workforce and heavy reliance on government spending on rd in mexico policymakers are trying to apply national st policies to economic growth yet face challenges to support university research and education st policy nd budget coordination and increase high technology investment cana das st issues involve significant cuts in national government rd percei ved innovation gap re sulting from canadas relatively low ranking among industrial nations in industr ial rd and in the face of increased government support for econo mically and industria lly relevant rd programs concern that university research may be unwisely neglected for the long term us st public policy should not be just reaction to other nations st policies it is also informed by these policies when necessary6 within the framework of us national st policies and priorities an understanding of how other nations are addressing similar issues can be instructive national st policy decisions are almost never made without affecting or bein g affected by international science and technology regard less of the country importance to us nonst policies broad policy issues ranging from the dom estic health education and training the environment to international trade and global security have roots in st policies and rd programs and the nati onal benefits accrued from st and rd understanding us st polic ies and rd funding vis vis other nations may be an important component for making these policy and funding decisions for example china is seeking membership in the world trade organization and most favored nation trading status w ith the united states us policymakers have raised many concerns as well as support for these two initiatives part of this issue may revolve around what china is trying to achieve by raising its status as developing high technology nation and its desire to be high technology partner with the united states while focusing on us trade and security interests is important clearer understanding of chinese national st policies and rd priorities may provide more beneficial discussion between the two nations in israel government st policies suppor t wide range of national education employment and economic velopment goals as nation it has policy that utilizes highly trained workforce incor porates steady stream of immigrants and assists communities targeted for high tec hnology development it also has made direct support of rd as well as financ ial assistance for commercialization andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs9 marketing an integral part of its economic growth strategy when the israeli st approach is compared to us st debate particularly within the context of the american system of incentives to promote technology development and commercialization the c ontrast is stark yet israe li st policy provi des concrete example of how science and technology is directly incorporated into national economic policy while in the united states the debate over the direct and indirect support of national st goals is still ongoing importance to international st agreements us policy debate regarding the us role and contributi on if appropriate to international st agreements may benefit from better understanding of other nations st policies in part this is because such knowledge is likely to inform us policymakers as to what foreign nations would like to gain from such agreements with the united states also successful multilateral and bilateral st agreements between nations can be instruc tive as to how the united states can best enter into these agreements in the future ultimately the united states must pursue its own national interests when entering in to these agreements as do other nations one current st agreement due to expi re in 1998 is the united statesindia fund usif broad exchange agreemen t between the two countries for us policymakers there have been serious concerns that in india there is not strong enough protection of us pa tent rights and that ther are overly broad compulsory licensing provisions for foreign rd some us critics contend that since these issues come under the usif the agreement needs major restructuring or should be allowed to expire in india many polic ymakers contend that patent and licensing problems have been addressed and corrected they contend that some us leaders do not recognize how important this agreemen t is to india not only for the science and technology exchanged but for the larger usindian relations therefore us policymakers may ask whether there are ssons to learn about indian and us priorities and policymaking that can help both sides make informed decisions about the future of this st agreement the st policies of thirteen countries and the eu were analyzed in the report for the committee on science among this group the eu probably has engaged in the most complex forms of st agreements since it must coordinate the st policies of 15 countries into one coherent european polic for some the eu may provide model of how nations can co together and agree upon basic st policies while allowing private sector competition to continue there is an extensive policymaking apparatus for regional and national appr oval of all eu policies including those in science and technolog since 1985 the eu has successfully completed four framework programs the framework programs support wide range of rd initiatives that all member states contribute to and from which they receive benefits supporte rs contend that the eu provides lessons for st consensusbuilding across borders is model for strategic planning and multiyear rd budgets and can provide paradigm for internationa l st cooperation by balancing national priorities with international objectives yet others contend that the eu is much too bureaucratic its po licymaking slow and cumbersome and by serving all interests it lowers the european standard of st and does not raise it does the eu provide any lessons for us international st policymaking or by itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs10 nature and scope does the eu approach limit its replication and use at the national level information and data resources chronic obstacle facing th contributors to this repor t has been that data and information about st policies and rd f unding often have been inconsistent dated or unavailable for many nations while there are several excellent research sources on international sc ience and technology si ngle source provided timely rd funding data with comprehensive analysis of science and technology policymaking issues for the range of countries addressed in the report to the committee on science the national science foundations n sf publications most notably science and engineering indicators are considered by many as definitive source of statistical information on other nations rd activities nsf offices in japan europe and elsewhere provide impor tant updates on foreign st issues however the nsf data can lag the publi cation date by up to five years and the reports do not always provide context for st policymaking in other countries nsf appears to be similar to other organizations that would like to undertake more internationa l st data collection and analysis but at the same time must allocate scarce resources in order to do so the department of state has info rmation on nations st policies and international st agreements mostly compiled by the bureau of oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs yet departmental reorganization and budgetar constraints have reduced that institutions capability to compile and publish international st information the department of commerces international technology policy itp division provides st policy analysis and rd funding data for many countries parts of the larger repor t prepared for the committee on science were drawn from itp research in ddition several itp analysts provided peer review for the larger report yet budget reductions and staff reorganization may hinder their ability to provide continued extensive in depth analysis of international st issues the organization of economic coopera tion and development oecd has several excellent s t reports and experts on relate d subjects however since the oecd membership is made up of industrialized countries important developing and lesser developed countries are not major part of the analysis the washington area is home to embassies and chanceries of almost all nations most embassies have sc ience counsellor or science attache many counsellors

policies other sources of information ranged fro m international web sites to industry and trade groups which cover global s t issues yet issues of accuracyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98353crs11 objectivity timeliness and comprehensiveness affected the quality of information and data from these sources information and data on internati onal science and t echnology remains fragmented and often lags comparable data on us policies and programs by anywhere from one to five years this is significant obstacle for congressional researchers analysts and policymakers and will likely to continue to be so for the foreseeable future as international st policies and rd programs continue to be an important part of us st issues policymakers may wish to consider how to best address the problem of fragmented dated and une ven information and data new challenges in new century as the united states prepares to enter new century congress is asking some fundamental questions about us st polic and programs that have been in place for over half century these questions include how and why the united states funds research and development what comprises successful partnerships between government industry and uni versities that promote and preserve our national st infrastructure and how we can best imp rove education trai ning and scientific literacy in the united states among others in many respects the us perhaps s the most successful st policy in the world often admired and some times copied but united states science and technology does not exist in vacuum we c onstantly interact with other nations that seek to cooperate andor compete with th unites states in science and technology all nations have their own national st prior ities and objectives as nation we must not only be aware of us st priorities but those of other nations who engage us in wide range of activities therefore policymakers may continue to seek greater understanding and knowledge of what other nations are unde rtaking and planning in science and technology policy while us st policy should never be dictated by or purely be response to other nations st policies and programs policym akers may benefit from being informed by those policies increasingly many st stakeholders contend that it is in the national interest of all concerned to gain greater understanding and knowledge of this complex
