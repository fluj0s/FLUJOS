6305c29 shspec270 programming cases part 1 the subject of programming cases is almost as old as the discovery of the engram programming is the overall action taken to resolve the case regulated by the state of the case and the necessary steps if guy stubs his toe and you decide to give him an assist that is programming the assist is auditing the two are not the same these are the things to be adjudicated in programming 1 time how much is available 2 what will the case accept stand for or tolerate as auditing 3 what will the case progress on as auditing 4 order of actions this comes back to time 1 5 when you will start auditing you cant leave out any of these adjudications you need good grip on programming before you can actually make clears even if you have technique that works on everybody because programming is easy to do lrh has never put it out as itself so it has been missed as factor in getting all cases to run well programming is easy unless you dont do it programming is based on some fundamental principles it is based on 1 the behavior of the time track 2 the abilities and disabilities of the pc related to the time track the time track is the worlds longest movie in 3d included in the movie are things which apparently destroy some of the movie so between say reel 16 and reel 80 everything is missing with improper programming you will never find that section and you can audit reel 80 and reel 16 and everything beyond reel 80 and though the pc gets lots of auditing nothing happens to his case because what is wrong with him is what is between reel 16 and reel 80 this film has total effect on the pc he lives it as you run it you can only be effective if you run the parts that are personal to the pc that is running the reality of the pc there are things you can run that are unreal to him but that nevertheless affect him eg the helatrobus implant but dont exceed the pcs reality by too much the program is not monitored by what the pc has reality on before you audit him it is monitored by what the pc can obtain reality on during auditing after all you want to increase his reality dont omit pc change and volition in your calculations and remember his reality might exceed yours if you dont try to increase the pcs reality you neglect his capacity to change it does the pc good to audit him farther than where he is at yesterdays mental sciences made this mistake continually they treated patients only from and on the viewpoint of their own reality then denied the patients capacity to change programming is based 100 on the following 1 the capability of the auditor 2 the capability of the pc to receive auditing 3 the amount of time available 4 the maximum result to be obtained given these limits in terms of increase of r and c affinity the increase in affinity can be seen in the persons change in position on the knowtomystery scale of which the tone scale is the middle guts person has personal reality except for possible intellectual reality on those tones that lie above his position on this scale he only has reality on those tones that lie below his chronic tone his chronic tone can be the tone of the body plus thetan or chronic tone as thetan the body plus thetan tone can be considerably higher than his tone as thetan the chronic tone of the body plus thetan combination can be at 40 while the level of the thetan is at unconscious any level above the chronic tone is susceptible of being dramatized dramatization is thetan or thetan plus body performing evolutions not under the thetan or thetan plus bodys control nonvolitional actions old mental studies fixated on these and believed that there is nothing else but there are volitional actions they lie below the chronic tone of the individual on the tone scale there are two chronic tones that of the thetan and that of the thetan plus body combination the body plus thetan can dramatize any tone above the chronic tone but most likely it will be the half tone above the chronic tone the above is of arc therefore increasing affinity is making the pc less susceptible to dramatization and gives the pc reality on more tones that are now below him you have added levels on which he has reality and subtracted levels which he may dramatize previously as certain tone was above him he was the effect of it now being above that tone he has reality on it and he is longer the effect of it the body plus thetan tone is an apparent tone and it never goes above 40 so you could have pc flying along at 40 enthusiastic and the next day you will get the thetan alone and he drops from 40 to zilch he has come up to degradation as thetan he feels awful for apparent reason because you are now seeing the thetan who has come up above unconsciousness to degradation as thetan for the first time this is case gain in terms of affinity to go somewhere by route one you have to get the thetans chronic tone level upscale enough to do it reality you can measure persons reality by measuring significance since reality is matter energy space time and significance the five parts of universe psychological testing measures reality on significances you can test reality by solution of problems if persons conversation is full of cant understand and he gets very reasonable about unreasonable things and he can assume viewpoint but his own while he doesnt really have one his reality level is low he may demonstrate this by the fact that as the pc comes to others viewpoints he begins to recognize his own overts and to suffer on that account that is big reality increase and occurs because understanding more and being more able to take other viewpoints the pc becomes more responsible he cognites cognition is actually the process of changing reality of significance it is necessary to case gain cognition more understanding case gain pc saying that the session was wonderful has not necessarily had any case gain he may have been beaten into propitiation but if he says you know my mom must have had quite hard time that is cognition if the pc is able to assume new viewpoint in this case that of his mother he has had case gain getting the pcs goals and gains at the end of the session is little psychometric test measure of case gain communication there is obvious gain when the pc is more willing to talk to people but his increased perception of walls etc isnt really changed reality so much as it is increased communication reach and withdraw willingness to receive etc is what is involved here even if the case is delusory and sees the room as full of polar bears it would be case gain at the end of the session if he could see the polar bears better if you are operating from the platform of the reality that the room is not full of polar bears and that you must therefore get rid of the polar bears you will have dropped the pcs communication this was one of freuds errors he cant communicate with you but he can communicate with these polar bears if he could communicate with the polar bears well enough he wouldnt have to communicate with them and they would depart thats the way to get rid of polar bears psychiatrists try to convince the patient that he doesnt have any bugs crawling on him this is the same as saying there must only be this one reality and unless we can hold the status quo of this reality we have lost this has been the criterion in all mental activities for the many trillenia and an auditor may be holding onto it with both fists and not realize it this consideration is that our only gain would be from the platform of where we are if we could continue the alteration to making things more like they are here and now we we would get case gain this consideration is way to clobber people by holding them on the time track these are the technical data underlying programming auditing is done by 1 unburdening basics 2 discovering what basics there are 3 disentangling them so as to erase basics this includes cchs it includes all processing discovery of basics end eradication of basics is done by discovering what basics can be found before the basic that disentangles the basic that you are trying to untangle basic will almost blow by inspection unless there is more basic one holding it in however basic on chain contains elements that are not basic to the basic say you have the basic on the chain of some somatic it is basic on the chain you are running but it has something in it that comes from more basic chain on another subject when this happens you can slip the basic out from under the earlier basics by finding the basics of remaining elements in the basic of the original chain frequently this can be done by dating by the time you are through you have practically cleared somebody if you can keep track of what you are doing you will be very successful if not the whole track collapses and the pc goes under the first action you should undertake on case is the most advanced action that can be undertaken in your estimation always enter case more boldly than you think is wise and you will usually be right if you dont you will never find the ceiling at which the pc can operate if you get away with it you are all set you have saved time that is what you are doing with the helatrobus implants if the pc cant manage it pull back so all there is to auditing is unburdening finding chain finding the basic on the chain and taking apart the basic i dont care what process you are using running chain back is unburdening it its taking off charge so that you can lay your paws on basic you are after the first gpm and if the pc cant recall what he had for breakfast this morning you have to unburden the case how long should you continue unburdening the case until you can get your hands on an implant not one second longer that you run the charge off of at least one dialwide disintegrating rocket read per item if and when you get stuck you probably have too early an implant one that is too close to basic remember you are trying to unburden pick up the last incident in the second chain if you know what it is and run that one with fast pass or lets use straightwire to give him some locks or find overts on this lets see if we can chase him earlier and find the first it is all unburdening you see lets run the threecommand process for awhile we are just trying to get our hands on an implant so we can run some charge off of it and find an earlier implant so that we can get to the basic implant you have to go later and unburden the basic implant because you are asking the pc to walk through wall of fire between pt and basic there is wall of fire you cant push the pc through the wall of fire you have to get him through to get the pc through it you have to put some fire out on gradient that is done by programming
