the proposal also advocates compensating african cotton producing countries for revenues estimated to be lost due to cotton subsidies the united states which provides substantial productionrelated subsidies to cotton producers agrees that cotton subsidies distort trade but maintains that the issue should be negotiated in comprehensive manner disagreement over the african cotton initiative has blocked progress on an agreement on agriculture in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations known as the doha development agenda dda how to tackle the question of cotton subsidies either as standalone initiative or as part of broader agreement to reduce tradedistorting farm subsidies will be on the agenda as dda negotiations continue in 2004 if the initiative were agreed to as proposed us cotton producers would longer be receiving 2002 farm bill marketing loan loan deficiency or countercyclical payments after four years under us alternative proposal for reduction in trade

data from the united nations food and agriculture organization fao cotton production accounts for 5 to 10 of the gross domestic product gdp in benin burkina faso chad and mali5 cotton accounts for around 30 of total export earnings of wca counties and more than 60 of earnings from agricultural exports the world bank reports that over 2 million farmers in the region produce cotton6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21712 cotton production in the united states does not occupy similarly dominant role in the total us economy but it does occupy an important place in the us agricultural economy7 cotton production accounts for just over threehundredths of percent 0034 of us gdp 2002 cotton exports account for 14 of total merchandise exports and 4 of agricultural exports cotton

httpwwwcottonorgeconworlddetailcfmyear2002 crs3 the united states is the second largest producer of cotton but is the worlds largest exporter marketing year 2003 exports are estimated at 29 million metric tons and account for 41 of world cotton exports the wca region is the third largest producer accounting for 5 of world cotton production and the second largest exporter accounting for 12 of world cotton exports uzbekistan is the third largest exporter with about 10 of world exports china the worlds largest cotton producer is also the worlds largest importer of raw cotton9 wca countries are low cost producers of cotton10 for example in 2001 the average cost of production in benin one of the four sponsors of the cotton initiative was 31 cents per pound in the united states the national average cost of production was 68 cents per pound in 2001 the economic rationale for the african initiative the economic rationale for the african cotton initiative is based in part on an analysis conducted by icac which estimates that cotton producers in developing countries not just africa face annual losses of about 95 billion as result of subsidies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21712 that other countries provide their cotton farmers11 losses of this magnitude according to icac are the result of the excess production stimulated by subsidies that depress world cotton prices the icac study notes that world prices for cotton at 42 cents per pound in 20002001 were at their lowest level in 30 years low cotton prices according to icac particularly affect revenues earned by some of the poorest african countries while producers in subsidizing countries are shielded from price declines by subsidies icac points out that the united states provides the largest amount of subsidies to its cotton producers which it estimated at 23 billion in 20012002 other countries subsidies in 200102 included china 12 billion european union eu countries greece and spain 716 million turkey 59 million brazil 50 million and egypt 29 million icac simulated the reduction in cotton production if us subsidies were eliminated according to the simulation without subsidies us cotton production in 19992000 would have been 900000 tons lower than actual production in that year 700000 tons less than actual production in 20002001 and 14 million tons less than actual in 20012002 the simulated removal of subsidies resulting in lower production leads to higher prices in the short term the simulated decline in us production results in average international prices per pound of cotton 6 cents higher than realized in 199900 12 cents higher than in 200001 and 22 cents higher than in 200102 higher prices would reduce the demand for cotton thus the initial price increases would be lowered by 1 2 and 6 9 usda foreign agricultural service cotton world markets and trade 2003 10 icac survey of the cost of production of raw cotton report by the technical information section of icac september 2001 while noting that its data is the only source of information on the cost of production of raw cotton at the international level icac also notes that the data must be used carefully differences in production practices variations in the input supply system make comparisons difficult among countries 11 icac production and trade policies affecting the cotton industry washington dc july 2002 crs4 cents per pound respectively in the three marketing years simulated initial price increases also would be offset by shifting world production to nonsubsidizing countries in the medium and long terms overall however the icac study says that the removal of cotton subsidies would have had net positive effect on the world price of cotton by 3 cents in 19992000 6 cents in 200001 and 11 cents in 200102 us and other country subsidies are not the only factor depressing world cotton prices icac says that weak consumer demand resulting from the recent economic slowdown and continuing competition from synthetic fibers are preventing world cotton consumption from more rapid growth in addition says icac improved technology the strong us dollar and the expansion of cotton production into new areas contributed to the increase in world cotton supply in 2001 recent world bank report used results from the icac study to illustrate the effect of us and other countries subsidies on cotton producers in the wca region12 according to the world bank report icacs estimate of 11 cent per pound increase in the net average world price for cotton in 20012002 would translate into revenue gains of 250 million year for wca farmers oxfam british nongovernmental httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21712 organization also contributed to the debate over the impact of cotton subsidies with publication of report that estimated revenue losses to african farmers from us cotton subsidies13 both the world bank and oxfam have played major role in mobilizing public opinion in support of the african cotton initiative the us response to the cotton initiative the us responded to the cotton initiative by proposing that cotton be included in comprehensive negotiated agreement to cut subsidies and tariffs on all farm products and eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers on manufactured goods including textiles14 the us trade representative ustr maintains that the problems affecting cotton extend beyond the issue of subsidies and include factors such as competition by synthetic fibers the slowdown in world economic growth and higher yields due to favorable weather conditions ustr cites many barriers that limit market opportunities and distort trade of cotton trade distorting domestic support applied by the united states the european union china and some developing countries high average allowed tariffs for cotton and textiles and clothing nontariff barriers such as nontransparent customs procedures difficult and costly marking and labeling requirements and burdensome testing methods and industrial policies related to manmade fibers that distort the market and displace sales of cotton and cotton products as an alternative to the african sectoral 12 cotton sector strategies in west and central

and clothing nontariff barriers and other barriers such as state monopolies special tax advantages and export requirements the national cotton council of america ncc an organization that represents producers ginners warehousers merchants crushers cooperatives and textile manufacturers allied itself with the ustr proposal to link wto negotiations on cotton with textile trade negotiations15 bipartisan group of us senators from cotton producing states expressed their opposition to the african cotton initiative in letter to the us trade representative16 the senators stated that the current round of multilateral trade negotiations offers an opportunity to increase market access and further discipline trade distorting domestic support and export subsidiesa sectoral initiative focusing specifically on the us cotton program is counterproductive to us cottons interest and distracts from multilateral reform of agricultural trade implications for us cotton programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21712 adoption of standalone sectoral initiative as proposed by the african countries could mean that cotton producers would after four years longer be receiving payments under 2002 farm bill programs that are linked to production namely marketing loan assistance and loan deficiency payments17 cotton producers also could become ineligible to receive payments under the 2002 farm bills new countercyclical payments ccp program ccp payments are linked to the level of commodity prices direct payments also authorized by the 2002 farm bill would not be affected if the initiative were adopted because they are not production related in fy2002 cotton producers received 721 million in loan deficiency payments ccp payments were included in the 2002 farm bill estimated ccp payments for cotton in fy2003 total 1247 billion18 direct payments in fy2003 are estimated to be 428 million credit guarantees for cotton exports an estimated 234 million in fy2002 also could be affected under standalone initiative as proposed by the africans19 adoption of the us proposal to reduce cotton subsidies as part of comprehensive approach to reducing tradedistorting domestic support

agricultural export subsidies export credits and the world trade organization march 27 2001 discusses the extent to which export credit guarantees subsidize agricultural exports crs6 negotiations is contained in letter from the us trade representative to wto members20 in the letter the ustr affirms that it is the objective of the united states to achieve substantial cuts in tradedistorting domestic support for agricultural products including cotton the elimination of export subsidies for cotton and all other agricultural products and substantial improvements in market access for cotton cotton products and other agricultural goods under this latest formulation of the us proposal trade distorting programs like marketing loan gainsloan deficiency payments would be reduced but not eliminated the us proposal which recognizes subsidy element in export credit programs also could result in changes in us export credit guarantees for cotton and other products while elimination or reduction of us cotton subsidies could benefit farmers in african and other lowcost producers of cotton eg australia the economic effects in the united states could be both positive and negative us consumers could benefit from lower prices for products made from cotton us tariffs and quotas on textiles would also have to be liberalized for us consumers to receive much benefit from cotton subsidy reduction or elimination taxpayers could benefit from not having to pay for support of cotton producers however cotton producers industries that supply inputs to cotton httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21712 production and rural communities could be adversely affected workers in ginning transportation and marketing warehousing and cotton seed crushing could all be adversely affected those affected could be expected to oppose the elimination of subsidies andor demand adjustment assistance to compensate for adverse impacts of subsidy elimination status of the issue the african cotton initiative remains on the wto negotiating agenda and is an issue that appears to be blocking the completion of the doha round the four african sponsors of the proposal other african countries and other developing countries continue to insist on separate sectoral approach to the cotton subsidy issue the united states on the other hand continues to insist on including cotton subsidies in broader negotiating approach us cotton subsidies also are being challenged in wto dispute settlement where brazil is arguing that the united states has exceeded its subsidy reduction commitments for cotton21 if brazil wins this dispute the united states either would be obliged to alter its cotton subsidy programs or accept the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by brazil on some of its products in 2004 interested members of congress will be closely monitoring the wto agriculture negotiations the african cotton initiative and the wto cotton dispute 20 the letter is at
