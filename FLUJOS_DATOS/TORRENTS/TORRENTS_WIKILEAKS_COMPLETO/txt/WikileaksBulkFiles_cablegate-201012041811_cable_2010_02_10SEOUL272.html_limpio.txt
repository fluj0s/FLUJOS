summary vfm chun on sinonorth korean relations 2 s during february 17 lunch hosted by ambassador stephens that covered other topics septel rok vice foreign minister and former rok sixparty talks 6pt head of delegation chun yungwoo predicted that china would not be able to stop north koreas collapse following the death of kim jongil kji the dprk chun said had already collapsed economically following the death of kji north korea would collapse politically in two to three years chun dismissed rok media reports that chinese companies had agreed to pump 10 billion usd into the norths economy there was substance to the reports he said the vfm also ridiculed the chinese foreign ministrys briefing to the rok embassy in beijing on wang jiaruis visit to north korea the unidentified briefer had basically read xinhua press release chun groused adding that the prc interlocutor had been unwilling to answer simple questions like whether wang had flown to hamhung or taken train there to meet kji 3 s the vfm commented that china had far less influence on north korea than most people believe beijing had will to use its economic leverage to force change in pyongyangs policies and the dprk leadership knows it chun acknowledged that the chinese genuinely wanted denuclearized north korea but the prc was also content with the status quo unless china pushed north korea to the brink of collapse the dprk would likely continue to refuse to take meaningful steps on denuclearization xxxxxxxxxxxx 4 s turning to the six party talks chun said it was very bad thing that wu dawei had retained his position as chief of the prcs delegation xxxxxxxxxxxx said it appeared that the dprk must have lobbied extremely hard for the nowretired wu to stay on as chinas 6pt chief name removed complained that wu is the prcs xxxxxxxxxxxx an arrogant marxspouting former red guard who knows nothing about north korea nothing about nonproliferation and is hard to communicate with because he doesnt speak english wu was also hardline nationalist loudly proclaiming to anyone willing to listen that the prcs economic rise represented return to normalcy with china as great world power chinas new generation of koreahands 5 s sophisticated chinese officials xxxxxxxxxxxx stood in sharp contrast to wu according to vfm chunxxxxxxxxxxxx chun claimed xxxxxxxxxx believed korea should be unified under rok controlxxxxxxxxxxxx chun said were ready to face the new reality that the dprk now had little value to china as buffer state view that since north koreas 2006 nuclear test had reportedly gained traction among senior prc leaders prc actions in dprk collapse scenario 6 s chun argued that in the event of north korean collapse china would clearly not welcome any us military presence north of the dmz xxxxxxxxxxxx chun xxxxxxxxxxxx said the prc would be comfortable with reunified korea controlled by seoul and anchored to the united states in benign alliance as long as korea was not hostile towards china tremendous trade and laborexport opportunities for chinese companies chun said would also help salve prc concerns about living with reunified korea chundismissed the prospect of possible prc military intervention in the event of dprk collapse noting that chinas strategic economic interests now lie with the united states japan and south korea not north korea moreover chun argued bareknuckle prc military intervention in dprk internal crisis could strengthen the centrifugal forces in chinas minority areas and japan 7 s chun acknowledged the ambassadors point that strong rokjapan relationship would help tokyo accept reunified korean peninsula under seouls control chun asserted that even though japans preference was to keep korea divided tokyo lacked the leverage to stop reunification in the event the dprk collapses stephens
