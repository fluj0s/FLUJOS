international financial institutions updated july 7 2004 danielle langton analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374anticorruption standards of the international financial institutions summary the international financial institutions ifis all have procedures to prevent identify and punish corruption within thei r organizations the world bank appears to have the most extensive and detailed pr ocess for addressing corruption issues but the other multilateral development banks m dbs have or are establishi ng similar procedures the internati onal monetary fund imf does not make loans for specific projects all its loans go directly to th central bank or finance ministry of the borrower country nevertheless it also has procedures fo r preventing investigating and punishing unethical or corrupt practices organizations may achieve more effective anticorruption programs by implementing complementary measures to c ounter corruption at many levels these include scrutiny of the ifis lending pro cedures their systems for the procurement of goods and services staff conduct overs ight and management of their operations and the education of sta ff on policies and procedures major procedures for controlling corruption include the establishment of an independent corruption unit an oversight committee mandatory staff financial disclosure procedures and corruption reporting hotline the world bank is the only ifi that has adopted procedures in all four areas most of the others excepting the african development bank afdb and the international fund for agricultural development ifad have procedures in three of these areas th afdb requires mandato ry staff financial disclosure and is considering possible action in the other areas ifads anti corruption unit is organized differently than the other ifis in that anticorruption responsibilities are carried out by its offi ce of internal audit but it functions similarly to anticorruption units at the other ifis also ifad is still in the process of implementing mandatory staff financial disclosure this report provides on sidebyside ba sis comparisons of the anticorruption procedures in the mdbs and the imf it also provides detaile d description of the institutional arrangements each ifi has adopt ed to address corruption issues this report will be updated if significant changes are made in the systems and procedures it describes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374contents c r r u p t i n n d t h i f i s

of this report for publicationanticorruption standards of the international financial institutions corruption and the ifis corruption is broadly defined as the abuse of public or private office for personal gain this includes but is not limited to taking bribes granting contract or choosing project in order to make pr ofit or to allow someone else to make profit or coercing someone else to act in corrupt manner most of the multilateral development banks mdbs define corruption and state their policies relating to it in their codes of conduct for staff procurement guidelines and other public documents this report is based on information pr ovided by the intern ational financial institutions themselves through publicly av ailable information on their websites and correspondence with members of their staff it compares on sidebyside basis the international financial institutions ifis procedures and policies for preventing and punishing corruption in their operations it does not attempt to evaluate the extent to which the ifis adhere to these standards and guidelines1 the anticorruption measures at the mdbs are new and in some cases notably in the african development bank are still being implemented the need for anti corruption policies became evident in th late 1990s when scandals involving corruption became public and the activitie s of the mdbs were more closely scrutinized development specialists recognized the importance of combating corruption to achieve economic developmen t and in response the mdbs began to provide technical assistance in corruption prevention and governance to member countries they recognized that improvi ng the anticorruption mechanisms within their own organizations would compleme nt governance activities in developing countries and increase development effec tiveness as well as improve their own credibility on governance issues the united states and the international community have been influential in the increased attention to anticorruption standards the g8 finance ministers and central bankers issued statement at their meeting in rome in july 2001 that recognized the recent improvements in the internal governance of the mdbs but added that further improve ments were still needed at the june 2004 g8 summit at sea island georgia the g8 issued statement on fighting corruption in developing countries announcing that th imf agreed to publish its program documents and surveillance reports ffective july 2004 the interamericanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374crs2 2 sea island g8 summit 2004 summit documents available online at httpwwwg8usagovd_061004ehtm accessed july 6 2004 3 section 581 of the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 pl108199 adding new section 1504 to the international financial institutions act pl 95118development bank idb also agreed to an improved disclosure policy at the summit furthermore the g8 pledged to encourage developing countries to meet the high disclosure standards set by the if is the g8 recognizes that corruption is detrimental to economic velopment and fighting co rruption requires cooperation between the ifis and member countries on transparency and disclosure policies2 in 2003 congress instructed the us executive directors to seek changes in each of the mdbs that would make thei r procedures for controlling corruption clearer and more transparent3 for procedural reasons the imf was not included within the scope of the act congress specified that they shall use the voice and vote of the united states in each mdb to ensure that by june 30 2005 each institution 1 posts an annual report on its website containing statistical summaries and case studies of the fraud and corruption cases pursued by its investigations unit 2 establishes plan for conducting regular i ndependent audits of internal management controls including fraud prevention and maki ng reports publicly available and 3 establishes an effective procedure for the receipt retention and treatment of complaints received by the bank regarding fraud and other matters of internal control the secretary of the treasur is required to report to congress by september 1 2004 on the actions taken by each mdb to achieve these goals experts say measures for counterin g corruption at the mdbs must be implemented on many levels to be eff ective these include bank lending and operations procurement of goods and services staff conduct independent internal reporting mechanisms to address alle gations of misconduct oversight and management of bank operations and educating sta ff on policies and procedures the establishment of effective internal controls is presumptively deterrent reducing the number of corruption cases that the system handles internal controls that aim to ensure the efficiency of the organization as whole such as internal audit procedures to ascertain that organi zational policies and procedures are being followed complement explicit antico rruption procedures high level of transparency and accountability in all oper ations helps to combat corruption in addition to specific antico rruption measures takenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374crs3 table 1 ifi anticorruption features at glance independent corruption unitoversight committeemandatory staff financial disclosurecorruption reporting hotline

development bank d ifad does not have unit dedicated to anticorruption activities however the office of internal audit oa is independent and has anticorruption responsibilities in addition to other audit and investigation responsibilities sanctions are an important aspect of internal control but they are only as effective as the mechanisms for detecting and investigating corrupt behavior each of the ifis consider similar sanctions for misbehavior such as demotions and dismissals of staff members blacklisting firms and the cancellation of loans for borrowers despite the efforts by the mdbs to implement internal controls and prevent corruption it is impossible to completely eliminate the possibility that mdb resources will be used toward corrupt ends it is possible for mdbs to ensure that the actual loans are used legitimately but in corrupt country they may be used to free up resources for less legitimate purposes furthermore there is distinction between the operations of the mdb manage ment and the decisions made by the executive board the executive board is composed of representatives of member countries with political interests and it is these board members who make the decisions about whether to make loan or grant the conditionality for that assistance and whether borrowers have sufficiently met the conditionality requirements anti corruption efforts are focused on the activities of management not the decisions of the executive board in the most airtight organization it may still be possible for corruption to occur however the consistent implementation of internal controls canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374crs4 4 for description of the ints procedures and discussion of one instance where it investigated allegations of corruption see crs report rs21501 world bank bujagali hydropower project by jonathan sanfordsend clear message that corruption is not tolerated within the organization and this could have positive impact on the organizations experience with corruption the world bank took the lead among th international fi nancial institutions ifis in implementing its anticorrupti on system in 1997 the regional mdbs have moved since to set up basically similar systems with organizational variations the mdbs have made substantial changes in their internal controls over the last five years which are aimed at bolstering their effectiveness however there are still concerns about inadequate effectiveness and insuffici ent independence of these controls the mdbs communicate with each other on issues of transparency and accountability through the evaluation coope ration group ecg an organization of evaluation departments of mdbs all of the institutions listed below are members of the ecg with the exception of th international fund for agricultural development ifad the european inve stment bank eib component of the european union eu is also member of the ecg the united states is not member of the eib anticorruption measures in the mdbs the world bank the world banks internal audit department iad began working in anti corruption issues in 1997 special unit the department of institutional integrity int was created in 1998 hiring specia lists from outside the bank as well as employees from within iad4 in may 1998 the bank established the oversight committee on fraud and corruption ocfc to oversee the banks anticorruption system the ocfc is composed of high level bank officials from administrative offices at the world bank in addition the bank established sanctions committee to review findings of investigations rela ted to fraud and corruption by contractors further the bank established 24hour free telephone hotline and post office box hotline to receive allegations of fraud and corruption available for use by bank staff and the public the hotline is managed by an outside firm and observes strict confidentiality users of the hotline may remain anonymous reports of fraud or corruption from the hotline are sent to the ocfc after an initial review the ocfc determines whether the allegations warrant an investigation and whether the investigation will be carried out by the investigations unit of iad the office of professional ethics or by external specialized investigative resources at the completion of the investigation the ocfc reviews the case and refers the case either to senior ma nagement or the sanctions committ ee for further action or to the appropriate authorities for criminal prosecution or civil actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374crs5 5 these are not necessarily instances of corr uption but they are cases of noncompliance with the banks procurement rules the world banks efforts to fight corruption also encompass the procurement process the bank disburses billions of dollars annually to finance purchases necessary for the implementation of project s the bank has standards and guidelines aimed at ensuring that procurement funds are spent on their intended uses and that staff members or contractors abuse the pr ocurement process one difficulty is that the borrower not the bank has control over the procurement process however the bank has taken steps to monitor compliance over the last two years the bank has hired independent firms to audit more than 50 bankfunded projects they found instances of misprocurement in 40 contr acts out of about 45000 that were included in the audit5 the sanctions committee may blacklist contractors and consultants who are found to be involved in corrupt ac tivities either for stated period of time or indefinitely the bank maintains list of such firms ineligible for bank contracts on its public website the audits are also used to develop plans with the borrower to build capacity to avoid future fraud and corruption separate from specific anticorruption efforts the world bank group has an operations evaluations depa rtment oed an indepe ndent evaluation unit which reports directly to the executive directors the oed rates the performance and development impact of bank lending operations it also evaluates the effectiveness of the banks general policies and procedures its mandate is not directly related to anticorruption but it adds to accountability at the bank and thus complements anti corruption efforts the bank also as an independent inspec tion panel which so reports directly to the executive board composed of three outside experts plus small secretariat the panel receives complaints from the public and assesses wh ether the bank has complied with its own rules and procedural guidelines in the design and implementation of bank funded projects or programs again this is not specific control against financial corruption but it is measure to insure that the banks operational rules or policies are not inappropriately breached the international monetary fund the imf is different from the mdbs in that it does not fund projects rather it provides balance of payments finance th at typically involves boosting the reserves of the central bank as money in the centr bank can be fungible it is difficult to track specific uses of imf resources nonetheless the imf has instituted safeguards framework that aims to verify that the central bank has the proper control and auditing systems in place to manage its resources including fund disbursements key element is requi rement that countries publish annual central bank financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with internationallyaccepted standards the centerpiece of the imfs internal cont rols is its code of conduct for staff which is supported by financia l disclosure requirements fo r senior staff to prevent financial conflicts of interest and an ethics officer the ethics officer position washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374crs6 established in february 2000 to investig ate alleged violations of the code of conduct and of other imf rule s and regulations the ethi cs officer is appointed by the managing director and is intended to be an impartial person having former employment with the imf however th ere is prohibition on future employment with the fund and the ethics officers term may be extended by the managing director the ethics officer conducts investigations at the direction of the managing director or the director of human resources hrd or heshe initiates investigations with the approval of the oversight committee oc the oc is composed of three senior imf officials with the director of hrd as chair the oc also rules in the event of staff appeal and determines if an investigation should be begun as well as whether one should be continued the independent evaluation office i eo was established in july 2001 to support the board in institutional governance and oversight responsibilities it reports directly to the executive board and its purpos is to evaluate imf advice operations and policies the ieo staff is hired from both outside and from within the imf the imf has made efforts in recent years to make its policies and operations more transparent and open to public scrutiny the fund pub lishes all artic iv staff reports for the public as matter of polic unless an individual country does not consent to having its report published c ountries have right under the articles of agreement to block any ifi disclosures about their internal economic conditions countries that block such di sclosure can be readily id entified however and potential investors or lenders may note that ther may be information about its internal economic situation which the country does not wish to release to the public the imf also releases fund policy papers th minutes of executive board meetings details of loan programs and annual evaluations international fund for agricultural development the international fund for agricultural development ifad is specialized agency of the united nations it s eeks to prevent corruption by prescreening potential recipients of grant financing nd through structured financial reporting and audit requirements for loan and grant recipients grant recipients must follow procurement guidelines acceptable to ifad to ensure transparency the procurement guidelines have recently been amended to specifically address fraud and corruption and they were presented to the executive board in april 2004 for approval after they are reviewed by the audit committee ifad is different than the other ifis in that it is specialized agency of the and it conducts investig ations in manner consistent with the rules of the united nations ifad set up its oversight committee oc in may 2000 to coordinate investigations into irregular practices either within ifad or in connection with operations and contracts financed by ifad the oc is similar to investigations units in the mdbs but it operates on higher level as it is composed of the vice president the general counsel and the chief of in ternal audit it decides whether an investigation is warranted determines who should be i nvolved in the investigation and reports the facts emerging from the investigation to the president if external agencies such as national authorities are involved in an investigation the oc determines ifads role in that investigation external agencies report the findingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32374crs7 of their investigations to the oc which then reports to the president the president makes decisions about sancti ons independent of the oc the office of internal audit oa re views operations of ifad for efficiency and integrity and participates in investigations of fraud and corruption it is an independent unit with only review responsibilities and involvement in sanctions the head of oa reports to the president african development bank as part of the banks zero tolerance policy staff members of the african development bank afdb are required to submit financial disclosures and they are required to comply with the staff code of conduct in the recent past allegations were investigated by the internal audit department iad or by an adhoc team including the general counsel the banks procurement review committee prc receives the findings and conclusions of investigations and decides on plan of action including sanctions both against th borrower cancellation of loans or the contractorconsultants who have been decl ared ineligible to participate in bank funded operations for minimu m period of five years the afdb has established guidelines and procedures for preventing and combating fraud and corruption in bank group operations efforts are also underway to establish specific unit within the existing internal audit department iad to conduct internal investigations and to provide protection fo r whistle blowers in the form of hotline for complaints of misconduct it is also considering proposal for the establishment of senior management oversight committee to combat fraud and corruption much like the oversight co mmittees at some of the other mdbs additionally the management of the ba nk has submitted final proposals to the afdb for the establishment of an inde pendent compliance re view and mediation unit crmu the crmu would focus on issues of noncompliance by the bank group with regard to operational polic ies and procedures in the design implementation or supervision of bankfi nanced project under this plan third parties would be able to submit complaints of harm from bank activities to the crmu the crmu would not be direc tly involved in fraud or corruption investigations but would complement the anticorruption activities of the bank by adding to accountability there are units within the bank that work in similar ways to the pr oposed crmu the iad investigates compliance w ith bank rules but it does not have the capacity to respond to complaints from th ird parties meanwhile the operations policy and review partment oprd re views all bank projects and programs for compliance with afdb operating policies and procedures as they enter the financing pipeline the 2002 presidential directive on the bank operation eval uation department opev allows the department to
