cause level ot and the public lecture given on 30 june 1964 thank you well this is the what audience 30th of june thirtieth of june what year audience ad 14 ad 14 all right saint hill special briefing course and i havent got anything to talk to you about and you know it all anyway and the last lecture i gave you got nineteen on the grade gave lose man and everythings going to pieces all over the world melbourne particularly nothings happening in melbourne what could happen in melbourne except kangaroo stampede you can see them now loping through the streets my respect for melbourne went downhill when one of their main banks didnt know what swiss draft was and i thought to myself well im going to stop worrying about actually somebody the other day from melbourne university went onto the inquiry stand and testified at vast rate and said yes the emeter did what we said it would do and it was good grade of galvanometer i think he said something like one of the best of that type hed tested must have been horrible lose for the medicos they couldnt get him to say anything about it except it just was galvanometer and it worked and it was fine and it was well constructed and and there are lots of other galvanometers not as good as that one shock shock wave must have gone through the entire profession well i did have something to talk to you about now that i think it over very carefully and whats wrong with you theres something wrong with you of course is just this youre so birddogged onto the dazzling glories of ot that youre going to leave the rest of the human race hanging in midair between the bottom rung of the ladder to ot and the ground because the bottom rung of ot does not sit on the ground theres large gap between the ground and the bottom rung and theres another ladder there and you try to climb the upper ladder without letting anybody climb the lower ladder or try to get people to climb the upper ladder without letting them climb the lower ladder or showing its there theres going to be an awful lot of people walking around in circles thinking youre nuts or were nuts or it doesnt work or its too horrible or something is all wrong and itd be something like theres big amusement park but they cant find the gate to get in dont you see theres all kinds of weird randomity and devt is about to develop on this one point because most everybody is thinking and gets birddogged onto and fixated with the idea that ot starts from the ground and ot doesnt start from the ground it starts from the top of another ladder so that the public at large is going to have its attention centered on the second ladder and everybodys going to be sweating and working to get them to climb this second ladder and selling this second ladder and talking to them about the second ladder and getting them all whipped up about the second ladder dont you see and hell they cant find any second ladder there isnt cant find any ladder at all because their attention is not being directed to the first ladder and the first ladder could be called cause level now youuns has been working for many year to get people to be causative weve had the definition for long time now an ot is cause over matter energy space time and god help us the whole universe see well thats very very intriguing to take look at this i dont know how anybodys mind can shortcircuit to this degree that with great case he could vanquish the sun and the stars but is having hell of lot of trouble with his wife and there in actual fact you have it in nutshell youre asking him to take care of pluto when he has an awful time pushing cigarette lighter across his desk now if you can envision an expansion of reach from an inverse self notimagined unbelieved self which he cant reach because it aint because he doesnt know you know this kind of thing you know hes he actually sort of has to reach in in order to try to reach out you get the idea if you can imagine reach that this is this confused that person doesnt even know which direction to go to get it why youve got level 0 and you got about ninetynine percent of the human beings that you will have anything to do with on this planet and youve got him right there for instance theyre following pied piper right now called science and science plays lively tune and they play it with very glossy photographs they play it with very good advertisements they play it with great big imposing universities huge facades built out of gorgeous marble imported from south debuque theyve got themselves pretty good face see big stuff peoples cars go whizwhiz down the streets and the petrol that goes into the engine will make it run at vast expense theyve got it up to point where an engine can actually utilize well it utilizes over thousandth of the potential power in gallon of gasoline theyve got it fixed up so they can color your health bread by certain breeds of mold and so they can get appropriation from other breeds of mold called congress youve got yourself quite quite game going here its called science and you yourself are not totally aware of the fact how that cuts your personal throat now were indebted to science but only in its branches of mathematics and some of its physics for the materials of scientology but we didnt go down the blind alley and the blind alley is this is man is machine man is an inanimate piece of matter that somehow or other became ammoniated this whole facade leaves out of it the essential ingredient the being himself man is an animal man is thinking brain an image comes in the eye and is reflected on projection screen on the back of the skull which is looked at by another computing projection screen which is looked at by another computing rejection screen which is looked at by another screen which is looked at by another screen which somehow or other results in people liking wheaties and if you look over scientific thought on the subject of life youll absolutely be flabbergasted the fields of biology are nothing but classification sciences there are two types of sciences extrapolative and classification one type of science which is physics mathematics and so forth is one which derives answers there is another type of science as described by roger bacon and when he set it up and he set up this type of science and he describes it by laying out botany as an example he said you could dream up this type of science and then he said if you wanted to put one around the subject of flowers you would go at it this way he just used it as passing example and that today is botany classification classification sciences if you know the names of eight hundred thousand gimmicks it is science see its not science actually at all its some kind of dictionary and when they dont know anything they name everything see classification sciences and then theres classifications and subclassifications and sub subclassifications and subsubsubsubsubclassifications and they call that science but its not extrapolative it doesnt let you learn anything and man to modern science is simply classification science and if you dont know the right name for the nonexistent parts of the brain then you know nothing about the mind and thats where theyve got you scientologist and thats why youre downgraded and thats why you really dont know your business because you dont know the parts of the brain and you also dont know that they add up to subject called the mind you cant go around spitting out this is the medulla oblongata and oblagata and so forth medically you cant go around spitting out this is the tibia this is the gluteus maximus dont you see these are classification sciences but that word science of course is added there as total falsity it isnt science its hodgepodge now im not degrading these people particularly im just showing you where they sit with all their glossy facade with all their hard sell on the subject of their great knowingness and their great authority they are yet in the field of the mind merely classification science and theyve gone off on the wrong foot they have got the man mixed up with the with steam engine or something and they try to analyze everything that he does on the basis of steam engine and they try to understand the mind on the basis and this is their big mistake on the basis of the conservation of energy somehow or another nothing is ever developed and nothing is ever destroyed so we have we have then this thing called conservation of energy and the field of physics being applied to man and when you try to understand man through the viewpoint of conservation of energy he doesnt make any sense see because you have to understand him on the basis of something would have to be done to him before he could do anything to anybody else in other words youd have to fill up his gas tank before he could do anything you see and then of course because this isnt true then the stimulus responses which they figure out arent true do you see how it follows then theyre going on this untrue basis that man never creates anything you see you couldnt understand the mind if you didnt realize the individual himself was just an individual who was capable of creation see and if you try to say he can never create and this is all just conservation of energy that energy is never created and never destroyed but just exists you immediately have misunderstood the whole subject you say one man is machine not an individual or living thing hes just some kind of machine that gets pulled together out of the ammonia and proteins you see now if we go that one more step and say that he never manufactures anything but its all stimulusresponse sort of thingamagooge and you have to put energy in to get energy out you feed guy pound of steak you get so many footpounds of work out of him dont you see if you figure it out that way why youre bound then if you study the subject at all to find out that the stimulus responses which are occurring arent occurring dont you see so then they say well hes totally incomprehensible and nobody can understand the subject well after youve laid down two conditions man is just sort of brain machine and hes other being weve we lay down that condition and then we say he never creates anything you see so therefore the mind is something that is put on him he never put it there then of course we come to the third conclusion after observation we find out that now we cant understand anything about it we come to the conclusion that its an incomprehensible subject so therefore we just sort of sweep aside the humanities and we say its an unworkable stupid field and we will simply keep classifying it and appoint lots of authorities in it and somehow or another squeeze by now along you come as scientologist and you say one heresy mans not machine hes thetan see hes hes being and we will just carry it back to this point he is being he is livingness and he records and thinks and the individual is that thing is this living unit and then you say well that sort of shoots it dont you see they say well what about this thing yeah what made it hahahaha well we say im sorry weve taken that as our basic point of assumption because we can demonstrate it see were not interested in what made it were just interested in what it is and there it is well he says youre crazy then because it doesnt agree with this other conservation of energy principle dont you see nothing is ever created nothing is ever destroyed some everything just exists you see and everything is sort of matter existing in space and time stream you see hes all messed up well hes therefore in rather violent disagreement with what youre trying to tell him an individual is an individual you take the body and brain off of him hes still standing there as an individual you put the body and brain back on youve still got the same individual slightly more confused see you could probably exteriorize him have him three feet in back of his head looking at his body and so and hed say wow you see be totally convinced and then yoyo back inside again couple of times and get very confused and then decide to have nothing to do with it because its so far beyond his understanding of the way things should be so because hes devoted to this thing called science thats his basic training science has certain criteria one of them is this thing called conservation of energy energy is never created well of course now you say this mind wheres it come from well the guys mocking it up see because this being is capable of native pure from nothing creation you know out of whole cloth he can mock it up see and thats his mind well now lot of us have an awful hard reality grabbing onto that i mean thats rough one you get gpm gnawing half of your skull off and its doesnt console you bit to say sit back and say well im just creating this because its on so many vias that you really cant believe it you know so you say it must have been done to you go around when was i implanted with this and how does it still exist you know all kinds of wild little oddball things keep entering your skull well if you can get into that shaky state and so forth well dont blame somebody else for not accepting the truth of the matter which is the fact that man mocks up his own mind it isnt being fed to him in big chunks hes doing it right here right now this instant all right youd run into immediately conservation of energy this immediately disagrees with any way he runs his automobile you got to put so many gallons of gas and so many gallons of quarts of oil in the thing and it consumes it and itll only run while its consuming well he proves this this is easily proven because you take body and you dont feed it and itll collapse so that proves then that man is incapable of creation do you see how wild that logic goes it just shifts because right away you say well you see he isnt his body well theyve forgotten that condition so you have to feed body so body then does act like machine because the person collapses if you dont feed him do you see how this wobbles so therefore it becomes incomprehensible where this thing called the mind came from so therefore it probably doesnt exist so the best thing to do is to cut his brain out see it cant be mind which is different than his brain do you see why it cant be is because there isnt anything there but the brain that could be given or shoved at this fellow if he eats food it turns into brain doesnt it do you see how the short circuited logic goes through here so obviously then there must only be the brain so when you scientologist say mind it is received by the classification authority who is pretending to be scientist its received by this authority as youve said brain see you say mind he receives brain now you say well were going to run out section of his mind that is troubling him he says it is easier to cut it out with knife why run it out do you see how youre at crosspurposes in any discussion here see hes arrived at these conclusions because if he feel if he follows the total dictates of what we call modern science then he will arrive in exactly the same trash heap with regard to the humanities see he cannot follow their rationale conservation of energy nothing is ever created you know he cant follow that rationale and arrive with any answers with regard to man because hes already put himself into two untrue conditions he said the individual sort of leaps spontaneously from the maternity ward thats how he comes into the world and then he never produces anything or he never creates anything so obviously then the only thing thats there is something that has to be fed that operates like machine dont you see so he makes these various errors and then gets very upset with you because you say we have some answers to the situation now of course you can go ahead and prove him wrong by getting result on preclear and of course youre using the basis that this preclear is himself thetan who is capable of creating and who is putting his mind up there all the time and whos making mental image pictures of every accident and pulling them in to his bosom and you straighten this out now hell be even perhaps even more upset because hes way adrift now he cannot understand how you do it you could go over it very carefully with him you could say well you see this guy has an accident you see and he bangs his head on the door well to some degree hes still stuck on that door banging his head you see and he has picture which is in held in suspension in his mind he says well where can this picture be in his brain he only has brai you get the idea his mind will short his training level short circuits off each one of these points and caroms off it youre not talking about the fellows brain youre not talking about his forehead youre saying this individual hit his forehead into door and hes got stuck picture at the moment he did that why he made picture of hitting his head into the door and hes still got this picture so therefore he has sensation of still being in the door all youve got to do is get him to feel the walls where he is and hell find out hes longer stuck at the door and there goes that headache ah but you see how the fellow youre trying to explain it to has now gone adrift hes gone wildly adrift painfully so itll give him headache so he falls back onto standard healing because it fits the idea that the body is machine and that being is nothing but an animate brain or computer some kind of biological computer and that its incapable of creation see theres nobody around who took picture of him and handed him this picture he so he couldnt have picture of the door youll find them berating i mean yeah the fellow we know all about mental image pictures ive had ive had guys do this this is theres some bird that copies our stuff in international news services doctor chary or cheeky or something i dont know what his name is i really at that time didnt know what his name was and some scientologist while ago challenged this bird because hed just taken good slab out of pab and he was barking away with this thing and writing up his column mr md writing up his column and he was having good time with this column and the scientologist said well you just took that out of pab and he wrote him back letter and said of course yes naturally yes i got the letter see yes hed tooken it out of our pab but also there was something else we didnt realize about the thing that doctors didnt use this and they knew this was all true but they didnt use this and they didnt pay any more attention to it and then he gave whole bunch of spurious reasons why they couldnt use this and so forth and it all added up to the fact they couldnt understand how it could happen that way so even though they knew that it was valuable and did happen that way they couldnt use it because you see it doesnt follow their rationale of thought in other words their rationale of thought is more important to them than an end result so we get the next difference between ourselves and the humanities the end result is more important to us than how we arrived at it you see were only thinking of how to arrive at the end result in order to produce the result in other words were not doodledaddling just to be doodledaddling and thats very easy for them to misunderstand the gracefulness with which you do transorbital leukotomy might be everything with them and itd be very very hard for you to figure out how that could be everything with anybody but if you think of sports itd become less hard to understand there are some sports this guy never wins tennis game but he has marvelous serving form his idea his idea has nothing to do with winning tennis games you see his idea is to have terrific form while playing tennis you get the idea so their whole their whole attention might very well be on form it might very well be on how gracefully you follow the authorities see it might be this and it might be that and the reason it would get this way is an end result has been totally denied them and they have end results so theyve begun to believe that there are end results in the field of the mind so you come along and you say an end result can occur in the field of the mind well that immediately makes you an heretic then you say well actually you have to follow along very exact discipline to get this end result but the end result is what is important this persons longer has migraine headache at the end of this thing all right they say they dont believe that its like leukemia we have several cases where weve cured people of leukemia and they inevitably prove that this isnt so by saying well he must have been misdiagnosed by the medical doctors in the first place they say he couldnt have had leukemia and you say well why couldnt he have had leukemia whats the matter with you and they say well he couldnt have had leukemia you see because its incurable you see thats by definition see that doesnt even make sense well what are they trying to do theyre trying to protect authority in an unworkable rationale that they themselves down deep know have failed they know this thing has failed they know its gone their question is how long can we put up the big bluff how long can we go on kidding ourselves how long can we go on getting fancy appropriations for not doing our job dont tell dont tell that an analyst whos been pounding his brains out for ten years and has seen patients committing suicide and going out windows and busting up and going into insane asylums and that sort of thing dont tell that this guy that any human being could be so stupid as to not be able to observe after while that he wasnt getting results see he after while even he would have to notice this and you talk to these boys and they are very theyre very loathe to notice this but even after while they must notice it then you come along and then you come along and you say well well you so and so and so what we got to get is an end result here what we got to get is migraineless being this person has chronic headaches all right well lets get him over the headaches you see lets see what these headaches consist of and lets get him over that and you go ahead and do it ah but they havent been invited to the party thats the next thing thats horrible that stands as terrible black mark against our faces they havent been invited to the party well actually they were invited to the party but they couldnt accept the first two principles you had to wear tie and jacket to come to this party and they wouldnt wear tie and jacket so we threw them out do you see that its just as elementary as that when they were invited to the party they stood around and argued madly about something we already had to assume for instance that man was not being dependent on body they couldnt assume this so they never really came to the party dont you see they never got off that first launching pad so they never started in on this line and they never will start in on the line and they regard you as an ogre whos going to eat them up and if you were to listen to small group of them sitting around in some large capital in the world right now and the subject were to come up scientology it would be note of fear disgust viciousness cross comments and note of fear they would be upset because they know their position has not been workable and that they are not giving the service and that they are sitting in there and here is group that if anybody ever got wise to the whole parade would simply take over and eat them all up and it doesnt do any good to try to invite them to the party and say well try to keep you in business and or anything like this or well be happy to train you or were not trying to shoot you down in your tracks it really doesnt do much good because they themselves are not aware of the genus of their own antipathies they are not as analytical of their own situation and so forth as i have just been you see they merely know theyre upset and they do know that this will this will take it sooner or later the breakthrough will occur and when it occurs theyre lost dogs theyll be as dead as yesterdays newspaper professionally they complain bitterly about the fact that their income is being cut into very badly and frankly note of pity came through the other day well the poor psychologist after all all they had was testing and we took that away from them many of us do and will start to feel sorry for the poor sods dont you see and go ahead and feel sorry for them but dont go into any snit of not comprehending what it is all about they were invited to the party but they wouldnt wear jacket or tie see and thats just about all there was to it you had to accept these two things to get workable result one that being was an independent thing that could exist independently of body and the other was that an individual was capable of you might say autocreation all by his little cottonpicking lonesome and by doing this he develops himself thing called mind which has mental masses and spaces and so forth in it and he builds himself little private universe all of his own which he carries around not inside of his skull but plastered all over this other universe and that is the thing which we are going for and the other point that we go along on because we do have these two bases on which we work we can then go along for result and we have become less and less tolerant of resu of lack of result you see less and less tolerant of lack of results youll find it getting more and more recurrent well it couldnt have been too good session the guy still had headache you know thats the thing but youll have somebody say oh well you see we got hundred and ninetyfive divisions of tone arm action i cant understand why somebodys looking and standing back there hell say somebodys lying in their teeth you see the guy still had headache so he did audit the whole session with his little finger at an angle of hundred and thirtyfive degrees to the horizontal tabletop you see at the end of the session the guy still had headache you see thats an incontrovertible fact to us well we find it hard to understand that profession or an activity could exist where that would not even be any part of the situation because situation which has gotten as many failures in the field of the mind and thinkingness and so forth as the present occupants of the throne of course lose to view the completed cycle of action theyve not completed the cycle of action ever so theyre sort of habitually never complete it so they never look at the result and they will tell you the elegance with which they did the operation you see now ive had these boys brag to about the elegance with which they did the electric shock you see it was well the records were all kept ive had madeyed psychiatrist telling this you know and remembering that i myself being an auditor could handle him if he got more violent you see yes but the records were all kept look at the records loooook at the records well what what about the records what do they prove well you should keep records well we keep records well what what what about these records what you ever examine these records see if they ever told you anything well theyre nice records look it there are columns and theyre kept here and you think im gagging you but im not im giving you almost an exact duplicate of this confounded interview one of the foremost psychiatrists in the united states big name and he finally said to i kept asking him this nasty stinking niggling auditing question see have you ever learned anything from these records and he finally tossed one off sideways to if ive told you about this before but i havent ever thought you would believe the degree finally he answered the question yes we found out that if we hadnt treated them theyd have been gone from here six weeks earlier than if we had treated them yes we found that out but arent they beautiful records and the guy it had just gone right over his head and so forth hed just said if youd kept your cotton picking hands off of all of these patients if you hadnt done doggone thing for any of them the average theyd have gotten out six weeks before they had gotten out in other words that all the treatment had ever done was cost the state per patient an average of six weeks more food clothing and shelter in other words hed extended the madness and it didnt seem to have any bearing on the situation the end that its pretty loopy so you get into that much loopiness you dont want to have too much to do with it and so you never really take time to try to understand it and im actually asking you now to understand it how could it exist otherwise than the individual says man is machine hes sort of biological monstrosity that has bunch of cells clicking against bunch of cells and you remove cell and you have cell missing and therefore theres part of this man is now missing you see and hes sort of an ambulant biological computing machine thats what he is and hes just an animal and product of something that sprang spontaneously of course he asks us to accept something more wild than were asking him to accept see this is real wild one you know that cell suddenly sprang by spontaneous combustion from sea of ammonia well man look at the conditions hes laid down hes made it necessary to have sea of ammonia this is the same thing like the virgin mary you know we at least are we at least are innocent of these second dynamic implications and other things we just say the guys there see and we are also saying were not going to worry where he came from hes just there this is the way this thing is you know and then he says hes incapable of making up anything so he must have gotten his mind somewhere which gives you immediate inflow and the real reason why he cant solve problems of the mind see he falls immediately into this fact that it must have been presented to him by w by the hot boy mind biscuit company or something you see another guy the guy starts out with with motivator not an overt see he says natively then man is an inflow mechanism and he gives you the exact reason why he cant make him well because hes got mans malady misdefined the mechanism he says works on an inflow basis and he says this with straight face hes never made it work see nobodys ever gotten better working on this inflow basis for any real length of time he never really solved the problems of the mind see hes also got these problems of the mind confused with problems of the body and hes pretty confused in all various directions but you see he says then that man is an inflow mechanism well actually man is an outflow mechanism if youre going to have any inflows or outflows at all and youd solve the guys problems on the basis of outflow you wouldnt solve them on the basis of inflow now if you want to prove this this is all susceptible to considerable proof if you want to prove this very nicely all youve got to do is run somebody on think of motivator thank you think of motivator thank you think of motivator thank you and watch your ta your ta will at first rise itll first stay fairly stable without doing anything and then itll eventually start to rise and then it will go up and then it will stick and there it will stick and you could run him for long time now with ta action with the individual paralleling the experience of the individual during this processing would be that of becoming fuzzier and fuzzier and worse and worse and nattier and nattier and feeling worse and worse and then sicker and sicker and hed wind up after while hed feel like he was stuffed full of cotton wool and it had been impregnated with some very very odorous substance of some kind or another hed really feel funny well thats following it out thats following out the quote scientific explanation of man we carry out the ne plus ultra hes machine he has gotten everything from exterior to himself so therefore you would then process what has been done to the individual and you would wind yourself up then with failed case you see if you follow their rationale you could not help but wind up with failed case we have an entirely different rationale the individual is independent of body and he is capable of mocking things up hes capable of mocking things up and his basic error was an outflow not an inflow and his basic action is an outflow action and what got him in trouble was outflowing and then he has learned not to outflow so he has eventually begun to inflow only and thats how he worked himself up into this state of thinking he can only inflow because what got him in trouble was outflowing that seems fairly obvious to i hope it appears obvious to you by their rationale then they could have wound up with nothing but the conclusion that an individual would have to inflow in order to be cured and your own personal experience which you could conduct would demonstrate to you that an individual would only recover if you recovered his ability to outflow and you know that but thats how we arrive at it and thats the two sides of the coin but we win with an end result and they dont win with an end result so therefore their premises would eventually be discarded by the society but at the state society is in theyre very very willing to believe an inflow basis theyre all trained into this scientific rationale to marked degree their religious training makes causes them to believe that they have soul and they keep it in their vest pocket or something and it has nothing to do with the individual theyre supposed to protect it or be good to it or purify it or do something like this but its something over there religion really does not recognize as the individual is soul this is not made plain but its easy for scientologists to think they do mean that because they havent made it plain we have they havent they used to say you will go to heaven you will go to hell thats been more or less dropped out of it but even then they were saying your soul will go to heaven and you read the later writings its all your soul should go to heaven and so forth and your soul will be condemned forever and all that sort of thing so even those birds you see were not much on the groove but frankly frankly we belong in inheriting anything in the direct channel of religion we really do not belong and this is not propaganda purposes we dont belong in the direct line of science we dont even think scientifically see if scientific thinking is based on these other premises of conservation of energy and that sort of thing were not in that line and frankly it is only recently that science tried to take bite on the subject of the mind its very very recent they only had custody of this thing called mind for very short period of time less than century really isnt that interesting in other words theyre very johnnycomelately and they interrupted the fact that religion took care of the field of the mind very nicely all down through the eons it was all religious activity you see and then there it is but in space opera why science very often takes over the field of the mind they very often do and then you get all kinds of oddball things being done to beings and so forth in the name of science they dont havent ever really taken it over with much comprehension they can do far more damaging actions they can do lots more damaging actions than this current scientific civilization has been able to do but the point im getting around to here is just that your inheritance goes back very very far in the field of religion and what we do to achieve our end result is directly and violently contrary to the scientific concepts of the way things are and now with the public being taught consistently and continuously along quote scientific principles of man is machine and all youve got to do is stuff him and he operates if you dont believe this that theyre under heavy hammer and pound just watch tv program sometime when you have nothing to do watch those ads if you just stuff something in good result occurs see thats the whole the whole song is played on that violin with great virtuosity if you just stuff something in something beneficial will occur well thats the first ladder that youve got to jump with the individual and youre not going to get him even in praying distance of the bottom rung of the ladder to ot unless youve got him out of if you just stuff something in something beneficial would occur and if you cant break that one then you will never get him to ot youll never get him to the bottom rung of the ladder now what im talking about here is not something id like to have true or anything like that it happens to have confronted us here in the last few weeks with violence now there practically nobody who comes to saint hill who is oddly enough very low on cause theyre not terribly low on causativeness ill tell you why they came to saint hill see do you see that well there was that much outflow involved dont you see well now the guy in the central organization that couldnt get up enough energy to come to saint hill then youd say well that fellow must be bit below the cause level of the person who did come to saint hill see because the person did outflow see all right now maybe someday youll have the experience that julia just had and that i have had many times and that you possibly have had many times too you get out in the jungle the human jungle after having been around scientology group or organization and you can stand it really just about so long and youll cut and run and go back to the group its just too much its their level of causation thats what gets your nerves it isnt that they dont talk your language its their noncommunication its the fact that they dont seem to connect with anything i always kick myself its the its the things you miss and dont get its the fish that got away you see photographers have it its the picture you didnt get i just ive just gotten picture i didnt get you know i dont know what happened to this other picture but it isnt on the films i just took and the very fact that there is one picture there which is right next to it which is absolutely bugeyed its impossible that anybody ever took that picture see the other one that i didnt get you see that is the perfect picture and thats missing so very nice set of pictures is rather muddied up in my mind by that there was one that should have been there dont you see what i mean there ones always mourning about these nonextant things the fish that got away the picture you didnt get the this the that the other thing and similarly in the field of human endeavor one can always look back at moments when something happened and he didnt make record of it or he didnt get it and so forth and he mourns and i mourn this because i was at cocktail party on the queen elizabeth and i would just love at this moment i had tape recorder down in my room it was all set for 7½ and i didnt take it all i had to have was thing over my shoulder and just have thrown the clip on the thing and we would have had the whole thing i could turn it on right now and itd be perfect example you would howl youd practically roll on the floor there was not one statement made in that cocktail party that was ever received by another member of the cocktail party there was not one remark ever received and remark made concerned or was intended for anybody but the person making it its the wildest series of pinpointed introversions you ever saw passing as social communication point craziest thing i all non sequitur nothing has anything to do with anything the emanated remarks if they appeared to emanate really werent emanating remarks they concerned the individual on nonemanation basis dont you see hes speaking of crazy well those people were rich they were able to go on vacation trip they werent they werent as bad off as the people who stayed home now we have our faults as individuals but were so much better than whats walking out in the street man theres frankly comparison see we may be bad off but wow i dont mean to be snide about it but there it is its fact youre going to get those people out there up to the bottom rung of ot theres another ladder and they got to climb this other ladder and it is the ladder of raising ones cause level you could also call it an outflow level you could also call it reach level but youve got to youve got to get them up to the recognition of the world around them i mean the world immediately around them the capability of recognizing the immediate vicinity i mean immediate vicinity too man in other words the first barrier youve got to crack is the total introversion to slight extroversion in other words from total introversion you know nothing exists here i am walking in this unreal zone and of course its all all right because nothing is here anyway and im not here either and i dont exist either and your expanding perimeter the first few grades is entirely breaking through those various barriers just to the environment and this is laid on us as restriction for ot not because i say so and not because you cant audit or any other derogatory reason its just that the poor guy who is sitting there cannot asis an item he it see its laid on us for very good reason not social reason its simply that he has to have the ability to cause slightly before he can cause an item to asis in other words his reach has got to be good enough so that he can at least reach causatively in the direction of the item hes trying to asis and if the individual cannot do that he cant asis the item and it wouldnt matter if you had him deadon and square in the center of exactly what he was supposed to be running and it was in perfect sequence you would say spatterguff cuffcuff and not blessed blasted thing would happen on that emeter you understand now to give you the degree that this is true some of the level vi co audit small percentage of them but some of these were what we call what youll hear more of is type b when they first started in now you understand that these people were not really low on cause im trying to give you an idea of how high you have to be on cause see these people had had lot of processing these people had had this im not downgrading them if they were put in the right item exactly deadon with all rudiments in you would get an asisness you understand but the rest of the people the other percentage in the coaudit could be put just little bit crosswise to this item and itd asis see it could be little bit out of sequence it could be two down from where you were supposed to go and yet youd see the meter go you understand well now look were talking about pretty good people now what do you think about not the guy out in some group someplace but what do you think about this bird on the street what do you think about the bird in the house that cant go out on the street you could put him in the right place at the right time and say blogablog wogwog and not blessed blasted thing would happen because his level of causation is too poor and if you did throw him into gpm and tell him to asis it he wouldnt do anything to the gpm but itd sure chew hell out of him nothing would happen to the bank but plenty would happen to the pc do you see the reverse curve well now thats condition then necessary to running level vi and that hasnt been forced on us by anything but the observation of the facts the facts are just that level of causation now you can take somebody who is tired and ill be talking more about this but you can take type who can usually asis most anything and sometimes youll get meter pack up meter just packs up suddenly nothing is asising hes sitting deadon what he should be sitting on and its packed up you wont get any meter action at all if you go into this you usually find out well he didnt have any breakfast or something like that is he hasnt eaten and hes running himself down and hes so the body is doing sort of sp drysponge effect on him as thetan you see and he may be too tired and thats usually the common denominator thats the more important hes just tired you could take anybody who ran well on gpms and run him at 3 oclock in the morning and the probabilities of his being able to asis gpm would be very slight indeed you could take type pc and run him from midnight let us say till six and i absolutely guarantee that some hour of that run the meter is going to pack up and it will lock up the prettiest you ever saw in your life on the right goal in the right sequence on the right item and back charge and absolutely nothing wrong with the case at all and that meter will pack up its simply exhaustion the only thing you can get the meter to read on well whats the matter are you tired and youll get read and thats the only read youre going to get now whats this first ladder its raising the cause level of the individual to point where he can asis something well that must be very tiny gradient because if the individual cannot asis his personal problems he cannot asis his constant worry about something or other he cant do this he cant do that well you better jolly well not expect this individual to be asising an item in gpm hahaha and he wont be able to do it that i guarantee now if you look at it the other way to and say well thats simple then really all youd have to do is find the gpm that he is worried about and run it ah look im showing you already that the gpm that is there is ready to run wouldnt fire what do you think will happen to one that is out of sequence so this barriered very beautiful idea i had which was very lovely idea it was lovely idea and it stayed in the idea stage because it only works on if i find myself thinking too hard about something i can always skip down through the end words and pick out the one thats gotten into restim and let it blow down this is little bit heroic and i thought how marvelous all youd have to do at level iv is just assess the end words you see you remember telling you well it doesnt work all that happens is the pc packs up you get about one end word back and that is the end of that meter man its finished gone well so that was beautiful dream that didnt come acr off but whats wrong with it is what youll be facing from here on youll go right on facing this point so theres use talking about well theres those lowergrade levels and so anybody can run those you see what we want to run is these big uppergrade levels you see and really get it done in hurry and therefore we dont have to know anything about this earlier auditing well ill tell you in an awful lot the majority of the cases that you tackle your later ability your on the higher levels of auditing will stand you in good stead at all except make you smoother auditor perhaps on the lower levels you wait youll get joe blow in there and youll be all set and rolling up your sleeves and all ready to go and all you got to do is go on down the bank and youll find yourself trying to climb the second ladder when you should have been on the first one so after youve had some signal failures on trying to do this and the pc is getting more and more headachy and more and more upset and more and more this and more and more that so on you will eventually go back and start climbing the first ladder and it will be with great satisfaction you find out that you have not lost your ability to get pcs to climb that ladder providing you know what ladder theyre climbing and its simply the ladder of cause thats all the ability to cause and where persons cause level is too low person cannot asis his bank and where person cant asis his bank by looking at it or examining it or cogniting on it he of course gets disappearance of whats worrying him because hes the effect of his bank and hes the effect of it very strenuously and so your whole task matter what processes you use is to put the pc at cause and get him more and more at cause and now you put your wits to it and try to figure out various ways of doing this you can undoubtedly come up with lots of applications of old materials you might never have dreamed of before certain ways to run this or that or the other thing you see and certain ramifications of old ow suddenly start showing up and kicking you in the head that you never really suspected before because if youre running ow today youre simply running it to raise somebodys cause level thats all of course its the biggest barrier there is to his cause level because hes done something he regrets and furthermore hes not telling anybody about it well so thats very destructive to his cause level but that today is not why youre running ow youre just running ow just to get certainty on having done and get asisness of doneness thats about all there is to that youre not even looking for crimes dont you see and youll find out by the way that and ill go into this in later lecture but youll find out that its highly probable that very few of your pcs have ever answered the auditing question because you want to find out what the guy did and hes looking for an explanation you want to find out what he did and hes looking for an explanation for what happened to him see and then some pc will go plunging madly trying to hit some happy chance that he will hit the explanation for what has happened to him by telling you bunch of things hes not sure happened at all dont you see and hell start yoyoing around whereas all you want is the answer to your auditing question just what have you done not what have you done bad or what have you done that is antisocial or what have you done that explains the fact that youve got sciatica see none of none of these things none of these things youre just asking him what hes done well of course pretty legitimate answer to that is ive eaten breakfast but somebody gives you an explanation on it you know like well i ate breakfast and that is probably why hes not running it see hes trying to find an answer to and there are various ways that people can avoid running ow and theyre startling in the numbers of variations which they have and you as the auditor all you have to do is police and make sure the person is certain that he did do that thats all you have to police on the subject and make sure that that is policed because they very often get pretty dazed and theyll give you alterises and they can actually make themselves worse where youve ever had any trouble with running ow the individual was giving you alterises he was giving you he was trying to find the answer that explained what had happened to him and in doing so he was dreaming up fictitious events he was not sure of and then of course ow doesnt work because like any other process if it isnt run it doesnt work but theres an enormous amount of ceiling an almost unlimited ceiling to just what have you done you can say what have you done what have you not done and you know what have you said what have you not said or what have you done and what have you not said or what havent you said you could get all kinds of various combinations you could run it as itsa and you could run it as this and that and the other thing you see terrific ramifications you get into the objective side of it you can convert 8c with little bit of an expert touch you see so that the individual is reaching and is touching and is sure of that dont you see you can get numerous objective and subjective approaches here all of which raise cause level and the you could say then the object of all lowerlevel processing up to level vi is to raise the cause level of the individual and you can even draw series of concentric circles around the individual in the center which represent the degree he can cause or reach so the individual has just spot in the middle of it originally can reach nothing everything reaches him well youve got to convert this and the way to convert it is not to run out what has reached him but to go on trying to reach trying to get this individuals reach extended and eventually you get out to this first very small circle around the individual and that is well his body himself you see his body now he might be able to reach something that is few feet away youll find out that distance has great deal to do with this then you get into very unreal estimations of distance the individual could reached from london to cape town but not to the settee on the other side of the room you see you get they get very weird concepts of reach and distance these things are inverting and upsetting and hell eventually get out to wider and wider perimeters this is cause level when youve raised the individuals cause level up the individual will be able to asis things of course then you get what whole index of what can not only the distance and the character of things that can be reached but you also get what the individual is capable of asising in his mind he can asis light lock that happened minute ago see or he can asis pt problem that was worrying him yesterday or he could asis pt problem that worried him twenty years ago see not any longer important and doesnt apply so he can asis it see you get the idea and you eventually build that up and youll have an individual who can reach the second ladder he can reach the bottom rung of the second ladder but unless you walk up that first ladder you dont ever get to the second ladder that the society is so gauged and organized and constructed that it would bow down to this nonsense that theyre currently calling human sciences tells you it must the common denominator of introversion on the first must be pretty fantastic must be pretty confoundedly fantastic if what sells them is the type of tv ad that you see must be pretty fantastic see the individuals ability to reach must be pretty confoundedly low staggeringly so now if then they bow down as i said before to scientific rationale which justifies their inability to cause anything then what sort of society are you looking at here well dont then go around and beat your head against the wall and cry crocodile tears because the society doesnt understand you and doesnt appreciate you why look for heaven sakes it doesnt even know it exists youre trying to get youre trying to get appreciation from hidden rock that even if you found it and got it in plain sight wouldnt ever say thank you dont you see your basic error if you have any in your relationship to the society around you is to do comparable basis and say its as alive as i am and of course it isnt you could say i underst its understanding of life is comparable to mine and of course it isnt and therefore you can feel very bad when somebody stands up and says all scientologists are bums its interesting the other day that the american medical association took its finger off its button if it has one and it said that all questionable activities not this is not direct quote but something on the order of all questionable activities in the united states are now hiding under the name of scientologist i think its fantastic admission for an organization like that to make theyre calling themselves scientologists so they can get away with it now you look at the rationale back of that it betrays immediately and at once what they are really sort of spooked about and think about and what theyre what theyre worried about theyve stopped saying scientologists are bad dont you see theyre just saying that other people use it as mask and that some pretty bad things can go on theyll be explaining to everybody theres nothing wrong with scientology its just that other people can use it you see as cover and thats why it has to be wiped out dont you see but they dont even know what theyre trying to wipe out you see and they dont even know where its located really they dont know what its all about and people who are in that state wipe themselves out faster than they shoot the enemy bunch of very introverted troops are more of menace to themselves than they are to the enemy i remember bunch of bunch of scared johnnycomelately got up on guadalcanal and i was bunking with their captain and he was in fine state he was in fine state he came back he was several shades of green because theyd gotten up into this jungle and coconut or something had dropped and theyd just gotten off the boat you see bunch of boot recruits when they were pushing them in at the last minute you know and coconut had dropped or something like that and everybody let go with everything he had his whole company started firing not at anything there wasnt anything to and of course the only they were there and he fortunately didnt get any casualties out of it but he wondered how in the name of common sense he escaped having the whole company wiped out by itself and that was their first foray behind japanese lines he talked to them quite while and for several days before he let them go again you see anyway the theyre far more of menace to themselves and they will eventually start passing rules and restrictions you can watch it and running each other down for instance theyve just written book law liberty and psychiatry i think it is something like that which is written by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and its well authenticated and it just tears up psychiatry and throws it away it says much more vicious things about psychiatry than i have ever said and it proves conclusively that the nation had better get rid of psychiatry right now before it loses all the freedom and liberty which it has left and this is published by the macmillan company one of the biggest and most reputable publishers and it is going around madly in other words their own high levels of authority when you see people losing they introvert and if theyre already introverted why they will they will lose fast so they arent any real great menace the only thing that is great menace in this regard is not the fact that weve got opponents if we dont have opponents not real ones the only thing weve got that can mess us up really is ourselves in not realizing that an individual has got ladder to climb before he gets onto the upper ladder and you go around selling everybody on the beautiful idea that hes got to go to ot and all hes got to do is run some goals and gpms and thats all hes got to do and everything will be all fine and copacetic then were going to lay an awful lot of eggs were going to have lot of failures were going to have lot of mess on our hands and so forth what youve got to do is tell him fast furious hot and heavy is what youve got to do is raise your cause level thats sufficient target all in itself let alone ot see be able to cause things in your environment simple these people are bothering you well do things that bother them we dont care what you do you see we dont care how you explain this dont you see and youll find the public at large would be able to understand that oddly enough and to that degree their cause level is raised see well you keep pushing them up the line this way you got it made but the idea is that we cant go on selling an upper strata that cannot be attained without ourselves then losing heavily what weve got to do is sell the first ladder that can be obtained and hit that real heavy and do it very very well and be able to handle it very very well and all that consists of is just making the individual more causative bringing him up bit higher along the line so that we start in just as we did in days of yore we said well wed bring the individual up to point where he can handle his own problems were not interested in handling the problem for the individual were interested how many times have you said this you see were interested in bringing the individual up to point where he can handle his own problems well you just better hit that chord with both paws and both feet see because that is road out that is the only road out for such people so theres where theres where your future comprehension and understanding of these things lies and where your future success lies now of course you can say at the same time this individuals keyed out clear because this wonderful technical fact does stay in our favor is actually the only thing that will key out gpm without paying any attention to it whatsoever is some version of ow its senior to gpms so you can make keyedout clear and you can key the fellow all the way out and by that time his cause level is raised so high that he can of course enter the bank at the proper place and asis it then hes ready for ot of course you can cut in and go ot before that well before that but thats still theoretical target even if its one that youre not going to attain particularly for the individual before he switches to the other route but heres the point the point is that you do have technology which wildly enough is senior to the bank itself which is doable all the way south and without which the individual can never come up the point of as ising what is really troubling him which is the bank and this is very fortuitous set of circumstances but it brings before our eye that the individual to get on the first ladder has got to have done something and you cant have people around who havent done anything at all ever who can asis these people will not be able to asis so your immediate and direct test of whether or not an individual can asis is has he ever done anything youll get an introversion where an individual isnt withholding anything he never done anything or with the things he has done that hell give you vicious horrible crimes that he has done of one kind or another trouble is we dont know theyre true or not and he doesnt know whether he did them or not what youve got to do is find something he knows hes done and raise him from there it isnt the quality of the deed its just whether or not he has done it youve got this technology theres lot of this technology it fits objectively it fits subjectively it works on anything that can be processed all the way down the line and if you stress keyedout clear raise your cause level get yourself up to point where you can handle your immediate perimeter before you take on pluto youll find that this is very easy to make this bridge and the public at large will be able to make the bridge and follow through in spite of the fact that theyre already crippled by philosophy which says they arent even there you can still get over that bridge and come forward and win in the long run and thats the first ladder thats got to be climbed before you throw somebody into the bank and say go on and swim you once in while are going to run into pc that when you say give the first two items the first item of the bank youre going to get it and its going to blow down and everythings going fine and the pc because youre good auditor is going to run like welloiled dream and that is going to spoil your whole concept of it because youve just accidentally gotten ahold of type it was sitting there ready to be plucked see and youre going to forget that this person had ninetynine others that you could have chosen none of whom would have been able to do it that little win will tend to throw you off of that program just remember i cautioned you when you get the next person and you throw him into the top of the bank and he instantly goes to the hospital he didnt do anything to it but it sure did plenty to him the bank could cause but he couldnt now theres the road out and there is the easy road out for you as an auditor theres the easy road out for an organization theres the easy public approach road out this is the drum you should beat on the public yes you can say we can make ots we can do this we can do that or you can say anything you please along these lines but the one you pound pound pound is you say raise your cause level raise your cause level and when i see what you can do in your immediate perimeter then we will start talking about taking on the moon and quartering it see keyedout clear why dont you become keyedout clear thats very very desirable goal lets work in that particular direction dont you see in other words thats the one you pound thats the one you pound thats the one you sell and then people will make it otherwise youre going to hand them big lose and after this tremendously fantastic fortunate breakthrough which weve made in scientology at this time and so on as far as im concerned its the only breakthrough thats been made in the field of the mind why lets not lose just because we neglect this little slight point that we try to put people on ladder two before they start even vaguely to locate ladder one much less climb it thank you
