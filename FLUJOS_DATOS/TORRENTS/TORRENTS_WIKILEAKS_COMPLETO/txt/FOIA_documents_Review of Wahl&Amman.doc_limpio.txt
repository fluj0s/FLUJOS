review of ms 3321 by wahl and amman this paper is to be thoroughly welcomed and is particularly timely with the next ipcc assessment coming along in 2007 the availability of the data and the programs on website will go long way to silencing the critics i suspect though that this will not be the last word on the subject whilst it would have been good to have had all the discussion of mbh in one paper i can fully understand the separation into number of specific areas i have one major comment which is only meant as suggestion but i think it would make the paper more useful this is to include map of proxy series andor table giving the locations and lengths of the sites if this is with the supplementary material then that is adequate i have one other point regarding the writing style it is little germanic with long sentences and paragraphs these could be shortened little also there is much specific detail in parentheses depending on journal style these might be better accommodated through footnotes or in series of endnotes specific points these suggest improvements to enhance clarity and also suggestions for pieces of text that could do with little more thought the detail will be assessed with fine toothcomb by few it should be as clear as possible 1 principle to principal this occurs everywhere 2 calculations may be done but for written english it is better to say performed or undertaken 3 the last two sentences on p1 could benefit from slight bit of re writing 4 rephrase reduced downward magnitude 5 in the list of other studies on p2 i would separate out moberg et 2005 and huang 2004 as these arent strictly highresolution reconstructions these two attempt to combine highand lowfrequency information bradley and jones 1993 could also be separated as it is decadal ie not annually resolved 6 i would qualify or remove with table policy implications you report the science leave the implications to others p3 7 i would replace congruence by agreement p3 8 can you explain exactly what you mean by amplitude this depends somewhat on how the data are portrayed degree of smoothing etc p3 9 expectable to expected p3 10 at the bottom of p3 you should say how many of the 415 are proxy and how many instrumental i would expand on this further to separate proxy into natural from documentary for the 1820 onwards period documentary are degraded instrumental see jones and mann 2004 you could add view on the worth of adding the early 19th century instrumental data it might have been better to remove cet then use it for independent validation over much longer time frame to consider the lowfrequency aspects 11 the reference to responses to moberg et 2005 may have to be removed 12 spell out aogcm in full p4 13 i would prefer projections using least squares regression they are not least square projections this occurs few times 14 some work on the 2nd paragraph of p4 is warranted phrases like modelbased reconstruction real model should be avoided it is better to say spatially incompletecomplete modelling situation is phase to avoid also what does farfield patterns of variability mean 15 temperature deviations to temperature fluctuations p4 16 under expression to supprssion p4 17 trend on either end to trend at either end p5 18 state exactly where the discussed below occurs say see discussion is section xy 19 i would add c to all degree signs 20 perhaps it is worth pointing out here that both von storch et 2004 and moberg et 2005 do state that they also produce unprecedented late 20th century warmth but dont highlight this in summaryconclusions 21 complete validation to complete assessment p6 22 cause and effect have also been discussed by jones and mann 2004 23 at the bottom of p6 you could mention that the 15th century warmth in mm is also at odds with all the other ie not just mbh reconstructions and that the closest reconstruction to mm is mbh albeit mm is long way from mbh but as your analysis shows mm is clearly wrong the fact that all other series gave lower temperatures at this time should have indicated to mm that something was wrong with their analysis 24 have not yet been addressed p7 25 as an antecedent to prior p7 26 you use the phrase pc summaries many times would pc compression be better term 27 comment about the necessity to undertake independent verification of reconstructions cf jones and mann 2004 would be appropriate at the bottom of p7 this could be contrasted with moberg et 2005 where their low frequency variability is essentially an act of faith as the slowly responding proxies cannot be verified 28 say relative to mbh mm05a question 29 pc extraction maybe pc compression is better p8 30 remove and say at the beginning we will show later in section xy that the temporal 31 i would rather refer to the scenario sections as 221 222 etc i dont think scenario is the right word but couldnt think of anything better choice selection option are possibilities scenario is storyline 32 their reconstruction last line of p11 33 backwards and forwards p12 34 mm03 cf their fig4 this also occurs elsewhere 35 specify where see above bottom of p13 is 36 as your reconstruction of mbh is so close to the original are you in position to say which proxies are most important in other words can you reduce the mbh method to one which is linear equation where the predictand is linear summation of the predictors you could then show for each pc which are the most important predictors 37 define better what is meant by spatially repetitive p14 38 rajagoplan p15 39 there is potential problem of independence from mbh that mm might try and use this relates to some of the in press references notably rutherford et 2005 hopefully this will be guarded against i guess im saying will mm think you are independent making the code and data available should suffice here 40 rephrase mbh98 recreation p18 41 why is equal weighting of proxies an issue isnt the method regression based p19 42 rephraseclarify weights imputed to the proxy series p20 43 bottom line of p20 say their result 44 6th last line of p21 say their fig 2 45 2nd last line of p21 is the original mbh 46 say data poorer rather than less data rich 47 8th last line after scenario 1 could you add ie as in mm03 48 say late 20thcentury instrumental temperatures p24 49 49 paragraphs get very long here p2325 50 last line of main paragraph on p26 replace bans by omits 51 remove of after failure is verify on p26 52 several forms of assessment p29 assessment instead of check 53 the phrase do not climatological meaning is just about ok it could also be said as makes sense climatologically but what you mean is not warranted from the perspective of the re values
