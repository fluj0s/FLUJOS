part i background and outline of the new policy ref 05 paris 5459 b 06 paris 5733 paris 00001501 0012 of 006 classified by political ministercounselor kathleen allegrone 14 b d 1 c summary the revised africa policy president nicolas sarkozy announced after taking office in may 2007 is taking shape this new policy features reduction and consolidation of frances military presence to align it more closely with africas regional structures more businesslike relations replacing the franceafrique model larger eu and roles and increased expectations in terms of transparency good governance and results on the part of africans receiving french aid while the advantages of franceafrique allowed that model to endure for decades its saliency has weakened as the colonial era grows more distant and as the political and economic costs to france of backstopping former colonies have become harder to sustain in modernizing and normalizing relations with africa the french risk losing some influence while reducing number of burdens this is tradeoff they believe they must make and seem confident that the france engaged with africans on these new terms will be an attractive partner capable of sustaining old relationships and cultivating and nurturing new ones across the continent the new policy may also provide opportunities for the us to extend its influence in africa without meeting french resistance or interference part i this message provides historical background and outlines sarkozys policy shift part ii septel focuses on its implementation and african reaction part iii septel centers on the new policys militarysecurity aspects end summary franceafrique 2 c former cote divoire president houphouetboigny reputedly coined the phrase franceafrique in french the more evocative francafrique with cedilla under the c to describe the complex web of economic military political social and cultural ties that linked france with its former colonies and to lesser extent nonfrancophone africa these ties built over decades of colonial rule persisted after independence in the 1960s and provided mutually beneficial environment for both sides with africans enjoying french protection military and security support and not least foreign aid 3 c the governmental educational legal military bureaucratic and administrative systems and methods of many former african colonies were modeled on french structures and many still are french is often the official language and lingua franca sometimes in competition with dominant local language in several african countries often air travel between nearby african countries could only be done by transiting paris these factors alone guaranteed continuing french influence postindependence in many african societies other benefits were manifest african leaders were able to amass private fortunes sometimes transformed into vast real estate and other holdings in france and elsewhere in europe cases of which the press continues to uncover to this day france profited from readymade set of compliant client states and leaders easy access to resources and markets for exports and tacitly accorded freedom of action both private and official for french and locals alike of the sort that produced cases like the falcone affair the longrunning arms trafficking case in angola 4 c culturally africans of the colonial and independence eras were deeply steeped in french ways with some achieving high positions in france eg houphouetboignys serving in the french government and senegal president senghors rise to the very pinnacle of french society with his election to the academie francaise the african elite and their children were often schooled in france with the everexpanding francophonie movement paris 00001501 0022 of 006 ensuring that they remained part of frances global network at the other end of the scale tens of thousands of african colonial troops fought for france during the world wars and other conflicts with surviving veterans still receiving pensions for their service to france 5 c franceafrique operated well for decades under the tutelage of succession of mr africas at the french presidency beginning with the legendary and controversial jacques foccart africa advisor to gaulle pompidou and briefly mitterrand and chirac others in that role have included mitterrands jeanchristophe for many years the africa advisor at the presidency did not report to the presidents diplomatic advisor the french equivalent of our national security advisor but directly to the president thus enjoying status equal to or perhaps even greater than that of the diplomatic advisor who had to worry about the rest of the world fact not lost on those currying favor at the presidency nothing lasts forever 6 c as the 20th century drew to close franceafrique as an effective model began having trouble adjusting to changing global landscape we noted certain factors in ref 05 paris 5459 the future of france in subsaharan africa these include shrinking older generations on both sides wedded to franceafrique younger generations lacking such knowledge and experience and less reflexively inclined to view relations through the franceafrique optic increased exposure of africans to other parts of the world either first hand or through the omnipresent global media aggressive pursuit of african resources and commerce by hitherto outsiders eg especially china see ref b 06 paris 5733 china in africa and culturally and socially growing exposure to nonfrench films fashions sports music and literature with the us enjoying an advantage in this area francophone africans began to lose their tendency to look to france as their model in short franceafrique began falling victim to several of globalizations effects 7 c for france the cost of maintaining franceafrique started becoming less commensurate with its returns both political and economic france shifted to an allvolunteer military in 2001 which immediately increased the cost of sustaining global military presence eu requirements limit deficit spending frances traditionally generous safety net and an aging population strain finances and booming and resourcehungry economies elsewhere raise the cost of commercial transactions threatening french privilege in africa costcutting at home and abroad has become priority for the gof and maintaining the qualitative and quantitative investment franceafrique entailed is becoming harder to accomplish 8 c politically brush fires have occurred that are harder and more expensive to put out the french are quite bitter about cote divoire once crown jewel of franceafrique which spiraled into chaos after the death of one of franceafriques biggest advocates and beneficiaries houphouetboigny reaching nadir with the november 2004 bombing by cote divoire of french forces in bouake operation licorne in cote divoire perhaps frances last unilateral military intervention in the old style has cost france about 250 million euro per year or well over billion euro in total without yielding decisive results 9 c other brush fires and scandals which in earlier days might have been ignored or covered up have erupted with regularity borrel in djibouti kieffer in cote divoire and falcone in angola to name few in addition to falcone other renegade french in recent times have been making mischief across the continent bob dennard repeatedly in the comoros gnassingbe advisor charles debbasch and arms dealer robert montoya in togo with effects in cote divoire and recently the zoes ark rescue paris 00001501 0032 of 006 mission of darfur children 10 c in the past the gof might have tacitly or openly tolerated or even supported some of these activities now with an instant global media and the weakened cover afforded by deteriorating franceafrique these become problems if not major scandals that must be addressed in less sheltered environment one oldtimer commenting on sarkozys trip to chad in the zoes ark case to seek the partial release of french and other europeans implicated in the adoption scandal sniffed that it used to be that one phone call from the elysee would have settled this how far we have come that the president himself has to go there and even then doesnt really finish the job in pushing for good governance transparency accountability and free press as part of its democratization foreign assistance and human rights agendas france has partly become its own victim as those forces have helped bring scandals to light 11 c franceafrique provided privileges to france but carried burden of expectation that has become harder to shoulder everyone acknowledged frances primacy in parts of africa but this created expectations that when problems arose the french will take care of it france was long able and willing to face these challenges when everyone accepted this reality but that is longer the case franceafrique has sometimes been doubleedged sword with some including africans wanting france to intervene forcefully when problems arise but with others happy to accuse france of acting unilaterally or as neocolonialist when it does damned if you do damned if you dont has become an underlying theme in the debate over frances role in africa 12 c the chirac government while aware of franceafriques stagnation was disinclined to do much about it and tried to preserve franceafriques facade acting in the old style chirac to some embarrassment was quick to mourn the 2005 death of his friend eyadema in togo and to accept quickly the questionable process that led to his sons taking power the presidency citing executive privilege refused to turn over records to judicial authorities investigating the borrel case although michel bonnecorse the presidencys last mr africa had to suffer the indignity of having his personal home and vacation house searched as in the heyday of franceafrique the french military was given relatively free hand in responding militarily to rebel incursions in chad and car prior to the end of the chirac era sarkozy brings change 13 c as he did in other areas on taking office in may 2007 sarkozy wrought change to the africa account his basic approach has been to try to clean the slates rid relations of the colonial era hangover and conduct more normal and businesslike relations with africans he is quick to attribute events and activities before his presidency to past french governments always suggesting that he represents new era 14 cnf sarkozy did away with the mr africa position at least on paper he named jeandavid levitte who had the same job under chirac before becoming permrep and then ambassador to the us as his diplomatic advisor and bruno joubert as levittes deputy joubert however is also the presidents senior advisor on africa and was previously mfa as for africa the mr africa position longer officially exists but joubert already wearing one hat as levittes deputy functionally also wears the hat the former africa advisors wore although he now reports to levitte rather than directly to the president two technical counselors work with him remi marechaux francophone africa plus south africa specialty and romain serman nonfrancophone africa issues and crises when one of marechauxs countries goes into crisis serman will often paris 00001501 0042 of 006 take charge marechaux was an mfa af dasequivalent when joubert was mfa af as and serman previously covered africa at the marechaux earlier worked at the department under the fellowship of hope exchange program 15 cnf joubert marechaux and serman make an effective team with complementary styles joubert classic diplomat smooth and savvy bureaucratically marechaux intellectual cerebral and somewhat reserved and serman fiery action oriented and master of rapid repartee in both french and english they dominate african issues within the gof and although they collaborate closely with mfa colleagues they seem to win intragof disputes their mfa counterparts af as jean gliniasty and dass helene gal christine fages and temporarily christian daziano are also quite capable and friendly but they do not have the same drive or clout that comes with being in close proximity to the hyperactive and demanding sarkozy joubert who knew her when he was mfa af as and gliniasty handpicked charlotte montel virtual firsttour officer and 2009 ivlp member to serve in fm kouchners cabinet ensuring the presence of dependable colleague on african issues within kouchners inner circle montels role has increased with the recent departure of laurent contini new ambassador to zimbabwe who was kouchners senior af advisor but who will not be replaced the new policy 16 c sarkozy used three speeches to express publicly the new direction africa policy would take in dakar on july 26 2007 in lisbon at the euafrica summit on december 8 2007 and in cape town on february 28 2008 the general theme emerging from these speeches is that france will seek to modernize relations get rid of lingering colonialist and postcolonialist baggage engage with africans on more businesslike and armslength basis longer seek to play paternal role and instead opt for partnership among equals to be sure sarkozy promises continued french engagement but engagement based on calculation of interests rather than on inertia and outdated sentiments deemed to be relics of the past he calls on africans to meet this challenge and to begin relating to france and others on the same basis 17 c the speeches and the outlines of the new policy were received with varying degrees of acceptance the dakar speech included apologies for frances colonial past but also suggested that africans needed to acknowledge that they derived benefits from the colonial period sarkozy stated that africans needed to become more selfreliant less dependent and to take charge of their destinies without raising colonialism and its ills as the continuing source of their problems or as excuses some africans welcomed sarkozys speech as necessary dose of reality while others claimed that his call for less paternalistic relationship was delivered in distinctly paternalistic and condescending manner see part ii septel for discussion of africa reactions to sarkozys policy 18 cnf presidential advisor serman later said that the dakar speech was drafted by henri guaino sarkozys special advisor and had not been vetted by levitte jouberts unit or the mfa serman believed the speech was too provocative and not diplomatic enough and would have been revised had guaino not given it uncleared directly to sarkozy of note on july 26 2008 one year after the dakar speech guaino published selfserving article in monde justifying the approach he took in the speech the lisbon and cape town speeches received closer vetting and their tone was less aggressive although their contents built on the foundation laid in dakar the lisbon speech delivered at the euafrica summit stressed the importance of strong europe working with strong africa the centerpiece of the cape town speech was sarkozys plan to change frances military posture in africa analyzed in part iii septel paris 00001501 0052 of 006 reward the good punish the bad 19 c our gof contacts say that sarkozys africa policy intends to normalize relations with africa strip them of the franceafrique veneer make them more transparent hold africans to certain standards of accountability and responsibility and end franceafriques long cycle of dependency and paternalism serman puts it succinctly sarkozy wants to reward the good and punish the bad the gof views some of the defense agreements see part iii septel maintained with eight african countries as patently absurd and out of date for example serman says that several agreements give france exclusive monopoly rights to natural resources nobody pays any attention to this so we need to get rid of it all and stop playing pretend us an attractive partner in africa 20 c sarkozys policy acknowledges the growing role in africa of former outsiders such as china and takes favorable view towards increased us engagement although skeptical at first and sensitive about protecting french influence the french have gradually come to accept if not welcome us activities such as africom tsctp acota agoa mcc and other africacentric us projects the french do not find them threatening and moreover they offer the possibility of new us willingness to share the burden in africa that earlier fell largely on france moreover the french are comfortable with an expanding us presence in africa as counterbalance to chinas regional expansion sarkozys policy combined with his generally favorable views of the us may allow the us freer hand in africa at least as far as the french are concerned 21 c similarly the french are seeking to increase eu and engagement in africa as another form of burdensharing and to allow france to operate discreetly behind eu andor cover the french have actively sought eu and involvement in recent years from elections support in number of places to military support in drc and chadcar success in lobbying eu members and some nonmembers to deploy eufor in chad and car although deployment required the french to provide more troops and equipment than first desired was significant political milestone in french eyes and the eufor case may represent the way the french will try to engage the eu in future crises the french went out of their way to depict this as an eu and not french activity the possible transformation of eufor into pko would also be consistent with french desires to increase the uns role in crisis management process that has also worked in cote divoire with the linkage between the french operation licorne and unoci 22 c as noted in ref b and above the french remain concerned about chinas growing influence in africa and believe that the chinese employ methods to achieve their ends that are longer practiced at least not so overtly or boldly by france and the west they express frustration that the chinese can operate so effectively acknowledge that many african countries are easily seduced by chinese practices but also are quick to notice any african backlash suggesting that there is too much china too fast in africa backlash that seems to be gathering momentum publicly sarkozys attitude has been that france has objection to chinas becoming more present in africa so long as africans apply the same rules to the chinese that are applied to everyone else policy as reflection of personality 23 c the new africa policy break with the past the shelving of relations based on history and sentiment the call for rationalizing relations and having them reflect the shared interests of equals the insistence on transparency and accountability the desire to work constructively in paris 00001501 0062 of 006 africa with partners such as the us eu and seems very much reflection of sarkozy himself who came to office in hurry to initiate reform left and right and not simply to tinker on the margins there have been few setbacks on the domestic front where he has had to compromise when faced with entrenched groups willing to push back in foreign affairs however he has had freer hand and in some ways franceafrique was an institution waiting to be changed previous french leaders talked about changing frances relations with africa and may have taken few steps but sarkozy is doing significantly more than that at least from todays vantage point 24 c one close observer reminds that sarkozy himself sharp break with french tradition is the first french president to have grown up without meaningful personal experience with the colonial era and is therefore free of sentimental attachment to franceafrique to sarkozy franceafrique longer makes sense with france and africa needing to modernize their ties and move on based on calculation of interests on both sides which in sarkozys view for the french boils down to reward the good punish the bad 25 c how have the french gone about implementing this new policy and how have africans reacted to it see part ii septel for discussion of those topics please visit paris classified website at httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalfran ce stapleton
