investment banking business we re consolidated by the second circuit as merrill lynch pierce fenner smith inc v dabit 1 the earlier cases had been dismissed as preempted by the securitie s litigation uniform standards act of 1998 slusa2 slusa was enacted in response to the per ceived failure of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra3 to curb alleged abuses of securities fraud litigation pslra set out framework for the br inging of securities fraud cases in federal courts in many instances plaintiffs circ umvented pslra by bringing cases in state courts on the basis of common law fraud or other nonfederal claims slusa attempted to make certain that plaintiffs could not avoid the pslra requirements by requiring securities fraud cases to be brought only in federal court and only under uniform standard if five criteria are satisfied 1 the lawsuit is covered class action 2 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22311crs2 4 15 usc 78jb 5 17 cfr 24010b5 6 dabit at 37 7 421 us

misrepresentation or omission is made in connection with the purchase or sale of covered security the second circuit court examined the lang uage of section 10b of the securities exchange act4 which is the general antifraud pr ovision of the act and rule 10b55 the rule issued by the securities and exchange commission sec to implement the statutory provision in its examination the court f ound that the in connection with requirement of slusa should be interpreted in the same way that courts have interpreted the phrase in the antifraud provision and in the rule in its analysis of past cases which have interpreted this statute and ru the second circuit stated th at the fraud at issue must be integral to the purchase and sale of the securities in question6 further in blue chip stamps v manor drug stores7 the supreme court ratified the doctrine that private litigant may bring an antifraud action only if an actual purchaser or seller of the securities in question the second circuit found it necessary to look at judicial interpre tations of the in connection with requirement and the standing issue of private litigant in order to determine whether standing under slusa w ould be comparable and whether slusa could be found to preempt all cl aims that might be brought under state law the court found that in enacting slusa congress sought only to ensure that class actions brought by plaintiffs satisfying the actual purchaserseller requirement are subject to the federal securities laws slusa as we have repeatedly noted wa s intended to bolster the pslra which in turn was intended to toughen the requirements for maintenance of successful action under rule 10b5 we need not and do not reach the question but see contradiction in concluding that congress could have intended to preempt state law securities fraud actions that if brought under federal law would fail for proof of loss causation or lack of timely filing but did not intend to preempt category of actions that because of the nature of the injury alleged could never have constituted potential federal action8 the remainder of the courts opinion concer ned the damages claims by the parties dabit asserted claims for two types of da mages 1 holding dama ges concerning merrill lynchs dissemination of fraudul ent information which induced him and the class which he represented to retain certain securities and 2 commissions that dabit would have earned from clients which he st because of merrill lynch s dissemination of allegedly fraudulent information as for the claim for holding damages the court stated that because this kind of claim did not satisfy the blue chip standing requirement necessary for the in connection with requirement of the antifraud provision and its rule

holding claims however when dabit asserted that he and the class which he repres ented both purchased and reta ined stocks based upon merrill lynchs misrepresentati on he satisfied the blue chip standing require ment and ran afoul of slusa which was intended to preempt cl aims alleging fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities the court ordered that thes claims be dismissed without prejudice so that the plaintiff might plead claim sounding in state law if possible his claim concerning lost commissions brought on behalf of himself nd other brokers fared better than the holdings claim with the court stating that this kind of claim by its nature did not allege fraud coinciding with the purchase or sale of security the court therefore allowed this claim as not preempted by slusa ijg investments attempted to recover damages caused by paying commissions or fees to merrill lynch by entities having brokerage accounts with merrill lynch the court held that claims for fl at annual fees were not preempt ed by slusa but that claims for commissions were preempted because commissions by definition involve allegations of purchase or sale of securities in connection with the alleged conduct in april 2005 four months after dabit the seventh circuit rejected the second circuit approach the seventh circuit held in kircher v putnam funds trust9 that slusa is as broad as 10b itself and that limitations on private rights of action to enforce 10b and rule 10b5 do not ope n the door to litigatio n about securities transactions under state law10 it would be more than little strange if the supreme courts decision to block private litigation by nontraders became the opening by which that very litigation could be pursued under state law despite the judgment of congress reflected in slusa that securities class actions must proceed under federal securities law or not at all11 on september 25 2005 the united states supreme court granted the petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit12 on march 21 2006 the united states supreme court unanimously13 vacated the judgment of the second circuit the court stated that the argument of respondent adopted by the second circuit that the operative langua ge of in connection with must be read narrowly to preempt only thos actions in which the purch aserseller requirement of blue chip stamps is met is inaccurate and must be rejected the court went on to discuss its belief that congress must have been aware of the broad construction of the phrase in connec tion with the purchase or sale adopted by both the court and the securities and exchange commission when congress used this key phrase in slusahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22311crs4 14 slip op at 13 citation omitted 15 slip op at 1314 citation omitted 16 slip op at 16and when judicial interpretations have ttled the meaning of an existing statutory provision repetition of the same language in new statute indicates as general matter the intent to incorporate its judicial interpretations as well14 in buttressing its holding that congress intended broad inte rpretation of in connection with the purchase or sale the court stated the presumption that congress envisione d broad construction follows not only from ordinary principles of statutory construction but also from the particular concerns that culminated in slusas actment narrow reading of the statute would undercut the effectiveness of the 1995 reform act and thus run contrary to slusas stated purpose viz to prevent cer tain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the 1995 act15 finally in response to the argument that the holder class action brought by respondent was distinguishable from typical class action because it was not brought by required purchaser or seller of the securities the court stated that the identity of the plaintiffs does not determine whether the complaint alleges fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities the misconduct of which respondent complains here fraudulent manipulation of stock prices unquestionably qualifies as fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities as the phrase is defined16 the court therefore vacated the judgment of the court of appeals for the second circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion
