nonprofit corporation whos purpose was to encourage the development and expansion of free and democrati c institutions in other countries through priva sector initiatives especially through the two major american political parties labor and business groups ned does not conduct democracy promotion programs itself but provides grants to four core groups and other private organizations for wide

rejected on caseby casebasis by the ned board nedfun ded projects are varied but often have one unifying characteristic thei r ability to function and implement democracy programs because they are not part of th us government for example ned has supported numerous democracy and huma n rights initiatives in china cuba burma iraq north korea and sudancountries where the us government is banned by law

lawmakers also continue to debate the size scope and distribution of us democrac promotion efforts some foreign policy experts argue that encouraging development of democracies overseas is crucial to americas own national and eco nomic security and that while supporting political transition is not costless it is far cheaper and safer than crisi s response those who would like to reduce the amount of government expenditures n democracy promotion activities contend that success is difficult if not impossible t assess because of these differences coupled with the offset requirement for funding new or expanded programs the house zeroed out ne ds budget during the fy1994 funding debate but the senate and conferees subsequently restored it in 1995 ned opponents in the senate sought to drastically cut or totally eliminate ned funding for fy1996 the senate appropriations committee recommended the elimination of funding in fy1998 and fy2000 but the full senate subsequently restored funding in both years the following issues continue to frame the debate over ned funding core granteescompetitive bidding many critics of ned have expres sed concern that four grantees receive the bulk of government funds on noncompetitive basis according to senator gregg the bottom line is this is relic of the cold war in time when we have very limited resources it is very hard to justify funding the democrati c national committee the republican national committee aflcio and the chamber of commerce all of whom have significantly more resources available to put into this than we have 3 proponents of fundin g the core grantees contend that political parties business and labor are at the heart of pluralistic democratic society they argue that the fou r organizations experiences and expertise make them particularly wellequipped to assis t emerging democracies in transition from oneparty regimes to multiparty governmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96222crs5 congressional record vol 145

projectbyproject basis further more the core grantees are covered by stringent reporting and evaluatio n requirements ned maintains that coordination w ith the department of state and possible audits by the general accounting office gao keep the grantees efficient honest and in line with us foreign policy objectives in june 1999 senator feingold introduced an amendment to the foreign relation s authorization bill s 886 to gradu ally reduce to zero by fy2004 the percentage of funds set aside for the four core groups at that time all grants are t be awarded competitively senator fein gold decried the annual bonanza received by the four groups and asserted that these four grantees know the fix is in so there is less incentive to make sure every single program is as efficient and as well planned as it p ossibly can be senator lugar and4 others oppose d the feingold amendment by defending the funding levels as checks and balances that insure that ned is not politicized the amendment was defeated by vote5 of 76 to 236 govern ment versus private funding of ned policymakers who oppos government grants to ned have claimed that when the organization first was established the intention was that ned eventually would rely on private funding some members of congress have asked if ned gets its funds from the us government is monitored by governmen t auditors and must coordinate its activities with the state department then in what way is it private conversely they wonder if ned is considered private entity shouldnt most of its funding be private although ned was originally establish ed as private entity private funding was not required neither the congressional debate in 1983 nor the national endowment fo r democracy act requires priv ate source funding the foreign relations act fy1992 and fy1993 pl 102138 did include sense of congress provision that the nationa l endowmen t for democracy should make every effort to solicit private contributions t realize the purposes of the endowment as set forth in the national endowment fo r democra cy act also many ned grantees including the core grantees typically us ned grants to leverage private contributions ned argues that priva statusgovernment funding is key to its effectiveness as nongovernmental organization ngo ned can work in areas of demo cratic development that are too risky for the us government in countries where the united states does not have an official assistance program or with local ngos where us government agency does not want overt ties such as in cuba and china variety of factors restrict direct government support in such circumstances including foreign policy considerations statutory prohibitions and th unwillingness of given foreign leader to allow assistance furtherm ore the credibility of democracy promotion projects in the recipient countrie s often is greater if private rather than government organizations conduct themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96222crs6 us aid budget

international military education and training program imet and th military to military contacts program mmct the department of states democracy promotion activities are pri marily through the economic support fund esf program jointly managed with usaid critics argue that with the myriad governmental private and overseas democrac programs in place ned is redundant supporters of ned however stress ned s strength is its independence from government agencies senato r kyl emphasized this point during senate floor debate if ned were to be too closely associated with th department of state ned might be seen as merely mouthpiece for whateve r administration currently occupies the white house8 future prospects although efforts have been made in every congress to eliminate funding for ned the program has survived and its funding level has stabilized proponents in congres s continue to stress its useful role as conduit for nongovernmental aid and its ability t respond quickly to changing democracy assistance challenges many believe that th prospects for continued funding of ned are good but issues related to the size an d division of grants between the four institutes and outside organizations chosen by ne d will continue to attract congressio nal interest in addition neds independence from the state department will be closely watched as the upcoming reorganization that abolishes the united states information agency is implemented
