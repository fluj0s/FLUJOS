from adam markham adammarkhamwwfusorg to mhulmeueaacuk nsheardueaacuk subject wwf australia date thu 29 jul 1999 094309 0400 cc mraewwforgau hi mike im sure you will get some comments direct from mike rae in wwf australia but i wanted to pass on the gist of what theyve said to so far they are worried that this may present slightly more conservative approach to the risks than they are hearing from csiro in particular they would like to see the section on variability and extreme events beefed up if possible they regard an increased likelihood of even 50 of drought or extreme weather as significant risk drought is also particularly importnat issue for australia as are tropical storms i guess the bottom line is that if they are going to go with big public splash on this they need something that will get good support from csiro scientists who will certainly be asked to comment by the press one paper they referred to which you probably know well is the question of significance by barrie in nature vol 397 25 feb 1999 p 657 let know what you think adam
