from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to fortunat joos joosclimateunibech subject re new fig 614 date tue 18 jul 2006 102226 0600 cc tosbornueaacuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi all thanks for all the eurodialog before i even got to my computer lots of good issues raised and glad the misunderstanding got cleared up eystein and i cant connect easily today so im going to take stab at the cla compromise guessing that hell concur if not he can clarify 1 we really do need to see the original forcing spikes for volc higher freq for solar so that should be given if tim can do his usual graphical magic and get smoothed version in there too thats ok but i think fortunat is correct that this new 614 gives us chance to show data differently and in way that the ts team really would like but to show smoothed curve perhaps behind or whatever looks best and makes it easy to see the more raw data the more raw data would be nice way to connect 614 with 613 and also make the points that tim points out especially highlighting the obvious link between forcing and response prior to 1900 this last point is key for the ts too but please dont make the more raw data hard to see they are key part of this fig especially in the ts so go for it tim i suggest some annotation for those peaks that are too large to plot perhaps an asterisk with note in the caption that volcanic forcing peaks larger than xxx are truncated for plotting purposes or something like that 2 the nomalisation reference period should be consistent between all of the associated figs so id stick with with youve been doing tim otherwise it will be too confusing 3 as to whether forcing should be proportional as long as the scaling yaxis labeling is explicit we can be flexible here in order to make sure viewers can see all of the smoothed and unsmoothed forcing data clearly that is the key and we can relax the need to have them all proportional in this fig bottom line is that the forcing data we present should have the ability to see the differences in solar clearly as fortunats mockup plot does this is driven more from the ts but thats ok we get serious play in the ts hope this provides enough for tim to go with and as always if you want to provide some options thats fine fortunat youll need write the caption hopefully keeping it as brief as possible by citing the earlier captions in the report thanks all best peck jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu xflowed
