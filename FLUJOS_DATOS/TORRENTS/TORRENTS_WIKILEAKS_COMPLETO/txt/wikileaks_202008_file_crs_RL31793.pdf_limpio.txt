introduce weakened or killed diseasecausing bacteria viruses their components1 such as proteins recombinant proteins or polysaccharides or toxoids into person or animal to stimulate an immune reaction that the body will remember if exposed to the same pathogen in the future most vaccines are given by injection although many people use the words vaccination immunization and inoculation interchangeably the terms ar not technically synonymous vaccination is the physical act of administering any vaccine and immunization is more inclusive term denoting the process of i nducing or providing imm unity artificially by administering an immunobiologic2 inoculation also involves introducing microorganism but not necessarily intentionally the term vaccination was coined to mean intentional inoculation with the v accinia virus that causes cowpox to provoke an immune response to protect against the smallpox virushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31793crs2 3a smallpox vaccine is

small number of human volunteers test for safety the sponsor continues with phase ii and phase iii trials to gather evidence of the biologics effectiveness in larger groups of individuals while continuing to monitor safety data if the product re mains feasible the sponsor ba sed on data collected in the clinical trials submits two license applications to fda product license for the vaccine and an establishment license for the manufacturing plant fda scientists review the clinical da ta along with the proposed labeling and manufacturing protocols inspect the manuf acturing facility to assess whether it can produce consistent product and performs test on the vaccine and its components advisory committees made up of experts from outside of fda also review the data are available for

evaluation and research cber bears the responsibility for vaccine regulation primarily under the authorities granted the secretary of hhs in the federal food drug and cosmetic act and the public

american companies ma vaccines in 1967 in october 2004 there were nine14 why reasons given are mostly economic the road to shot in the arm can take decades of research and development and according to

discussion of the issuesproblems production costs because vaccines are biologics even routine manufacture involves care expertise and expense mu ch beyond that required for pharmaceuticals to produce drug the manufacturer essentially repeats chemical formula vaccines require dedicated production fac ilities that include physical and chemical barriers to protect workers from pathogen exposure and finely re gulated temperature and ventilation to keep the biologics viable while stored also because the product is injected the purity standard has to be much higher than for pill although fda inspects both drug and vaccineproduction f acilities it inspects every lot of vaccine produced and only sample of drug production lots16 for example manufacturers ceased production of licensed vaccines against plague because of manufacturing difficu lties and against adenovirus infection because of contract cost issues to re start production these or other manufacturers must submit new license applications to fda conform to current good manufacturing practice standards and demonstr ate the safety and effectiveness of the new vaccines all before they can make the vaccine available to the public production failures in october 2004 when the us manufacturer chiron announced that the british drug regulatory authorities had shut its liverpool plant the united states was instantly plunged into flu vaccine shortage chiron was slated to supply approximate ly half of the vaccine for us use in the 20042005 flu season the british agency and then with fda concurrence found some bacterial contamination and manufacturing practices that could not assure the safety of the rest of the vaccine production17 liability why go to the trouble for product that does not promise the sales volume common to pharmaceuticals particularly when manufacturers may be liable if vaccines cause injury the huge claims for compensation that followed the swine flu immunization program in the mid 1970s have made the vaccine industry wary manufacturer executives recall for example discussions of unindemnified liability in their decisions to decline pl ans to produce anthrax or lyme disease vaccines market for some diseases scientists know how to produce protective vaccines but manufacturers have chosen not to pursue the timeconsuming and expensive steps necessary to obtain fda approval for some there is insufficient market size in the united states to warrant the effort an example is the tickborne encephalitis vaccine that dod administered to troops in bosnia during the 1990s although licensed in europe where the dis easecarrying ticks are more widespread the vaccine is not fdalicensed to get fda approval requires us clinical trialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31793crs8 18us

against bioterrorism or biowa rfare agents such as vaccines as in the public interest many also so categorize all vaccines whether intended against naturally occurring or bioterrorrelated infectious diseases the bottom line in persuading companies to produce vaccines is largely one of opportunity cost whether they can afford to put aside other potentially lucrative projects to do so over the years members of congress have proposed changes to the internal revenue code involving tax credits for cer tain vaccine research and distribution activities to effectively lower the cost to manufacturers another way to provide financial incentive is to assure that primary purchaser is available to generate demand for the vaccine when the government is the primary purchaser such as
