american national government government and finance division the federal workforce characteristics and trends summary understanding the characteristics and trends of the federal workforce is important because among other things agencies accomplish their missions via that workforce total personnel costs direct compensation and benefits for all federal employees civilian and military current employees and retirees were estimated at more than 523 billion in 2008 and civilian personnel costs in the executive branch alone were estimated at about 194 billion three cabinet departments the departments of defense dod veterans affairs dva and homeland security dhs accounted for almost 60 of the nearly 19 million executive branch civilian employees in 2008 the duty stations for more than 35 of these employees were in four states california virginia texas and maryland and the district of columbia and dod was the top federal employer in 35 states dod also employed more than 90 of federal civilian employees in foreign countries and was the top federal employer in us territories the federal workforce grew by more than 120000 employees between 2000 the low point during the last 10 years and 2008 with the growth concentrated in homeland securityrelated agencies and dva civilian employment in other agencies including dod and most independent agencies declined during the last 10 years the number of bluecollar and clerical federal jobs declined between 1998 and 2008 but the number of professional and administrative jobs increased during this period the percentage of the federal workforce that was made up of minorities also increased but the percentage that was women remained almost constant although women and minorities represented an increasing portion of the growing professional and administrative groups the representation of women and minorities in the senior executive service was less than their presence in the overall workforce the federal workforce was somewhat older in 2008 than it was in 1998 but the average length of service declined from 152 years in 1998 to 147 years in 2008 the number of whitecollar employees in the general schedule gs pay system declined during the last 10 years while the number of employees in agencyspecific pay systems primarily at dod and dhs increased dramatically from less than 1 of the workforce in 1998 to 16 in 2008 if these trends continue the gs system will cover less than half of the federal civilian workforce by the year 2020 the average salary of the workforce was 69061 in 2008 but average salaries varied substantially between and within federal agencies and pay systems although the federal workforce has grown somewhat in recent years 2006 study estimated that the hidden federal workforce of contractors and grantees grew by more than 50 between 1999 and 2005 when it reportedly included more than 105 million jobs in 2005 that figure is more than twice as large as the combined total of all three branches of government the us postal service the intelligence agencies the armed forces and the ready reserve this report will be updated when september 2008 data for the federal workforce

percentage of federal civilian employees in major pay systems at various pay points march 2008 26 the federal workforce characteristics and trends introduction the work of the federal government is done via its workforce so understanding the characteristics and trends of that workforce is critical part of understanding how the federal government can better accomplish its various missions as the government accountability office gao said in may 2008 the importance of topnotch federal workforce cannot be overstated the nation is facing new and more complex challenges in the 21st century as various forces are reshaping the united states and its place in the world to address these challenges it will be important for federal agencies to change their cultures and create the institutional capacity to become highperforming organizations this includes recruiting and retaining employees able to create sustain and thrive in organizations that are flatter resultsoriented and externally focused and that collaborate with other governmental entities as well as with the private and nonprofit sectors to achieve desired outcomes1 in 2001 however gao identified the management of the federal workforce as governmentwide highrisk area because federal agencies lacked strategic approach to workforce management that integrated those efforts with their missions and goals2 understanding the federal workforce is also important for variety of other reasons personnel costs for both current and former employees represent substantial portion of many agencies budgets and significant portion of the total federal budget some federal agencies are major employers in certain states and tens of thousands of federal employees work outside of the united states the federal workforce is also expected by some to reflect the gender racial and ethnic diversity of the country as whole in addition understanding recent changes in the overall size and composition of the federal workforce can indicate what changes may lie in the future 1 us government accountability office human capital transforming federal recruiting and hiring efforts gao08762t may 8 2008 2 us general accounting office high risk series an update gao01263 january 2001 crs2 cost and size of the federal workforce determining the size or cost of the federal workforce first requires determination of what should be considered the federal workforce and what are considered relevant costs associated with that workforce federal budget documents distinguish federal personnel costs in terms of 1 direct compensation eg salaries and bonuses versus personnel benefits eg health benefits and life insurance 2 civilian employees versus military employees and 3 current employees versus retired employees the documents also show costs specific to the us postal service and the department of defense dod and separately show costs for the legislative and judicial branches of the federal government according to the fy2009 federal budget and as shown in table 1 below total federal personnel costs ie direct compensation and benefits in 2008 for all groups ie civilian and military current employees and retirees were estimated at more than 523 billion direct compensation costs for current civilian employees including all three branches of government and the us postal service were estimated at just under 190 billion civilian compensation costs for just the executive branch were estimated at nearly 144 billion with dod constituting about onethird of that total in comparison direct compensation costs for the legislative and judicial branches were relatively small less than 5 billion combined compensation costs for employees of the us postal service are almost entirely funded by postal fees not appropriations some federal regulatory agencies eg the securities and exchange commission the nuclear regulatory commission and the federal communications commission are also entirely or primarily funded through fees rather than appropriations according to the office of personnel management opm and as shown in table 2 below there were slightly more than 27 million employees in the total federal civilian workforce all three branches plus the us postal service in september 2004 down from nearly 30 million in september 19943 from the beginning to the end of this period the number of executive branch civilian employees declined by nearly 259000 employees4 driven largely by reductions in the department of defense dod down nearly 212000 employees and the us postal service down by more than 550005 the number of legislative branch employees declined somewhat during this period down about 5000 employees 3 us office of personnel management the fact book 2005 edition p 7 available at httpswwwopmgovfeddatafactbook2005factbook2005pdf opm has not published the fact book since 2005 so 2004 data are the most recent available here and throughout this report the number of employees reported is based on head counts of employees on board as of particular date federal budget documents and other sources sometimes use fulltime equivalent or fte numbers in which two employees working 20 hours per week are treated as one fte 4 as the table shows executive branch employment actually reached its lowest point during this period in 2000 and has risen somewhat since then 5 for more

agency must take those changes into account for example before dhs was created in 2003 several of its bureaus were parts of other cabinet departments eg the us coast guard was in the department of transportation the us customs service was in the department of the treasury and the immigration and naturalization service was in the department of justice with that caveat table 8 below shows the

joined federal agencies these accessions may be divided into two main groups employees who transferred into the agencies from other federal agencies either through individual or mass actions and new hires each year transfers are typically less than 15 the nonpermanent category mainly consists of excepted service schedule and schedule b employees according to opm schedule appointing authorities describe special jobs and situations for which it is impractical to use standard qualification requirements and to rate applicants using traditional competitive procedures for example agencies must use schedule exception to hire attorneys because by law opm cannot develop qualification standards or examinations for attorney jobs opm says schedule b authorities also apply to jobs and situations for which it is impractical to rate applicants using competitive procedures however under schedule b authorities applicants must meet the qualification standards for the job for example schedule b includes hiring authorities for the student temporary employment program the student career experience program and the federal career intern program only students qualify for student programs it is

competitive selection process than others for example in 2007 100 of tsa hires and 905 of hires in the bureau of customs and border protection were into excepted service positions18 in each of the last several years about 250000 employees separated from federal agencies in one of two ways through transfers to other agencies either through individual or mass actions or via separations from federal service as was the case with accessions transfers typically account for about 10 of all separations 16 for example in 2007 22781 86 of the 263544 accessions were either individual or mass transfers the exception to this trend in recent years was 2003 when more than 162000 employees were mass transferred when dhs was created including 67958 at tsa 37416 at the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement and 24239 at the bureau of customs and border protection 17 certain positions are excepted from competitive service by law by executive order or by opm on the grounds that competitive examinations for such positions are not appropriate or impracticable eg attorneys medical doctors and students under certain temporary employment programs 18 several agencies have been

continuations of longerterm trends representation of minorities and women table 13 below provides data on the percentages of the federal civilian workforce in september 1998 and march 2008 that were

composed 42222 the relatively small change in the percentage of the federal workforce that was women between 1998 and 2008 may be partly function of the decline in the number of federal clerical jobs

prevailing rate pay system were substantially lower than in the whitecollar gs and related systems and much lower than in the other systems both governmentwide and singleagency systems however the table also shows that there were substantial average salary differences by agency within the single agency systems eg 43576 for the pay systems within dhs versus 104072 for the pay systems within dot

system is to look at the percentage of employees in each system above various pay points as table 20 below indicates in the gs and related pay systems less than 10 made more than 110000 per year and less than 1 made more than 150000 per year on the other hand more than 55 of employees in governmentwide pay systems eg the senior executive service and the physiciansdentist schedules made more

database summary observations the data provided in this report show that the size shape and character of the federal workforce varies substantially depending on how that workforce is conceived viewed broadly the federal government includes civilian and military employees all branches of government and the us postal service however most discussions of the federal workforce focus on civilian employees in the executive branch within that category while opms fedscope data indicates that nearly 90 of the workforce in march 2008 was composed of fulltime permanent employees crs27 more than half of all accessions and separations each year involve temporary andor other than fulltime employees therefore in discussions about the federal workforce or even more specific issues of federal recruitment and retention it is important to be clear which agencies and what types of employees are included some aspects of the federal civilian executive branch workforce are however relatively unambiguous that workforce grew by more than 120000 employees between 2000 the low point during the last 10 years and 2008 with the growth concentrated in homeland securityrelated agencies and dva the civilian workforce at dod on the other hand declined between 1998 and 2008 by more than 40000 employees 57 and independent agencies like epa and ssa also grew smaller although federal employees work in more than 100 agencies and organizations the data indicate that nearly 60 of the federal civilian workforce was in three large cabinet departments in 2008 dod dva and dhs even in its reduced size dod was by far the largest and most ubiquitous federal department or agency in 35 states dod was the largest federal civilian employer often by wide margin and dod was the second largest employer in most of the other states dod also employed more than 90 of federal civilian employees in foreign countries not including the foreign service it is also clear from the data that certain aspects of the federal workforce have changed in recent years for example between september 1998 and march 2008 the number of bluecollar jobs declined by more than 17 and the number of clerical jobs declined by more than 27 meanwhile the number of professional and administrative jobs increased by more than 4 and 23 respectively the percentage of the workforce that was minorities also increased during this period but the percentage that was women remained almost constant also although women as well as minorities represented an increasing proportion of the growing professional and administrative groups their representation in the senior executive service lagged behind their representation in the workforce as whole the federal workforce is also noticeably older than it was 10 years ago the percentage of the workforce that was age 55 or older rose by more than 60 between 1998 and 2008 in 1998 the age grouping with the largest percentage of federal workers was age 4549 in 2008 the modal age grouping was age 5054 with larger percentage of federal workers either eligible or almost eligible to retire opm submitted legislative proposal in march 2008 that would allow agencies in all three branches of government to more easily rehire annuitants without salary offset currently unless agencies receive waiver from opm federal retirees who are reemployed by the federal government must have their salaries reduced the proposal is similar to hr 3579 which would cover only executive branch employees other legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress eg hr 2780 that would allow certain employees to switch to parttime schedule at the end of their career without affecting the calculation of their annuities the data also illustrate decline in the dominance of the gs pay system during the last 10 years and corresponding increase in the use of agencyspecific pay systems if recent trends continue into the future the gs system will cover less than half of the federal workforce within the next 15 years and the gs system will be surpassed by agencyspecific pay systems shortly thereafter several of these single crs28 agency pay systems are pay for performance systems however and those systems have been met with resistence from federal employees unions and some members of congress28 therefore to the extent that these singleagency systems are based on pay for performance and to the extent that pay for performance is resisted by congress and others the growth in those agencyspecific systems could slow in the future perhaps the most surprising statistics however involve the hidden federal workforce of contractors and grantees that workforce was estimated to include more than 105 million jobs in 2005 more than more than twice as large as the combined total of all three branches of government the us postal service the intelligence agencies the armed forces and the ready reserve the number of contractor and grantee jobs was also estimated to have increased by more 50 between 1999 and 2005 if that rate of increase continued for the next six years the number of federal contractors and grantees could reach nearly 16 million by the year 2011 however the growth in contracting and grants could slow considerably if the next administration is not as committed to transferring certain federal functions to the private sector as the current bush administration 28 see
