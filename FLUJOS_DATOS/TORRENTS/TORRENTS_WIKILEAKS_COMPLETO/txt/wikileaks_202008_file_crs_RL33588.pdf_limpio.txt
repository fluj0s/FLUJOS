associates to develop an offshore wind farm near cape cod massachusetts the parties to the debate are waiting for the results of department of interior doi environmental impac t statement and coast guard study of navigational safety aspects also concern that large wind turbines may disrupt radar systems led to federal actions to halt veral wind farm devel opments pending the results of study by the department of defense dod that was due in early may 2006 in late june 2006 the sierra club f iled suit to compel completion of the dod radar study an agency of the united king dom has studied modifications to turbines and radar systems that may help solve the problem also high gasoline prices have s timulated doe proposal for aggressive development of cellulosic ethanol as an alternative

derived from resour ces that are generally not depleted by human use such as the sun wind and wa ter movement these primary sources of energy can be converted into heat electricity and mechani cal energy in several ways there are some mature technologies for conversion of renewable energy such as hydropower biomass and waste combusti on other conversion technologies such as wind turbines and photovoltaics are ready well developed but they have not achieved the technological effi ciency and market penetra tion that many expect they will ultimately reach alt hough geothermal energy is produced from geological rather than solar sources it is often incl uded as renewable energy resource and ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33588crs2 1 for further definitions of renewable energy see the

nuclear power is not generally considered to be renewable energy resource1 contribution to national energy supply according to the energy information administrations eias annual energy outlook 2006 renewable energy resources exc luding wood used for home heating supplied about 57 q quadrillion btus or quads of the 997 q the nation used in 2004 or about 60 of national energy demand more than half of renewable energy production takes the form of electricity suppl of this most is provided by large hydropower however from 1998 through 2001 droughtdriven decline in hydroelectric availability led to major drop in national renewable energy use industrial use of renewables supplied primarily by biofue ls accounts for most of the remaining contribution2 some note that renewable energy after more than 25 years of federal support has achieved neither high vel of market pene tration nor growing market share among other energy sources 1999 revi ew of renewable energy studies by resources for the future renewable energy winner ser or innocent victim concludes that the lowerthanprojected ma rket penetration and flat market share were due primarily to declining fossil fuel and electricity prices during most of that period in contrast however it notes that the costs for renewable energy technologies have declined by amounts equal to or exceeding those of earlier projections3 nevertheless the costs are still higher than those for conventional energy4 even wind energy which has much lower cost than solar energy technologies owes its recent commerc ial success to support from the federal renewable energy production tax credit and the renewabl portfolio standard rps that many states have put in place5 eias annual energy outlook 2006 projects that current policies would yield 18 average annual increase in renewa ble energy production to 90 q through 2030 resulting in 57 total increase th is would amount to about 67 of the projected 134 q total demand in

environment and development found th at energy efficiency can only buy time for the world to develop lowenerg paths based on renewable sources7 though many renewable energy systems are in relatively early stage of development they offer potentially huge primary energy s ource sustainable in perpetuity and available in various forms to every nati on on earth the report suggested that research development nd demonstration rdd pr ogram of renewable energy projects is required to attain the level of primary energy now obtained from mix of fossil nuclear and rene wable energy resources the agenda 21 adopted at the 1992 united nati ons conference on environment and development unced earth summit concluded that mitigating urban air pollution and the adverse impact of energy use on the atmosphere such as acid rain and climate change requires an emphasis on clean and renewable energy sources the division on sustaina ble development oversees implementation of agenda 21 the 2002 world summit on sustainable development johannesburg earth summit adopted political declaration and plan of implementation 8 which includes clean energy as one of five key policy actions9 subsequently in 2003 the us depar tment of state implemented 42 million clean energy initiative10 and the european union committed to 700 million energy partnership nevertheless eia estimates that renewable energys share of global energy consumption through 2030 will remain limited to less than 9 for the next two to three decades11 history the oil embargo of 1973 sparked quadrupling of energy prices major economic shock and the establishment of comprehensive federal energy program to help with the nations immediate and l ongterm energy needs during the 1970s the federal renewable energy program grew rapidly to include ba sic and applied rd and federal participation with the priv ate sector in demonstration projects commercialization nd information dissemination in addition the federal government instituted market incentives such as business and residential tax credits and created utility market for nonutilitypr oduced electric power through the public utility regulatory polic ies act pl

broader more aggre ssive renewable energy program than any administration federal spending for these programs fell steadily through 1990 until 1994 congress led policy development and f unding through legislative in itiatives and close reviews of annual budget submissions fy1995 marked noteworthy shift with the 103rd congress for the first time approving ss funding than the administration had requested the 104th congress approved 23 less than the clinton administration request for fy1996 and 8 less for fy1997 however funding turned upward again during the 105th and 106th congresses and stayed relatively flat through the 107th and 108th congresses and the first session of the 109th congress12 from fy1978 through fy2005 the doe spent about 134 billion in 2005 constant dollars for renewable energy r d renewable energy rd funding grew from less than 1 million per year in the early 1970s to more than 14 billion in fy1979 and fy1980 then declined steadily to 148 million in fy1990 by fy2005 it reached 380 million in 2005 constant dollars this spending history can be viewed with in the context of doe spending for the three major energy supply rd programs nuclear fossil and energy efficiency rd from fy1948 through fy1977 in 2005 constant dollars the federal government spent about 426 billion for nuc lear fission and fusion energy rd and about 141 billion for fossil energy rd from fy1978 through fy2005 the federal government spent 339 billion fo r nuclear fission and fusion 211 billion for fossil 134 billion for renewables and 124 billion for energy efficiency thus total energy rd spending from fy1 948 to fy2005 in 2005 constant dollars reached 1400 billion including 765 billion or 55 for nuclear 352 billion or 25 for fossil 134 billion or 10 for re newables and 124 billion or 9 for energy efficiency in fy2006 as part of restructuring of the appropriations co mmittees congress merged appropriations accounts for the doe energy efficiency program which previously had been under the departme nt of interior and related agencies appropriations bill with the appropriati ons accounts for the doe renewable energy program under the energy and water development appropria tions bill as result appropriations for some subpr ograms of the renewable energy program such as hydrogen and program management are commingled with those for the energy

develope d for energy security air pollution reduction continuedbiodiesel appears to have net energy production much higher than that for corn ethanol and slightly higher than that for petroleum diesel92 us biodiesel production has increased from less than 1 million gallons in 1999 to an estimated 75 million gallons in 200593 the latter figure is equivale nt to about 5000 barrels of oil per day and is less than 1 of tota l diesel fuel use for transportation94 eia projects that biodiesel production coul d reach the equivalent of 20000 barrels of oil per day by 203095 the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 301 created an excise tax credit for biodiesel fuel blending the credit is set at 100 per gallon of biodiesel used96 because the credit is fixed on volume per gallon basis 20 biodiesel blend b20 would be eligible for 20 cent per gallon credit and 100 biodiesel fuel b100 would be eligible for 100 per gallon credit97 epact 1344 extended this credit through th end of 2008 furt her epact 1501 created renewable fuel standard rfs98 which allows for biodiesel production to contribute to achieveme nt of the standard99 climate change and renewables because in most cases

purposes it is an example of noregrets strategy for co2 emission reductions wind and solar energy have zero co2 emissions in operation but may need an energy storage backup system such as batteries or fu cells that do require fossil fuel use when biomass is developed as an energy crop the co2 emissions are near zero because each new crop absorbs the same amount of emissions as are released by

impact the reduction of co2 has been the focus of studies of the potential for reducing emissions through renewable energy and other mean s except for biofuels and biopower wherever renewable energy equipment disp laces fossil fuel use it will also reduce carbon dioxide co2 emissions as well as pollutants that contribute to water pollution acid rain and urban smog in ge neral the combustion of
