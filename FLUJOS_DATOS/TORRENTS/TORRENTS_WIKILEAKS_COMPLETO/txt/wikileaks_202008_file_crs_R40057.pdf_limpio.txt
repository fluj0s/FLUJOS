performing wide range of expeditionary missions including domestic emergency operations and military operations outside of the continental united states dod increasingly relies on contractors during expeditionary operations to perform wide range of services for example more contractors are working for dod in iraq and afghanistan than are us military personnel as result military personnel in the field are increasingly interacting with and responsible for managing contractors yet many observers argue that the military is not sufficiently prepared to manage contractors during expeditionary missions the national defense authorization act of fy2008 hr 4986pl 110181 required dod and especially the army to train military personnel who are outside the acquisition workforce but are expected to have acquisition responsibility and to incorporate contractors and contract operations into mission exercises dod including the army are taking number of steps to comply with congressional legislation to better prepare the operational forceincluding servicemen and women conducting military operations on the battlefieldto work with contractors these steps include developing doctrine for integrating contract support into expeditionary operations introducing courses on contract support into the curriculum for nonacquisition personnel and incorporating contract operations into mission

g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the department of defense dod has long history of relying on contractors to support troops during wartime and expeditionary operations1 generally from the revolutionary war through the vietnam war contractors provided traditional logistical support such as medical care transportation and engineering to us armed forces since the end of the cold war there has been significant increase in contractors supporting us troops in terms of the number and percentage of contractors and the type of work being performed figure 1 according to dod postcold war budget reductions resulted in significant cuts to military logistical and support personnel requiring dod to hire contractors to fill the gap figur 1 contractors as p er centa g of dod w orkf or

iraq is significant according to dod as of july 1 2008 there were 200000 dod contractors in iraq and afghanistan compared to 180000 uniformed military personnel2 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that from 2003 through 2007 dod obligated 54 billion for contractors working in iraq3 these contractors not only provide traditional logistical supportsuch as delivering food and providing weapons maintenancebut also provide critical frontline combat support that puts them directly on the battlefield such frontline support includes interrogating prisoners working as translators for combat units providing security for convoys traveling through the battle space and providing security for forward operating bases figure 2 projecting into the future senior dod official said that civilian contractors may make up 50 of all dod personnel deployed in future overseas operations 4 unless policy decision is made to expand the military many analysts argue that the largescale use of contractors will remain fixture of the militarys force structure for the foreseeable future5 figur 2 iraq dod contractor p ersonnel b t ype of ser vice pr vided as of j uly 2008 source depart ment of defe nse this raises questions about dods capacity to manage contractors in the field during such operations dod has an established acquisition workforce consisting of military and civilian 2 according to dod there were 162000 contractors in iraq of which 39 63000 were local nationals most of the local iraqi contractors 47000 were engaged in base support 3 see contractors support of us operations in iraq op cit p 3 4 based on discussions with and presentation given by the assistant deputy under secretary of defense program support 5 based on discussions with contractors government officials and industry experts according to one publication not since the 17th century has there been such reliance on private military actors to accomplish tasks directly affecting the success of

acquisition workforce is generally not deployed or embedded with the military during expeditionary operations as the number of contractors in the area of operations has increased the operational forcethe service men and women in the fieldincreasingly rely on interact with and are responsible for managing contractors7 yet number of military commanders and service members have indicated they did not get adequate information regarding the extent of contractor support in iraq and did not receive enough predeploy ment training to prepare them to manage or work with contractors8 one dod official has pointed out that the military does not have an adequate infrastructure to effectively execute and manage contractors in iraq9 and last year an army commission produced the gansler report which found that contacting officer representatives cors responsible for managing contractors are generally drawn from combat units and receive little if any training on how to work with contractors 10 this finding confirms what many analysts have argued that deployed military personnel are not sufficiently trained or prepared to manage contractors in an area of operations given the critical role contractors are playing in supporting military operations and the billions of dollars dod spends on contractors the ability of the operational force to manage and oversee contractors has become increasingly important poor contract management can lead to troops not receiving needed support and the wasteful spending of billions of dollars 11 lack of effective contractor management can even undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the us military for example according to an army investigative re port lack of good contractor surveillance at abu ghraib prison contributed to fostering permissive environment in which prisoner abuses took place12 many observers believe that the fallout from abu ghraib and other incidents such as the shooting of iraqi civilians by private security contractors hired by the united states government have hurt the credibility of the us military and undermined efforts in iraq 6 there are number of positions in the acquisition workforce including contracting officers program managers and auditors for more information on the acquisition workfor ce see httpwwwdaumilworkforceindexasp last visited october 23 2008 7 the operational force including

operational forces management of and coordination with contractors in the area of operations these experts have argued that increased training and education is necessary for nonacquisition personnel throughout the military the gansler report stated that the army needs to train operational commanders on the important role contracting plays as well as on their responsibilities in the process the report called for including courses in the curricula on contractors in expeditionary operations at command schools eg the war college and sergeant majors academy and other officer educational programs 13 echoing the gansler report an official at the us army materiel command wrote that contractor logistics support must be integrated into doctrine and taught at every level of professional schooling in each component 14 the calls for more robust training are not new for example in 2003 gao testified be fore the house armed services committee subcommittee on readiness stating the lack of contract training for commanders senior personnel and some contracting officers representatives can adversely affect the effectiveness of the use of contractors in deployed locations without training many commanders senior military personnel and contracting officers representatives are not aware of their roles and responsibilities in dealing with contractors 15

g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 according to title x of the united states code military services are generally responsible for training military forces as such some argue that it is the charge of the military services to implement training aimed at improving contract or coordination and management others argue that the use of contractors during expeditionary operations cuts across military branches and to be successful training initiatives should be spearheaded by dod and then propagated throughout the individual services according to senior military officials while there is not yet unified strategy among the various dod departments on how to train and educate nonacquisition personnel to work with and manage contractors number of initiatives are underway some of these initiatives are described below

in july 2008 dod developed an operational cont ract support concept of operations intended to be road map for integrating contract support and management during expeditionary operations the concept calls for training officers in developing and executing key contracting documents such as statements of work with the objective that dod as whole must have the ability to ensure cors are properly trained and certified in addition according to the joint staff joint logistics doctrine has been published that addresses contractor support integration and management 20 dod is also developing classroom and online training for nonacquisition personnel and incorporating contracting scenarios into military exercises

course on contingency contract management training that is intended to pave the way for the military services to introduce such course at the staff colleges dod also developed similar eighthour course geared to the senior staff colleges 21 these courses are intended to prepare military leaders who lack extensive contracting experience to plan for contract support integrate contractors into force plans and manage contractors in the area of operation dod expects these courses to be offered in 2009 according to senior dod officials the long term plan is to offer similar courses throughout the militarys educational system including courses for noncommissioned officers 19 congressional record may 19th 2008 pg s 4325 20 according to joint staff j4the publication is entitled joint publication

military exercises can help educate and prepare military planners and operational commanders to better manage contractors dod established the joint contingency acquisition support office jcaso to provide the joint force commander with the necessary assistance to plan support and oversee contingency contracting activities during the initial phases of contingency operation22 jcaso is intended to provide initial program management and contracting teams and will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring all contractors in joint area of operations where jcaso is operating in may 2008 dod tested the jcaso concept by incorporating it into us european command useucom military exercise which took place in germany over span of nine days23 according to dod the exercise validated the jcaso concept and structure providing the joint force commander with muchneeded visibility regarding contracts and contractors postexercise assessment found that military planners and commanders need to become better informed as to the role of jcaso and the capabilities it provides 24 dod intends to have jcaso participate in other war games and exercises to ensure that contracting is integrated into mission planning and execution

educational classes and seminars are intended to familiarize the force with the importance of contracted suppor t while other classes and seminars are intended to provide concrete knowledge and skill sets officials stated that most efforts are focused on logisticians who will be provided seminars or discussions on contracting throughout their careers including at the staff sergeant captain and second lieutenant levels number of educational opportunities will also be offered to nonlogisticians for example all majors will be required to attend two hour class on contract support through the intermediate leader education courses all attendees of the army war college will be required to participate in seminar on contractor support and operations logistics selected generals are to take three hour senior leader course on operational contract support the army has also developed informational pamphlets and handbooks to help military personnel better understand the contracting process to know their contracting responsibilities and to work more effectively with contractors 26 in addition the army with air force support is developing one to two week course on operational contract support that is intended to outline the contracting process focusing on tactical unit commanders and staff roles and responsibilities in the acquisition process teach relevant contracting skills including how to create complete requirements package and teach how to integrate contractor personnel into military operations the course is expected to be taught at the army logistics management colleges hu ntsville alabama campus at ft levenworth kansas to selected officer and nco multifunctional logisticians and is to be made available to all army personnel

most mission readiness exercises over the last two years27 in addition the army is working with the joint community to include contract support into other operations for example from august 11 22 2008 the us southern command sponsored panamax 2008 military exercise focused on ensuring the defense of the panama canal28 the exercise included joint contracting command element provided by the army augmented by air force and navy personnel as result of the contracting component of the exercise the after action review of the effort included discussions on contracting for example noting the importance of contracting to mission success and the little to emphasis on contracting functions during the execution phase of the exercise the after action review recommended joint training agencies develop acquisition training programs that target operational commanders as the training audience 29 the report also recommended the establishment of policies and procedures for managing contractors 26 for example the army developed contracting basics for leaders and the deployed cor pocketsized pamphlet that explains key contracting concepts definitions and processes the army also published handbook deployed cor tactics techniques and procedures and has draft handbook logistics civil augmentation program customer handbook 27 missionreadiness exercises also known as mission rehearsal exercises focus on specific mission prior to deployment 28 the exercise involved more than 30 ships dozen aircraft and 7000 personnel from 20 nations 29 executive summary to joint contracting command

on the one hand including contractor management narrative as part of performance evaluation could help ensure attention is given to this issue however it should be recognized that contract support is not relevant for all military personnel and elements of contract support could also fall under other evaluation factors such as personnel management alternatively congress could consider requiring performance evaluations for military personnel whose mission involves or substantially relies on contractor support another option would be to amend the performance evaluation guidelines to stipulate specifically that ctor management be part of the discussion of personnel management or other related factors
