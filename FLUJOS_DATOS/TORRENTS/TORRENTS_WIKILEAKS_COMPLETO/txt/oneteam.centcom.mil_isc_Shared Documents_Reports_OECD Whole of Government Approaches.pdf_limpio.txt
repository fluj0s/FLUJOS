governance peace and security whole of government approaches to fragile states there has been an increasing concern in the international community about the implications for stability and progress towards the millennium development goals resulting from state failure or state fragility in response to this challenge the oecd development assistance committees dac fragile states group fsg developed set of draft principles for good international engagement in fragile states these principles highlight that successful development in fragile environment depends at least in part on well sequenced and coherent progress across the political security economic and administrative domains working effectively in fragile states requires donor countries to adopt whole of government approach wga involving departments responsible for security political and economic affairs as well as those responsible for development aid and humanitarian assistance this present study assesses existing wgas drawing upon

summary background in 2005 the oecd development assistance committees dac fragile states group fsg developed draft set of principles for good international engagement in fragile states these principles highlight the fact that successful development in fragile environment depends at least in part on well sequenced and coherent progress across the political security economic and administrative domains working effectively across these domains requires donor countries to adopt wholeofgovernment approach wga involving departments responsible for security and political and economic affairs as well as those responsible for development aid and humanitarian assistance an oecd dac workstream on policy coherence and wgas in fragile states was initiated 1 to produce an agreed dac framework or guidance on good practice for wgas in fragile states that would inform international donor country practice2 the scope of this study is limited to an assessment of existing wgas drawing upon the recent experiences of number of oecd countries in fragile states3 rationale for wholeofgovernment approaches to fragile states resonating with global concerns such as international security and crime fragile and failing states have increasingly become preoccupation of the international community fragile states face problems in wide range of domains eg provision of physical security legitimate political institutions sound economic management and the delivery of social services indicating the need for mix of actors instruments incentives and interventions as stated in the oecd dac principles for g ood international engagement in fragile states the political security economic and social spheres are interdependent failure in one risks failure in all others 4 the case studies show that governments involved in fragile states recognise the need for and the benefits of wgas to fragile states further greater coherence between security and development policies is key to establishing an effective wga to fragile states acknowledging the interdependence between the two fields as result security actors and objectives related to the security domain are increasingly included in the development debate as are economic actors justice departments and others clear benefit of wga is that it can contribute to the overall objective of longterm development and stability in fragile states at lower overall fiscal cost in addition the risk of these objectives either being compromised or simply not being met is reduced finally coherent policies and activities may have greater legitimacy in the eyes of the recipient country and will therefore be more likely to receive positive response challenges to wholeofgovernment approaches to fragile states there are several challenges to the development and successful implementation of wgas to fragile states first the case studies show that political interests and priorities are important for successful wgas joinedup working becomes more important and receives more attention if country is high on the priority list of national interest however not all fragile states receive political priority experience demonstrates that political attention focuses on postconflict states not paying attention to non post 8 conflict states can lead to the risk of creating donor orphans5moreover achieving real progress in fragile states requires longterm commitment this is challenge as political priorities often shift at the national level the constitutional and political context of donor government poses challenge to wgas these factors have consequences for the type of political leadership the position of departments and agencies within the government system and the potential and options for joinedup working in political system that is characterised by coalition or minority governments with typically giveandtake custom joinedup working is not as easy to achieve as compared to systems where one political party can provide the prime minister and all cabinet ministers the case studies show that actors may approach work on fragile states from very different though relevant perspectives ranging from counterterrorism to governance conflict prevention and peacebuilding trade promotion or development cooperation the rationales for engaging in fragile states may differ and at times come into conflict it is important therefore to try to strike balance among these different rationales and perspectives in particular between development and security objectives furthermore the roles of the actors involved need to be clarified including who should take the leadership role here the challenge of bridging differences in organisational culture among the actors involved needs to be taken into account for example departments for development cooperation will traditionally be more processoriented whereas defence or foreign affairs will tend to be more output oriented the case studies suggest that there are strong disincentives to working in close partnership with other government departments challenging the commitment of actors to become involved in wga first working horizontally in multiactor context requires more consultation and is therefore time consuming second it may require compromise and willingness to dilute ones own policy agenda third it can weaken individual departmental visibility finally joinedup working can have huge resource implications in both financial and human terms the case studies show that in many cases the selected governments have not matched their ambitions for an integrated approach with sufficient resources specifically at the field level wga requires sufficient staff capacity both in terms of numbers and qualifications to manage relations with other partners and implement policies in an integrated manner main findings and recommendations all case studies confirm the appropriateness of the principles for good international engagement in fragile states and highlight the need for them to be mainstreamed in oecd member governments as there are nonetheless considerable gaps between what has been agreed in principle and the practice of ministries and agencies mainstreaming of the principles should be accompanied by efforts to develop the policy instruments and mechanisms required to operationalise these into assistance programmes the need for an overall framework the case study reports show that progress has been made several of the countries have started to tackle the issue of more coordinated and integrated approaches however the case studies also find that none of the governments studied has developed an overall policy aimed at establishing wholeof government approach on fragile states this can partly be explained by the absence of clear definition of fragile states as result there seems to be tendency to focus more on conflict and postconflict countries furthermore it was found that involvement in fragile states is generally based on broader regional or postconflict policy documents that often originate from development cooperation the reports 9 also show lack of dialogue on what joinedup approach means for the key actors involved in the absence of such dialogue the risk of continuation of existing approaches remains the effectiveness of joinedup approaches may be improved by the creation of an overall framework for managing wholeofgovernment engagement in frag ile states such framework would consist of three elements 1 clear understanding of what fragile states are which is shared by all relevant government actors 2 joint policy statement explaining the rationale for collaborative working in fragile states together with the aims and how these will be achieved and 3 commitment to establish an effective dialogue between the key actors involved in wga and to work on bridging differences in organisational culture the suggested framework would enable early involvement of relevant actors including those at the field level and define their roles and objectives in wga while important as an instrument for promoting and managing joinedup working the crea tion of an overall framework should not result in bureaucratic straitjacket that would create an additional layer of decision making rather the framework should acknowledge the need for joint countryspecific approaches on fragile states the success of such framework requires political commitment at the highest levels ideally the process is driven at the level of prime minister and engages the relevant ministers for wholeof governmentapproach who to involve the study finds that when dealing with fragile states it is important to engage with wide range of actors the case studies show that along the lines of the politicalsecuritydevelopment nexus currently foreign affairs defence and development cooperation are the key actors in wgas to fragile states in order to create wga evidence calls for increased involvement of other departments in particular ministries of economic affairs and trade other actors may also have role to play depending on the circumstances here one can think of the police ministries of finance and treasury justice and migration however in light of the difficulty of coordinating the activities of broad range of actors these other departments should only be involved when they have comparative advantage joint analysis in order to improve the effectiveness of the activities of the different actors involved they need to be linked to set of broader joint objectives these objectives ought to be defined on the basis of joint analyses or assessments the case studies make clear that in most countries investigated this has not been the case at the national level it is recommended that governments aim to conduct joint analyses of fragile states and to share findings with the key ministries and agencies involved in order to set priorities for action the case study reports indicate that already good deal of informal learning is going on but that this could usefully become more institutionalised sharing experience among members of the fragile states group could be helpful in this regard however the case studies also show that the success of joint analyses and shared findings is at least in part dependent on government structure that compels ministries to work together as wgas to fragile states do not emerge automatically or organically at the operational level countryspecific joint operational strategies the case studies confirm that there is onesizefitsall strategy for addressing state fragility and show need for developing practical countryspecific approaches for engagement in fragile states even 10 though all governments investigated acknowledge the need for joint country strategies there seem to be clear guidelines on the development of such strategies an overall framework could provide muchneeded guidance collaborative working is undermined by approaches that become fragmented and are guided by different and potentially conflicting departmental objectives the case studies suggest that joint assessments early in the process allow for joint strategies planning monitoring and evaluation here existing multilateral joint assessment mechanisms should be taken into account in order to avoid duplication coordination the need for political leadership and lead coordinating role the study finds that clear political guidance and leadership is the starting point for an effective wga providing the actors with an understanding of the importance of their involvement the study points to the need for clarity on who plays what role in crea ting an integrated approach and the need for lead coordinating role otherwise the risk of fragmentatio n remains how to establish coordination is crucial and sensitive it should not be underestimated here one should differentiate between leadership and coordination the first implies that other ministries and departments have to follow directions the latter indicates equal relationships which are essential for joinedup working governments engagement in fragile state covers different phases that require different types of involvement from different actors this engagement is not static the roles and involvement of actors change according to circumstances in simplified model this could imply that for instance defence and police may play more central role in stabilisation phase whereas in capacitybuilding phase development cooperation may play more central role external interventions will be heavily politicised hence there will often be case for diplomatic actors to play key role as the phases of engagement operate in parallel rather than in succession attention should be paid to continuity and overall coherence underlining the need for wholeofgovernment coordinating leadership some of the case studies suggest that given their position role and mandate foreign affairs may be best positioned at headquarters level to take up this lead coordinating role in particular integrated departments and ministries of foreign affairs and development cooperation these cases showed that at the field level ambassadors or special coordinators originating from foreign affairs seem to be best positioned for such lead coordinating role supported in this task by representatives from development cooperation and defence other cases indicate that the lead coordinating role can also be taken on by other actors depending on the modalities key is that capable lead coordinating actor be identified it is suggested that in order to guarantee continued wholeofgovernment coordinating leadership foreign affairs could act as constant cocoordinating actor during all the phases creating the right incentive structures the study finds that joinedup working has considerable resource implications both in financial and human terms in view of potentially high transaction costs governments should acknowledge that there are disincentives for collaborative working eg timeconsuming requiring compromise and willingness to dilute ones own policy agenda possi bly less visibility similarly existing and new incentives for joinedup working should be identified an important incentive is providing the means and resources for joinedup working on fragile states allowing ministries and departments other than development cooperation to devote part of their budget to fragile state activities joint policy statement by the key ministers providing the rationale for wholeofgovernment engagement in fragile states as well as the main obj ective can also serve as an incentive for joinedup 11 working as it commits the key actors involved to enter into dialogue furthermore donor governments could use such policy statement as means of accountability for higherlevel officials to put joinedup working into operation in their respective organisations governments should also be encouraged to identify institutional incentives in terms of tradeo ffs working with other actors provides the opportunity to influence policy agendas and offers means to access skills and resources which department may lack mechanisms and instruments for promoting policy coherence and joinedup working in addition to the need for an overall framework join t country strategies and attention to process it is imperative to have the right instruments to support political decisions on wgas the case study reports indicate that even where such instruments are available their usage can be improved in other cases new instruments will need to be developed the case studies show that institutional budgetary and functional walls between departments can impede cooperation and coordination instead joint budget lines would foster integrated planning establishing such budget lines proves to be difficult however or even impossible given existing mandates and budget reporting requirements pooled funding is considered an important alternative instrument to foster integrated planning allowing flexibility in support of activities which may be classified as official development assistance oda and nonoda however it is critical to avoid creating parallel structures and instead to encourage the participation of geographic desks across relevant government departments foreign development and security in the planning and implementation of initiatives funded by these pools information management systems in order to promote joinedup working it is recommended that where possible the information management systems of different actors be integrated the case studies show that intra and interdepartmental communication systems can be revamped to improve the technical features of access to information practical issues such as insufficient levels of staff security clearance can be significant impediment to accessing information and creating shared understanding of sensitive issues and problems both at headquarters and field levels in order to make joinedup working more effective participants need adequate information access if they are to enter into dialogue with colleagues from other ministries 12 13 i introduction 11 background the topic of fragile states is increasingly gainin g ground on the international agenda including within the oecd development assistance committee dac the dac characterises fragile states as those countries where there is lack of political commitment andor weak capacity to develop and implement propoor policies in addition these countries tend to be characterised by poor governance and by being prone to violent conflict6 in order to deal with the specific issues an d needs of fragile states the dac 2003 highlevel meeting established the fragile states group fsg see box 1 the work of the fsg was brought together at seniorlevel forum on fragile states that was held in london in january 2005 one of the outcomes of this forum was that draft set of prin ciples for good international engagement in fragile states be developed the principles see dcddac200653 reflect lessons on development effectiveness derived from experience in fragile states covering issues including priority interventions alignment aid instruments and aid allocations donor coherence and coordination7 box 1 what is the fragile states group the purpose of the oecd dac fragile states group fsg is to facilitate coordination among bilateral and multilateral international actors in order to improve devel opment effectiveness in fragile states it brings together knowledge from experience research and lessons learned on the design and implementation of development approaches in fragile states the fragile states group was established at the dac 2003 high level meeting that meeting asked the network on governance govnet and the network on co nflict peace and development cooperation cpdc with input from other networks and working parties to jointly work on issues relating to fragile states it also agreed that this work should be carried out in conjunction with the world bank group undp and the european commission the principles highlight that successful development in fragile environment depends at least in part on wellsequenced and coherent progress across the political security economic and administrative domains working effectively across these domains requires donor countries to adopt wholeofgovernment approach wga involving departments responsible for security political and economic affairs as well as those responsible for development aid and humanitarian assistance the oecd dac members had previously recognised the importance of integrated approaches for conflictaffected fragile states in particular in their commitment to strive to increase coherence among our policies trade and investment foreign affairs and defence and development cooperation that impact on conflict prevention 8 in 2004 dac guidance to support donors in their work on security system reform and governance where collaboration across ministries and departments is fundamental was adopted9 to deepen understanding of the issue of whole of government and improve knowledge of existing good practice in the area an oecd dac workstream was initiated on policy coherence and wgas in fragile states 10 the workstream would assess experience and practice and produce an agreed dac 14 framework on good practice for wgas in fragile states which should inform international donor country practice11 the present study is an output of the workstream 12 objectives and scope of the study the objective of the study is to assess existing w holeofgovernment practice with view to develop practical guidance in the future application of effective wholeofgovernment arrangements in fragile states12 for the purpose of the study wholeofgovernment approach is defined as one where government actively uses formal andor informal networks across th different agencies within that government to co ordinate the design and implementation of the range of interventions that the governments agencies will be making in order to increase the effectiveness of those interventions in achieving the desired objectives 13 to achieve this broad objective the scope of the study has been limited to an assessment of existing wgas developed within select group of oecd governments australia belgium canada france the netherlands sweden and the united kingdom in order to provide an indepth analysis of specific wholeofgovernment initiatives implemented within partner countries the study has focused on small group of recent fieldlevel examples democratic republic of congo linked with belgium and france haiti linked with canada solomon islands linked with australia sudan linked with sweden and the netherlands and yemen linked with the uk 14 the case studies have been selected with view to linking headquarterslevel wgas with specific incountry experience it is important to note that the study does not evaluate existing wgas rather the study focuses specifically on tradeoffs processes mechanisms and instruments that contribute to effective wgas in fragile states however it should be noted here that the assessment of the cases for this study suggests that in terms of joinedup working lot of progress has been made over the last years there also seems to be an increasing interest in crossgovernmental cooperation in particular in the work on the security and development nexus the scope of the study is not limited to the selected governments fragile state policies but includes broad policy documents on policy coherence and wgas in line with the areas identified in the principles for good international engagement in fragile states the study focuses on the engagement of the selected governments on the politicalsecuritydevelopment nexus the study also considered wgas in terms of economic issues eg arrears trade extractive industries immigration and humanitarian assistance the country reports indicate an interest in moving beyond the politicalsecuritydevelopment nexus and encourage involvement of ministries of economic affairs and trade 13 limitations of the study the study has number of limitations first the study focuses predominantly on process this does not imply that content is not of importance rather the aim of this report is to map the process of bringing wgas to fragile states in order to maximise synergies of crossgovernmental cooperation second the study focuses predominantly on best practices of wgas to fragile states as the study does not entail an indepth evaluation of wga practices it is not possible to provide balanced assessment of joinedup working in terms of both positive and negative consequences wherever possible the report does provide insight in the difficulties that stem from joinedup working third the study looks at cases that almost all deal with postconflict situations the concept of fragile states however is not limited to postconflict countries in this study yemen is the only non post 15 conflict country from the perspective of prevention ie deterioration of fragile states to conflict states it is important to broaden the scope it is advisable that future studies on fragile states take note of this fact as well as of the implications this may have on wgas fourth the study does not examine the perspectives of partner countries and major international actors on the selected governments wgas the case studies prov ided little or input on this subject due to lack of opportunity to contact these actors 14 structure of the report the report is structured along the following lines section 2 provides synthesis of the assessments of existing wgas as presented in the different case studies the assessment is structured along the following categories conceptualpolicy level tools and instruments and process coordination and management section 3 presents recommendations on wgas in fragile states and key orientations for donor governments as well as the fsg and the dac in terms of future applications of wgas 16 17 ii assessment 21 introduction rationale for wholeofgovernment approaches to fragile states before the september 11 2001 attacks fragile states were mainly seen as countries facing serious developmental challenges often lacking functional government as such most fragile states had little broader strategic significance for oecd countries consequently their problems were perceived primarily through development and humanitarian lens this perception changed following 911 however and fragile and failing states have increasingly become preoccupation of the international community for the purpose of this study the defining features of state fragility are to be found in states inability or unwillingness to provide physical secur ity legitimate political institutions sound economic management and social services for the benefit of its population while there are differences in the way these states are described weak failing failed collapsed fragile at risk or precarious it has become clear that such states are linked to range of threats such as transnational crime trafficking in weapons drugs and human beings the spread of disease intrastate and regional violent conflict genocide and terrorism as this wide range of threats is not limited to the territories of these states precarious statehood is considered to have ramifications for regional and global security 15 the fact that fragile states can face problems in wide range of domains indicates the need for mix of instruments incentives and interventions as well as actors to be involved however notwithstanding the prominence on th international foreign policy security and development agendas attempts to deal with precarious states have proven quite complex and problematic most recently interventions in afghanistan and iraq ve revealed the limitations of traditional diplomatic and military interventions experiences in bosnia and herzegovina and kosovo have taught security actors that predominantly military responses are insu fficient for multidimensional statebuilding and post conflict peacebuilding processes development actors have come to realise that successful longterm development in impoverished nations is impossible when incapacitated states cannot deliver the collective goods of basic security and effective governance both development and military actors are also aware of the fact that shortterm ad hoc responses in which national and international policies lack coherence and coordination will not be successful as result th focus has now shifted to improving statebuilding capacities through better joinedup working this new quest for policy coherence across domains can also be found in the oecds draft principles for good international engagement in fragile states where it is stated that it is important for the international community to work in coherent way across diplomatic security development and financial domains when engaging in fragile states16 the challenge for governments involved in fragile st ates is to establish clarity on and coherence in objectives these objectives are likely to differ among the departments involved for instance the promotion of sustainable development is not the primary mandate of all government departments therefore ministries may promote national interests rather than the interests of partner country which from the perspective of development cooperation is problematic when dealing with the problems of precarious statehood and in particular the wide range of potential threats emanating from them the issue therefore is how governments determine their priorities for engagement in fragile states from the perspective of the oecd dac the question more specifi cally is where development outcomes should rank visàvis trade counterterrorism national defence and other political objectives of donor countries 18 one cannot conclude that the interconnectedness of the key areas for successful engagement in fragile states will result in wellsequenced and coherent progress across the political security administrative economic and humanitarian and emergency domain the case studies show that the selected governments recognise the need for and the benefits of wgas they are increasingly developing new mechanis ms and instruments to promote joinedup working among different government actors specifically greater coherence between security and development policies is recognised as key to establishing an effective wga on fragile states yet it is also clear that there is single blueprint for such wga there are many differences in wgas across oecd governments as well as in the effectiveness of these in terms of benefits it is apparent that in order to be more effective policy coherence and wgas should go beyond providing collection of independent policies guided by departmental mandates if not the risk of policy incoherence is magnified the advantages of coherence are clear more coherent policies and activities can contribute to the overall objective of longterm development and stability in fragile states at lower overall fiscal cost in addition the risk of these objectives either being compromised or simply not being met is reduced finally from the perspective of harmonisation and alignment coherent policies and activities may have greater legitimacy in the eyes of the recipient country and will therefore be more likely to receive positive response achieving polic coherence within governments of international actors as well as between the international actors and partner governments may be one critical determinant of successful outcomes in fragile states progress has been made already in the field of security system reform ssr which was one of the first areas where the need for wholeofgovernmen t approach was recognised the work on ssr brings together the development community w ith their military intelligence police prisons civil society judicial and customs services colleagues however although ssr indicates the need for wga policy instruments that can promote policy coherence among these actors were largely absent this has led the oecd dac to provide dac guidelines on security system reform and governance which were agreed upon by development ministers and agency heads in 2004 currently the ssr work of the dac is taken one step further although not the direct focus of this study it should be noted that the dac is developing policy instrument implementation framework for curity system reform ifssr that can provide unifying framework for development security and dipl omatic interests working jointly on security system reform for this study on wgas it will be relevant to link the two activities to ensure that they incorporate knowledge on the political and technical aspects of their work and build the necessary linkages across government 22 challenges to wholeofgovernment approaches to fragile states the case studies for this report identify several challenges to the development and successful implementation of wgas to fragile states first the case studies underline the importance of political interests and priorities for successful wgas joinedup working becomes more important and receives more attention if country is high on the priority list of national interest regardless of formal structures mandates or parochial departmental factors the challenge is how to create political interest second challenge is the constitutional and political context of donor country which has consequences for the type of political leadership the position of departments or agencies for development cooperation and the potential and options for joinedup working third th case studies show that key challenge for whole ofgovernment engagement in fragile states is to balance different rationales and perspectives of actors involved as well as to clarify the roles of the actors and to establish who should take leadership role fourthly evidence also points to the challenge of bridging differences in organisational culture among the actors fifth challenge identified by the case studies is the lack of incentives for departments to work collaboratively with other government counterparts in many cases there are strong disincentives to work 19 in close partnership with other government departme nts finally the case studies show that joinedup working can have huge resource implications in both financial and human terms evidence points out that in many cases donor governments have not matched their ambitions for an integrated approach with sufficient resources this section of the report will take into account the above mentioned challenges and assess the different selected governments responses to these challenges in assessing the different wgas developed the assessment will first focus on the conceptualpolicy vel of wgas to fragile states and will then look into the different tools and instruments developed for these approaches as well as coordination and management mechanisms which have been developed and implemented 23 conceptual policy level constitutional and political context when assessing donor governments wgas to fragile states it is important to take the constitutional and political context as well as the agenda of national interests into account these factors have consequences for the type of political leadership and the potential and options for joinedup working which can range from mere information sharing at the one extreme to fully integrated approach on the basis of one common policy at the other the countries investigated represent variety of political systems and legislative processes these differences present opportunities and constraints on crossgovernmental working for instance in some countries responsibilities for policy making can be delegated to other bodies eg regional or local body like state or province as is the case in belgium in these cases there can be different decisionmaking levels involved in wga thereby complicating the process in political system that is characterised by coalit ion governments as is the case for instance in the netherlands and belgium there is typically giveandtake custom coalition partners all have their own partys agenda to take into account next to the overall government agenda this often results in need to compromise and balance different agendas similar problem applies to minority governments that have to look for parliamentary support on casebycase basis joinedup working in such context is difficult to achieve and more time consuming than in countries where one political party provides the prime minister and all cabinet ministers as is the case for instance in the united kingdom furthermore wgas are limited by constitutional mandates and subsidiary legislation indicating key priorities for different actors as well as by positions within the overall government system mandates can limit what actors can contribute to wga and what role they can play in such an approach the issue of fragile states for instance traditionally stems from the development cooperation agenda the position and role of development cooperation actors within the different donor governments however varies there are number of options development cooperation can be fully integrated into the ministry of foreign affairs eg the netherlands it can have partial autonomy reporting to the minister of foreign affairs eg australia there can be separate development ministry eg the united kingdom and there can be split responsibility for official development assistance among several ministries and agencies eg france independent from the status there may be minister for development cooperation in other cases the minister of foreign affairs is responsible for development cooperation sweden canada and australia have government agencies responsible for development cooperation17 which operate on fairly autonomous level implemen ting the donor governments development aid and administering the bulk of the official aid resources th ey do not however have the legal status to formulate official donor government policy in canada the depa rtment of foreign affairs and international trade 20 dfait is the legal authority for formulating and co ordinating canadas international policy including development cooperation in australia this is coordinated within the portfolio of the department of foreign affairs and trade dfat with ausaid taking lead role in sweden there is one main department within the ministry of foreign affairs responsible for development policy but several are involved in the preparation due to the joint preparation process law this lack of legal status can have practical implications on the way in which these gove rnment agencies can influence the development and implementation of wgas yet the swedish case study reports that the swedish agency for development cooperation sida even though it is not part of the departmental structure does participate in the interdepartmental working group on sudan in the netherlands belgium and france development cooperation is integrated as directorate general within the ministry of foreign affairs all three countries have minister for development co operation and in the cases of the netherlands and belgium these ministers also have cabinet status in the case of france the minister for development cooperation operates under the authority of the minister of foreign affairs the united kingdom has separa department for international development dfid which operates autonomously from the foreign and commonwealth office fco having minister responsible for development cooperation can be of importance for wgas it is clear that the higher the status of the actors involved ie minister the more impact the ministry or department can have in raising certain issues or views an example would be the role of the netherlands minister for development cooperation in putting coordination with the ministry of defence on the agenda and in practice together with the minister of fence this suggests that it can be helpful for cross governmental cooperation and that buyin can be created at the highest ministerial level finally wgas are influenced by political interests and priorities of donor governments joinedup working becomes more important and therefore receives more attention if country is high on the priority list of national interest regardless of formal structures mandates or parochial political factors the belgian case study for instance focuses attention on the fact that the great lakes region and the democratic republic of congo in particular historically plays an important role in belgian foreign policy the fact that the democratic republic of congo is not just t echnical but also political area of attention has resulted in long history of interdepartmental coordination however it is important to keep in mind that not all fragile states receive political priority experience demonstrates that political attention focuse s on conflict and postconflict states this in part can lead to the risk that non postconflict states become donor orphans18 moreover achieving real progress in fragile states requires longterm commitment this is challenge as political priorities often shift donor governments need to be willing to enter into longterm relationship with fragile state in order for their responses to be effective the case of yemen and the attention of the uk seem to be an exception to the rule in that yemen is neither postconflict country nor one of the top priorities of the uk however the uk approach can still be characterised as wga notwithstanding the case of yemen there seems to be greater interest in conflict and postconflict countries not having investigated this the study calls for work on deteriorating situations to be linked with the work on conflict prevention which is already on the agenda of many international actors overall policies for wholeofgovernment approaches to fragile states all governments studied identify fragile states as an important international challenge acknowledging the fact that fragile states are potential threats to both national and international security as well as to 21 development processes they also recognise that holistic and integrated approach is needed to effectively address the challenges of fragile states yet of the governments studied none has developed policy paper aimed at establishing wholeofgovernment approach for dealing with these challenges the studies for this report suggest number of reasons for this absence one reason can be found in the fact that the concept of fragile states originally stems from development cooperation as result discussions and initiatives on fragile states were predominantly initiated from this perspective this limitation changed after 911 when the problem of fragile states suddenly appeared high on the international diplomacy and security agenda however at the conceptual level the fragile states issue is still largely couched in development cooperation terminology creating hurdles for other actors to become actively involved and assume ownership of the issues at stake second reason is the lack of international agreement on definition of fragile state the concept is applied to wide variety of countries and actors for instance the choice for sudan as one of the case studies for this workstream was questioned by number of respondents as they felt that the sudanese government could not be qualified as weak the political sensitivity of the concept of fragile states can be seen as possible third reason labelling states as fragile can cause problems in terms of establishing or maintaining fruitful and equal partnerships it should be noted that this has not prevented the uk from publishing proxy list of fragile states taken from the world bank cpia ratings 19 however it appears to be problematic for the uk to use the label in practice fourth and final reason relates to the perception that the problems of respective fragile states cannot be captured in one overall strategy the context of fragile states is considered to be complex of highly fluid and political nature and entirely different for each country donor countries must therefore develop specific policy and strategy towards each individual fragile state universal documents on fragile states consequently are considered to be too general to be of practical use however not all respondents shared this criticism as this does not rule out an ideal description of how to organise engagement in fragile states who to involve at what time et cetera instead of onesizefitsall approach an overall approach could be built with sufficient flexibility for adapting to specific contexts some respondents even felt that an overall policy document would be particularly useful at the headquarters level where specific country experience is not always available the fact that these discussions are not settled within the donor countries investigated for this study does not mean that nothing has been established in terms of joinedup working in this context the case study reports confirm that donors acknowledge the need fo r an integrated approach towards fragile states hence support the oecd dac principles progress has been made in that several of the countries investigated have started to work on the issue of more coordinated and integrated approaches albeit not specifically aimed at fragile states in the case of sweden for instance the policy on global development is aimed at promoting coherence in development cooperation through engaging wide range of actors parliament the ministry for foreign affairs the ministry of defence the ministry of justice sida and the swedish rescue services agency similarly australia has launched white paper on its aid programme april 2006 which established wholeofgovernment approach to international development and the provision of australian development aid crossgo vernment office of development effectiveness was established to monitor the performance of the aid programme in the absence of clear definition of fragile states many of the governments investigated have designed approaches dealing with preconflict confli ct and postconflict countries ie countries that could easily be labelled as fragile the netherlands for instance has developed wga on reconstruction 22 after violent conflict involving the ministry of foreign affairs including development cooperation the ministry of defence and the ministry of economic affairs the united kingdom and australia have developed policy statements dealing specifically with the issue of fragile states and acknowledging the need for more joinedup working on this issue20 other countries eg canada the netherlands and sweden have developed policy statements on the need for crossgovernmental working but their focus is not specifically on fragile state environments however none of these countries has specific policy document that can be used as framework mandating or setting guidelines for wholeofgovernment working notwithstanding the abovementioned initiatives involvement in fragile states is generally based on broader regional or postconflict policy documents that often originate from development cooperation in the absence of dialogue on what joinedup approach means for the various actors and how this relates to their role in supporting national interests the risk of maintaining of existing approaches remains the reports indicate that each of the actors has different objectives uses different language methods and instruments and has specific departmental policy imperatives and approaches that remain guidance principles these differences potentially undermine joinedup working the absence of an overall concept and guidance policy is felt here who should be involved in wholeofgovernment approaches on fragile states and when when dealing with fragile states it is important to engage with wide range of actors even though the fragile states issue is still predominantly perceived from development cooperation perspective the case studies confirm that the effect of nonaid policies on development outcomes is now widely accepted as result security actors and objectives related to the security domain are increasingly included in the development debate as are economic actors justice departments and others most of the case studies show that currently development cooperation foreign affairs and defence are the key actors in wgas to fragile states in order to create wga increased involvement of other departments should be encouraged other actors that may have role to play depending on the circumstances are the police ministries of justice ministries of finance or treasuries and ministries of economic affairs in belgium for instance the administration of the treasury is involved in financial aid to countries with emerging economies similarly in the netherlands the ministry of economic affairs is cooperating with the ministry of foreign affairs and development cooperation to promote economic development programmes as well as the position of dutch businesses in emerging markets in canada statebuilding activities have resulted in the development of partnerships between internationally oriented departments and agencies of the government and typically domestic ones for instance in the health policy framework for haiti in which the canadian international development agency cooperates with the canadian public health agency in australia the federal police and the federal treasury and department of finance and administration play key roles in the regional engagement in the solomon islands however in light of the difficulty of coordinating the activities of broad range of actors these other departments should only be involved next to the key actors if and when they have comparative advantage in the case of the uk involvement in yemen it was preferred to work with group of core actors to be expanded on casebycase basis the mfa development cooperation the mod were preferred as core group by the uk the netherlands australia and canada also mention the ministry of economic affairs or financethe treasury as key actors for working in difficult environments such as fragile states 23 in several countries work was planned on the nexus of security and development for example supporting the development of an effective and accountable security system as part of ssr21 in these cases the departments of justice interior and finance could be brought in to work alongside the departments of foreign affairs development cooperation and defence overall the challenge to most of these partnerships is that they have comparatively little history for the practitioners involved most activities therefore have pioneering character in which actors are still adapting to each others idiosyncrasies arising from differing organisational cultures professional skills sets mandates and legal statutes these are then compounded by lack of consensus or clarity over roles and responsibilities of each partner and lines of accountability furthermore the case studies suggest that there are strong disincentives to working in close partnership with other government departments challenging the willingness of actors to become involved in wga working horizontally in multiactor context requires more consultation and is therefore time consuming it may require compromise and willingness to dilute ones policy agenda and it can lead to less individual or departmental visibility the need for political leadership and lead coordinating role effective political leadership is key for the implem entation of allencompassing approaches such as wholeofgovernment approaches to fragile states who should promote such an agenda across government and facilitate coherence for such goal there are similarities to promoting coherence for development but whereas in the case of development it is clear which agenda should be promoted wga on fragile states first has to identify clear focus and coherent agenda for the various actors involved this implies building coalitions among policy communities and negotiating various policy options in the case of fragile states the lack of clear objective means that the process is more complicated as different actors will have different perspectives on and stakes in dealing with fragile states the case studies confirm this perspectives range from counterterrorism to governance conflict prevention and peacebuilding or trade promotion the rationales for engaging in fragile states may differ and at times come into conflict key challenge for wholeofgovernment engagement in fragile states therefore is to balance these different rationales and perspectives 22 the starting point for an effective wholeofgovernment approach is clear political guidance and leadership to provide the institutional impetus for the different phases of wga requires commitment and leadership from the political top the different actors need to understand the importance of their involvement therefore it is vital to have clear understanding of the objectives of donor governments involvement in fragile state for example in the case of australia it was the cabinet under the leadership of the prime minister that made wholeofgovernment working priority for the australian public service this resulted in report entitled connecting government whole of gove rnment responses to australias priority challenges the importance of such political leadership is not confined to general policies on joinedup working but also relates to specific policy priorities and selection of target countries this is confirmed by the case of the uk where sustained joinedup working on yemen is related to cabinet attention as well as by other cases such as canadas involvement in haiti the report on the netherlands states that the minister for development cooperation and the minister of defence have led the way in creating greater collaboration between the two policy fields by publicly acknowledging the interaction and interdependence between both fields by stepping out of their comfort zones and by advocating greater cohesion the reports also underline the fact that an integrated approach should not simply be perceived as an outcome but rather as process how to get there is just as important as getting there one of the issues that an overall concept or guidance policy should address is who plays what role in this process on the 24 one hand joinedup approach may imply that any of the actors could take that lead from the perspective of coordination on the other hand it is better to have an established lead coordinating agency in this regard it is important to differentiate between lead ership and coordination the first implies that other ministries and departments have to follow directions while the latter indicates equal relationships governments involvement in fragile state covers different stages that require different types of involvement from different actors the australianled regional assistance mission to the solomon islands ramsi for instance is conducted in three phases intervention stabilisation and capacity building the roles of actors are expected to change as each of these phases takes centre stage each of the key actors will take central coordinating role at some point for example in the stabilisation phase the police plays central role whereas in the capacitybuilding phase development cooperation will have central role at the same time external interventions in fragile stat context will be heavily politicised hence there will often be case for diplomatic actors to play central role these phases may operate in parallel rather than in succession in view of the fact that the key actors involvement in wgas to fragile states changes over time and for reasons of continuity the case of ramsi suggests the need for continuous overall coordinating leadership the department of foreign affairs and trade was given the lead both in canberra and through special coordinator in the field objectives in order for the activities of the different actors to be successful they need to be linked to broader strategy 23 the same can be argued for the objectives of interventions if these are not adequately linked the whole ie the strategic impact of all interventions is less than the sum of the various interventions considering the lack of overall strategies on involvement in fragile states and an often unclear leadership role for any of the departments involved it will be difficult to set clear interlinked objectives for engagement objectives should be identified at two levels first there needs to be clarity on why country should engage in fragile state ie what is the overall objective second there needs to be clarity on why and how specific actors need to be involved the first requires broad assessment of the national interests of the country of the international actor involved this assessment should not take place from specific perspective but should encompass development cooperation diplomatic economic and security interests the second requires joint planning and possible joint implementation mechanisms as part of an overall strategic process if joinedup working is to succeed it first requires joint setting of objectives and priorities although difficult to achieve the same holds true for the process of monitoring and evaluating it is vital that key departmental actors in joinedup approach are part of the development of strategy from the beginning the studies make clear that in most cases objectives were not defined on the basis of joint analyses or assessments in the case of the uks involvement in yemen however joint assessment instruments have been applied see strategic conflict assessments and drivers of change analyses under tools and instruments below although the instruments had been developed by the department for international development the foreign and commonwealth office and the ministry of defence were invited to contribute to the process resulting in shared analysis of the issue of state fragility in yemen several other donor governments have tried to deal with this issue by designing instruments or approaches like the netherlands stability assessment frameworks other attempts at bringing about joint processes vary from stimulating voluntary cooperation eg the competition of ideas used in canada that 25 aimed to allocate resources for the international ssistance envelope with greater interdepartmental transparency and participation to requirement by law eg the swedish joint preparation process yet the cases show that they were not fully used nor did they lead to the creation of common objectives on the involvement in fragile states the case studies show that it remains challenge to make sure that interdepartmental contacts exceed the level of fragmented information sharing exchange of information does not yet entail dialogue on problems approaches and objectives nor does this necessarily lead toward joinedup working in particular joint assessments are an important first step to exceed the level of merely exchanging views and to move to the level of promoting dialogue on strategy and objectives the uk engagement in yemen is case in point the emphasis on these joint assessments and more integrated perspective is also important for guaranteeing that objectives balance the availability of resources and capacity of donor country with the needs of fragile state it is therefore essential that from the beginning objectives are linked to planning implementation coordination monitoring and evaluation if such objectives can be clearly defined this will also be helpful in terms of donor coordination and harmonisation 24 tools and instruments wholeofgovernment approaches can be facilitated in various ways the development of formal and more practical instruments can be one such way for this study an attempt was made to map the various instruments developed by the countries investigated as well as to assess their role in the process of interdepartmental cooperation the instruments found on the basis of the mapping are categorised in terms of funding country strategies secondment and deployment of staff and analytical tools in order to avoid overlap some instruments that are more of coordin ating nature will be dealt with under the section coordination given the fact that the fragile states issue is traditionally perceived from development cooperation perspective the risk is that fragile states are treated as traditional development cooperation countries however it should be avoided that other onesided approaches are adopted that will address only part of the problems that fragile states confront the case studies show need for development actors to adapt their instruments and implementation arrangements mo re flexibly to allow for working in complex and difficult political settings in line with the oecd dac principles for good international engagement in fragile states 24 and various other studies the reports at hand show that mere refinement of existing tools may not suffice fragile states require specific approaches and policy instruments funding mechanisms one of the principles for good international engageme nt in fragile states deals with the need to mix and sequence financial instruments to fit the context principle 925 donor countries are increasingly aware of the need to adjust existing funding mechanisms to the specific needs of fragile states research shows that there is severe resource mobilisation gap for interventions on the nexus of peace security and development as they cut across organisational and budgetary boundaries and often fall between stools 26 furthermore fragile states require flexible and timely funding to meet urgent basic needs as well as to create peace dividends simultaneously fragile states require recurrent funding to meet structural needs and to provide longterm rehabilitation support eg rebuilding basic service delivery channels given the importance of resources for implementing policies funding mechanisms are considered by most respondents in the case studies as key factor for enabling effective integrated engagement in fragile states 26 the creation of joint budget lines or pooled funding is an important instrument to foster integrated planning pooled funding allows flexibility in support of activities which may be classified as official development assistance and nonofficial development ssistance the challenge however is to ensure the integration of both categories of funds according to coherent wholeofgovernment strategy donor governments have made attempts to create inte grated financial instruments that are flexible and allow for the swift provision of funding although not labelled as fragilestate oriented funding instruments their focus seems to be on enabling rapid disbursement of nonhumanitarian assistance belgium for instance has recently opened up budget line for transitional actions reconstruction and society building aiming specifically to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development assistance other examples go one step further and seem to pick up on the aspect of facilitating joinedup working important examples of innovative practice in support of interdepartmental cooperation are the netherlands stability fund the uks global and africa conflict prevention pools and the canadian global peace and security fund see box 2 for short description of these funds in terms of objectives and actors yet although these instruments are certainly laudabl in terms of flexible and integrated funding there are also limitations overall the schemes funded by these instruments are relatively small and the projectbyproject approach of the instruments is not ideally adapted to the chronic and structural problems of fragile states 27 the instruments management structures therefore pose limitations in terms of establishing wga this is particularly true in the case of the netherlands stability fund which is managed and largely financed by one single actor the ministry of foreign affairs including development cooperation even though the stability fund involves actors from the security the economic and other communities for consultation they do not contribute financially this arrangement limits the possibility for real joinedup decision making and planning actors remain executors and subcontractors in order to create more ownership and involvement it would therefore be recommended to consider funding arrangements and instruments aimed at involving other actors as equal funding partners the same would apply to the case of canada where the global peace and security fund administered by the department of foreign affairs and international trade is aimed at fundi ng initiatives coordinated by the interdepartmental stabilisation and reconstruction task force similar to the case of the netherlands this limits the involvement and shared responsibility of other actors in the case of the uks conflict prevention pools such problems are less pressing as all participating departments contribute financially initially each department put in funds from their own budget with the treasury providing additional resources today the pools bid for money alongside their parent departments in each governmental spending round consequently all participants have role in chairing and overseeing the pools the pooled approach facilitates process of developing shared analysis of problems and integrated policies on conflict prevention other case studies tie in with this finding by suggesting that joint funding mechanisms should be managed by interdepartmental units 27 box 2 financial instruments the netherlands stability fund established in 2004 combines official development assistance and non official development assistance funds in order to provide rapid and flexible support for activities at the juncture of peace security and development as well as operational conflict prevention and peacebuilding ie short term the fund falls under the responsibility of the ministers of foreign affairs mfa and for development cooperation both in political and financial terms defence is involved in the funds steering committee but does not contribute financially the overall management of the fund is in the hands of the mfa the uks global conflict prevention pool gcpp and th africa conflict prevention pool acpp are tri departmental mechanisms dfidfco and defence supervised by the defence and overseas policy cabinet committee the conflict prevention pools aim to develop integrated departmental policies on conflict prevention in areas of either thematic or regional interest the emphas is on joint working is reflected in the fact that the three departments share public sector agreement target to deliver improved effectiveness of uk and international support in conflict prevention by 2008 the acpp is c haired by dfid while the fco chairs the gcpp joint steering committees are made up of officials from each department funding for the acpp and gcpp is additional to dfid fco and mod allocations canadas global peace and security fund gpsf is administered by foreign affairs and was created to support canadas response to international crises the fund will largely be used to fund initiatives coordinated by the stabilisation and reconstruction task force start see below however pooled funding instruments are not necessarily perceived as resources for new and integrated activities rather there is danger that they can generate competition among departments for scarce resources and as such discourage joinedup approaches in the early stages of set up pooled funding instruments can easily be perceived and used as pots of additional money they can be tapped into for repackaging or dealing with regular projec ts that would have received funding from either of the ministries but would now be funded through these new financial instruments this practice can for instance be found in the case of the uks conflict prevention pools28 as well as in the dutch stability fund consolidated guidance policies that outline clear processes for the disbursement of resources from the funds and joinedup country strategies against which to assess project proposals are clearly required and may help prevent such practices they are nevertheless likely to continue if departments are heavily budgetconstrained and have few other resources outside the pooled funding arrangements to pursue their own objectives in examining the conflict prevention pools the st udy found that because there is only small pot of funding available for yemen departments are primarily reliant on their own resources this can in certain ways make it more difficult to match uk assistance with needs on the ground this issue has not been problematic for the department for international development which benefits from substantial aid budget however the foreign and commonwealth office and defence are more constrained in meeting their policy objectives in yemen due to internal budge t constraints and their inability to secure as much funding from the global conflict prevention pool as th ey require the management of the pool is also challenging in that while the overall objectives are shared by all departments potential projects are screened by the department for international development to assess how they meet key development criteria such as ownership participation and sustainability number of foreign and commonwealth office and defence project ideas that were discussed be tween departments at the draft stage have not been put forward to the pool for consideration in fact the report mentions that overall relatively few of their projects in yemen have been funded through this joint mechanism country strategies there is onesizefitsall strategy for addressing state fragility this is confirmed in the studies which show need for developing practical countryspecific approaches for engagement in fragile states 28 in the absence of an overall policy towards fragile states country strategies could prove to be of great importance by providing operational guidance objectives and priorities for both the headquarters and the field level they also help making tradeoffs between ad hoc and structural approaches the process of developing joint country strategy can furthermore contribute to wholeof government approach by encouraging consultation and shared analysis of political security and development issues it can also become management tool and enable actors to link departmental priorities to overall foreign policy objectives thereby providing basis for ensuring that actors speak with common voice when dealing with different host government interlocutors even though all donors studied acknowledge the need for joint country strategies there seem to be clear guidelines on the development of such strategies the uk for instance has developed joint strategies for number of countries with the impetus to draft such strategy often coming from cabinet office in some cases joint strategy emerges from discussions between departments for instance when either the foreign and commonwealth office or the department for international development produces draft strategy based on its own analysis and invites comments from other departments while there are agreed criteria for establishing strategies they tend to be drawn up because of high political interest awareness of potential threat to the uk or its objectives or significant uk involvement in given country country strategies therefore tend to vary greatly in terms of timing content objectives monitoring and management in the case of france one of the specific aims of country policy frameworks is policy coherence here the embassies have the lead in developing country frameworks aiming to establish coherence among the different french actors harmonisation with othe r donors and alignment with the host government the frameworks are limited however in terms of creating wga as they do not include defence or security aspects furthermore the frameworks have fiveyear time span which in practice will prove difficult to apply to the fluid situations in fragile states in the case of sweden discussions in the framework of the policy on global development led to cooperation strategy incorporating relevant forms of swedish assistance provided to country there is an interdepartmental dialogue and joint planning the case study report shows however that this process which is led by the ministry of foreign affairs regional desks in practice does not lead to fully joined up approach due to the fact that there is joint ssessment process different actors provide what they find important from their perspective and it is all incorporated into the strategy at the belgium directorategeneral for development cooperation an interdepartmental exercise is being undertaken to develop policy framework invol ving the oecd principles for good international engagement in fragile states this includes conflictsensitive approach as basis for the reinforcement of the bilateral cooperation with burundi and the elaboration of new threeannual indicative cooperation programmes multidisciplinary mission will be sent to the field to conduct part of the assessment with an important role for the embassy the methodology developed in this exercise could be used in other cases of postconflict posttransition engagement overall the case studies show the need for country specific strategies to be based on joint analysis and assessments early in the process thereby providing an important building block for the development of shared understanding of the issue at hand and laying the foundation for common strategies when developing country strategies developments and activities in the multilateral domain can also play an important role as can be seen in the case of haiti canadas country strategy has taken these factors into account through participation in the inte rim cooperation framework in the case of belgium the eu country strategy papers are increasingly the first reference for donorharmonisation for the directorate general for development cooperation 29 secondment and deployment of staff one instrument that is used in all cases investigated as part of broader strategy for the promotion of joinedup approaches both at headquarters and field level is secondment of staff to other departments however the cases also show that secondments hard ly ever exceed the working level thereby missing opportunities for creating joinedup approaches at the strategic level the cases of the netherlands and canada can be mentioned here as an exception to this rule in the netherlands development cooperation advisor was seconded to defence while military advisor was in turn seconded to foreign affairs although these secondments only involved two people their roles and positions within their departments are such that they have direct access to the level of the political leadership this indicates that the secondments are taken seriously as instruments to contribute to the exchange of experience as well as to bridging the cultural gap between the institutions involved in the case of canada the department of national defence provides liaison officermilitary advisor to the canadian international development agency at the working level secondments of staff are mo re common in the netherlands for instance staff from the ministry of economic affairs is seconded to foreign affairs and vice versa along the same lines secondments between defence and foreign affairs take place eg for the interdepartmental ssr team in canada staff from various departments notably defence and the canadian international development agency is seconded to foreign affairs to be part of the stabilisation and reconstruction task force start in france foreign affairs direction coopération militaire et défense is made up largely of defence personnel in australia the australian defence force and the australian federal police have permanent liaison officers lodged with the other in the field and have institutionalised their links at headquarters secondments and in broader sense mobility of staff and common training across different government departments and agencies can be catalysts for shifting paradigms and promoting joinedup working staff mobility will allow officers to become more familiar with other departments and specifically their expertise and potential contributions in addressing the problems of fragile states the prospect of greater mobility can also work as an incentive for enhanced partnership across departments and agencies at middlemanagement and deskofficer level however this is not given the case studies also show that secondment of staff from departments other than foreign affairs to embassies and representations at field level such as defence or military attaché or an economic advisor are likely to enhance the involvement of these other partments in wgas to fragile states furthermore it was noted that at the embassy level the role of such secondments is welcomed from the perspective of added expertise however the case studies show that the decisionmaking process on the secondment of defence attachés is rather pragmatic and ad hoc both the netherlands and sweden for instance do not have fulltime defence attaché based in khartoum rather in the case of the netherlands the cairobased defence attaché is accredited to sudan while in the case of sweden the defence attaché based in addis ababa is accredited to sudan from the perspective of joinedup engagements in fragile states there is need for more structural involvement of defence attachés the reports also indicate that whereas the position of defence attaché is not new their required role in fragile and postconflict states may be totally different from their old mandate this relates in particul ar to their role in issues such as the reform of security systems in the case of the uk the embassy is encouraged to develop ministrategy aimed at ensuring more coherent crossgovernmental engagement here the new defence attaché is considered as an important actor in facilitating the process of reaching agreement among partner ministries on project proposals before formal submission to the global conflict prevention pool steering committee 30 australia has embarked upon the secondment of central agency staff to positions in the solomon islands government such secondments are of differen t nature and pose new challenges as officials have to reconcile the dual nature of their positions sworn in as public servants of the solomon islands government they may detect potential conflicts of interest when faced with requests for information or other forms of service from their home departments such elaborate secondment and deployment activities also call for effective personnel management in the case of australia this was taken seriously particularly for those departments making sustained deployments for the first time for those who are not familiar with the realities of overseas postings an operational support unit within ausaid was created to supply training and education the deployment of large number of australian public servants from different agencies also proved challenging from another perspective it has for instance led to disparities in pay and conditions which have also caused some tensions in the field part of the problem for central agencies not familiar with secondments and deployments overseas is that there has been little or career structure based around international deployments because until recently they have been minor part of their business the reports furthermore indicate that there are differences in criteria for deployment between defence and civilian staff these relate to issues of staff security preconditions and safety procedures it was found that even though such differences serve purpose they can also hamper flexibility of deployment between departments when it would be useful to aim for joinedup approaches in terms of deployment such differences in deployment criteria may also create problems in terms of deploying staff to international organisations the reports describe change in the role of securityrelated actors ie military and police it is now increasingly common to deploy limited number of individual staff as advisors or observers as opposed to deploying entire contingents or battalions the ployment of individuals requires other deployment criteria both in terms of preconditions of deployment and in terms of management some of the donor countries investigated have set up expert pools consisting of available experts who can be deployed on individual missions sweden for instance has set up pool for the deployment of police officers to international police missions another example is the integrated security system reform ssr pool set up by the netherlands in 2005 consisting of military former defence personnel and civilian juridical experts to support the implementation of ssr activities defence is responsible for the composition and deployment of the pool while foreign affairsbased interdepartmental ssr team consisting of staff from defence and foreign affairs is responsible fo r the overall coordination the interdepartmental nature of this ssr team provides plenty of opportun ities to exchange views and develop joint strategies towards ssr the creation of such pools not only increases the possibilities of donor governments to swiftly engage in international missions but can furthermore serve to support donor countrys own activities on the nexus of peace security and development analytical tools the studies show that many of the selected governments have developed analytical tools to provide an evidence base for longterm coherent policy and strategy development examples are the uks interdepartmental drivers of change analyses and strategic conflict assessments and the netherlands stability assessment frameworks see box 3 apart from enabling joint assessments these analyses also provide opportunities to establish closer collaboration among the various departmental actors in order for these analytical tools to be effective in 31 terms of establishing cooperation they should be used as standard procedure in the design of country strategy papers they should be guided from an integrated perspective as well as linked to other initiatives as in the case of the current belgium interdepartmental reflection exercise on the future role of belgium in postconflicttransition context which includes several departments federal public service foreign affairs finance and defence box 3 analytical tools the uk drivers of change analysis offers way of understanding the political economy of poverty reduction in developing countries it directs attention to the underlying and longterm factors that affect the enabling environment for reform in different countries incl uding actors institutions and structural issues drivers of change offers the prospect of better informed development assistance and more effective delivery of the governments international strategic priorities while the tool was originally developed by dfid its value is enhanced if the analytical process is shared with other departments to date drivers of change analysis has been applied in over 20 countries mechanisms are being developed to formalise collaboration between dfid and fco and where appropriate to draw other interested departments into the process the uk strategic conflict assessments have been used in number of countries including yemen sri lanka and nigeria the aim is to improve the effectiveness of development policy and programmes in contributing to conflict prevention the methodology is flexible but generally focuses on analysis of conflict structures actors and dynamics fco has contributed to these assessments in number of countries the netherlands stability assessment frameworks offer general analytical tool for stability and strategic joinedup planning for particular country it provides an analysis of trends on number of stability indicators and helps to identify options improving these trends by taking into consideration large number of sectors development cooperation politics military economics the framework has thus far been used in mozambique rwanda kenya afghanistan and bolivia this reconfirms the need for an overall guidance strategy that calls on departments to establish objectives and approaches on the basis of joint assessment of the country as stated before the case studies show that such conditions are lacking thereb undermining the effectiveness of the analytical tools 25 process coordination and management the case studies show that wgas to fragile states do not emerge automatically or organically at the operational level the countries investigated have each established broad range of policies instruments tools and strategies that can promote joinedup work ing this section explores how donor governments co ordinate and manage these arrangements in general coordination can take place at different levels the intradepartmental level the interdepartmental level coordination among donors ie harmonisation and coordination with the partner government ie alignment29 this section will focus on intra and interdepartmental coordination and management however before moving to coordination and management mechanisms it is important to identify few important factors that will determine the effectiven ess of coordination differences in organisational culture for example have major impact on effectiveness arrangements for coordination implementation and management can help minimise these differences as can continued exposure to other actors through collaboration but their success still also depends on political interest the role of political interest and often closely related the availability of resources are central feature in the various studies the case studies indicate that the level of political importance attributed to country here fragile state determines to large degree the level of joinedup working the use of the whole spectrum of instruments available for prom oting such joinedup working and the available resources yet the case of the uk approach with regard to yemen shows that even if country is less high 32 on the list of priorities much can be done with the right approach and mechanisms and with complementary interests coordination and management mechanisms the case studies show that donors have developed plethora of mechanisms aimed at better co ordination often supported by specific initiatives instruments and tools annex b provides short overview of the most important coordination mechanisms by case study the various cases investigated show that donor countries use different approaches in different places to promote crossdepartmental working coordinat ion may be achieved through informal mechanisms when formal structures are not appropriate to the circumstances and hence not being used to their full potential for instance in the case of yemen the uk has not relied as heavily upon the conflict prevention pools the pcru spell out or the cabinet office to deliver integrated assistance programmes as it has in other countries colocation of the department for international development and the foreign and commonwealth office at the field level in yemen may have done more to enhance joinedup working between the departments by facilitating cooperation on drivers of change analysis which contributed to shared understanding of the problems facing yemen in addition the uk cabinet offices light touch approach to managing the wholeofgovernment approach in yemen allowed the department for international development the foreign and commonwealth office and defence room for manoeuvre to respond to changing conditions in the field and to determine assistance policy accordingly an interesting concept emerging from the case studie s is the added value of task forces the case of the netherlands shows that such task forces can play key role in policy formulation and implementation and thus in coordinating the input from the differen t ministries it should be noted however that in the case of the netherlands various steering committees also covering the key areas of joinedup approach play an equally important supporting role in this coordination an important element of the dutch task force in sudan is that it is operationally placed outside the normal ministerial channels and has direct access to the ministerial level this facilitates flexibility and rapid responses both essential elements of involvement in fragile states it may also promote muchneeded outofthebox thinking which is also key for responding to the issue of fragile states challenge linked to the temporary character of the dutch task force is the potential loss of institutional memory when the task force is dissolved the canadians take an interesting approach to the annual country strategy by providing the embassy with key role in the strategic planning process and by making the ambassador accountable the field level may be more directly involved in designing and implementing joinedup approach this idea would have to be investigated further as it may not only imply stronger role for the field level but also the need for stronger and more joinedup representation in embassies in australia coordination across number of departments is achieved by interdepartmental committees which have been in use within the austra lian public service in one form or another for decades and are formed regularised or disbanded according to requirements they exist at every level of government from the purely functional junior ranks of the public service to the cabinet itself where ministers represent their respective departments and coordinate policy under the direction of the prime minister these committees may be ad hoc or institutionalized key committee for the purposes of developing government policy on international engage ments is the strategic policy coordination group made up of deputy secretaries from the relevant departments lower down the scale interdepartmental working groups address policy and operational details special reference should also be made to the way the regional assistance mission to the solomon islands is coordinated the missions administrative structure is an expression of australias wholeof 33 government principles it uses special coordinator model which provides single authority under which the various strands of the mission can be drawn together and coherently managed through the nexus of the closeknit principals group the group is made up of the lead representative in the field from each of the police military and civilian components foreign affa irs the participating police force ausaid and the consultant trust fund with operational policy em anating from the office of the special coordinator there is reduced scope for separate fiefdoms to develop the special coordinator model thus seems to have distinct advantages over shared leadership model for efficiency and clear communications interestingly the australian coordination mode l puts great emphasis on the field level when differences of opinion cannot be resolved in the offi ce of the special coordinator they are referred to more senior committee at first assistant secretary level or above besides the principals group series of regular and ad hoc working groups have been set up to deal with the different elements of the mission regular planning and coordination between headquarters and the field is based around standing weekly interdepartmental conferences with membership at first assistant secretary level and principals level attended also by the deputy special coordinator and the heads of each governance pillar every six months the national security committee of cabinet nsc meets to review the mission and the strategic policy coordination group meets more frequently as needed halfyearly superplanning day is held in honiara and attended in person by senior representatives from each agency from the field and from canberra regular submissions to cabinet also facilitate coordination among departments yet other ideas to be picked up on coordination are the uks closer working action plan for department for international development and the foreign and comonwealth office and the planned comprehensive spending review as well as the swedish ministry of foreign affairs extended information sharing in order to use sida and fo reign affairs funds in more complementary manner the idea of working plan could be broadened to include other ministries departments and agencies the spending review and the attempt to make budgets more complementary are potentially strong instruments for promoting joinedup working as they can be linke d to formal reporting to parliament it would also make sense to link these reviews and assessments to funding instruments such as the uks conflict prevention pools and the netherlands stability fund finally mechanisms such as the swedish joint preparation process and the global policy for development could inspire other countries to establish formal procedures or even obligations at the governmental level to coordinate for specific purpose in the case of sweden coordination ensures that at the working level departments are in agreement on all issues domestic and international there are also number of important lessons to be drawn from the cases first lesson relates to the need to work in joinedup manner from the be ginning sweden for instance has introduced the management response which is mechanism employed by foreign affairs department for policy development aiming to operationalise findings from studies that are commissioned as part of the need for more joinedup approach the scope of actors involved in the discussions on operationalising such findings has been broadened to an interministerial vel with relevant ministries represented according to the theme concerned the case study indicates that excluding relevant partners from the beginning of the process can hinder cooperation and coordination second lesson concerns the need for formal structures although not always inadequate informal mechanisms do have limitations third lesson has to do with very basic yet important aspect one cannot coordinate what is not accepted and operationalised the cases of france and sweden show most clearly that it is difficult to coordinate different inputs such as from development cooperation and security departments in the absence of policy that allows for such cooperation and coordination 30 this relates back to principle 5 of the oecd dac principles for good international engagement in fragile states recognise the politicalsecurity development nexus the lesson is to have clarity on approaches to development and security 34 harmonisation it is also important to assess how wgas relate to coordination with other international actors through harmonisation the regional assistance mission to the solomon islands is harmonised as it is regional mission with representation from 12 pacific island countries and new zealand the mission is led by the special coordinator career diplomat from the australian department of foreign affairs and trade the deputy special coordinator is new zealand government official and the assistant special coordinator is from fiji the united nations is not involved beyond giving the mission its blessing in the other cases harmonisation also plays an im portant role in the case of yemen the department for international development is seeking to engage more strategically by influencing the policies and approaches of its assistance partners in this context the department takes an active lead in yemen in driving the harmonisation and alignment agendas both thr ough its support of an aid effectiveness unit in the ministry of planning and international cooperation and its interaction with other donor countries and agencies one result is that the september 2004 drivers of change study was supported by the dutch embassy in haiti canada also puts premium on harmonisation by working through the interim cooperation framework the framework coordinates vast arra of donor activity including the interventions of multilateral organisations and bilateral aid agencies in the case of the democratic republic of congo belgium coordinates with other international actors and donor governments through multitude of political and diplomatic forums including the international committee to accompany the transition known by its french acronym ciat the great lakes contact group the great lakes regional conference and the multicountry demobilization and reintegration program mdrp in addition coordination takes place at the eu level for france the document cadre partenariats dcp are the main instrument for assuring coordination with international actors in sudan some novelties can be identified in addition to eu dialogue and participation in the assessment and evaluation commission and the multidonor trust fund the netherlands denmark norway sweden and the united kingdom have embarked upon an innovation in donor coordination with the establishment of joint donor team for the south to be based in juba the five parties to the team will jointly coordinate and execute th development cooperation activities of their respective countries in the south of which they consider the multidonor trust fund to be the core an important note should be made about the fact that not all international actors support and work through mechanisms and procedures promoting harmonisation in the case of the solomon islands and sudan special mention was made of this aspect in the case of sudan it implied that the most influential international actors in terms of assistance re main outside the main coordination mechanisms alignment almost all cases show great interest of interna tional actors and donor governments in coordinating with partner governments in the case of the regiona l assistance mission to the solomon islands formal systems for coordinating with solomon islands government are less well developed coordination of policy between the mission and the solomon islands government is largely informal and highlevel problem in terms of coordination is the governments limited capacity to service membership of the numerous interdepartmental conferences the mission is currently working on its first coherent medium term strategy an inherently wholeofgovernment obj ective which should help to provide both strategic information and the opportunity for input to solomon islands government officials and ministers 35 in haiti the interim cooperation framework and its system of committees also help to enhance the leadership and ownership of the interim haitian government of its development agenda in particular the formulation of poverty reduction strategy paper is seen as an opportunity for canada to revise and update its engagement within longterm strategic vision led by the haitian government in the democratic republic of congo and sudan alignment takes place through the same mechanisms that were mentioned for harmonisation in sudan the multidonor trust fund is mentioned as an important instrument as for every donordollar in th fund the sudanese authorities will add two from their own budget differences in organisational culture each of the case studies points out that in terms of management differences in organisation cultures can play role development cooperation for instance traditionally engages in countries based on an understanding that change is slow process and that obstacles are structural in nature this implies long term engagement with various kinds of local actors also nongovernmental and the risk of various setbacks ministries of foreign affairs on the other hand are much more focused on the shorter term eg managing crises this may lead to less attention for the longerterm aspects and even to approaches that are not in favour of longerterm commitments ministries of defence are generally also more focused on shortterm outputs eg related to the duration of military mission in order to develop an effective joinedup approach it is of vital importance that the actors involved acknowledge and recognise such cultural differences and take them into account in developing co operation strategies instruments such as secondment of staff and shared training of staff on thematic issues are being used by the donor governments to bridge the cultural gaps between departments joint assessments are another important way to raise awareness of differences in organisational culture staff capacity and human resources joinedup working has considerable resource implic ations both in financial and human terms this poses yet another challenge to the successful development of wgas the case studies show that lack of qualified staff is one of the main problems encountered in the implementation phase capacity problems are not limited to the field level as mentioned in almost all the cases but can also be found at the headquarters level sweden and the uk are examples capacity problems are amplified in cases where organisations are faced with high rates of staff turnover in cases where staff position lasts for only 1224 months it will be difficult to build relationships with counterparts an important factor for the longterm commitment needed in fragile states this not only app lies to actors with an organisational culture focused on the shorter term but also to those with longerterm orientation in the case of canadas involvement in haiti it was noted that given the longterm involvement and the relatively small turnover of staff especially at cida institutional memory was strong however it was also noted that this is rather an exception to the ru in order to deal with this problem and to capture best practices emergency officials are now developing standard operating procedures that should help to inform new staff the reports also seem to suggest that problems of capacity are bigger in those cases where engagement is high on the political agenda and where formal coordination and reporting mechanisms are in place notwithstanding the advantage in terms of more political attention such mechanisms also draw heavily on embassy resources and staff as the case of the netherlands made clear it may be necessary to better balance political ambitions and implementation capacity specifically at the field level wga 36 requires sufficient staff capacity to manage relations with other partners and implement policies in an integrated manner efficient wgas to fragile states do not only require sufficient number of staff they also require certain level of qualified staff specifically in fragile states international actors need to be able to respond to developments in swift and flexible manner this requires level of staff able to take strategic decisions and operate without having to refer back to the headquarters level for every little detail in the case of australia for instance senior officials were appointed specifically to the mission in the solomon islands as way of ensuring flexibility in the case of australia special attention is paid to the quality and seniority of the staff as this is crucial for the effective functioning of its special coordinator model in the regional assistance mission to the solomon islands the special coordinator role is tasked to career diplomat from foreign affairs in general much importance is attached to the personal attributes of the missions principals particularly to the relationship between the special coordinator and the commanders of the military and police contingents the success of this structure depends on their personal qualities however for such models to work effectively it will be necessary to appoint equally senior and equally competent personnel in all key positions availability of financial resources another problem at the implementation level relates to resources in terms of having flexible funds available for implementing policies this aspect is further touched upon in the section on instruments but needs to be highlighted here as well even when resources are available at the field level their disbursement can be complicated due to reporting and accounting regulations or the need for formal approval at the headquarters level in order to be able to disburse quickly attempts should be made to delegate funds to the field level as much as possible alternatively simplification of procedures should be considered to enable swift disbursement the reports show that funding disparities among departments can be problematic by channelling funding through development agencies or ministries there is risk that development priorities and reporting requirements limit flexibility in particular if those requirements do not suit the purpose of programmes run by other agencies also procedures can be quite different from other ministries and agencies thus leading to questions and sometimes differences of opinion this was reported for the cases of australia and the uk part of this has to do with formal aspects and requirements such as development assistance eligibility and part has to do with organisational culture in addition it was mentioned that there is lack of common understanding across agencies on basic economic management in particular as regards working in difficult environments like fragile states this seems to suggest that whereas it may be good to have funding coming from single source attention still needs to be paid to who manages that source and to the implications for the main procedures the case studies show that the selected governments have not always matched their ambitions for an integrated approach with sufficient resources pooled funds can be solution to this challenge but it was also mentioned that limited availability of nondevelopment resources can be constraint for some programmes to emerge or being executed communication systems the intra and interdepartmental level in addition to various formal mechanisms the repo rts for this study indicate that in most cases communication among departments and between headquarters and field level is achieved primarily in an informal manner in the case of the uk for instance although formal meetings were arranged between the 37 various members of each departments yemen team in general communication took place by email and phone similar findings emerge from the reports on belgium sweden and australia the reports point out the lack of joinedup communication strategies and procedures in the case of canada canadian international development agency officers are not able to link up easily with relevant communication systems used by foreign affairs officers as they tend to use secured communication lines and messages can take days to reach them in order to achieve efficient communication governments need to make sure that systems are accessible and information is available to all relevant actors collaboration between development and security actors can also be affected by issues of security clearance the fact that joinedup approach im plies sharing all kinds of information including information with higher level of confidentiality im plies the need for effective planning to ensure that staff in relevant posts including those working for development agencies or ministries have appropriate levels of security clearance in order to improve the ad hoc character of communication and to exceed the level of mere information sharing and the role of personalities in establishing and maintaining contact departments should seek to integrate their informationmanagement systems and reporting structures apart from technical and security aspects it would be of particular interest to assess whether it is possible to establish more centralised formal communication and reporti ng system such centralised system would promote coherent joinedup approaches the papers indicate that currently reporting structures often are quite different thus leading to perceptions of complicated partnerships misunderstanding or even mistrust in terms of willingness to cooperate or coordinate the question remains where the centre for such communications coordination should lie and which system to adopt establishment of more formal proce ss involving regular reporting to political actors like parliament might also create incentives for policy coherence that are sufficiently strong to override departmental incentive structures and cultural differences that impede joinedup approach communication systems and reporting stru ctures field vs headquarters level the case studies show that for increasing effectiveness donor countries need to ensure regular communication between headquarters and the field level information must flow vertically as well as horizontally headquarters must make greater effort to contact the field currently most of the cases investigated indicate that contacts are insufficient to ensure field input on all strategic documents in the same context information is hardly shared with field st aff on regular basis if information is shared it is often to obtain fieldlevel input for specific initiatives or issues at headquarters level the case study of canada highlights the need for greater informatio n exchange and joint planning not only between departments but also between headquarters and the field in order to reconcile shortterm stabilisation efforts with longerterm development objectives in haiti emergency relief and stabilisation on the one hand and sustainable development on the other often in volve different sets of actors unless they plan together they could miss opportunities for synergy and greater overall impact or possibly even potentially work at crosspurposes in the case of belgium these issues were dealt with quite pragmatically the joint team on ddr demobilisation desarmement and reintegration and ssr consisting of development cooperation and defence staff is present at weekly interdepartmental coordination meetings on the great lakes and reports back to and consult with the embassy in the democratic republic of congo on regular basis in the case of sweden however the embassy is only to small extent involved in the work of the sudan working group in stockholm nor is the working group reporting back on regular basis in addition the staff in the swedish embassy office sida and fore ign affairs report back separately to their 38 institutional headquarters this practice of separate reporting to headquarters can be found in the case of the netherlands as well best practices are found for this inadequacy apart from ad hoc and personal initiatives however for joinedup approach one so lution would be to consider different communication system in which reports are shared with relevant departments and agencies on formal basis in the case of australia the communications matrix with the office of the special coordinator osc at the centre at the field level and with lines of communication operating in three directions among personnel from the different agencies in honiara among personnel from each agency in the field and their counterparts or superiors in canberra and among personnel from the different agencies in canberra has proved to be an effective way to transmit coherent synthesised information about progress on the ground while allowing each department to retain degree of hierarchical contact and control 39 iii recommendations the need for an overall framework all case studies confirm the appropriateness of principles 5 and 631 of the principles for good international engagement in fragile states they also highlight the need for all these principles to be mainstreamed in oecd member governments along with other dac guidelines there are nonetheless considerable gaps between what has been agreed in principle and ministerial and agency practice while mainstreaming of the principles within donor govern ments should therefore be high priority for dac members this should be accompanied by efforts to develop the policy instruments and mechanisms required to operationalise these into assistance programmes32 the effectiveness of joinedup approaches may be improved by the creation of an overall framework for managing wholeofgovernment engagement in frag ile states such framework would consist of three elements 1 clear understanding of what fragile states are which is shared by all relevant government actors 2 joint policy statement explaining the rationale for collaborative working in fragile states together with the aims and how these will be achieved and 3 commitment to establish an effective dialogue between the key actors involved in wga and to work on bridging differences in organisational culture the case studies show that current approaches are often initiated by development actors and that discussions on the politicalsecuritydevelopment nexus are also mainly couched in development terminology creating joinedup approach requires taking on board the views approaches and needs of other government actors as well the aim of the suggest ed framework is to enable early involvement of all relevant actors including those at the field level and to provide clarity about their roles and objectives in wholeofgovernment approach while important as an instrument for promoting and managing joinedup working the creation of an overall framework should not result in bureaucratic straitjacket creating an additional layer of decision making an overall framework resulting in standardised approaches towards fragile states is to be avoided the starting point shoul d be that there are blueprints for addressing their problems achieving such framework requires political commitment at the highest levels ideally the process is driven at the level of prime minister and involves engaging the relevant ministers for wholeof government approach who to involve when dealing with fragile states it is important to engage with range of actors which actors to engage and to what extent may vary from case to case however notwithstanding the fact that the fragile states issue is still predominantly perceived from development cooperation perspective the case studies confirm that the effect of nonaid policies on development outcomes is now widely accepted as result security actors and objectives related to the security domain are increasingly included in the development debate as are economic actors justice departments and others most of the case studies show that currently departments of development cooperation foreign affairs and defence are the key actors in wgas to fragile states in order to create wga evidence suggests that increased involvement of other departments in particular ministries of economic affairs and trade should be encouraged 40 other actors may also have role to play depending on the circumstances here one can think of the police ministries of justice and migration however acknowledging the difficulty of coordinating the activities of broad range of actors these other departments should only be involved next to the key actors if and when they have comparative advantage joint analysis donors must not underestimate the difficulty of developing and carrying out joint analysis let alone sharing and internalising findings so that they can be acted upon in joinedup manner through country strategies but despite the challenge it is recommended that donors aim to develop joint analyses of fragile states and to share findings as important steps in the process towards setting priorities for action the case study reports indicate that there is already good deal of informal learning that goes on but this could usefully become more institutionalised sharing experience among members of the fragile states group could be helpful in this regard however the case studies also show that the success of joint analyses and shared findings is at least in part dependent on government structure that compels ministries to work together countryspecific joint operational strategies there is onesizefitsall strategy for addressing state fragility one of the challenges therefore is to become collaborative and countryspecific while avoiding approaches that become fragmented and guided by different and potentially conflicting departmental objectives the suggested overall framework plays critical role in this regard and should promote the development of practical countryspecific approaches the case studies suggest that donors would benefit from the development of countryspecific approaches on the basis of joint assessments early in the process that allow for joint strategies planning monitoring and evaluation box 4 how can country strategies contribute to policy coherence the major components of joinedup working are analysis policy strategy programming and monitoring the strategy development process is key to linking these different components together by encouraging consultation and shared analysis of political security and development issues as basis for agreeing policy linking departmental priorities in the country in question to donor countrys foreign policy objectives providing tool for managing joinedup working through the development of action plans with benchmarks providing basis for ensuring that departments speak with common voice when dealing with different host government interlocutors and officially committing departments to work more closely with each other in particular area coordination the need for political leadership and lead coordinating role the case studies indicate that wgas require commitment and leadership from the political top the starting point for an effective wholeofgovernment approach therefore is clear political guidance and leadership which should provide the different actors involved with an understanding of the importance of their involvement 41 the case study reports also underline the fact that an integrated approach should not simply be perceived as an outcome but rather as process how to get there is just as important as getting there in this regard it is important to have clarity on who plays what role in this process and in particular to recognise the need for lead coordination without clar ity on how coordination is established the risk of fragmentation remains how to establish coordination is crucial and sensitive and should not be underestimated on the one hand joinedup approach may imply that any of the actors involved could take that lead from the perspective of coordination on the other hand it is to be preferred to have an established lead coordinating agency in this regard it is important to differentiate between leadership and coordination the first implies that other ministries and departments have to follow directions the latter indicates equal relationships in examining coordination it is important to note that governments engagement in fragile state covers different phases that require different types of involvement from different actors this engagement is not static the roles and involvement of actors may change according to circumstances in simplified model this could imply that for instance defence and the police may play more central role in stabilisation phase whereas in capacitybuilding phase development cooperation may play more central role at the same time external interventions in fragile states context will be heavily politicised hence there will often be case for diplomatic actors to play key role it is important to recognise the fact that these phases may operate in parallel rather than in succession in view of this fact as well as the fact that the key actors involvement in wgas to fragil states changes over time attention should be paid to continuity and overall coherence the case studies underline the need for continuous wholeof government coordinating leadership to ensure consistency some of the case studies suggest that given their position role and mandate foreign affairs may be best positioned at headquarters level to take up this lead coordinating role in particular integrated departments and ministries of foreign affairs and development cooperation these cases showed that at the field level ambassadors or special coordinators originating from foreign affairs seem to be best positioned for such lead coordinating role supported in this task by representatives from development cooperation and defence other cases indicate that the lead coordinating role can also be taken on by other actors depending on the modalities the key is that capable lead coordinating actor be identified it is suggested that in order to guarantee continued wholeofgovernment coordinating leadership foreign affairs could act as constant coordinating partner during all the phases what should be avoided at all cost is formal overall leadership resulting in contractorsubcontractor relationships whereby some departmental interests are systematically ignored or coopted to serve one narrow policy objective this would frustrate real jo inedup working all departments have the lead in their sectors of expertise and policy mandates attempts need to be made to increase ownership of the joint working not least by involving core actors from the st art and to let all parties share in successes and in taking risks creating the right incentive structures in view of the potentially high transaction costs involved governments should acknowledge that there are disincentives for collaborative working and identify those eg timeconsuming requiring compromise and willingness to dilute ones own policy agenda possibly leading to less individual departmental visibility similarly attention should be paid to id entifying existing incentives for joinedup working as well as create new ones where necessary an important incentive is providing the means and resources for joinedup working however in some countries such an approach can be problematic it is clear that if fragile states are priority as part of joinedup working ministries and departments other than development cooperation should also devote part of their budget to fragile state activities in this regard high official development assistance targets can limit governments in identifying financial room or extra 42 money for other sectors to devote to fragile states finally it is important to have better insight in the financial costs involved in mainstreaming policies joint policy statement by the key ministers providing the rationale for wholeofgovernment engagement in fragile states as well as the main objective can also serve as an incentive as it commits the key actors involved to enter into dialogue furthermore donor governments could use such policy statement as means of accountability for higherlevel officials to put joinedup working into operation in their respective organisations an incentive for the working level could be for performance reviews not just to focus on project outputs but also to include credit for effective coordination with other government departments leading to improved outcomes govern ments should also be encouraged to identify institutional incentives in terms of tradeoffs key incentive for working with other actors is that it provides the opportunity to influence their policy agendas and ways of working and it also offers means to access skills and resources which department may lack overall benefit of wholeofgovernment approach is access to broader pool of expertise in the public sector to help strengthen partner government institutions mechanisms and instruments for promoting policy coherence and joinedup working in addition to the need for an overall framework join t country strategies and attention to process it is imperative to have the right instruments available to support political decisions on wgas the case reports indicate that where such instruments are available their usage can be improved in other cases new instruments will need to be developed the case studies show that institutional budgetary and functional walls between departments can impede cooperation and coordination the creation of joint budget lines can foster integrated planning establishing joint budget lines however proves to be difficult or even impossible given existing mandates and budget reporting requirements pooled funding is considered an important alternative instrument to foster integrated planning the case stud ies show that different approaches are possible one is the dutch model the stability fund in which money comes from foreign affairs including development cooperation and in which defence as one the key actors is consulted for planning the other is the uk model for pooled funding where the different ministries adding to the fund decide on its spending both models of pooled funding allow for flexibility in support of activities which may be classified as official development assistance and nonofficial development assi stance however there is danger that pooled funding can result in the proliferation of small projects unconnected to wider strategy and can generate competition among departments for scarce resources and so discourage joinedup approaches there is also risk that pooled funds can lead to the creation of new and additional structures eg new units geographic desks which can make achieving coherence more difficult by the addition of more actors avoiding the creation of parallel structures and encouraging the involvement of existing geographic desks across relevant government departments foreign development and security in the planning and implementation of initiatives funded by these pools can result in improved coherence with lower management and transactions costs reporting structures both vertical and horiz ontal are an important instrument to promote effectiveness in terms of implementation joined up reporting can strengthen cooperation between headquarters and the field level vertical and at the field level joinedup reporting can enhance dialogue horizontal among different departmental interests joinedup reporting can also play role in terms of developing an influencing agenda as it ensures that the key actors speak with common voice when they deal with their hostgovernment interlocutors 43 information management systems in order to promote joinedup working it is also recommended that where possible the information management systems of different actors be integrated the case studies show that intra and interdepartmental communication systems can be improved in terms of technical features of access to information practical issues such as lack of the right level of security clearance for key personnel can be an impediment to accessing information and creating shared understanding of sensitive issues and problems both at headquarters and field levels in order to make joinedup working more effective differences in information access have to be addressed as they can limit the ability of actors to enter into dialogue with colleagues from other ministries 44 45 references ausaid 2002 investing in growth stability and prosperity canberra australia

httpwwwdepnofilarkiv210673rapp104pdf 46 47 annex overview coordination mechanisms case study countries the case studies show that over the last years donors have developed plethora of mechanisms aimed at better coordination often supported by specific initiatives instruments and tools short overview of each case study is provided here australia australian security policy is coordinated at the highest level by the national security committee of cabinet which comprises key ministers and department and service heads and therefore covers both the making and implementation of policy committee members are wellplaced to provide the necessary wholeofgovernment impetus to their individual depart ments with regard to combined operations so that failures of communication at lower levels tend to be faults of leadership rather than structure at lower levels foreign and development policy is generated by the department of foreign affairs and trade dfat and its institutional younger sibling the australian agency for international development ausaid while security policy and ope rations may be undertaken by the department of defence the australian defence forces and the australian federal police afp where particular operation requires the involvement of these and other actors the department of prime minister and cabinet has oversight of proceedings in general these departments attempt to coordinate their efforts by common membership of interdepartmental committees idcs some of which stand permanently while others are formed and disbanded according to circumstance personal relationships across departments have proven just as important as more formal mechanisms for the effective coordination of policy at both headquarters and field level some relationships arise naturally from the current circumstance but others were formed previously and provide productive but less obvious paths of communication among different depart ments the relatively small size and geographic concentration of the australian public service contributes to this effect permanent liaison officers placed in defence the afp and ausaid help to facilitate common understanding in the case of the regional assistance mission to solomon islands ramsi coordination is achieved by means of two central mechanisms the ramsi idc which meets weekly by video link and includes senior officials from both the field and headquarters and by the good offices of the ramsi special coordinator dfat official who brings together the leaders of each element of ramsi and has overall charge of the field mission the office of the special coordinator is the nexus through which reporting and decision making flows between the field and headquarters separate lines of communication also operate between the field and headquarters with in each department though they tend to deal with departmental rather than missionwide issues at wer levels in the field interdepartmental committees and working groups address specific issues the australian high commission in honiara is neither formally nor directly involved in coordinating ramsi activities although there is constant communication between their respective leaders both of whom are career diplomats because ramsi is regional mission though overwhelmingly staffed and 48 funded by australia it cannot be run bilaterally and the high commissions activities are limited to the usual business of diplomacy including management of the bilateral aid program although this program is formally distinct from ramsi their respective co mponents are practically seamless ausaids country strategies mandated to include wholeofgovernment inputs therefore provide another forum for interdepartmental coordination in the case of ramsi belgium the political and institutional complexity in the case of belgium indicate that issues of coordination and the potential for wga can vary according to country due to national political and institutional factors in this context the key coordinating role for foreign policy lies with the federal public service foreign affairs international trade and developmen t cooperation fps fa within the fps fa several directorates general have central function to achieve policy coherence through range of mechanisms and forums the directorate general for development cooperation is integrated into the fps fa and is responsible to seek coherence among the different belgian actors in development policies with regard to the case of the democratic republic of congo drc the case study focuses attention on the fact that the great lakes region and the drc in particular historically play an important role in belgian foreign policy the fact that the drc is not just technical but also political area of attention has resulted in long history of interdepartmental coordination the paper mentions that notwithstanding the political importance of the drc coordination has mainly been ad hoc at the headquarters level co ordination on the drc takes place through weekly meeting which involves representatives from all relevant ministries as well as the policy cells of th prime minister and the ministers of foreign affairs development cooperation and defence the meeting is informal but written report is widely distributed as in the case of the swedish sudan working group this belgian group is not decisionmaking organ it is mainly vehicle for exchanging views information and policy on regular basis at the field level belgium has considerable diplomatic representation with political economiccommercial development military and consular section the ambassador plays central role in terms of coordination he presides over daily meetin gs between the sections and relates to the weekly interdepartmental coordination meetings in brussels the fact that most coordination takes place on an ad hoc basis is now recognised as an area for improvement first step to enhance coordination is the joint team ministry of defence and development cooperation which was established for dealing with issues related to ssr and ddr the different sections of the embassy are closely involved in its work field missions their reports are widely circulated and they participate in the weekly coordination meeting canada 33 at more general level the prime minister of canada is ultimately responsible for the coherence of canadas public policy overall supported by his cabinet and its system of committees for international policy the foreign affairs and national security comm ittee is responsible for ensuring coordinated and integrated approach to canadas engagement abroa d the privy council office pco provides critical link between the prime minister and his cabinet on the one hand and the civil service on the other the pco is responsible for ensuring that the prime ministers priorities are reflected in the work of the civil service for the latter the pco serves as focal po int for coordinating priorities across government policy coordination among departments and agen cies is done mainly through interdepartmental committees working groups and task forces the department of foreign affairs and international trade dfait is mandated to coordinate all relevant departments and agencies the stabilisation and 49 reconstruction task force start has recently been established at dfait to enhance the governments ability to produce timely and coordinated responses to international crises although start is meant to be an interdepartmental mechanism its management comprises only of dfait officials number of department of national defence dnd and canadian international development agency cida officers are seconded to start but they are placed mostly at working level as of april 2006 the way in which start was to interface and work with other departments and agencies remained unclear an interdepartmental advisory board made up of dfait cida dnd public safety and emergency preparedness canada psepc royal canadian mounted police rcmp and pcos foreign affairs and defence policy secretariat s been established to provide guidance to start however the terms of reference for this director gene rallevel coordinating body have yet to be finalised furthermore at the operational level it remains to be seen how start will be able to coordinate the global peace and security fund with cida bilateral programmes and promote coherence between short term stabilisation and longerterm institution building the latter is normally the purview of development cooperation how start will work with cida bilateral desks to ensure complementary design and delivery of longerterm programmes as well as how exit strategies will be developed remains to be seen the canada corps and canadian police arrangement cpa are two mechanisms that also enhance interdepartmental engagement in fragile states the former enabled canada to deploy large number of shortterm election observers to the international m onitoring mission of hai tian elections headed by canadas chief electoral officer canadas election support was good example of how various departments pooled their resources to provide multifaceted support to strategic initiative similarly the cpa enabled canada to deploy up to 100 canadian police officers to the united nations stabilization mission in haiti during the past two years involving collaboration between dfait cida and the rcmp canadas overall engagement in haiti was planned by an interdepartmental steering group consisting mainly of dfait dnd cida psepc and pco when resource issues were addressed the department of finance and treasury board secretariat participated in the meetings at the operational level an interdepartmental working group was also convened by departments and agencies to plan and oversee the implementation of canadas approach in haiti domestic departments with important technical expertise participated in this working group such as correctional services canada elections canada and the department of justice the prime minister also appointed special advisor but this advisor has specific coordinating role at field level canada coordinates its support mainly through the interim cooperation framework and its system of sectoral tables the ambassador and head of aid play key role in aligning canadian activity with priorities set by haitian authorities and supported by the international community the formulation of country strategy is new process launched by all canadian embassies this year the country strategy is to be produced on an annual basis and outlines how the mission with headquarters support will implement canadas strategic objectives on the ground particularly it seeks to define how the mission will advance these objectives with wga this strategy is also linked to the ambassadors performance management agreement which defines the specific mandate of the ambassador which heshe is professionally accountable for implementing the performance management agreement is relatively new tool and is currently still being developed however it is considered an important incentive for working in joinedup manner france in the case of france the ministry of foreign affairs with the directorate general for international cooperation and development dgcid and the directorate for military cooperation and defence dcmd is main player in terms of international assistance broad range of other actors are also 50 involved the ministry of defence the ministry of economic affairs finances and industry and the french agency for development specifically with rega rd to coordination of policies on africa the cellule africaine of the elysée and the directorate africa and the indian ocean daoi are also important actors in addition for the coordination of development co operation two platforms have been created recently the cicid interministerial committee for international cooperation and the cosp conference on strategic orientation and planning in terms of actual coordination in the case of the democratic republic of congo these ministries and bodies are supported by range of instruments of which the documents cadres partenariat dcp partnership framework documents are the latest and most important addition the main actors for coordination are the daoi and the embassy in kinshasa with strategic input from the cellule africaine in terms of the development cooperation the afd plays the main role however it is clear that there is only limited coordination at the level of the administratio n between issues of security and development the assessment concludes that the dcmd seems to operate in different sphere and is culturally and content wise very disconnected from the dgcid of that same ministry hence whereas the dcp plays an important role in terms of coordination of development co operation the limited scope excluding all issues related to security makes it in its current form less useful as an instrument for coordination of joinedup approaches in fragile states the ambassador though can and does play key role in the coordination of all policies development and securityrelated and is able to bridge this gap to certain degree through his defined role but in the case of the democratic republic of congo to large degree because of his personality there are however formal structures to bridge this gap ie to promote coordination for joinedup approaches the netherlands in the case of the netherlands coordination at the more general level takes place in the council of ministers the coordination commission for internat ional affairs and the cabinet committee on european and international affairs in terms of the implementati on of dutch integrated policies more specialised co ordination mechanisms come into play key are the steering committee for security cooperation and reconstruction the stability fund sf steering committee the steering committee military operations the steering committees on police and rule of law and the interministerial consultation committee on civil military cooperation the ministry of foreign affairs mfa plays key role in most of these steering committees often with the ministry of defence as cochair these steering committees also cover the key actors foreign affairs development coopera tion and defence and instruments sf of the dutch wga on fragile states ie postconflict reconstruction for sudan the netherlands has established temporary task force with members from the mfas africa department the human rights and peacebuildin g department the security policy department and the humanitarian aid division meetings of the task force sudan tfs take place on weekly basis and are attended by representatives from defence other actors can join on an asneeded basis part of the tfs staff is temporarily seconded the tfs is special in the sense that it is positioned outside the mfas bureaucratic structures this provides the tfs with direct access to the directorsgeneral for international cooperation and for political affairs and ensures efficient provision of information to the ministers of foreign affairs and for development cooperation who are integrated in the mfa in practical terms the tfs is responsible for policy formulation and implementation and functions as the key coordinating mechanism to integrate policies in doing so the tfs has special envoy who is among other things involved in the darfur negotiations in abuja the tfs also works closely with the embassy in khartoum interestingly it was noted that the tfs as coordinat ing mechanism is better staffed than the embassy it was also noted that full time defence attaché in khartoum as opposed to the current situation where the cairo based defence attaché is accredited for sudan would enhance joinedup working at the embassy 51 level although coauthor of the joinedup rec onstruction memorandum the ministry of economic affairs is less visible in the tfs and not present at the field level special mention needs to be made here of the joint donor team and office in juba which will jointly coordinate and execute the development cooperation activities of five donor countries denmark netherlands norway sweden and the uk sweden in the case of sweden the coordination of foreign and development policy starts with the joint preparation process which is required by law and which pr oduces government decisions that are acceptable to all relevant ministries second important mechanism for coordination is the policy on global development pgd this policy is aimed at fighting poverty through promoting coherence in the whole government when it comes to the nexus of security and development and engaging in fragile states the range of actors is usually parliament the ministry of foreign affairs mfa defence the ministry of justice sida and the swedish rescue services agency the range of actors indicates that most relevant policy areas for fragile state are included discussions in the framework of the pgd lead to cooperation strategy incorporating relevant forms of swedish assistance provided to country there is an interdepartmental dialogue and joint planning the case study report shows however that this process which is led by the mfa regional desks in practice does not lead to fully joinedup approach due to the fact that there is joint assessment process different actors provide what they find important from their perspective and it is all incorporated into the strategy further coordination takes place through regular consultations between the mfa and sida these take place once or twice year or whenever this is called for and can address questions and reviews of policy implementation in order to promote coherence and to contribute to joinedup approach sweden has developed number of new initiatives as well first new development for sweden is the mfas ex tended consultations with sida on ways to use funds in complementary manner second new development is the management response this latter mechanism is employed by the mfas department for policy development and aims at operationalising findings from studies that are commissioned as part of the need for more joinedup approach the scope of actors ie different ministries involved in th discussions on operationalising such findings has been broadened according to the theme concerned regarding sudan coordination is in addition to the mechanisms mentioned above organised through the sudan guidelines for the moment revised version as from october 2005 and the sudan working group the paper on sweden concludes that these guidelines are developed through consultations but are not based on joint assessment process however each of the ministries involved provides its input from its perspective for sudan policy to the mfa the sudan working group which is not decisionmaking group is supposed to promote coherent implementation of the guidelines the sudan working group is informal and provides key civil servants with forum for discussion and facilitates agreements on next steps given the fact that the sudan working group only meets on an as needed basis also due to capacity problems the coordinating role is limited factor further constraining the coordinating role of the sudan working group is the fact that sida does not participate in the working group on regular basis sida is however consulted whenever necessary at the field level the potential for coordination is both high and low as in the case of the uk the colocation of the sida and mfa representatives in khar toum has led to an adhoc integrated approach at the field level limiting factor is the fact that sweden has very small representation in sudan consisting of only two people one representative from the mfa and one from sida however special envoy for 52 the horn of africa has been working since spring 2006 sweden has also had special envoy connected to the darfur peace negotiations in the first half of 2006 the swedish ambassador and defence attaché work out of the swedish embassy in addis ababa all this could possibly lead to fragmented approach sweden is partner in the joint donor team jdt in juba another sida official will be assigned to the jdt uk the three key actors involved in the uks join edup approach to yemen are the foreign and commonwealth office fco the department for intern ational development dfid and the ministry of defence mod all three departments participate in the africa and global conflict prevention pools which aim to develop integrated policies on conflict prevention in areas of either thematic or regional interest the post conflict reconstruction unit pcru was established to improve the uks capacity to deal with postconflict stabilisation including inte grating civilian and military policy planning and operations by providing operational support and facilitating communication between dfid the fco and the mod the pcru can help to align departmental pl anning processes the cabinet office provides the central support to the government to take forward its strategic foreign and policy objectives the cabinet office supports the prime ministers office and the cabi net and drives crosswhitehall coordination the cabinet office is supported by the joint intelligence committee jic which coordinates interdepartmental intelligence assessments improvements in crossdepartmental collaboration since the 1990s have been made possible by number of factors two worth noting are ministerial leadership stressing the need for greater cross departmental collaboration and the development of sh ared concepts and terminology important additional initiatives have been the dfidfco closer working action plan 2003 aimed at improving collaboration between these two departments and the planned 2007 comprehensive spending review the latter initiative will aim for greater governmentwide efficiency through further integration across departments the uks wga to yemen has been underpinned by range of formal and informal processes and mechanisms development of shared analysis of the problems was key starting point for building case for more integrated uk engagement with yemen ie drivers of change analysis on this basis the prime ministers office took the decision to review uk policy towards yemen and assigned the cabinet office with the task to initiate dialogue among the relevant departments the fco finally was given responsibility for developing the overall approach under the guidance of the cabinet office however in contrast to various formal mechanisms for other countries eg for sudan there is formal sudan unit the coordination of activ ities for yemen was done mainly through informal mechanisms management of the uk engagement in yemen has relied on lighttouch approach driven essentially by individual departments rather than by formal crossdepartmental or cabinetlevel committee pcru has not been involved in either the pl anning or coordination of departmental activities this approach reflects the fact that yemen ranks below other current uk priorities such as afghanistan and iraq where more formal management structures have been established this lighttouch approach can be seen as pragmatic response to resource constraints which exist across government to the extent that joinedup working has been achieved in number of key areas this is because all departments broadly share the same analysis of the problems and are clear on their individual roles in responding to them the fact that contrary to practice in many other countries where the uk is engaged fco and dfid are colocated in the same building in sanaa was also factor that contributed to closer professional and personal interaction between dfid fco and mod staff 53 notes 1 see oecd 2005 policy coherence and whole of

increasing concern in the international community about the implications for stability and progress towards the millennium development goals resulting from state failure or state fragility in response to this challenge the oecd development assistance committees dac fragile states group fsg developed set of draft principles for good international engagement in fragile states these principles highlight that successful development in fragile environment depends at least in part on well sequenced and coherent progress across the political security economic and administrative domains working effectively in fragile states requires donor countries to adopt whole of government approach wga involving departments responsible for security political and economic affairs as well as those
