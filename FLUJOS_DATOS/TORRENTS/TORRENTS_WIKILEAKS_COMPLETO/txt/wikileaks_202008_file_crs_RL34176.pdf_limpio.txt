g343g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 the inspector general act as amended will reach its 30th anniversary in 2008 and today there are more than 60 offices of inspectors genera l oigs this longevity and growth built on the efforts of the committee on oversight and government reform then the committee on government operations in spearheading their origination beginning in 1976 substantial bipartisan and bicameral support was necessary at their creation given the acrosstheboard opposition by executive agencies early on and for their continued development there are two types of inspectors general igs 1 federal establishment igs are appointed by the president with senate confirmation and may be removed only by the president except in the case of impeachment and 2 designated federal entity dfe igs are appointed and removed by the agency head in usually smaller agencies the establishing mandates and statutory supports for the igs 1 provide useful vantage point to view the current proposals to modify the igs their statutory powers and political power in combating waste fraud and abuse igs have been granted substantial amount of independence authority and resources in combination these assets are probably greater than those held by any similar internal auditinginvestigating office at any level of government here or abroad now or in the past some of these purposes and powers of the igs include their charges to conduct and supervise audits and investigations within an agency provide leadership and coordination for recommending policies and activities to promote the economy efficiency and effectiveness of programs and operations have access to agency information and files and subpoena power for records and documents receive complaints from agency employees whose identities are to remain confidential with certain stated exceptions implement the cash incentive award program for employee disclosures of waste fraud and abuse hold independent law enforcement authority in offices in establishments receive separate appropriations account for offices in establishments be appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely

under only the general supervision of the agency head who is prohibited with only few express exceptions2 from preventing or prohibiting an ig from initiating or carrying out an audit or investigation along with these igs have critical reporting requi rements to keep the agency head and congress fully and currently informed through specified reports and otherwise which includes testifying at hearings and meeting with members and staff3 the reports include semiannual reports as well as immediate reports regarding particularly serious or flagrant problems4 for both types the ig reports are submitted to the agency head who transmits them unaltered but with comments deemed necessary to congress within designated period of time the resulting connections between the igs and congress not only enhance legislative oversight capabilities but also provide an avenue for potential support for ig findings conclusions and recommendations for corrective action

institutional arrangements and authorities modifications to the ig act have been seen as useful to enhance the igs independence and power along these lines is the wide range of proposed changes in these two bills their overarching theme is to strengthen and clarify the authority tenure resources oversight and independence of the inspectors general the bills specific proposals and considerations set up additional protections for igs including for cause removal and terms of office consolidation and codification of two existing councils established by executive order into single council of the inspectors general on integrity and efficiency the reporting of the igs initial budget and appropriations estimates to the office of management and budget the agen cy head and congressional committees program evaluation in ig semiannual reports and the grant of law enforcement authority to igs in designated federal entities additionally hr 928 as passed by the house and s 1723 would require that

an audit or investigation or issuing subpoena and then only for sp ecified reasons to preserve national security interests or protect ongoing criminal investigations among others when exercising this power the agency head must transmit an explanatory statement for such action within 30 days to the house committee on oversight and government reform the senate homeland security and governmental

appointed igs may be removed from office for any reason by the president the president is required to communicate the reasons for such removal to congress however the reasons need not be given in writing and time limit is set7 there is requirement that congress be given advance notice of an igs removal igs who are appointed by an agency head may be removed or transferred for any reason by the agency head and the only limitation on such removal is that the agency head must promptly communicate to both houses of congress in writing the reasons for the igs removal or transfer 8 hr 928 and s 1723 propose change in the removal provision for establishment igs by requiring that removal by the president must be for cause on specified grounds hr 928 and s 1723 provide that an establishment inspector general may be removed from office prior to the expiration of his or her term only on any of the following grounds 1 permanent incapacity 2 inefficiency 3 neglect of duty 4 malfeasance 5 conviction of felony or conduct involving moral turpitude 6 knowing violation of law rule or regulation 7 gross mismanagement 8 gross waste of funds 9 abuse of authority 9 congress has provided these specific grounds for other officials and an appendix to this report lists other examples of statutory terms used to limit the presidents authority to remove officials appointed with the advice and consent of the senate s 1723 would also change the removal provision for dfe igs by requiring that removal of dfe ig by the agency head be for cause on any of the first five grounds listed above s 1723 would require the agency head of dfe to notify congress in writing of the reasons for the dfe igs removal or transfer by that agency head not later than 15 days before the agency head takes such action an amendment to hr 928 while not containing for cause removal requirement for dfe igs would require dfe agency heads to give both houses of congress and the dfe ig written notice of the reasons for any such removal or transfer at least 30 days before such removal or transfer the president has threatened to veto hr 928 in part because of the for cause removal provision the bush administration argues that limiting the presidents removal authority does not enhance the function of igs and raises grave constitutional concerns 10 however as explained below this argument is without merit the supreme court has held as constitutional congressional conditions limiting the presidents ability to remove appointed officers in humphrey s executor v united states 11 the court continued

purely executive functions could not be removed during their terms of office except for one or more of the causes named in the applicable statute12 such as inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance in office13 the court reasoned that the fixing of definite term of office subject to removal for cause is enough to establish legislative intent that the term not be curtailed in the absence of such cause14 congressional restraints on the presidents power of removal fall within the principle of separation of powers according to the court which recognized the fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence direct or indirect of either of the others 15 subsequently in morrison v olson 16 the supreme court expanded the congressional authority established in humphrey s executor the court removed the limitations with respect to inapplicability to officers performing purely executive functions holding that now congress has the authority to provide for cause removal protection to any advice and consent officer the court established twostep balancing test for such separation of powers situations first the president must establish that the congressional action interferes with core power if so congress must show necessity for its action to overcome the interference in morrison the supreme court held that congressional restrictions on the attorney generals ability to remove an executive officer did not violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers17 in analyzing the issue the court reasoned that the good cause standard for removal did not impermissibly interfere with the functions of the executive branch because congress had not tried to gain role in the removal of executive officials beyond its current powers18 additionally even with its limitations removal power remained within the executive branch19 thus enabling the executive branch to perform its constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed 20 in the ig context the executive branch would retain ample authority to assure that the ig is competently performing his or her statutory responsibilities according to the ig act21 the court also noted that congresss limitation on the executives removal power was essential in the view of congress to establish the necessary independence of the office22 in sum congress has the authority to limit removal of individuals by the president or an agency head and can determine for which reasons that individuals should be removed under this 12 id at 632 13 id at 621 15 usc 41 14 humphreys executor 295 us at 623 15 id at 62930 16 487 us 654 1988 17 the nowlapsed independent counsel provision in the ethics in government act

officers at all levels of departments and agencies for reasons varying from general cause to discrete limited reasons such as inefficiency neglect of duty and malfeasance in office for example the commissioner of social security may be removed from office only pursuant to finding by the president of neglect of duty or malfeasance in office23 yet the chief actuary of the same agency24 and the chief actuary of the centers for medicare and medicaid services25 may be removed only for cause during the clinton administration congress provided temporary protection from the presidents authority to remove appointed officials for the under secretary for nuclear security of the department of energy26 precedents also exist for limiting the removal of an individual with an analogous position to an ig to for cause reasons the special counsel who heads an independent agency dedicated to protecting federal employees and applicants from prohibited personnel practices may be removed for cause which the relevant statute defines as inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance in office 27 in the cases of the comptroller general who heads the government accountability office and deputy

without delineating the causes for which individuals could be removed would protect igs from being removed by the president or an agency head based on policy reasons or because of disagreement with an igs determination furthermore different written formulations of the removal for cause provision for example neglect of duty or malfeasance as opposed to inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasancedo not diminish the purpose of giving igs degree of independence if congress deems it proper for cause removal however does recognize that some minimal due process procedures are required this was

policies or the administering of the federal trade commission 30 humphrey and later his estate contested his removal in court and succeeded it does not appear that any for cause removal officer has been fired by the president since humphrey and therefore there has been establishment of mechanism to determine the appropriateness of presidential removal however there is one recorded instance of an advice and consent officer who demanded and was offered minimal hearing31 the removal for cause requirement is viewed by its proponents as way to strengthen and preserve the independence of the igs whose ability to investigate allegations of waste fraud and abuse within their respective agencies would be enhanced by prohibiting their firing without cause 32 requiring for cause removal could potentially prevent the removal of an ig whose investigations were proving embarrassing to the agency however requiring removal only for cause would meaningfully restrict the presidents and agency heads discretion and may make it difficult to remove poorperforming ig an alternative approach seen in the amended version of hr 928 reported out of committee and passed by the house 33 is the requirement that the dfe agency head notify the ig and congress 30 days in advance about the prospect of dismissal or transfer and the reasons for it this would allow an opportunity before the removal occurs for the ig to challenge the specific concerns or allegations for congress to inquire into them and possibly for resolution of the dispute this notification requirement is also present in s 1723 which provides for cause removal for dfe igs although with shorter time frame of 15 days the council of the igs on integrity and efficiency proposed by hr 928 and s 1723 discussed in greater detail

hr 928 and s 1723 would institute fixed terms of office for all establishment and designated federal entity igs the new provision is designed to encourage igs to remain in office for at least seven years as it appears that many leave before then34 the grant of fixed term of office does not run contrary to precedent and has been viewed as providing the incumbent with the chance to gain expertise35 as well as independence36 however only one ig the usps ig has fixed term of office it is sevenyear term and is renewable all other igs have fixed terms several other executive branch positions also have fixed terms of office such as the director of the office of personnel management four years37 the director of the office of government ethics five years38 and the special counsel

establish the sevenyear renewable fixed term of office for all other igs questions might arise over whether seven years is sufficient since it does not extend across twoterm presidency on the other

tenure might impinge on the igs independence he or she would be reappointed by an official who or whose political allies might be subject to an ig audit or investigation at the time term limits even if renewable would also allow for lameduck ig if it becomes evid ent that he or she will not be reappointed and such limits would still permit vacancy awaiting fullfledged inspector general until replacement arrives with the position being filled by an acting ig these characteristics both affect the stability of the office and continuity of its operations projects orientation and priorities some may suggest single but longer term 10 or 15 years without the possibility of reappointment as currently applied to the comptroller general the term of office section of hr 928 and s 1723 may necessitate additional clarification though the bills specify that an establishment presidentially appointed ig could serve more than one term of office the bills also state that such an ig may only holdover for more than an additional year after the expiration of his or her sevenyear term an individual may continue to serve as inspector general beyond the expiration of the term for which the individual is appointed until successor is appointed and confirmed except that such individual may not continue to serve for more than 1 year after the date on which the term would otherwise expire 42 since hr 928 and s 1723 state that igs may serve for more than one term reappointment and confirmation would be required before the ig could serve another full sevenyear term due to the holdover language for establishment igs in 2b of the bills this would also be true for designated federal entity igs appointed by agency heads for whom there is holdover provision finally the sevenyear term limit in hr 928 as passed by the house would apply to any inspector general appointed on or after the date of the enactment of this act 43 emphasis added the house committee on oversight and

order in 199246 the merger of the two councils would combine their forces and arguably reduce overlap and duplication one concern however might be the size of the new collective and whether it would prove unwieldy it appears that the proposed cigie would be an interagency council of the kind widely seen throughout the federal government the cigie would include other relevant executive agencies and officials as the pcie and ecie do now the new councils membership would also extend to two other igs not included in the existing councils these offices ie at the central intelligence agency and at the government printing office legislative branch agency do not operate directly under the ig act but instead under their own separate statutory authority question might arise as to whether it would be appropriate for legislative branch ig to be member of an interagency council which is chaired by an executive official now and as proposed th office of management and budgets deputy director for management however the cigie would have secondary chairperson who would serve twoyear terman ig selected from the councils membership 47 similar problem arises under s 1723 which unlike hr 928 would require the cigie to submit recommendations of 3 individuals to the appropriate appointing author ity for any appointment to an office of an establishment ig designated federal entity ig the central intelligence agency ig and the government printing office ig 48 such provision would allow mostly executive branch officials to submit recommendations for positions in legislative branch ig officethat of the government printing office ig additionally the phrase appropriate appointing authority implies that igs and executive branch officials on the cigie would be able to submit their three recommendations to the president agency head or ig for any appointment including that of the ig or any member of the igs staff once again executive branch officials could potentially influence the internal composition of the ig office of legislative branch agency the bills proposals would modify the existing arrangements which have grown under executive orders issued by presidents ronald w reagan george h w bush and william j clinton the statutory structure although incorporating some notable changes would more strongly institutionalize the current structure endorsed by successive presidents giving it greater stability as well as legislative approval this change could also add opportunities for congressional oversight of the inspectors general as well as of the coordinative arrangements among themselves and between the igs and other relevant executive entities additionally the legislation would provide separate appropriation account for cigie appropriations 49 the cigie would also provide for an integrity committee which already exists under executive order to handle allegations of wrongdoing by igs and top officials in their offices the bush administration has

cigie this statutory construct would codify with certain changes the integrity committee which now operates under eo 12993 issued by president clinton in 199653 such committee shall receive review and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing that are made against inspectors general and certain staff members of the various offices of inspector general54 this section does not appear to specify how allegations of wrongdoing that are made against an ig would be referred to the integrity committee this may raise also the question of who could refer an allegation of an igs wrongdoing to the committee for example would an other ig be able to allege wrongdoing by an ig however 11d5a states that the integrity committee shall review all allegations of wrongdoing it receives against an inspector general emphasis added so clarification as to who may make such allegations may not be necessary 55 the use of the term all in 11d5a seems to indicate that the integrity committee would be required to review every allegation of wrongdoing including allegations by member s of congress or by the general public after the proposed integrity committee reviews allegations of wrongdoing it must refer to the chairperson of the integrity committee any allegation of wrongdoing that the integrity committee determined is meritorious that cannot be referred to an agency of the executive branch with appropriate jurisdiction over the matter 56 next the chairperson of the integrity committee must thoroughly and timely investigate such allegations according to investigative 51 id 52 in shoemaker v united states 147 us 282 1893 the supreme court distinguished between congressional creation of and adding to the duties of an office and appointment to an office congress had provided for commission to acquire through condemnation land for park in the district of columbia and to appraise it for compensation the commission was composed of the chief of engineers of the united states army the engineer commissioner of the district of columbia and three citizens to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate id at 284 the designation of two officers as members of the commission was challenged on the ground that the provision represented an appointment of them which only the president could make the supreme court rejected the contention that because additional duties germane to the offices already held by them were devolved upon them by the act it was necessary that they s hould be again appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate it cannot be doubted and it has frequently been the case that congress may increase the power and duties of an existing office without thereby rendering it n ecessary that the incumbent should again be nominated and appointed id at 30001 in essence the shoemaker court upheld the legislation as result of its determination that the new duties assigned to the engineers cannot fairly be said to have been dissimilar to or outside the sphere of their existing responsibilities id 53 61 fr 1304345 march 26 1996 54 see hr 928 4a s 1723 4a would establish ig act 11d1 55 see william j esposito chairman

reporting establishment igs initial budget estimates directly to the office of management and budget omb the agency head and appropriate congre ssional committees this would ensure that all three units were aware of the initial estimate and thus enable each to calculate any decreases or adjustments made afterwards by agency officials or omb in addition to finding any such alterations the change in budget reporting could also contribute to congressional oversight of the establishment ig offices and their projected spending as well as omb and agency leadership the president has objected to hr 928s budg etary provisions claiming that they would authorize igs to circumvent the presidents longstanding and constitutionally based control over executive branch budget requests by allowing igs to submit their budget requests directly to congress 60 historically for significant period in our early history the president did not see departmental budget estimates before the treasury department transmitted them to congress61 prior to the budget and accounting act of 1921 agencies negotiated their annual appropriations directly with congress62 moreover congress previously required the interstate commerce commission to submit copies of budget estim ates requests and information including personnel needs to congress at the same time they are sent to the president or the office of management and budget63 additionally the statute detailing the preparation and submission of appropriations requests to the president specifies that an officer or employee of an agency 57 hr 928 4a

submit to congress or committee of congress an appropriations estimate or request only when requested by either house of congress64 the bush administration also objects to requiring the president to

investigators who currently may need to rely on piecemeal statutory authorizations or on special deputation by the us marshals service which is limited in time and location the additional authority however would mean that igs would need to be vigilant in approving and monitoring the conduct of oig staff in this regard ensuring that they receive necessary training meet relevant qualifications and

while the version of hr 928 passed by the house and s 1723 are identical in most respects other than those provisions discussed above s 1723 adds several provisions first s 1723 would require both establishment and designated federal entity igs to appoint counsel to the inspector general who shall report to the inspector general 73 second s 1723 states the mission of the cigie differently from the one stated in hr 928 previously both bills called on the cigie to increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies standards and approaches to aid in the establishment of welltrained and highly skilled workforce in the offices of the inspectors general 74 however the version of hr 928 passed by the house eliminated this language s 1723 includes the above language and would expand the councils mission to address integrity economy and effectiveness issues that transcend individual government agencies 75 currently the mission of the cigie as expressed in the version of hr 928 passed by the house is to coordinate and enhance governmental efforts to promote integrity and efficiency and to detect and prevent fraud waste and abuse in federal programs finally the housepassed hr 928 addresses concern raised in the bush administrations veto threat that disclosure protections regarding the witness security program apply to the department of justices inspector generals internal investigative procedures and release of information76 the administration argued that the release of specific program information could put the safety of witnesses at risk in addition to endangering program personnel and the program itself the housepassed bill would eliminate referral of allegations of misconduct involving department attorneys investigators or law enforcement personnel where the allegations relate to the exercise of the authority of an attorney to investigate litigate or provide legal advice by the doj ig to the counsel office of
