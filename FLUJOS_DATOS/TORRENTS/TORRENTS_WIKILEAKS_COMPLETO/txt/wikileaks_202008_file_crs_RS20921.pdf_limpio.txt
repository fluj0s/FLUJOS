innovation usps has long opposed their issuance while commemora tive stamps have from time to time been issued to raise awareness of social or health problems in the nation2 usps was reluctant to get into the fundraising business usps argued that there was strong tradition of private philanthropy in this country and due to the vast number of worthy fundraising organizations in existence it would be difficult to single out specific ones to receive semipostal revenue3 usps also warned that the administrative costs involved in accounting for sales would tend to outweigh th revenues derived from the surcharge philatelic groups also opposed semipostals they generally thought that usps was issuing too many commemorative stamps with broader clientele in mind than that of the stamp collector semipostals were departure from the tradition that stamps are for postage collectors regarded the semipos tal surcharge as tax on their hobby and pointed out that unlike other citizens who might be unsympathetic to the cause being supported they still had to buy the stamp or their collections would be incomplete the breast cancer research stamp despite usps oppositi on congress authorized

evaluate the program gao has since reported twice on the bcrs4 and the senate governmental affairs committee has held an oversight hearing to review it5 gaos evaluation was that the bcrs has been an effective fundraiser but gao also said that usps did not have good way of tracking its costs to avoid inadvertent subsidy from postal ratepayers revenue raised and postal service costs as of december 31 2007 accor ding to usps over 785 million bcrss had been sold the regular postage rate has been ra ised four times since the stamp was introduced from 32 to 41 cents and its cost has gone from 40 to

with usps over the amount usps had charged for its reasonable costs to be subtracted from the surcha rge amount before the net surcharge was turned over to nih and dod6 additionally usps decided to subtract less than 9 of the bcrs costs it did identify from the surcharge proceeds before turning the rest over to nih and dod uspss reasoning was that it also stood to recoup most costs from the firstclass postage portion of the stamp since some of the stam ps would be retained by the public and not used for postage in this respect the bcrs was similar to blockbuster commemorative issue and retained revenues from such issues are perennial moneymaker for usps7 the semipostal authorization act the attention given to the breast cancer stamp and gaos pronouncem ent that it was success helped

government relations and public policy made it clear that while usps was proud of the work it did on the bcrs it still did not favor issuance of other semipos tals she testified that fundraising was diversion from uspss core mission that the philatelic community opposed semipostals on the grounds that they dilute the quality of the stamp pr ogram but most seriously that choosing among the many worthy causes eager for semiposta l revenue would be difficult for the postal service9 she said that if semipostals were au thorized in the future she hoped congress would make those choices congress chose another approach however the semipostal authorization act cleared the house as hr 4437 under suspension of the rules on july 17 2000 and the senate by unanimous consent on july 26 the president signed the bill into law pl106253 114 stat 634 on july 28 2000 the day before the stamp out breast cancer act was to expire the act extended the bcrs for two more years until july 29 2002 and gave usps broad authority to issue and sell semipostals for 10 more years in order to advance such causes as the postal service considers to be in the national public interest and appropriate other than specifying that the funds raised could go only to federal ag encies the act left broad discretion to usps in selecting future semipostals the act also required usps to use the noticeand comment regulatory process to propose and then issue regulation specifying selection criteria procedures and any limitations imposed on the issuance of semipostals procedures and criteria for selecting semipostal stamps on june 12 2001 usps published regulation tting forth how it planned to implement its responsibility for the semi postal program 66 fr 3182231828 usps said it intended to invite

under the semipostal authorization act of 2000 until after the sales period of the bcrs has ended the implementing regulations also provide that the office of stamp services will determine the date of commencement of the 10year period congress however has enacted more semi postal stamp legislation the treasury postal service appropriations act for 2002 pl 10767 contained three provisions affecting the issuance of semipostal stamps one provision extended the bcrs expiration date to december 31 2003 and author ized raising the price of the stamp from 40 cents to 45 cents second provision author ized another semipostal to be issued as soon as possible to assist the families of resc ue workers killed or disabled in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the federa l emergency management agency fema would administer the funds usps announced at white house ceremony that the heroes of 2001 stamp would be issued june 7 2002 and terminate on december 31 2004 third provision authorized issuance of semipostal to support programs of the department of health and hu man services to stop domestic violence beginning later than january 1 2004 and being withdrawn later than december 31 2006 the stop family violence stamp went on sale october 11 2003 at price of 45 cents this stamp went off the market on december 31 2006 over 45 million of these semipostal stamps were sold raising about 3 million all three of these provisions exempted the stamps from the usps regulation limiting circulation of semipostals to one at any one time it is unlikely that usps would authorize semipostal under its statutory au thority to compete with those authorized directly by congress since usps is well aware that the public could tire of semipostals as has happened in veral other countries of the 170 c ountries that issue stamps only about 50 issued any semipostals in the 1990s and only 17 did so on regular basis even fewer had more than one in circulation at time canada the united kingdom and sweden discontinued the use of semipostals when they became unpopular with the public and competed with other fundraising activities11 there is some evidence that the public is losing interest in semipostals sales of the bcrs peaked at 1213 million stamps in fy2000 sales declined to 830 million and 801 million in fy2003 and fy2004 rose to 926 milli on in fy2005 then fell to

reported the views of some observers that the large initial sales figure s of the heroes of 2001 semipostal were not sustainable because that semipostal did not benefit from the support of longestablished wellorganized nationwide networ k of organizations to keep the heroes semipostal in the public eye in contrast to the nationwid support base for the breast cancer stamp13 in the last three months of 2004 period of s easonally heavy mailing sales of the heroes semipostal averaged only 16 million per mont h and sales of the domestic violence semipostal averaged only 967000 the

19 to discourage the consideration of legislation to authorize new semipostals the committee has adopted the policy that the determination of the subject matter of commemorative stamps and new semipostal issues is properly for consideration by the postmaster general and that the committee will not give consideration to legislative proposals specifying the subject matter of commemorative stamps and new semipostal issues it is suggested that recommendations for the issuance of commemorative stamps be submitted to the postmaster general this rule now numbered as rule 20 was retained by
