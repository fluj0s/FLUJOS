ref 2009 sanaa 1430 classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d 1 snf summary commander of the us central command general david petraeus congratulated president saleh on recent successful operations against aqap and informed him that us security assistance to the royg would increase to usd 150 million in 2010 including usd 45 million to equip and train ctfocused aviation regiment under the yemeni special operations forces saleh requested that the us provide 12 armed helicopters and train and equip three new republican guard brigades saleh rejected the generals proposal to have usg personnel armed with directfeed intelligence present inside the area of ct operations but agreed to have us fixedwing bombers circle outside yemeni territory ready to engage aqap targets should actionable intelligence become available end summary saleh helicopters helicopters helicopters 2 snf centcom commander general david petraeus accompanied by the ambassador centcom aides the embassy datt and econoff note taker congratulated president saleh on successful operations against aqap during january 2 meeting the general told saleh that he had requested usd 150 million in security assistance for 2010 substantial increase over the 2009 amount of usd 67 million also present were minister of defense mg muhammed nasser ahmad ali and deputy prime minister for defense and security affairs rashad alalimi raising topic that he would manage to insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour and halflong meeting saleh requested that the us provide the royg with 12 armed helicopters possessing such helicopters would allow the royg to take the lead in future ct operations ease the use of fighter jets and cruise missiles against terrorist targets and allow yemeni special operations forces to capture terrorist suspects and identify victims following strikes according to saleh the us could convince saudi arabia and the uae to supply six helicopters each if the american bureaucracy prevented quick approval saleh suggested the general responded that he had already considered the roygs request for helicopters and was in discussions with saudi arabia on the matter we wont use the helicopters in saada i promise only against alqaeda saleh told general petraeus 3 snf saleh agreed to general patraeus proposal to dedicate usd 45 million of 2010 security assistance funds to help establish and train ysof aviation regiment allowing ysof to focus on alqaeda targets and leaving saada air operations to the yemeni air force without giving much detail saleh also requested that the us equip and train three new republican guard brigades totaling 9000 soldiers equipping these brigades would reflect upon our true partnership saleh said the general urged saleh to focus first on the ysof aviation regiment aqap strikes concern for civilian casualties 4 snf saleh praised the december 17 and 24 strikes against aqap but said that mistakes were made in the killing of civilians in abyan the general responded that the only civilians killed were the wife and two children of an aqap operative at the site prompting saleh to plunge into lengthy and confusing aside with deputy prime minister alimi and minister of defense ali regarding the number of terrorists versus civilians killed in the strike comment salehs conversation on the civilian casualties suggests he has not been well briefed by his advisors on the strike in abyan site that the royg has been unable to access to determine with any certainty the level of collateral damage end comment aqap leader nassr alwahishi and extremist cleric anwar alawlaki may still be alive saleh said but the december strikes had already caused alqaeda operatives to turn themselves in to authorities and residents in affected areas to deny refuge to alqaeda saleh raised the issue of the saudi government and jawf governorate tribal sheikh amin alokimi subject that is being reported through other channels shifting airstrike strategies 5 snf president obama has approved providing us intelligence in support of royg ground operations against aqap targets general petraeus informed saleh saleh reacted coolly however to the generals proposal to place usg personnel inside the area of operations armed with realtime direct feed intelligence from us isr platforms overhead you cannot enter the operations area and you must stay in the joint operations center saleh responded any us casualties in strikes against aqap would harm future efforts saleh asserted saleh did not have any objection however to general petraeus proposal to move away from the use of cruise missiles and instead have us fixedwing bombers circle outside yemeni territory out of sight and engage aqap targets when actionable intelligence became available saleh lamented the use of cruise missiles that are not very accurate and welcomed the use of aircraftdeployed precisionguided bombs instead well continue saying the bombs are ours not yours saleh said prompting deputy prime minister alimi to joke that he had just lied by telling parliament that the bombs in arhab abyan and shebwa were americanmade but deployed by the royg room for improvement in milmil relations 6 snf general petraeus praised cooperation between the embassy and the nsb ysof yemeni coast guard ycg and counterterrorism unit ctu but singled out relations with the yemeni air force as problematic only four out of 50 planned us special operations forces command training missions with the yemeni air force had actually been executed in the past year he said saleh said he would personally instruct minister of defense to improve the situation the general also urged saleh to stop yemeni customs habit of holding up embassy cargo at the airport including shipments destined for the royg itself such as equipment for the ctu saleh laughed and made vague pledge to have the customs issue taken care of saleh complained that the royg had not yet received the necessary training to operate 17 iraqi light armored vehicle ilavs provided by the usg in 2008 saying that ysof needed the training in order to use the ilavs for ct operations the general said he would look into having us special operations forces personnel conduct the training 7 snf pointing to the roygs problems in combating rampant drug and arms smuggling saleh told general petraeus that us maritime security assistance was insufficient to cover yemens nearly 2000 km of coastline why not have italy germany holland japan saudi and the uae each provide two patrol boats saleh suggested the general told saleh that two fullyequipped 87foot patrol boats destined for the yemeni coast guard were under construction and would arrive in yemen within year saleh singled out smuggling from djibouti as particularly troublesome claiming that the royg had recently intercepted four containers of djiboutiorigin tnt tell djiboutian president ismail guelleh that i dont care if he smuggles whiskey into yemen provided its good whiskey but not drugs or weapons saleh joked saleh said that smugglers of all stripes are bribing both saudi and yemeni border officials saleh welcomes london conference 8 snf saleh told the general that he welcomed pm gordon browns announcement of the london conference and said that the cooperation on yemen between the us eu saudi arabia and the uae would be benefitial qatar should not be involved however because they work with iran in this regard saleh also identified qatar as one of those nations working against yemen along with iran libya and eritrea 9 u general petraeus did not have an opportunity to clear on this cable seche
