6809c28 class viii tape 5 the standard green form and rudiments and this is what date the twenty eighth of september 1968 lecture number what five glad you can still count thank you very much lecture number five of the standard tech class viii auditors course the situation with regard to standard tech at this time is we have had few mice and i imagine down through the years there will be few other mice bulletin gets altered tape gets pulled off the line some vital action is shifted somebody comes tearing in with brand new idea that seems to be absolutely vitally essential and the first thing you know why we have trouble of one kind or another and tech fails and it suddenly ceases to give the results which it should attain at that time morale goes down scientology doesnt work these are the danger points of the past and of the future it is not unbeknownst to to get proposals such as this through the mail line its proposed hco bulletin there are forty or fifty of these things which have been written and issued and it does seem that person before he is permitted to have grade should go to the examiner to find out if it was an arc broken needle or if it was actually release on the grade he was supposed to be released on and not an fn on something else now ill tell you what does this stem from why why why would such proposal come up standard tech is already out its already out with enthusiasm whats out the trs are would have to be so bonkers that the auditor was not able to attract the attention of the pc for the next grade or action and the pc chortling merrily merrily to himself would be getting an fn from former action you see what could happen here alright weve just released this fellow on zero and he says ooh gosh you know boy that was really some cognition you know needles swinging uh its really going great and the auditor sits there and says aw yaya uh number one it went awaw and it went by and ububuzub and the pc thinking to himself boy thats really great that communication process really great and the auditor says uh why thats release uwuuwuwuw and the pcsaying boy that really i can communicate you know and the auditor says kenya you know nyee canned command trs command impingement on the pc cant operate his emeter anyhow doesnt even notice the pc isnt looking at him uh well its raring too and so forth and the needles going on swing and the pcs saying gee well what do you know about that i really can talk to people you know the only other condition this could occur on is if it was busted emeter now in the first place if its an arc broke needle youre getting the pc sitting here like this duh and the auditor says says catfish gollawong and the pc says awawang yeah oogh nya oog log and the auditor says well im glad thats floating needle and so forth the pc never would answer on any of his questions it could also occur on one of these kooky stage four needles it goes up and does little hitch and goes down you ever heard of stage four needle i saw somebody just go uh whats stage four needle stage four needle is stage beyond three which is dead laughs you can get meter you can get meter on pc and he sits down in session and goes up and hitches and falls and its doing about two inch sweep and it goes up and it goes it hiccups at the top and it goes down and you say have you ever been shot and it does the same thing and whats your name and itll do the same thing and you kick him in the shins and itll do the same thing and theres absolutely meter change of any kind whatsoever it isnt hardly connected to anybody which is really the truth it isnt connected to anybody and it goes on and it does this weird dance well if person doesnt know what one of those needles is as far as an arc broke needle is you can get swinging needle it isnt connected to anybody either and the questions which you ask dont change it in ordinary auditing an fn broadensnarrows responds just to that degree you start overrunning it youll see your fn is going narrower and narrower and narrower and narrower and it packs up pc you get an fn and then the pc has the cognition he actually states the cognition on which he gets an fn and you see the fn widen up in other words an auditord have to be complete dolt to need such an arbitrary on his lines now this is based on the fact that somebody has trained some auditor in an academy on the trs something on this basis what is tr0 its the tr in the book you and i think i heard about it good fine you passed now whats tr1 thats the number of the other tr good what are the rest of the trs oh i know all them and that would all he could possibly know about trs to require such regulation one of the conditions of auditing is that you have the pc in session he has to be aware of the auditor and in communication and answer up and so forth well if he wasnt doing any of these things naturally you would have to send him to the examiner to find out if it was real fn but the situation would be so peculiar but to stop everybody everywhere from ever progressing in session just because some supervisor hasnt been able to teach an auditor to audit and just because theres been one pc last may who went all the way through the lines with stage four needle and nobody ever noticed that he didnt know he had ever been audited and didnt know hed ever been in session just to introduce that sort of an arbitrary would of course be completely nuts inspection before the fact is the standard line if youre not having trouble on some line dont do anything about it if you are having trouble on some line do something about it and it follows in auditing too youre having trouble with the pc well you do something about it now when i berate and start tearing you apart for wanting nickel in the slottype approach to auditing it is because you are asking for something which will make you rotten auditor if you dont know what youre doing and if you dont know what the standard action would be for that you ought to go back and study your trs and few other things it wouldnt be an occasion then to put regulation in after the fact of not having trained somebody do you see now there are rote commands which are the standard processes but you receive an order something like rehab former lifetime releases now what the hell do you wants what now how could anybody under gods green earth write down all the words that would have to fit in the ensuing action they couldnt it couldnt be done because it wouldnt fit all the cases because there are many different types of former lifetime releases or this lifetime releases and you see what youre doing is rehabbing former releases so you say rehab former releases well how would you go about finding these things auditor that is your problem and if you cant solve that with the pc sitting in front of you you ought to quit do you see what youre doing you have to know what youre doings and then do it with great economy and then if the session is running like an express train whatre you going to do inspect after the fact every couple seconds now ill give you an idea you know do you have an arc break that reads uh oh yeah uh yeah i was feeling pretty bad yesterday i got letter very bad ok was it break in r c u u that reads yeah i couldnt understand any part of it good c d i using the words to somebody who isnt educated curious curious about what it was curious about the understanding of it yeah thats right hey yeah thats you know what i thought it was the stuff in the letter it wasnt in the letter i never could dig it i i didnt dig it wow skin tone looks good good indicators everything is fine and the needle goes whumwhum fn now youre going to say do you have an arc break did that floating needle float on the arc break cognition which you had mmmm youre not going to say anything about it at all youre going to say youre needles floated thats it thank you now your fn is now in on the rudiments which are simply setting the pc up then you simply swing into the session now because therere this many variables you would now have to say it didnt clean see so do you have an earlier arc break of similar nature or do you have an earlier similar arc break did you have one like that before man were talking about communication were not talking about words you have to know what youre after youre after the arc break similar to this which occurred before now it doesnt matter what language you say it in as long as it communicates to the pc and you know what you want otherwise youre liable to get something kooky you want similar earlier arc break you got it now supposing youre auditing some guy supposing youre busy auditing some guy and he doesnt know what the word arc break is or suppose hes got complete misdefinition of the thing he thinks an arc break is an overt or something he busted when he was kid youre going to have to know what you are asking for so that you can communicate it as an auditor as an auditor you are trying to communicate thought or sense now why should anybody try to escape his responsibility on the whole subject to the degree of wanting canned word by which to ask perfectly ordinary routine question if you know your business you dont have to have those now on the grade processes yes you had better know those words exact exact exact because theyre very carefully worked out but again you cant administer grade process if you dont know what youre asking for its your job as an auditor to to to deliver it to the pc to receive the answer and know what the hell to do with it and there isnt anybody under gods green earth can give you whole bunch of canned balderdash that does your job for you now ill point something out to you i have already done quite enough without also writing all the words you use now that is not wide open invitation that every time you get yourself into corner you suddenly shift processes now recognize the difference between process and question theres fantastic width between process and question im going to give you kooky one i read in folder you can have an infinity of wrongnesses but some of them are funnier than others you say that this auditor said to the preclear do you have present time problem and the preclear said oh yes good what postulate created that problem good now what counter postulate met that problem good now what postulate created that problem and the funny part of it is that the ta sort of went up and the session all went to pieces because i think the problem was that his chair was tippy and it didnt have anything whatsoever to do with any problem it had to do with the auditor didnt clear the environment in the first place see hes actually asking the he had some canned idea he got this from someplace i dont know where that you clear up problems by what postulate did you make what counter postulate did you make now he of course is taking the definition of problem is postulate counter postulate he tried to audit this by definition but note that is was also in the wrong part of the session he didnt notice that the pc was sitting there almost falling out of his chair because one leg was busted now this is one hell of an awful lousy level of awareness if you want to even dignify it by calling it level of awareness so the auditors supposed to be there hes supposed to be on the ball and hes supposed to do what hes supposed to do in order to come down on certain exact line and keep the pc herded on to that line so we know that it would be the most fatal to audit over an arc break you audit over an arc break its an absolute law its nobodys opinion i assure you you audit pc over an arc break hell go eventually into the sad effect yet at saint hill one time i saw pc who had been walking around for three months with an arc break that people had audited in every session over the top of she was in grief she was in complete sad effect she was an absolute text book case of sad effect and there wasnt one single person there ever asked her if she had an arc break of long duration until i noticed this character walking around and i got an auditor by the scruff of the neck and i said pull the arc break of long duration would you please and he did so and the case cheered up and everything was great you see therere certain things that are meaningful like an arc break audited over the top of puts the pc into sad effect and there arent any exceptions and it is rule and it is law and any time the law is disobeyed you cut your throat as an auditor and the pcs throat so you always pick up your arc break as the first thing in the session cause its completely fatal to audit somebody over the top of now the person who has the arc break who says he doesnt have an arc break has had somebody tell him he did have an arc break when he didnt he protested and since that time arc broke has read and an educated auditor asks him immediately for did anybody ever tell you you had an arc break when you didnt cleans up the false read or this reverse thing can happen more rarely more rarely but it can happen he said do you have an arc break doesnt read the auditor says thats clean and the pc says the hell it is so the auditor says on arc breaks has anything been suppressed and you get the suppress off now you say do you have an arc break and the pc says yeah that was my arc break people never taking up my arc breaks so it now doesnt read but the pc is cheerful about it so it can be positive or negative but your educated auditor your educated auditor takes this up this is something he takes up he doesnt sit there like damn bump on the log waiting for the next piece of telex tape to pass through his skull auditing is something that is understood you only get into fire fights over pcs if you dont know what youre doing so we dont ever audit over an arc break and we never leave false read on and we never leave false noread on we handle it now the next thing we take up is present time problem and present time problem means present time problem the problem the pc has now problem which he does have you never get into any trouble about this or definition it comes up or it doesnt come up and the reason we take up present time problem is very elementary indeed as you will not ever change case that is audited over the top of present time problem you wont do him any harm but youre never going to get any change he doesnt change and that is proved by graph after graph after graph after graph after graph dozens dozens dozens dozens dozens hundred of pcs i finally traced it back and isolated exactly what is was that gave an unchanging graph the presence of present time problem work was done in 55 56 washington change so you going to audit this guy over present time problem well then youre going to audit him to change where you going to get an fn youre not wherere you going to get the ta doing anything youre not what you trying to do cut your throat alright similarly you asked him if he has present time problem and he says you say that reads and he says oh not againl god damn every time i get into session and i try to get auditing done why that reads and so on i suppose i have got present time problem and you say alright has anybody ever said that you had present time problem when you didnt have one oh my god yesl bdabdadadababbdabdadadabab bdeedeebdeedee bdada and so on and so on and so on and i never can get into the body of the session because they all say theres present time problem with the ruds and so forth and all dbababa powpow powpowpowpowpow pow fn you say the needle floated were going to take up whatever were going to take up now the reverse can be true more rarely that you say do you have present time problem that doesnt read funny you see him look little puzzled just but very often wont say puzzled it didnt read look little bit baffled and you could say well should it have read oh yeah gee you know i just have been served with writ for federal income tax from the eskimos and so on and boy its problem because i dont know any eskimos anyway you say alright on the present time problem has anything been suppressed yeah yeah i have to suppress it if i dont suppress it ill never get anything done it doesnt clean up is there an earlier time you suppressed problem anything you care to say at this particular time do you want to tell more about the eskimos or any damn thing you care to say its itsa or earlier green form rule is invariable it is itsa or earlier or listing process thats all you ever do on green form itsa earlier or listing process and therere certain things on the green form which you list says environment alright if theres something wrong with the environment do remedy b if hes connected to suppressive person or suppressive group anything in that department that comes up on the green form you do an s and d continuous present time overts comes up you do the prevent process you say what about all black doesnt that require some special process not necessarily i dont care if the pc goes on being all black if he wants to be all black thats alright with do you follow but the pc is you didnt follow the pc is worrying about his grades hes worrying about his field hes worried about this or hes worried about that so itll clean up on itsa and earlier yeah yeah everything i see is black i dont ever see anything i close my eyes and its all black and so on did you ever notice this earlier yes yeah alright when was that oh i dont know spokane what was going on then oh thats right we ran this engram and everything went black huh what do you know needle goes voomp fn what the hell are you doing something complicated for its itsa or earlier that is the law of the green form on certain points of the green form you do list so itsa or earlier if it doesnt clean on itsa it cleans on earlier now i can see you putting together beautiful rote process knock it off what you have to know is itsa or earlier now how do you ask for itsa knock it off do you have present time problem oh yeah my god im about to lose my job and oh wow and so on and then how will i meet my alimony payments because oh my god you know woo wow or do you have present time problem read is there an earlier similar problem didnt clean on itsa so you gotta go earlier and you can run it back back back back and all of sudden youve got it you got it back to basic then you have to know your mechanics dont you you have to know the composition of the mind you have to know that you have to reach the basic point where the chain started in order to get total freedom on the total chain you have to know that you dont just know itsa or earlier you have to know why how come you run it earlier well if it doesnt free late on the chain you theres an earlier on the chain to make it free if it does free late on the chain it hasnt got any basic under it or its simply tripped off and released at that particular point youve made him think the right thought that moved him off the mass simple too simple it is so simple that it is the most easily misunderstood thing anybody can think of in the first place youre trying to teach somebody something about something they very well may have reactive bank now when you say present time problem there are so many people that say oh yes ive got present time problem and they miss the rest of the sentence and youre trying to teach them this you restimulate em problem i brought up one here in yesterdays lecture and i said the incredible can hang up track and two students only learned this about it that it applied to them and i didnt tell them because it applied to them and i couldnt care less that it applied to them do you understand i taught them that because it applies to other cases and i am talking to an auditor not case there is rule about this very broad rule about this that in later years has been violated auditors and students do not have cases when we first found out they had cases and thought they had cases was about thirteen years ago and it became illegal while being student and while being an auditor it is very violently illegal to have case you dont have one at that time thats it do you understand those are the facts of life we had gag here happen the other day somebody says youre late why did you arrive and the person said i need review because ive got an arc break how can anybody get up to class vi and not know that student doesnt have case students dont have cases so when im trying to communicate to you im not talking about your bank to hell with your bank i am not talking out of my bank as philosophers and experts in this line have only done for the last four or five quadrillion years so you can pay the compliment of not listening through yours its very remarkable to have principles which came up way the hell and gone back on the track of dianetics and scientology principles of the early years they still hold good they hold so good that they function at ot8 fantastic the stuff which is being taught to the lowest grade auditor is valid all the way through to ot8 fantastic so when youre learning simplicity of this character you are learning simplicity of this character nobodys trying to solve your case nobodys even trying to give you cognition im just telling you what the hot dope is those three things those three things that are absolutely completely impossible to audit over the top of include the withhold so youve got arc break ptp and withhold you will never get away with it and neither will the pc nothing how many ways can you pull withhold you can pull them the easy way you can pull them the hard way i have pulled withholds by moving my chair over in front of the door and said its perfectly ok i can sit here the rest of the night i am going to hear it but that was after i checked it over to make sure that it was real withhold that it wasnt false read that the symptoms and manifestations of the withhold were very very present and the pc wasnt going to tell his withhold well i knew damn well there was reason to proceed beyond that point i would just be wasting my time so i would just simply say well i can sit here the rest of the night until you tell theres another system which is highly workable alright good we will sort this out on the meter youre not going to give the withhold well sort this out on the meter have you murdered somebody good where did you bury the body have you robbed bank do you strangle children are you rapist by prof oh god nothing like that alright what is it like oh well i just so and so and so and so huh im short twenty five dollars today in my cashiers till and cant find it and i didnt want to tell anybody in other words you exaggerate the withhold but thats after youve made sure that it is withhold theres false read in connection of it connection with it it is withhold it does read now there is slight danger about rock slams which turn on on withholds occasionaly is you can get them off with invalidate while theyre still hot now you can turn off rock slam by putting in the button invalidate on it it doesnt mean the persons innocent youve just cooled off the rock slam now the person may be innocent but when you put in invalidate then you also have to put in suppress you cant just put in invalidate and have it cool off without then also putting in suppress to find out was it just smush out rock slam is basically an invalidation therefore if you invalidate somebody hard enough on some subject he can turn on rock slam an invalidative question asked with sufficient ferocity can itself turn on rock slam it can be done but that isnt all the rock slams there are we had criminal i use the word advisedly because it wasnt very big criminal but nevertheless criminal just the other day that had rock slam we cooled it off with invalidate and then it didnt read and she was supposed to have stolen hundred dracma it didnt read it exhonerated her she even had two hundred dracma on her and then few weeks later thousand dracma disappeared and she had it too many coincidences the rock slam actually was perfectly accurate the person was thief but it did cool off with invalidate so remember if you cool rock slam off with invalidate youve also got to put suppress and notis and few other things in and make sure that you dont turn it back on again your job as an auditor is not to turn off rock slams or turn them on it is to discover the truth theres any gods quantity of ways you can approach the whole subject of withhold there have been many bulletins concerning it an auditor if he understands what withhold is all about is all about he can handle withholds now missed withhold is what is in the rudiments so you have to not only detect that it exists but you have to find where and when it was missed and i see folder after folder where it says do you have missed withhold the auditor says yeah yep i stole pin from hasi good that cleans the question we will now go to the body of the session pc doesnt think anything natters bleblopbloopjep doesnt even repeat the question doesnt ask who nearly found out nothing just missing do you follow so this is is kooky kookyruds see now you wonder why you havent if you havent flown the needle by the time youve got to missed withhold and you wonder why it doesnt fly on missed withhold its just that the where and when by whom it was missed has been omitted you have to know the theory of rudiment it is not enough to know rote now we go down into other matters but frankly from there on youre on safe ground youre on safe ground nobodys gonna do anything very weird now the only violations of this is taking up the obvious arc break the guy was given wrong item hes arc broken about it in the last session pc is arc broken after the session the session consisted of listing for an item he obviously has wrong item the longer you spend asking if he has an arc break the more of fool you are obviously hes got an arc break because that is what wrong item causes an arc break you look in the folder there are eighteen items reading on the list and hes given an item that he didnt list and the auditor gave him the item do you know that was the first trouble on lists we always have trouble on lists first trouble on lists was the auditor suggesting items to the pc weve come further than that now weve only come as far as it doesnt matter whether hes given wrong item or not but this is important the lads got an obvious arc break because youre repairing the last session which had wrong item youre repairing 5a and you find the third bd item was the one he was given if you get hold of this guy wrrrr now youre going to put in ruds to correct the item aw dont be an ass see if you know your business and you know you know your business you know that wrong item off list is going to have produced an arc broken pc and if you ask for the arc break he is seldom sufficiently technically oriented to know that that is the source of the arc break so of course you cant pull it so you can box around for an hour and half auditing across the known arc break just busting him to pieces so of course you handle the known arc break if it wasnt an arc break alright so the pc comes into session alright in the last session we see we had list here it runs 118 pages oh yeah yes we have this list and howd you feel about that oh god almighty oooh well i wish to indicate to you the list was over listed alright were going to check this list now was it the first item bong alright thats good that was the first item on the list your item is free fall thank you very much ok good indicators come in you now say rudiments do you follow i saw session there is session in the case folders there that is in complete howl the pc was sent in by cs to have wrong item corrected and the auditor asked for an arc break and it goes on for column after column because the pc is insufficiently educated to know hes arc broken because hes got wrong item it goes on and on well they pull more arc breaks without getting anywhere because pulling arc breaks over the existence of the arc break can also be painful it goes on for pages wound the pc right up in the rag bag so the rudiments now that doesnt in any way violate the rudiments the guy walks into session saying oh my god what am i going to do oh my god what am i going to do he sits down in the chair oh my god what am i going to do picks up the cans my god what am i going to do you would be very very foolish auditor if you didnt say do you have present time problem elementary you dont q and on other things then the rudiments however pc comes into session and says well i suppose you think youre going to do something with heheheh myanyayaya you think youre an auditor do you and so forth my response to that is there you go there are the cans do you have missed withhold pongl booml something wrong oh im sweetness and light as matter of fact i did have little withhold i stole pin once from hasi good thank you very much do you have withhold yeah i ate your lunch you know something like that well itll be obvious and having handled that one naturally then you go back through your actions now this is an auditor who knows his business there is folder that runs like this do you have an arc break yeah theyre doing us all in everybodys caving us in lately were sure getting shot down in flames and so on im really arc broken about it boy what theyre doing to us and the auditor like god damned fool sat there for the next i dont know how long continuing to ask for arc breaks and finally finished up the session asking for arc breaks because he couldnt clean arc breaks well it was very remarkable he couldnt clean up arc breaks because the pc didnt have one the pc had missed withhold and was calling it an arc break and hell notice in the old bulletins and so forth says very often it occurs that when you have an arc break it is really missed withhold the one thing i had hard time teaching class vi students way back when was that they dont accept everything the pc says in violation of tech he says oh theyre doing in and all that last auditor he cut my throat from ear to ear and that is all bad yes i have terrible arc break because everything theyre doing in you see and theyre really pretty nasty to and thats off pmfodf fddouf gobbldy gobbldy gobbldy gob critical missed withhold pcs inevitably because its more socially acceptable will call missed withhold an arc break so if the arc break doesnt clean hes got missed withhold very simple but it isnt something you wreck the pc with all of this is were traveling now in auditing and couple of thousand miles an hour at least were not traveling with that old fan job piper cub fan job anymore dont you see if you know your business its nya nya nya now good do you have missed withhold zoom thank you very much now do you have thats clean do you have missed withhold thats clean good do you have an arc break thats good ptp thats fine alright didnt fn green form now youve just asked these four questions so are you live being or fool are you now going to ask those same questions again on the green form all youre going to ask about is environment you having trouble in your environment and then youre going to bring it down to overts and motivators because you just got through covering them do you understand and you get down the line and you suddenly find out that this pc has had an overrun and you straighten up the overrun and the needle flies good now you can get on with what you were supposed to do in the first place thats the way it goes with speed it isnt any fumblebumble stumblebumble i wonder whatts wrong with this pc if you ever think that thought as case supervisor youre an ass i can tell you whats wrong with pc hes humanoid that questions answered dont ever worry about it again on diagnosis if you want to use such word the pc is as he is because he hasnt made the next grade now lets set him up and correct any earlier errors so that he can make his next grade we dont go into figurefigure because hes got pain in his side pc comes in he says i have this awful pain in my side oh terrible pain so on hes just walking invitation boy for you to go kooky hes issuing an engraved invitations to the examiner and everybody else connected with it the two things that can be wrong with him are the auditing hes had needs correcting or he should be on the next grade and that sure requires hell of lot of you as case supervisor doesnt it honest papall spank you if he ever catches you pulling this line well hes got this awful pain in his side i wonder what it is i can tell you what it is its either the living hes had or the auditing hes had isnt sitting well on his reactive brisket which can be corrected he should be doing the next grade its always the next grade thats all the think you do you can know more doggone things about pcs you can run complete intelligence service on pcs you know they are this and that and woffawoffawoffle well it does you some good dont think that it doesnt it does you some good because it tells you what you just solved you dont have to know what youre trying to solve before you solve it this fellow was hop head bank robber spent the first five years of his life in cast his uh do you see was premedical school student and was expelled uh so forth and etcetera and etcetera and for twenty two years studied yogi see and youve got this list see and you say wow see and by the time you get him up to grade iv hes flying and you say boy look what i did thats actually most of the use of it you can get this kind of situation where you know that the pc is lithuanian and doesnt speak english and has been audited by dane who didnt speak lithuanian your problem as an auditor is to find is to find lithuanian auditor your problem as cs is to find lithuanian auditor ive had that here the other day had that here the other day managed it too we were embarrassed one time along side of dock somebodyd been handing out hand outs talking about scientoiogy and some guy showed up and he wanted to be audited on his grade processes and he only spoke one language actually i think we did get him some auditing on his grade processes he just showed up out of the blue demanding his auditing couldnt speak english nothing recently recently you talk about standard tech and the quality of auditors and so on we had an auditor who was absolutely the worlds most experienced killer this auditor was class vi but had never audited anybody with any great degree of success and had in the main neglected one certain an especial pc and this pc had been especially he wasnt pc even he had never been audited he was the one who had given over all the money for all of her training her grades everything but she had never paid it back with single grade so she was asking some favor of and i said yes and at that moment she was balled and chained on the whole subject some of you are liable to take that literally it was actually only forbidden to leave and i said you for the first time are going to really learn what grade process is and youre going to run every single one of those processes and youre going to run them perfectly and youre going to produce results because as of this minute you have certs and awards of any kind whatsoever and you get em back just as fast as you put that pc together each grade he makes you get your cert back on that grade took him all the way through to power the guy was absolutely flying you couldnt recognize him at all it was almost over her dead body that shed do this she didnt like him i think but all of sudden he made it all the way she made it all the way all came out right in the end she wasnt auditing on her own determinism laughs thats how exact and good standard tech can be it was quite remarkable it was remarkable feat its much more than i tell you in just this little thing it was win of years duration years duration its great now what did she have to do she had to do exactly nothing but exactly what i told her to do and if she so much as wiggled her little finger god help her and even though she was unwilling to audit him even though she didnt even like the guy even though so on and so on it all came right on up the line therefore the processes which youre using can easily easily easily bypass mere objection you see youre not dealing with let us assume the ibis position you are not dealing with if you take vitamin day the dogs will go away youre not dealing with bunch of old wives tales youre dealing with something that is hot as ninety foot circumference buzz saw you got to learn how to run this buzz saw cause itll go right straight up the line you dont monkey with this buzz saw you do exactly what the buzz saw says and if somebody under your direction doesnt do what the buzz what you say and does something else well you just turn the buzz saw in to hlm little bit sideways you make it go you make it go right and it will go you can make it go right in the most impossible situations you ever heard of as long as you keep the guy right on the main highway youve got channels and edges on that road he cant go into the ditch you mustnt let him go into the ditch there is an infinity of ditch to go into there is only one road so therefore the approaches to session are simply the approaches ive been giving you there arent other approaches to the session you really cant audit covertly wawafafaawagaaw i can give you an infinity of other circumstances these are the things which you handle with session and you dont go anyplace with session unless youve got those things handled now the grade processes you go up the line through have just about as much choice in wording as though they were branded four feet deep on concrete wall there is variation not the faintest variation clearing the command the exact command the exact administration of the process the exact end phenomena it is drill of tremendous precision and that is what youre leading up to when you get those rudiments in and so forth youre leading to this moment where the next grade is to be done and then youve got him all set up and you do just exactly that you tell him what it is you clear the command you get make sure that he knows the command and pollyvolly and he goes on through he doesnt miss and you fumblebumble i wonder where the where is the trim knob wheres the directions for the emeter its hcob lets see the grade chart what are the commands for level 1 and so on this meters terribly new meter just take ive seen it on the he wont go up the highway any fumblebumble at all any slightest any slightest wigglewoggle and indecision and have to think to get the datum and and so forth it there is goes you havent got it i mean theyre not it you havent got the session you havent got the preclear he didnt go anyplace you got it its like marksman marksman hes trying to find the trigger on the rifle where is the trigger wheres the trigger you think hes ever going to hit any bulls eyes so here you have the variability of the rudiments the variabilities involved in setting up case the variabilities by which you can run green form or run an l4a or an l1 and in each of those you just get the thing done somehow and the rule is uniformly it sets itself right by itsa or it goes earlier you can on such thing as l1 indicate the bpc reads you can indicate the bpc but you would be very foolish person indeed to be indicating the bpc on something you didnt know what the pc had just read on cause it might be false read you always have to find out what it is which is itsa now you could indicate the bpc in the matter now that that would take it out of the line you can indicate the bpc very complexly theres an old bulletin there that tells you how to indicate bpc oh my god its perfectly ok to do it that way but thats that body of auditing now those are the body of auditing of repair now you also have to know what the process was to know what you are repairing see now that is working with the pc to set it right and that is usually backwards look and you dont do review actions to get case gains only one thing to the contrary and thats ot4 it is now review action because the whole rundown it can get so damn many gains for the guy that there have to be done at ot4 before he starts ot5 that its just review action now only its really not review action its sort of tech action but you start sending people to review its because they cant get on the next process all my life ive had this heavy feeling in my stomach well you send the guy to review why is anything wrong with his auditing theres nothing wrong with his auditing whats wrong with him is his stomach well does that mean scientology wont handle things like this yes scientologyll handle things like this itll handle on the next grade or two sometimes it handles on the next grade and then then drifts sort of back and then two or three grades later or sections later all of sudden he runs into it head on and it does solve then for gods sakes see but youre not auditing the significances and peculiarities of individuals these are infinite in number you have the main road why are you running up and down these little side paths any of the grades will handle anything so to hell with it i mean walking up the grade line will eventually handle anything but anything you dont have to have process that handles this and process that handles that dont get yourself associated with little doctor that has little pill case there are pink pills green pills orange pills and blue pills now if the individual has toothache you give him green pill and so forth waffa waffa waffa well youre not in that business youre not in that business well there are undoubtedly processes which might do him this and that and the other thing you could straighten this and that and the other thing out but the truth of the matter is on your main line of auditing on your main line of auditing its always grade action that handles the pc now there are certain actions that run through the entirety one secondary running engram running and arc breaks also missed withholds and also ptps run all the way from hundred lifetimes ago to ot8 those processes still remain valid still remain valid well the faults i find with scientologists is they very often will see somebody fall on his head get run over by truck and do some kind of light touch assist and say thats that and then wonder why the guy is limping and then they sort of say scientology doesnt work man ive got word for you that auditor is afraid of work do you see an engram could be run at any time but then this isnt review action it comes under the heading of an assist its engram running as an assist now you say well god if engram running can be done as an assist what couldnt you do oh yes thats right you can always run an engram you can always run secondary i dont care where the grade is but i got news for you know how to run it know how to run engrams the funniest thing engrams dont run if you dont know how to run engrams i get so disgusted looking at somebody who allegedly knows how to run engrams or know how to run secondaries this is an actual one and he says recall moment of loss recall of moment of loss and i looked at the thing and i said what the hell were you doing what were you doing in this session what were you doing what what the hell was going on what what what what is this whats this it was running secondary suffering godfrey if thats gotten into the line up holy christ now you see the truth of the matter is that you can take thing like secondary which is in present time near present time the individuals got all of his restimulators for it and you can key it out to fn snap just like that and then the person walks around the corner and meets joe who is associated with it and it keys back in just like that and then you can as an auditor give the guy slight recall of it and it keys out to fn snap just like that and he can go around another corner and he runs into restimulator of it and it thump back in just like that and you can just keep this up eventually itll wear out but i call to your attention that it is about the slowest possible method i know of of running secondary now i have had to pick up two cases two cases who in actual fact were severely severely bogged on an assist level of secondary and engram running that auditors had stood right in front of them sat down in the auditing chair asked them what it was all about and the individual is all boggled up it comes under the heading of secondary can make somebody so depressed that they feel physically ill they feel old its peculiarity they feel energyless and old and used up and so on and youre in to audit this see youre trying to audit this and youre trying to audit this oh nothing flies there isnt any reason to run anything on the thing why well the guy she just lost her husband he isnt even cold in the ground and some damn fool auditor will say do you recall your moment of loss and so forth yes i guess i do oh good that fnd oh yes i feel much better yes i feel much better shell feel that much better for the next ten or fifteen minutes dont you see what you have to know is the mechanism of release and an auditor that does this sort of things damn fool now good auditor would say now wait minute this characters was doing all right really fell on her head you understand im talking to you about an exception from grade auditing these are the things that can go the whole line see but whats messed up lifes gotta be corrected see some its gone this way in life see theres been life intervention of magnitude that has driven this person off and you can get the idea that if the cannon ball came along and blew off your pcs head he wouldnt be able to make the next grade he wouldnt be there to hold the cans well id say at that exaggerated level its the same thing when person was an innocent bystander and all of sudden why they had this big secondary occur bombo big loss of some kind or another and ive had good auditor good auditor if he was on the ball and he knew his business and so forth he wouldnt ask questions about this or something like that he he would know this and the cs would be informed she just lost her husband and the cs would say alright get in your ruds and run the secondary of death only please that would be run the secondary of death run it run its the first moment he enters the incident what is the duration of the incident and so forth when did you first hear in the news of the subject you know bong what is the duration of the incident alright move through the incident and so on just like it says in the handbook and you go through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and you spill few gallons and quarts of tears and misemotion comes up theres such thing as fear secondary i was terrified the guy was terrified hes been in state of shock hes dead white ever since he can run terror secondary perfectly easy to do this but life has knocked him sideways you can put him back on the line alright he didnt get up high enough to get his grades fast enough in order to keep life from knocking him in the head and to this degree you can give him an assist and straighten him out another person was given an s and d and i dont know what all to straighten out severe illness i got hold of the pc found the pcd been ill asked the pc whats she been doing told at once ran him to the first moment of the incident ran him through it zoom zoom zoom zoom that was the end of the illness and one of the one of the lazy part of this problem however is do you know it can take nine hours to run secondary it can take ten or twelve hours to run real engram you only run it to fn of course but running it it doesnt just key out it erases you are now dealing with the category of clearing youre erasing the engram youre erasing the secondary thats different alright ill give you the circumstances this is an assisttype action the individual was doin all right they were gain on up the line and they stepped under truck now youve got to get him back on the main line again how do you do that well you can give them contact assist taking him to that place if it is necessary to where the accident happened and make him touch that place and so forth with the part of the body that was hurt touch the object that hurt them and work on it on contact assist just directly one right after the other always the best type of assist is that contact assist and the somatic runs out you wait for the somatic to run out and so on it runs out when it runs out and bang that is it if you cant get him to that place and so on you run touch assist and the touch assist is run with feel that finger and so on and if the injury was very severe indeed after youve done the touch assist little bit later you come along and you run the engram and that is complete assist now how come were knocking off all of sudden this business of running the engram cause the person might it might go past an fn now let assure you youd have to be completely ignorant of the phenomena of an fn an fn occurs when the person disconnects from the masses connected with something he ceases to make them and ceases to be there and he disconnects from them alright so he gets an fn now you can disconnect person from his whole bank which is greats which is great and that is what is called release its release of this type and release of that type and the central things you have to disconnect to bring him up the lines are the grade processes right to five so find out what youre doing youre just making him disconnect thats all the only grades that that is not true on are secondaries and engrams youre erasing something there now hes gain on up the line and only when he gets to clear do you find the final mechanism as far as he is concerned and why hes doing it what hes doing that isnt the end of it but his bank at that moment or what he knows of in his bank goes brrrroooom erased gone now its the difference between this ashtray ceasing to exist gone completely and the ashtray simply being put off release is the ashtray being put away gone ashtray is an erased ashtray gone secondary is an erased secondary so you can actually do this you can key out secondary longer thinks that kind of thing you key out secondary and you can say well to key it out again would be an overrun oh thats so true to key it out before it had keyed in again would be an overrun and to go on keying out something that has been keyed out would be an overrun but do you know that you can key it out turn right around and plunge him right straight into it again and run it without the slightest consequences the ta doesnt go up nothing the proof of the pudding of this whole thing is whats the behavior of the meter now this is the only time you can go by an fn that is two different processes one youre releasing and the others going to clear it so you could get release on this engram and then erase it now itd be much to your horror if you found out actually at the moment of release he had also sort of blown it he had done both actions at once then you might be little embarrassed but ive never seen it happen so you could get release on secondary alright her husbands dead alright good husbands dead now what are we gonna to do were gonna recall moment of loss good floating needle shes saying oh thank heaven i feel so much better and she goes home and she opens up her drawer to get out her powder puff and theres his watch gaa well your release did her some good but she could come right back to you in session and you could do the exact same thing as before and get her to recall finding his watch and itd key out and you go floating needle again and then she could go home and open the closet and find his hat and this could just keep up ad nauseas she could keep keying it in and you could keep keying it out do you see then such things about the fellow has had wreck in this car and he drives to work in it every morning its repaired and he goes on driving to work in it every morning and the next thing you know he develops this horrible neuralgia on the side of his head well its restimulated all the time now if he drove it long enough and restimulated it hard enough and was in it often enough and went past the place frequently enough where he had the accident it would run the engram it wouldnt just key it out it would actually well the familiarity and so on and would just sort of run it out he is hes running through it every time he goes about anything so gone you know oooh and then he sees little picture go by and then that kind of hell keep doing this do you see well so you have to choose whether or not this is an assist action which is necessary by reason of the restimulators of the environment so person can only be released now when hes released on communications he doesnt release from one engram lets look at this he doesnt release from one secondary he doesnt release from one specific action he actually may very well be releasing from hundreds of trillions of years of such actions all in an own little flicker of an eye now the length of time it would take to key that back in because hes not on those planets anymore hes not even in that space and time hes not even in that era anymore so its very valid release indeed itll take quite while to key that one back in do you see so hes having difficulties with problems and all of sudden he has cognition that just roars on the whole track it isnt even that he can think on the subject of the whole track but he suddenly has change of mind concerning the subject of problems christ how long is it going to take to key that back in again man youd really have to bail this guy under to do that do you see now you see why the releases are valid but why releasing guy from specific instance in an engram that has to do with injury and unconsciousness or secondary that has to do with loss you see how these things differ they differ they differ considerably now as cs you are going to have this sort of situation this individual has had something happen to him in life is driven off the line and youre going to have to order that the engram of it be found and erased and you would only err if the auditor erred now one of the little bits and pieces thats missing off the line is that if secondary on the second run through becomes more solid you have to send the pc with the same procedure to the earlier secondary to an earlier secondary and if that secondary by the second pass through it running the pc through it becomes more solid and begins to become more solid you have to send him to an earlier secondary the test is that is becomes more solid and if you dont do that and if you dont know that you can wrap pc around telegraph pole but i notice that it is missing from the rundown on engram running by chains in this dianetic auditors course book at this time and it is being reinserted into the book and is the subject of at this moment is the subject of hcob 28 september 68 class viii im carefully inspecting back bulletins to find out whats been missed whats disappeared out on the line up and that for some reason or others disappeared on the second pass through if it gets more solid you go to the earlier incident now that doesnt mean you go from secondary to an earlier engram it means you go from secondary to an earlier secondary to an earlier secondary to an earlier secondary on the engram line you go from an engram to an earlier engram to an earlier engram and ive got news for you this isnt just this isnt just for only for your little guy whos doing an assist this is the only way youre going to solve some section threes and section three is going to have to be audited just that way so you better get hotter than pistols running engrams none on three is this lifetime injury which has impacted all the bodythetans into one chunk and is handled by running that engram loosens them all up and away they go now you can run three there is case there is case there never has been case that has none on three that had one on three that had two on three that had five on three such cases there isnt any case that suddenly read the instructions and all of sudden whee they all went away and he didnt have to do anything after that bullshit so you have to know engram running and you have to be damn good engram runner because that engram is gonna run like bitch youre really gonna have to have session control to handle it cause all the time pcll be telling you well i dont know why youre doing this its just evaluation on the whole thing because that really has nothing to do with hes just talking out of the basic incident all the way he isnt protesting the auditor hes talking out of the basic incident and you roll it right on down the line and smasho bingo thud there is an exact rundown which you will have oh looks to like you better get very familiar with this ole process known as running engrams as far as running secondaries is concerned you can have somebody around and this arc break is so thoroughly encysted in grief and so forth that you can key it out and it keys in you key it out and it keys in you get tired of it after while run the secondary where is it what is it person comes into session every time with howling arc break in grief and all upset cleaned up and got review three days from now gonna do the same thing clean it all up goes fn she feels great few days later feels terrible is all very sad you look for arc break of long duration youre liable to find yourself sitting there holding onto secondary roll up your sleeves and audit why be lazy run it establish what it is because it wont itll just keep releasing and coming back and releasing and coming back and this becomes one of these weird cases that you really cant quite do anything with or for dont you see rocketybockety its one of its one of the types that are very difficult to do anything for they keep getting caught up in this present time situation but if it were out of this lifetime i wouldnt bother with it id leave that for seven eight way up the line see when they can handle such things but you find out two years ago she was doing all right the case was doing all right and then all of sudden she vwaff waff waff and theres period there and that has been handled before and its handled before and its somebody ran it before and so forth so you just roll up your sleeves and you run it and that is the only real criticism i have of modern auditor youre perfectly willing to learn im willing to take responsibility for the fact that some guys hooked things out of the line up and so on but the one thing i cant understand why you would omit from your repertoire would be secondary and engram running for good good solid nothing but secondary and engram running running em to free needle of course stopping them when you get the free needle theyre gone theyre erased naturally you run em through you get the free needle only that time that needle damn it will stay free after youve freed up the needle four or five times on the same subject i should think youd get the word run it the persons gonna keep falling on their head the reason why you shouldnt shouldnt drop it out of your repertoire if you want advertising pieces its pieces on whom you have run secondary or an engram that is close to pt because their before and after is extreme and hes going around looking like he was an old lady about ninety years old and creeping about and so forth and hes been digged in this way ever since the house burned down and she lost her all and people know how this character looks like alright you take this person just run the secondary if that one goes solid theres an earlier one with loss you have to run the earlier one if that goes solid you run the earlier one follow the same rules but you just go to that secondary get the moment of it get the duration of it follow it through brooom brooom brooom grind away grind away grind away through and through and through and spill and spill and tears and sorrow and shame blame regret apathy through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and some of these cases you wouldnt believe your eyes youre sitting there youre sitting there looking at somebody who looks like theyre only about twenty years old ive seen in person running an engram ive seen person running an engram goiter at least six inches in diameter recede and completely vanish with all signs thereof within half an hour after the engram was finished it isnt for every time action but there are miracles to be found on it there are rather wonderful things that can happen so you start omitting this from your repertoire youve got rocks in your head so class viii should know how to run an engram because there are going to be some cases you run into that wont just wont go anyplace unless you run an engram and theres the other little interesting thing is you wont be able to shove anybody up through the later ot sections unless you can run an engram theyre just gonna hang right there unless youre sharper than pistol on running engrams but running engrams is lot of fun when you have good meter and you have the technology of engram running as it was finally developed its gas nothing to it its ball and it doesnt take as long as youd think but dont dont be suddenly upset if it the session is twelve hours long you can break one of those sessions but when you break the session youve got to get in all the ruds fly the needle again before you start him back into it see you dont have breaks which go back to the same action every time you have this trouble with breaks every time you have break every time you have new session youve got to fly the youve got to fly the ruds so you have to know this sort of thing now to show you how far out it can get and so on i dont think people today really know how to do touch assist i dont know what happened to the touch assist but i was fascinated to have whole group of scientologists not very long ago absolutely amazed watching with the most intense fascination watching do touch assist correct and by the book they knew that you touch assist left and right but they didnt know any of the fars or nears they didnt know that you followed the nerve channels it was quite interesting quite interesting touch assist is highly complex action it isnt just jabbing the guy in the ribs saying something or other and the action is elementary actually the area the area that youre doing touch assist from you approach on gradient and recede from on gradient and if you have for instance an elbow injury or something like that you would for sure go further from the head than the elbow eventually but if you wanted to practically kill the guy why youd go immediately and directly to an area further down the arm than the elbow as the first touch now contact assist also has its gradients and you do it equally on both sides of the body and its just feel my finger and so forth but you have to also go down the nerve channels cause theres where the current is locked up and there are twelve nerves in the spine and any injury that is severe in the body has to have the whole spine released on the subject and its far and near gradient approaches coming back going forward so what what if we can forget an assist or it can evaporate lot of things can evaporate on the lines but your job is to hold standard thats why im telling you these things your job is to hold it standard now i havent told you all there is to know about touch assist but i will i havent told you all there is to know about engram running but it is down except for the one data i gave you and as far as im concerned the technology has stayed together pretty well pretty well there arent many pieces of it missing enough of its missing to make some of you curious and people have not held the standard well enough in its application to put it where it should go and now assembling it all putting it together making straight line proposition that is right down the middle of highway with wide open throttle with everything we know about it were in position to make it win but it will keep winning just as long as you continue as you continue to hold the standard thank you very much
