accounted for through the smi trust fund both funds are maintained by the department of the treasury 1 each fund is overseen by board of trustees that reports annually to congress concerning the funds financial status almost from its inception the hi trust fund has faced projected shortfall when observers refer to the impending insolvency of medicare they are actually referring to the pending insolvency of the hi trust fund the smi trust fund does not face exhaustion because of the way it is financed however the smi trustees continue to voice concern about the rapid growth in program costs

the program went into effect the insolvency date was postponed number of times primarily due to legislative changes which had the effect of restraining the growth in program spending see table 1 the lower growth rates were achieved largely through reductions in payments to providers primarily hospitals and physicians generally these measures were part of larger budget reconciliation laws which attempted to restrain overall federal spending efforts to curtail program spending intensified as congress considered legislation to bring the entire federal budget into balance and culminated in the passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 this legislation achieved significant savings in medicare and extended the solvency of the part trust fund number of observers contended that the savings achieved through the enactment of bba 97 were gr eater than intended at the time of enactment and had unintended consequences for health care providers as result of these concerns congress subsequently enacted two measures t he balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra 99 pl 106113 and the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa 2000 pl 106554 these measures were designed to restore some of the bba 97 spending reductions in early 1997 the trustees had projected that the part fund would become insolvent in 2001 following enactment of bba 97 significant improvements were recorded in the shortterm projections the new projections reflected number of factors including bba 97 and strong economic growth which generated more revenues to the trust fund from payroll taxes despite enactment of both bbra 99 and bipa 2000 which increased program spending the 2001 and 2002 trustees reports continued to delay the projected insolvency date however the 2003 report 1 the trust funds are an accounting mechanism there is actual transfer of money into and out of the fund

g344g561shifted direction again its projected insolvency date was 2026 four years earlier than the 2030 date projected in the 2002 report the revision was due to lower than expected hitaxable payroll and higher than expected hospital expenditures the 2004 report projected that under intermediate assumptions the hi trust fund would become insolvent in 2019 seven years earlier than projected in 2003 the revision of the projected insolvency date was due to number of factors including slow wage growth on which payroll taxes are based and faster growth in inpatient hospital benefits the enactment of mma added significantly to hi costs primarily through higher payments to rural hospitals and to private plans under the ma program the 2005 report projected that under intermediate assumptions the hi trust fund would become insolvent in 2020 one year later than projected in 2004 the revision reflected slightly higher income and slightly lower costs in 2004 than previously estimated the 2006 report moved the insolvency date forward again under the trustees intermediate assumptions the hi trust fund would become insolvent in 2018 the revision refl ected slightly higher costs and an upward revision in shortrange assumptions about utilization of hi services both the 2007 and 2008 reports project 2019 insolvency date though the 2008 report indicates it would occur earlier in the year t

cannot be made from the hi fund unless there are sufficient monies credited to it neither the social security trust fund nor the medicare trust fund has ever run out of money and there are provisions in the social security act governing what would happen in such an event there is authority in law for general revenue funding of the shortfall of course the fund would continue to have payroll taxes credited to it though these would be insufficient to pay all the pending claims g14g152g151g144g556g20g138g151g144g142g561g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g151g144g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the projected insolvency date is only one measure of the financial soundness of the part program the 2008 trustees report states that the fund fails to meet both the short and longrange tests for financial adequacy further they contend that the financial soundness of the entire medicare program must be addressed for further discussion of this issue see crs report rs20173 medicare financing the
