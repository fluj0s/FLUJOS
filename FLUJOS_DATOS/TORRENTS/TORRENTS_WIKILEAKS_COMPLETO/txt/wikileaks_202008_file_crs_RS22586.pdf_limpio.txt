tax shelter is generally defined as transaction that technically complies with the internal revenue code but results in unreasonable tax consequences that are not intended under the code1 the economic substance doctrine is one tool that the irs has for fighting abusive tax shelters it is judicially developed doctrine that allows the irs and courts to disregard transactions that were made for taxavoidance purposes and lack economic substance2 the economic substance doctrine is rooted in several supreme court decisions the first is gregory v helvering 3 where the court stated that while the legal right of taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes or altogether avoid them by means which the law permits cannot be doubted transact ion will be disregarded for tax purposes if it was not the thing which the statute intended4 in that case the court looking at whether stock transfer qualified as taxfree reorganization disregarded the transaction because there was business or corporate purpose for the companies involved and to hold otherwise would be to exalt artifice above reality and to deprive the statutory provision in question of all serious purpose5 in knetsch v united states 6 the court applied the gregory analysis in determining whether taxpayer could deduct interest arising from transaction in which among other things he bought bonds using promissory note and effectively paid the notes interest due at the beginning of each year with money he borrowed prospectively from the bonds value at the end of the year the court disregarded the transaction because it did not appreciably affect the taxpayers beneficial interest except to reduce his tax and refused to believe without evidence of legislative intent that congress intended to provide tax benefits for sham transaction 7 the court in frank lyon co v united states8 further explained that transaction should be recognized for tax purposes if there is genuine multipleparty transaction with economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities is imbued with taxindependent considerations and is not shaped solely by taxavoidance features that have meaningless labels attached 9 in 2006 four important tax shelter cases were decided by us courts of appeals in all four cases the economic substance of the transaction was at issue the next section of this report looks at these cases because this report focuses on the economic substance doctrine the other tax aspects of the cases are not discussed it is however important to note that courts in these cases found that the challenged transactions complied with the relevant statutory requirements in the internal revenue code it should also be noted that the factual situations are summarized and may not include all parties to or all aspects of the transaction 1 for more information on tax shelters see crs report rl32193 antitaxshelter and other revenueraising tax proposals considered in the 108th congress by jane g gravelle 2 there are several related doctrines including the substanceoverform doctrine the step transaction doctrine and the business purpose doctrine 3

and b gave promissory note worth 375 million and property worth 4 million to b in exchange for stock in b and bs assumption of as future asbestos liabilities the value of the note was calculated to cover the liabilities then sold its stock in b for 500000 coltec claimed that had 3785 million loss from the sale of the stock coltec asserted that as basis in the stock was 379 million the value of the note and property and did not have to be reduced by the value of the assumed asbestos liabilities under the contingent liability rules in irc 358d2 the irs challenged among other things the transactions economic substance in 2004 the court of federal claims held that the economic substance doctrine was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine 10 the court reasoned that because congress had the authority to write the tax laws it was unconstitutional for courts to require taxpayers to meet criteria beyond compliance with the congressionally written statutes the court explained that taxpayers needed to be able to rely on the tax codes statutory language and that it was unfair to apply the economic substance doctrine on top of the statutes because of its unpredictability and ambiguity the court dismissed the idea that supreme court and federal circuit decisions had endorsed the use of the economic substance doctrine finding instead that the holdings in those cases relied on the statutory language and only used the doctrine as support for their conclusions the court also noted that the doctrines constitutionality had not previously been challenged and believed that recent case law raised questions about the doctrines viability in 2006 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed and remanded the lower courts decision describing the holding as untenable 11 the appellate court noting that the economic substance doctrine had been recognized in several supreme court and federal circuit cases and in tax treatises found precedent for holding the doctrine to be unconstitutional 12 the court explained that the doctrine was similar to other canons of statutory construction upheld by the supreme court as constitutional that permitted courts to look beyond the statutory language if legislative intent would otherwise be violated the court then laid out five principles of the doctrine 1 transaction without economic substance is disregarded for tax purposes regardless of the taxpayers motive for entering into it 2 the taxpayer has the burden to prove the transactions economic substance 3 an objective test is used to determine whether there is economic substance 4 the transaction that is tested is the one giving rise to the tax benefit and 5 intercompany transactions that do not affect thirdparty economic interests deserve close scrutiny 13 using these principles the court determined that the coltec transaction lacked economic substance because it did not effect any real change in the flow of economic benefits provide any real opportunity to make profit or appreciably affect coltecs beneficial interests aside from creating tax advantage14 10 coltec indus v united states 62 fed cl 716 75256 fed cl

lion in capital gains from the sale of assets took part in transaction seeking to create capital loss first bdc transferred 561 million in cash to subsidiary in exchange for stock and the subsidiarys assumption of bdcs future health benefits claims which had an estimated present value of 560 million one month later bdc sold the stock for 1 million to an unrelated thirdparty the subsidiary then lent 564 million to bdcs parent company which the parent company repaid in monthly installments designed to furnish the subsidiary with funds to pay the benefit liabilities bdc claimed 560 million loss from the sale of stock bdc asserted that its basis in the stock was 561 million and was not reduced by the value of the assumed liabilities under the contingent liabilities rules in irc 358d2 the irs disallowed the loss the district court agreed with bdcs characterization of the transaction 15 the court stated that under fourth circuit precedent the question was whether the taxpayer was motivated by business purpose other than obtaining tax benefits in entering the transaction and that the transaction has economic substance because reasonable possibility of profit exists16 the fact that the taxpayers sole motivation was tax avoidance was undisputed with respect to the tests objective second prong the court stated it would be met if the business engaged in bona fide economicallybased business transactions 17 the court found that the transaction met this standard because it had very real economic implications for the health plan participants and the businesses involved in the transaction because the subsidiary had assumed the administration of the benefit plans was responsible for paying the claims had proposed cost containment strategies that had been implemented and had always had salaried employees18 thus the court found that the transaction had economic substance and granted bdcs motion for summary judgment the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit disagreed with the district court19 because bdc had conceded the subjective prong of the test the court looked only at the objective prong the appeals court stated that the lower court had misapplied that prong by focusing on the subsidiarys business activities when the test actually required looking at whether the transaction had reasonable expectation of profit outside of the tax benefits20 the court therefore found that many of the facts upon which the district court had based its decision eg the fact that the subsidiary had salaried employees and paid claims as they came due were irrelevant thus the court reversed the district courts decision and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine the economic substance issue

paid the premiums by borrowing funds fro m the insurers using the policies cash value as collateral and by making partial withdrawals from the policies cash value the plan was not expected to generate positive prededuction cash flows or earn significant inside buildup ie earn interest on the policies value unless dow made substantial investments of cash into the plan the plan also limited dows potential mortality gain ie its potential to profit by being paid more death benefits than expected because of high number of deaths dow deducted more than 33 million for interest paid on loans used to pay the premiums the irs disallowed the deductions arguing that the transaction lacked economic substance the district court held that the transaction did not lack economic substance 21 the court began by stating that the economic substance doctrine required the court to determine whether the transaction has any practicable economic effects other than the creation of income tax losses and if so whether the taxpayer had legitimate profit motive in entering into the transaction 22 the court looking at prior cases in which courts had held coli plans to lack economic substance determined the test would be met if the transaction generated positive prededuction cash flow and it was possible for dow to profit from both inside buildup and mortality gain the court determined that these factors were met because the net present value of the policies was positive the plan allowed for inside buildup and the plan did not completely eliminate the transfer of risk23 the sixth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court24 although the appellate court found that the lower court had properly framed the inquiry by looking at the plans key characteristics to determine whether it lacked economic substance it disagreed with the district courts findings on each factor25 specifically the appellate court stated the district court erred by not looking at dows past conduct in determining the likelihood that dow would make the significant future investments necessary for the plan to eventually have positive prededuction cash flow and generate inside buildup the court found that dows past conduct made such future conduct unlikely the appellate court also stated that the district court wr ongly required that the plan not provide any possibility of mortality gain and found that while the plan did allow for the possibility of such gain it was basically designed to make the mortality provisions neutral based on these factors the court held that the plans lacked economic substance and should be disregarded for tax purposes dow filed petition for certiorari with the supreme court on october 4 2006

its income to the banks each year there was significant difference between the banks book income and tax income this was because the book income had been reduced by expenses that included depreciation the tax income on the other hand was not reduced by depreciation because the airplanes had already been fully depreciated for tax purposes while the banks received most of the income the operating agreement granted the taxpayer management control over the llc the operating agreement also called for the llc to annually buy back percentage of the banks ownership interest so that the banks would be bought out after eight years the overall effect of the transaction was that during the eightyear period the taxpayer was able to partially monetize the airplanes by having access to the funds that the banks invested and the banks received steady rate of return on their investment the irs argued that the transaction should be disregarded the district court held that the transaction had economic substance 26 the court explained that the economic substance doctrine requires the court examine both the subjective business purpose of the taxpayer for engaging in the transaction and the objective economic effect of the transaction27 the court stated that the precedential decisions in the second circuit were unclear as to whether both prongs of the test had to be met this was unimportant to the court however because it found that the transaction satisfied both tests28 the court reasoned that the transaction had economic effect because the banks had invested 1175 million and received percentage of the llcs income in return and that the taxpayer had subjective business purpose in participating in the transaction because it needed to raise capital the court then looked at whether the banks were actually partners in the transaction 29 the court found that they were because there were legitimate business reasons to create the llc and the banks had an active stake in the llc because its investment returns depended on the llcs business performance in 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the lower courts decision30 the appellate court did not disagree with the lower court that the transaction had economic substance due to the companys nontax motive to raise equity capital instead the appeals court found that the lower court erred in not looking at whether the banks were truly partners under the test developed in the supreme courts decision in commr v culbertson 31 the court stated that under culbertson it had to determine the nature of the interest based on realistic appraisal of the totality of the circumstances32 the court found that the banks did not have any real equity interest because their interest was in the nature of secured loan with an insignificant equity kicker which meant that only in negligible fashion was their wellsecured interest intertwined with the fortunes of the business33 thus the appellate court did
