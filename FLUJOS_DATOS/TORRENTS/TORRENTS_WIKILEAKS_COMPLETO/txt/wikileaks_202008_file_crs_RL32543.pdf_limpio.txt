federal agencies when the federal governments energyefficiency and conservation programs r eceived severe budget cuts in the 1980s shared energy savings and later energy savi ngs performance contracts were devised as part of the strategy to meet federa l energy reduction goals energy savings performance contracts espcs offered federal agencies novel means of making energyefficiency improvements to aging buildings and facilities in return for privately financing and installing energy conservation measures contractor receive d specified share of any re sulting energy cost savings the contractor referred to as an energy service company esco guaranteed fixed amount of energy and cost savings th roughout the term of the contract and bore the risk of the improvements failure to pr oduce projected energy savings the sum of the improvements cost and its reduced level of energy cost could not exceed the preespc energy cost the term energy conservation measure ecm was applied to

enter into energy savings performance contracts espcs with contractors that privately financed and installed energy conservation measures in federal buildings and facilities in return the contractors r eceived specified shares of any resulting energy cost savings the term energy conservation measure ecm applies to energyefficiency improvements such as energy and watersaving equipment and renewable energy systems such as solar energy panels1 the contractor referred to as an ergy service company esco provided the design acquisition installation tes ting operation mainte nance and repair services for the ecm the esco also had to guarantee fixed amount of energy and cost savings throughout the term of the contract and bore the risk of the ecms failure to produce projected energy savings the sum of the ecm cost and its reduced level of energy cost could not exceed the preespc energy cost the term energy savings was applied to the measured reduction in the base cost of energy used by an existing federally owned building or facility as established through methods specified in the contract to date more than 340 espcs have b een awarded according to the department of energy doe and esco

months to award the contract and 12 months for design and construction 27 m onths in duration from start to finish for an average implementation price of 326 million21 based on data for 23 energy

between espcs and appropriationsfunded contracts since escos pay interest charges on money borrowed to finance the energy conservation measures they recover the cost over the life cycle of the espc under an appropriationsfunded project c ontractors commercial finance charges would also be passed through as part the pr ojects cost but the length of financing and therefore cost of financing would be considerably less than with espcs key measure for comparing the espc funding alternative to appropriations funded projects lies in the lifecycle cost this accounts for the costs of the initial survey and feasibility study installation and owning and operating the ecm over its useful life ornl vised parametric tables22 to assist federal managers in deciding whether to fund ecms through espcs

the budget om funds that would pay for espcs must be appr opriated upwards of 25 b illion over the next 10 years would be scored as future commitment if espcs were reauthorized in effect the federal government borro ws money when it authorizes energy efficiency improvements through espcs when there is deficit the treasury must also borrow money needed by government to pay its bills which government borrows by selling treasury securities such as tbills notes treasury inflation protected securities and savings bonds to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32543crs9 proponents of espcs may argue that espc s represent financially smart choice because of the guarantee that all costs in cluding debt repaymen t will be covered by the cost savings produced by new ecms further the real cost of energy conservation measures under espcs is zero given that the capital improvement costs and reduced energy costs are less than what the government would continue to pay without the improvements further argu ments may be made that espcs require shorter lead times than impr ovements made with appropriated funds hence energy reductions can be achieved sooner with spcs as supported by the ornl study however the lifecycle cost of the ecm favors appropriationsfunded projects within certain parameters and espc funding unde r other parameters espcs were devised by congress as means of decreasing future obligations by reducing operation and ma intenance spending on energy in recognizing that espcs do impose future financial obligati ons as scored by cbo congress may consider retaining the sunset provision despite declining appropriations for ergyefficiency improvements and the necessity to limit future financial obligati ons congress may still choose to encourage energyefficiency improvements in federal facilities congress may decide once again to extend the sunset provision as d been authorized in the 1998 legislation further congress may consider amending the provisions of espcs to promote early payback strategies to reduce longterm oblig ations or expanding their application to mobile systems for additional energysavings potential
