programs that reduce greenhouse gases ghgs have been introduced in the 110th congress proposals receiving particular attention would create marketbased ghg reduction programs along the line s of the allowance trading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments under the program an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of pollutant however there are several important differences for example the scope of the greenhouse gases control program would be substantially greater than the title iv program involving more covered sectors and entities this diversity multiplies as the global nature of the climate change issue is considered along with the multiple ghgs involved thus carbon market is likely to involve far greater numbers of affected parties from diverse industries than the current title iv program it will also involve far greater numbers of tradeable allowances than the current title iv program under the current program about 9 million allowances are allocated to over 2000 emission sources annually in contrast greenhouse gas program that capped emissions in the electric power transportation and industry sectors at their 1990 levels at some point in the future would be allocating about 485 billion allowances annually trading activities under title iv has been increasing since 2005 however it doesnt approach the anticipated volumes that would occur if greenhouse gas capandtrade program was instituted likewise the economic value of future carbon market is likely to be substantially greater than the title iv program currently the annual allocation of so 2 allowances has market value of about 45 billion using estimates of 15 to 25 an allowance the annual allocation of 485 billion allowances posited above for greenhouse gas program would have market value of 728 billion to 1213 billion despite these differences in scope and magnitude there are trends in title iv trading that are likely to continue in carbon market first there is trend toward more diverse nontraditional participants in the title iv market like the title iv market the economic importance of carbon market will likely draw in entities not directly affected by the reduction requirements such as financial institutions these entities motivations may be equally diverse including facilitating projects involving the need for allowances portfolio balancing intermediary fees and trading profits second as noted there is trend in the title iv market toward using financial instruments to manage allowance price risk given the greater economic stakes involved in carbon market this trend toward more sophisticated financial instruments is likely to emerge early as hedge against price uncertainty the emergence of entities wellversed in the use of these instruments may reinforce the trend and make options collars strangles and other structures as common in the allowance market as they are in other commodity markets with more liquid and dynamic market carbon market may look more like other energy markets such as natural gas and oil than the somewhat sedate so 2 allowance market

congressional proposals to advance programs that reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress proposals receiving particular attention would create marketbased greenhouse gas reduction programs ong the lines of the trading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments1 these capandtrade schemes would impose ceiling cap on total annual emissions of greenhouse gases and establish market in pollution rights called allowances between affected entities an allowance would be limited authorization by th government to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent co 2e and could be bought and sold traded or held banked by participating parties these domestic proposals have parallels with the programs being implemented in europe to meet its obligations under the kyoto protocol specific ally the european union eu has decided to implement capandtrade program along with other marketoriented mechanisms permitted under the kyoto protocol to help it achieve compliance at least cost2 the eus decision to use emission trading to implement the kyoto protocol is at least partly based on the successful emissions trading program used by the united states to implement its sulfur dioxide acid rain control program contained in title iv of the 1990 clean act amendments 3 these two operating capandtrade programsthe us s acid rain program and the eus climate change programmay provide insights for the design of domestic greenhouse gas reduction scheme however while the experiences of the eu system directly relate to the greenhouse gas reduction initiative of the domestic legislative proposals it has operated only short time see text box the acid rain control program has longer operating history although the control scheme differs in some important wayseg it is internal to one nation and involves fewer types of sources among the lessons that phase 1 of the european trading system may have for similar us program is that allowance prices are linked to the price of other energy commodities 4 analysis of ets allowance prices during phase 1 suggests the most important variables in determining allowance price changes have been oil and natural gas price changes5 this suggests that traders will pursue arbitrage strategies involving simultaneous transactions in allowances and oil and gas contracts for example trader anticipating rise in the price of oil might take position in allowances in the expectation that the two prices would move in tandem since there is 1 pl 101549 title iv

others has affected energy prices in recent years6 the possibility that the price of allowances could also be subject to distortion or manipulation will be policy concern taking that hint from ets

clean air act caa by limiting total so 2 emissions from electric generating facilities to 895 million tons annually beginning in the year 20007 title iv essentially caps so 2 emissions at individual utility sources operating before enactment of the caa in 1990 known as existing sources through tonnage limitation and at those plants beginning operation after enactment known as new sources through an emissions offset requirement so 2 emissions from most existing sources are capped at specified emission rate times historical average fuel consumption level beginning january 1 2000 so 2 emissions from new plants commencing operation after enactment must be offsetin effect the emissions cap for new sources is zero their allowances come from emissions reductions at existing facilities the program was implemented through twophase process with the final phase beginning in 2000 to implement the so 2 reduction program the law creates comprehensive permit and emissions allowance system capandtrade program an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so 2 during or after specified year issued by epa the allowances are allocated to existing power plant units in accordance with formulas delineated in the law the owner of the facility receives the allowances for given plant regardless of the actual operation of the plant for example an owner may choose to shut down an ex isting power plant and use those allowances to offset emissions from two newer cleaner facilities as noted generally power plant that commences operation after enactment receives allowances requiring new units to obtain allowances from those with allowances or purcha them at an epasponsored auction in order 6 see eg senate permanent subcommittee on investigations excessive speculation in the

as bank allowances for future use or sale if an affected unit does not have sufficient allowances to cover its emissions for given year it is subject to an emission penalty of 2000 indexed to inflation per ton of excess so 2 and it submits to epa plan for offsetting those excess emissions in the next year or longer if epa approves further epa must deduct allowances equal to the excess tonnage from the sources allocation for the next year another epa responsibility is to provide for allowance auctions for the post2000 period the law sets aside percentage of available allowances for auction anyone may participate in these auctions as buyer or seller and those selling allowances may specify minimum sale price epa may delegate or contract the conduct of the auctions to other agencies such as to the department of the treasury or even to nongovernmental groups or organizations two streams of allowances are sold in the auctions the first stream represents spot sales of allowances that must either be used in the year they are sold or banked for use in later year the second stream represents advance sales of allowances that must either be used in the seventh year after the year they are first offered for sale or be banked for use in later year for 2000 and thereafter title iv provides that 125000 allowances be setaside annually for spot sales and 125000 for

emissions from affected units the emission tracking system ets and to reconcile trueup allowances and emissions at the end of the year the allowance tracking system is the official record of allowance transfers and balances used for compliance purposes each participant in the system has an ts account and each account has an identification number table 1 identifies what the ats tracks and does not track with respect to allowance activity as suggested epa primarily gathers information to ensure compliance with the emission limitations of title ivthe ts is not trading platform participants are not required to record all transfers with epa until the affected allowances are to be used for compliance participants must notify epa to have any transfers recorded in the ts when parties agree on transaction that they want recorded on the ts they provide information on the buyer and seller and the serial numbers of the affected allowances to the ts which records the transfer 8 epa has renamed

annuallyusually on the last monday in march sealed bids entailing the number type and price along with payment are sent to epa later than three business days before the auctions the auctions sell the allowances according to bid price starting with the highest bid and continuing down until all allowances are sold or there are more bids unlike allowances offered by private holders for auction these

amendments were enacted during time of transition in the electric utility industry there are three components to ectric power delivery generation transmission and distribution historically electricity service was defined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry had 1 an inherent tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technological conditions that limited the number of potential entrants in addition many regulators considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 were served by vertically integrated investorowned utilities the public utility holding company act puhca 9 and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act10 established regime for regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government essentially regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilities under this bargain utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking authorities of these commissions tend to be as broad and varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over invest ment and debt at the other end of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of utility operation despite this diversity the essential mission of the puc is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process complete with attorneys briefs witnesses etc the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitted to collect revenue requirement and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among the various customer classes rate structure 11 this is commonly known as rate of return ror regulation under the regime set up by fpa federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce historically federal regulation followed state regulation and is premised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of states to regulate interstate commerce in this bifurcation of regulatory jurisdiction federal regulation is limited and conceived to supplement state regulation the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has the principal functions at the federal level for the economic regulation of the electricity utility industry including financial transactions

and ensuring adequate and reliable service in addition until passage of the 2005 energy policy act epact0512 the securities and exchange commission sec regulated utilities corporate structure and business ventures under puhca to prevent recurrence of the abusive practices of the 1920s eg cross subsidization selfdealing pyramiding etc this comprehensive costbased approached to regulation began to undergo change in the 1970s and 1980s as passage of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa13 and the fuel use act of 1978 fua14 helped establish independent electricity generatorselectricity producers who sold at wholesale and had exclusive franchise area building on the perceived success of these independent generators under purpa the energy policy act of 1992 epact92 created new category of wholesale electric generators called exempt wholesale generators ewgs that are not considered utilities and not regulated under puhca 15 ewgs also referred to as merchant generators were intended to create competitive wholesale electric generation sector epact92 effectively initiated deregulated wholesale generation by creating class of generators that were able to locate beyond typical service territory with open access to the existing transmission system epact05 continued this process by adding provisions to address system reliability repeal puhca and modify purpa16 the current status of these initiatives and resulting state responses is mixture of states with traditional comprehensive ror regulation of electricity and those with restructured industry with segmented generation transmission and dist ribution components over the past 20 years some states have truncated their ror regulation to the extent they have chosen to restructure their industry in response to federal initiatives in states that have not restructured the system operates as it has since enactment of the federal power act with retail consumers paying one price that includes transmission distribution and generation this is referred to as bundled transaction in states that have restructured consumers are billed for separate transmission distribution and generation charges this is referred to as unbundled electricity service in those states retail consumers are allowed to choose their retail generation supplier however few states actually have competitive markets for retail choice exceptions include texas and massachusetts ferc regulates all transmission including unbundled retail transactions 17 12 pl 10958 13 pl 95617 16 usc 2601 14 pl 95620 15 exempt wholesale generators may sell electricity only at wholesale ewgs may be located anywhere including foreign countries before enactment of epact05 utility generators were limited by the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca to operate within one state 16 in repealing puhca epact05 provides that ferc and state regulatory bodies must be given access to utility books and records also ferc is given approval authority over the acquisition of securities and the merger sale lease or disposition of facilities under fercs jurisdiction with value in excess of 10 million with respect

rates for electricity generation under its jurisdiction rather ferc conducts twopronged horizontal and vertical market power analysis to determine an entitys eligibility for marketbased wholesale rates18 if eligible the entity may set its wholesale prices according to market demand not according to production costs because of the marketbased nature of ferc wholesale rates allowances are an accounting issue not ratemaking issue for ferc electric public utilities and licensees within ferc jurisdiction are required to maintain their books and records in accordance with fercs uniform system of accounts usofa19 the usofa guides the jurisdictional entity in understanding the information it needs to report on various ferc forms incl uded in the usofa are instructions on how to account for allowances allocated to the entity under the 1990 clean air act or acquired by the entity for speculative purposes allowances owned for other than speculative purposes are accounted for at cost in either account 1581 allowance inventory or account 1582 allowances withheld as appropriate allowances acquired for speculative purposes are accounted for in account 124 other investments20 by defining allowance value in terms of historic costs allowances allocated by epa to entities are valued at zero ferc does require that the records supporting account 1581 and 1582 be maintained in sufficient detail so as to provide the number of allowances and the related cost by vintage year likewise the uniform system of accounts also provides instruction on accounting for gains and losses from selling allowances it should be noted that the internal revenue service irs also values allowances allocated by epa to an entity on zerocost basis 21

is more than an accounting issue it is also ratemaking issue during and after passage of title iv there was substantial debate and studies were done on the role of the pucs in facilitating or hindering allowance trading 22 in title iv the regulatory treatment of allowances is left to the appropriate state and continued transmission and leaves all retail issues up to the state utility commissions enron in an amicus brief argued that ferc clearly has jurisdiction over all transmission and ferc is obligated to prevent transmission owners from discriminating against those wishing to use the transmission lines on march 4 2002 the us supreme court ruled in favor of ferc and held that ferc has jurisdiction over transmission including unbundled retail transactions 18 ferc order 697

regarding the treatment of allowance transactions in state utility rate proceedings basically congress chose to leave the state commissions free to apply any rate treatment they deem reasonable and appropriate the states responded in diverse manner some states issuing broad guidelines on treatment of allowance transactions while others decided such events on casebycase basis an analysis of the interaction between pucs and the allowance system made three general observations about the resulting puc treatment of allowances 1 regulations tend to require 100 of both expenses and revenues from allowances to be returned to ra tepayers with net gains losses incurred used to offset or increase fuel costs 2 few states have allowed utilities to retain some of the profits as an incentive to sell excess allowances 3 state regulations tend to be tailored to states specific circumstanceallowance rich states have regulations encouraging sales allowance poor states have regulations encouraging purchases 23 the focus of puc decisions has not been to encourage allowance transactions but generally to ensure ratepayers and not shareholders receive the benefits of the allowances in some cases pucs have also used their authority to encourage utilities to protect highsulfur coal production even if it is not the most costeffective control strategy24

amendments were enacted about 75 of the allowances were allocated to vertically integrated ror regulated entities today that percentage has shifted with more allowances allocated to independent generating entities as some utilities have divested themselves of their generating assets this diversification of ownership is reflected to some degree in the ts statistics on official transfers and transactions25 as indicated by table 2 in the first two years of trading transfers between economically unrelated entities were small percentage of total transfers more recent data suggest that transfers between unrelated entities account for about 50 of total transfers however it is clear that internal transfers remain major part of the allowance market even in restructured industry and that the total number of official transactions occurring is quite modest internal transfers ie transfers within or between economically related entities tend to be transacted in accordance with agreements that the utility andor holding company has filed with the appropriate state puc or ferc or both26 23 elizabeth m bailey allowance trading activity and state regulatory rulings evidence from

future emission re ductions the two entities agree to swap allowances to improve their allowance streams over these years 30 epa website httpwwwepagovairmarketstradingbuyinghtml 31 ema website

transactions in contracts based on commodity prices pursuant to the act the commodity futures trading commission cftc regulates the futures exchanges such as nymex and certain other derivative transactions that occur offexchange the cftcs authority varies according to the identities of the market participants and the nature of the underlying commodity in general the cftc does not regulate spot or cash trades in commodities or forward contracts that will be settled by delivery of the physical commodity which are also considered cash sales 39 in terms of allowances the cftcs jurisdiction is confined to trades that take place on those markets it regulates it has jurisdiction over spot trades in allowances full jurisdiction over futures and options trades on regulated exchanges and limited jurisdiction over derivatives trades on certain other markets subject to lighter regulation than the exchanges allowances are regulated by the cftc as exempt commodities under the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 40 the commodity exchange act defines an exempt commodity as any commodity other than an excluded commodity eg financial indices etc or an agricultural commodity examples include energy commodities and metals emission allowances are related to energy production this designation has been supported by other federal entities in 2005 interpretive letter approving physically settled emission derivatives transactions the office of the comptroller of the currency administrator of national banks states that physical settlement of emission allowances do not pose the same risk as other physical commodities the proposed emissions derivatives transactions eg futures forwards options swaps caps and floors will be linked to three emission allowance markets the us

derivative structures such as forwards futures options caps and floors these derivatives are generally physically settled because the current emissions market is primarily physical in nature the occ has previously concluded in variety of contexts that national banks may engage in customerdriven commodity transactions and hedges that are physically settled cashsettled and settled by transitory title transfer similarly the occ permitted national bank to make and take physical delivery of commodities in connection with transactions to hedge commodity price risk in commodity linked transactions in these decisions the approved activities were subject to number of cond itions due to risks associated with physical transactions in certain commodities those risks included storage eg storage tanks pipelines transportation eg tankers barges pipelines environmental eg pollution fumigation leakage contamination and insurance eg damage to persons and property contract breach spillage physical settlement of emissions derivatives and hedging with physicals would not pose those risks however emission allowances are not tangible physical commodities such as electricity or natural gas

trade only on regulated exchanges dcms these are subject to extensive selfregulation and cftc oversight electronic trading facilities where small traders are not present are subject to much less regulation because traders are assumed to be capable of protecting themselves from fraud however if an electronic trading facility plays significant price discovery role that is if the prices it

activities44 in recommending cftc approval of the ccfe as dcm the staff memorandum noted the following in futures markets generally the existence of liquid market for particular contract and the ability of an fcm to liquidate positions therein which it may inherit from defaulting customer are important to the financial integrity of such an fcm and in turn its ability to fulfill its obligations to other customers and to the clearing system the epa will facilitate the delivery process of these contracts in manner that makes cash positions known and compensates for any current lack of developed deep liquid cash market for the contracts as compared to other futures contracts collectively ccorp nfa and epa will carry out financial surveillance monitor situations and provide information the effect of which should counterbalance any disparate effects on financial integrity which might be imposed by the initial lack of trading history and prices 45 g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 despite the tendency to view the title iv program as model for future greenhouse gas reduction scheme there are several important differences for example the title iv program involves up to 3000 new and existing electric generating facilities that contribute twothirds of the countrys so 2 and onethird of its nitrogen oxide nox emissions the two primary precursors of acid rain this concentration of sources makes the logistics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable with continuous emissions monitors cems providing real time data however greenhouse gas emissions are not so concentrated in 2005 the electric power industry accounted for abou t 33 of the countrys ghg emissions while the transportation section accounted for about 28 industrial use about 19 agriculture about 8 commercial use about 6 and residential use about 546 thus small dispersed sources in transportation residentialcommercial and agricultur sectors along with industry are far more important in controlling ghg emissions than they are in controlling so 2 emissions this diversity multiplies as the global nature of the climate change issue is considered along with the multiple ghgs involved47 thus carbon market is like to involve far greater numbers of affected parties from diverse industries than the current title iv program it will also involve far greater numbers of tradeable allowances than the current title iv program under the current program about 9 million allowances are allocated to participating entities annually in contrast greenhouse gas program that capped emissions in the electric power transportation and industry sectors at their 1990 levels at some point in the future would be allocating about 485 billion allowances annually this is two and half ordersofmagnitude increase over the title iv program and double the phase 2 allocations under the ets as 44 evolution markets llc an overview of

increasing since 2005 however it doesnt approach the anticipated volumes that would occur if greenhouse gas capandtrade program was instituted finally the economic value of future carbon market is likely to be substantially greater than the title iv program with epa s pending implementa tion of the clean air interstate rule cair the price of title iv allowance has increased to about 50048 thus the annual allocation of so 2 allowances has market value of about 45 billion using estimates of 15 to 25 an allowance the annual allocation of 485 billion allowances posited above for greenhouse gas program would have market value of 728 billion to 1213 billion 49 unlike the title iv market carbon market may be quite liquid despite these differences in scope and magnitude there are trends in title iv trading that are likely to continue in carbon market first there is trend toward more diverse nontraditional participants in the title iv market like the title iv market the economic importance of carbon market will likely draw in entities not directly affected by the reduction requirements such as financial institutions the motivations of these entities may be equally diverse including facilitating projects involving the need for allowances portfolio balancing and profits earned through intermediary fees or proprietary trading second there is trend in the title iv market toward using financial instruments to manage allowance price risk this trend is partly the result of the regulatory uncertainty introduced in the allowance market by cair given the greater economic stakes involved in carbon market this trend toward more sophisticated financial instruments is likely to emerge early as hedge against price uncertainty the emergence of entities wellversed in the use of these instruments may reinforce the trend and make options collars strangles and other structures as common in the allowance market as they are in other commodity markets with more liquid and dynamic market carbon market may look more like other energy markets such as natural gas and oil than the somewhat sedate so 2 allowance market
