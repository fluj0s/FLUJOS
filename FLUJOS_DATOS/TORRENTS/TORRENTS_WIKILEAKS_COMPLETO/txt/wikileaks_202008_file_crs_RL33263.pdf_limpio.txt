issues as to the geographic scope of the wetlands permitting program in the federal clea n water act cwa in 2006 the supreme court rendered third decision rapanos v united state s on appeal from two sixth circuit rulings the sixth circuit rulings offered the court chance to clarify the reach of cwa jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent only to nonnavigable tributaries of traditional navigable watersincluding tributaries such as drainage ditches and canals that may flow intermittently jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters was established in one of the two earlier decisions the courts decision provided little clarification however splitting 414 the fourjustice plurality decision by justice scalia said that the cwa covers only wetlands connected to relatively permanent bodies of water streams rivers lakes by continuous surface connection justice kennedy writing alone demanded substantial nexus between the wetland and traditional navigable water using an ambiguous ecological test justice stevens for the four dissenters would have upheld the existing broad reach of corps of engineersepa regulations because rationale commanded the support of majority of the justices lower courts are extracting different rules of decision from rapanos for resolving future cases corpsepa guidance issued in december 2008 says that wetland generally is jurisdictional if it satisfies either the plurality or kennedy tests the ambiguity of the rapanos decision and questions about the agencies guidance have increased pressure on congress to provide clarification in the 110 th congress committees held hearings on legislation intended to do so hr 2421 and s 1870 the legal and policy questions associated with rapanos regarding the outer geographic limit of cwa jurisdiction and the consequences of restricting that scopehave challenged regulators landowners and developers and policymakers for more than 30 years the answer may determine the reach of cwa regulatory authority not only for the wetlands permitting program but also for other cwa programs the cwa has one definition of navigable waters that applies to the entire law while regulators and the regulated community debate the legal dimensions of federal jurisdiction under the cwa scientists contend that there are discrete scientifically supportable boundaries or criteria along the continuum of wetlands to separate them into meaningful ecological or hydrological compartments wetland scientists believe that all such waters are critical for protecting the integrity of waters habitat and wildlife downstream changes in the limits of federal jurisdiction highlight the role of states in protecting waters not addressed by federal law from the states perspective federal programs provide baseline for consistent minimum standards to regulate wetlands and other waters most states are either reluctant or unable to take steps to protect nonjurisdictional waters through legislative or administrative action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33263g22g145g142g561g25g142g157g149g138g151g141g156g561g5g152g159g142g155g138g144g142g561 g152g143g561g157g145g142g561

decision addressed the asserted jurisdiction of the us army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency epa over wetlands adjacent to waters of the united states the problematic phrase used by the clean water act cwa2 to define the geographic scope of the acts wetlands permitting program actually two separate decisions consolidated for purposes of argument and decision were before the court both were from the sixth circuit and both involved michigan wetlands in rapanos v united states 3 the issue was whether the cwa s wetlands permitting program applies to wetlands that are only distantly connected to traditional navigable watersor at minimum do not abut them in carabell v us army corps of engineers 4 the issue was whether that same program reaches wetlands that are not hydrologically connected to any traditional navigable water both cases also raised constitutional question if the disputed cwa coverage exists did congress exceed its authority under the commerce clause of the constitution 5 in taking these separate cases the court was revisiting cwa conundrum with which it and many other courts had wrestled for three decades which wetlands are to be regulated under the cwa and which fall solely within the jurisdiction of the states in which they are located wetlands with variety of physical characteristics are found throughout the country they are known in different regions as swamps marshes fens potholes playa lakes or bogs although these places can differ greatly they all have distinctive vegetative assemblages because of the wetness of the soil some wetland areas may be continuously inundated by water while other areas may not be flooded at all in coastal areas flooding may occur on daily basis as tides rise and fall g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 from the earliest days congress has grappled with where to set the outer bound of federal authority over the nations waterways often with regard to uses of waterways that impaired navigation the phrase congress often used to define federal authority was navigable waters of the united states 6 the concept proved an elastic one in supreme court decisions from the early to midtwentieth century navigab ility underwent substantial expansion from waters in actual use to those which used to be navigable to t hose which by reasonable improvements could be made navigable to nonnavigable tributaries affecting navigable streams7 1 547 us 715 2006 2 33 usc 12511387 3 united states v rapanos 376 f3d 629 6th cir 2004 4 carabell v us army corps of engineers

considering the legislation that became the cwa of 19728 felt that the term was too constricted to define the reach of law whose purpose was not maintaining navigability but rather preventing pollution accordingly congress in the cwa retained the trad itional term navigable waters but defined it to mean waters of the united states9seemingly minimizing the constraint of navigability the conference report said that the new phrase wa s intended to be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation10 among the provisions in the 1972 clean water legislation was section 40411 which together with section 301a requires persons wishing to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters as newly defined to obtain permit from the us army corps of engineers12 the corps initial response to section 404 was to apply it solely to waters traditionally deemed navigable which included few wetland areas despite the broadening waters of the united states definition and conference report language under 1975 court order 13 however the corps issued new regulations that swept up range of wetlands14 this broadening ushered in debate continuing today as to which wetlands congress meant to reach in the section 404 permit program at one time or another the debate has occupied all three branches of the federal government as the title of this report indicates rapanos and carabell are not the supreme courts first foray into the section 404 jurisdictional quagmire15 in 1985 in riverside bayview homes inc v united states 16 the court unanimously upheld as reasonable the corps extension of its section 404 jurisdiction to adjacent wetlandsas one component of its definition of waters of the united states17 under the corps regulations adjacent wetlands are wetlands adjacent to any nonwetland waterbody that constitutes water of the united statessuch as navigable bodies of water or interstate waters or their tributaries the court reasoned that the waterquality objectives of the cwa were broad and sensitive to the fact that water moves in hydrologic cycles due to the frequent difficulties in defining where water ends and land begins the court could not say that the corps conclusion that adjacent wetlands are inseparably bound up with waters of the united states was unreasonable particularly given the deference owed to the corps and epas ecological expertise also persuasive was the fact that in considering the 1977 amendments to the cwa congress vigorously debated but ultimately rejected amendments that would have narrowed the corps asserted jurisdiction under section 404 8 pl 92500 to be precise the 1972 enactment was titled the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 it was only after the 1977 amendments thereto that the act as whole became known as the clean water act 9 cwa 5027 33 usc 13627 10 conference report srept 921236 at 144 reprinted in 1972 us code cong admin news 3776 3822 11 33 usc 1344 12 section 301a 33

decision in solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers swancc 18 directly involved the isolated waters component of the corps definition of waters of the united states19 rather than the adjacent wetlands component at issue above isolated waters in cwa parlance the regulations dont actually use the phrase are waters that are not traditional navigable waters are not interstate are not tributaries of the foregoing and are not hydrologically connected to navigable or interstate waters or their tributariesbut whose use degradation or destruction nonetheless could affect interstate commerce 20 illustrative examples listed in the regulations include intrastate lakes rivers streams including intermittent streams mudflats sandflats wetlands sloughs or prairie potholes21 with an interstate commerce nexus or connection the issue before the court was whether waters of the united states is broad enough to embrace the corps assertion of jurisdiction over such isolated waters purely on the ground that they are or might be used by migratory birds that cross state linesknown as the migratory bird rule in 54 ruling the majority opinion held that the migratory bird rule was not authorized by the cwa the decisions rationale was much broader however appearing to preclude federal assertion of 404 jurisdiction over isolated nonnavigable intrastate waters on any basisindeed over wetlands not adjacent to open water 22 this disparity between the courts holding and its rationale occasioned considerable litigation in the lower courts the majority of which opted for narrow reading of swancc hence broad reading of remaining corps jurisdiction under section 404 such uncertainties as to the corps isolated waters jurisdiction after swancc focused attention on the alternative bases in corps regulations for asserting 404 jurisdictionsuch as the existence of adjacent wetlands neither the corps of engineers nor epa however has modified its section 404 regulations since swancc 23 the new spotlight on the concept of adjacent wetlands is the backdrop for the supreme courts consideration of rapanos and carabell two adjacent wetlands cases

united states in 2000 seeking penalties for the filling of three michigan wetlands without section 404 permit in separate federal criminal action mr rapanos was convicted in 1995 of illegally discharging fill material into protected wetlands as in riverside bayview the issue was the corps jurisdiction under the adjacent wetlands component of its regulations defining waters of the united states in particular plaintiffs argued that swancc did more than throw out the migratory bird rule it also barred section 404 regulation of wetlands th at do not physically abut traditional navigable water in ruling that section 404 reached the rapanos wetlands the sixth circuit held that immediate adjacency of the wetland to traditional navigable water is not required rather what is needed is significant nexusa ubiquitous phrase in section 404 court decisions lifted from swancc s explanation of riverside bayview24between the wetlands and traditional navigable waters significant nexus in turn can be satisfied by the presence of hydrological connection thus the fact that the rapanos wetlands had surface water connections to nearby tributaries of traditional navigable waters was sufficient for section 404 jurisdiction nor did it seem to matter to the court that the hydrological connection to traditional navigable waters was for at least one of the rapanos wetlands distantsurface waters from this wetland flow into manmade drain immediately north of the site which empties into creek which flows into navigable river according to the record this wetland is betw een eleven and twenty miles from the nearest navigableinfact water in ruling that surface water connection to tributary of navigable water was enough the circuit aligned itself with the large majority of appellate courts to rule on this issue since swancc in its petition for certiorari to the supreme court the rapanoses asked whether the cwa s reach extends to nonnavigable wetlands that do not even abut navigable water if hydrological connection matter how tenuous or remote is all that is required the rapanos petition also asked whether such cwa jurisdiction would exceed congress power under the commerce clause carabell v us army corps of engineers wetlands adjacent to tributary manmade ditch that ultimately flows into traditional navig able watersbut wetlands separated from the tributary by manmade berm like the rapanoses the carabells owned wetland tract in michigan they wished to develop it for condominium project unlike the rapanoses the carabells pursued the required wetlands permitting processstate then federal the carabell case was their challenge to the corps denial of the section 404 permit and raised among other things the issue of whether the corps had jurisdiction over the wetland the sixth circuit held that adjacent wetlands jurisdiction existed under the corps regulations even though the wetland was separated from tributary of waters of the united states by fourfootwide manmade berm that blocked immediate drainage of surface water from the parcel to the tributary 25 the existence of the berm meant critically that unlike the wetlands in rapanos 24 swancc

waters at all parenthetically the fact that the tributary was merely manmade ditch which emptied into creek which flowed into navigable lake did not appear to be an issue in the case as it was in rapanos finally the court endorsed the view of the majority of courts addressing the question that swancc spoke only to the corps isolated waters jurisdiction it did not narrow the agencys adjacent wetlands authority involved here and broadly construed in riverside bayview in its petition for certiorari the carabells asked whether section 404 extends to wetlands that are hydrologically isolated from any of the waters of the united states if so the petition asked the same followup question as in rapanos would such cwa jurisdiction exceed congress power under the commerce clause

decision addressing the sixth circuit decisions in both rapanos and carabell was disappointment in three major opinions the court split 414 as to whether the corps assertions of 404 jurisdiction in the two cases before it co mported with the cwathat is involved waters of the united states justice scalia wrote fourjustice plurality opinion ruling that the corps had overreached and thus the sixth circuit decisions must be vacated and remanded for further proceedings applying the pluralitys rule justice kennedy in lone concurrence also disagreed with the corps interpretation of the cwa but w ould have applied different approach than the plurality he supplied the fifth vote supporting the vacation and remand making that the judgment of the court five votes is majori ty on the supreme court finally justice stevens wrote fourjustice dissent upholding the corps reading of its jurisdiction accordingly he would have affirmed the decisions below 26 the problem is that single rationale in these three opinions commands the support of majority of the justices thus lower courts addressing challenges to corps 404 jurisdiction are struggling with what rule of decision to extract from rapanos taking their cue from either the scalia plurality decision or the kennedy concurrence more on this later that being so it behooves us to examine both these two opinions with brief mention of the dissent justice scalias plurality opinion asserts what is probably the narrowest view of 404 jurisdiction in the three major opinions at least in most circumstances his opening paragraphs set the tone by describing the substantial costs of applying for 404 permits and the immense expansion of federal regulation of land use that has occurred under the clean water act27 this critical tone continues with the opinions description of how the lower courts even after swancc have continued to uphold the sweeping assertions of jurisdiction by the corps over tributaries and adjacent wetlands28 justice scalia continued by construing waters in waters of the united states to mean only relatively permanent standing or flowing bodies of water such as streams rivers lakes and 26 in addition to these three major opin ions chief justice roberts wrote brie f opinion concurring with the plurality and justice breyer wrote brief opinion concurring with the dissenters 27 547 us at 722 28 id at 726

definition leads him to exclude channels containing merely intermittent or ephemeral flow30 wetlands our topic here are included as waters of the united statesthat is are adjacent in the corps languageonly when they have continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the united states in their own right by contrast wetlands with only an intermittent physically remote hydrological connection to waters of the united states are not covered by section 404 according to the scalia opinion importantly the plurality sought to calm concerns that narrow reading of section 404 would eviscerate other sections of the cwa particularly the pointsource permitting program under section 402 that is the heart of the act that section the plurality explained does not require that the point source discharge directly into jurisdictional water it is enough that the discharged pollutant is likely to ultimately be carried downstream to such jurisdictional water thus unlike with section 404 discharges into noncovered waters could still be regulated in contrast to the absolute rules proposed by the plurality justice kennedys concurring opinion proposed casebycase test he picks up on the signi ficant nexus test used by the sixth circuit and many other courtsbut while the lower courts defined significant nexus as having hydrological connection with traditional navigable waters 31 justice kennedy used an ambiguous ecological test32 wetland he declared has the requisite significant nexus if alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region it significantly affects the chemical physical and biological integrity of traditional navigable waters33 these ecological functions include flood retention pollutant trapping and filtration under kennedys opinion the waters that perform these functions may be intermittent or ephemeral and they need not have surface hydrological connection to other waters when in contrast their effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial the wetland is beyond section 404s reach 34 this formulation justice kennedy explained allows that when the corps seeks to regulate wetlands adjacent to navigableinfact waters adjacency is enough for jurisdiction in contrast for wetlands sought to be regulated based on adjacency to nonnavigable tributaries significant nexus must be shown on casebycase basis importantly however the justice did allow that the corps might adopt regulations at some point declaring certain categories of wetlands to have significant nexus per obviating the casebycase approach for those wetlands each of the foregoing views the pluralitys and justice kennedys rejects the hitherto prevailing view that any hydrological connection to traditionally navigable water matter how distant is sufficient for coverage this any hydrological connection test had been key element of the united states assertions of adjacent wetlands jurisdiction 29 id at 732733 30 id at 733734 31 hydrological connection is the test that the corps has used to demonstrate significant nexus 32 soon after rapanos was decided federal district court commented that justice kennedys opinion advanced an ambiguous testwhether significant nexus exists to waters that areweremight be navigable this test leaves guidance on how to implement its vague subjective centerpiece united states v

jurisdiction reasonable in both cases the courts earlier decision in riverside bayview the dissenters argue was not confined to wetlands having continuous surface flow with traditional navigable waters or their tributaries rather it had endorsed jurisdiction over nonisolated wetlands generally without casebycase analysis the pluralitys concerns about the costs of applying for permit they continued are more properly addressed to congress not to court g14g142g144g138g149g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 the jurisdictional questions raised by rapanos and carabell presented the supreme court with perfect storm of hotbutton issues first there is the federalism matter where do cwa section 404 and the constitutions commerce clause draw the line between federal and state authority over wetlands second there are property rights concerns some 75 of jurisdictional wetlands in the lower 48 states are on private property w ith the result that protests from property owners denied section 404 permits or subjected to unacceptable conditions on same are often heard sometimes in the courts through fifth amendment takings suits third rapanos and carabell have pervasive significance within the cwa itself since waters of the united states governs not only the section 404 wetlands permitting program but also multiple other provisions and requirements of that law see discussion belo w under policy implications in addition the corps broad reading of its jurisdiction created novel semantics such as viewing dry arroyos as waters and manmade ditches as tributaries that justices inclined to more literal readings of statutory language would have hard time accepting it was not surprising in light of the above themes that the justices split as they did the four more conservative justices rejecting the corps expansive view of its adjacent wetland jurisdiction the four liberalmoderates upholding it and ju stice kennedy coming down in between as he often does with casebycase test at least until the corps adopts new rules the question as noted earlier is what rule of decision the lower courts will discern in rapanos with its absence of majority rationale for use in future cases in practice courts often look for common approaches supported by majority of the justices looking both to the views of plurality justices supporting the judgment of the court in the case and those of the dissenters who do not support the judgment thus far lower courts applying rapanos have drawn different tests from the decision as was predicted based on its fractured nature five federal circuits have ruled so farthree holding that the kennedy significant nexus test controls 35 one accepting justice stevenss suggestion that wetland satisfying either the kennedy or plurality tests is jurisdictional36 and one avoiding the issue by finding that the kennedy test plurality test and even the dissents test were all satisfied37 as the footnotes below show the supreme court has declined to review each of the these circuit decisions possibly because with change in justices since rapanos it is unable to agree on how to clarify the decision district court decisions at

test38 there appears to be reported decision squarely holding that the plurality test alone governs39 to considerable extent the court decisions turn on how the courts read supreme court guidance on what rule of law may be inferred from decisions of the court in which rationale commands the support of five or more justices the united states for its part has consistently taken the kennedyorplurality position in litigation as it did in congressional testimony soon after the rapanos decision 40 and in the corpsepa guidance on interpreting rapanos discussed below in the wake of rapanos several factors arguably put pressure on the corps and epa to do rulemaking on the scope of adjacent wetlands permitting jurisdiction under the cwa assuming congress does not act one is the fact that fewer than three of the opinions in rapanos urged the agencies to do so41 second factor is the laborintensive nature and vagueness of the kennedy casebycase approach requiring empirical study of each wetland near nonnavigable tributary the third factor is the divergence of the lower courts as to the rule to be applied after rapanos one can be confident however that anything the corps and epa promulgate will find its way into the courts at this time whether the agencies will go beyond their interpretive guidance to an actual rewrite of regulations is unclear the agencies state in the guidance that further consideration of jurisdictional issues including clarification and definition of key terminology may be appropriate in the future either through issuance of additional guidance or through rulemaking 42 all of the rapanos opinions that mention swancc seem to accept without discussion that swancc eliminates jurisdictional coverage of all isolated intrastate nonnavigable watersnot just those isolated intrastate nonnavigable waters where the sole basis for asserting jurisdiction was the migratory bird rule most lower court decisions to broach this issue had adopted the latter narrower reading of swancc thus although only adjacent wetlands were directly involved in rapanos there may be impacts on the corps authority over isolated intrastate nonnavigable waters also 38see eg united states v evans 2006 westlaw 2221629 md fla 2006 kennedy test or plurality test environmental protection information center v pacific lumber co 469 f supp 2d

the commerce clause issue the decision in rapanos as expected was on purely statutory grounds the plurality however did assert that the corps view of its adjacent wetlands jurisdiction stretches the outer limits of congress commerce power43 using this as one of several reasons for adopting narrow reading of that jurisdiction this plurality view is plainly relevant to congressional bills seeking to overturn swancc and rapanos by amending the cwa to explicitly assert jurisdiction over waters to the fullest extent consistent with the constitution

their field offices on how rapanos should be interpreted in jurisdictional determinations agency enforcement actions and other agency actions the guidance does not impose legally binding requirements on epa or the corps and may not apply in particular circumstance the corps and epa had previously issued other guidance attempting to clarify the courts rulings on the jurisdictional issues discussed here following the rapanos ruling the agencies first issued informal guidance in 2006 it was replaced by formal guidance in june 2007 the december 2008 guidance made limited changes to the 2007

first traditional navigable waters 45 and their adjacent wetlands under this test the existence of continuous surface connection as demanded by the plurality but not kennedy or the dissenters is required to establish adjacency categorical waters of the united states also include non navigable tributaries of traditional navigable waters where such tributaries are relatively permanent waters ie typically flowing yearround or at least seasonally and adjacent wetlands with continuous surface connection to such tribut aries not separated by uplands berms etc the 2008 revised guidance clarifies that wetland is adjacent if it has an unbroken hydrologic connection to jurisdictional waters or is separated from those waters by berm or similar feature or if it is in reasonably close proximity to jurisdictional water 2 waterbodies that are waters of the united states on casebycase basis are those dependent on finding of significant nexus with traditional navigable water per the kennedy 43 547

relatively permanent such as intermittent and ephemeral streams and their adjacent wetlands and wetlands adjacent to but that do not directly abut relatively permanent nonnavigable tributary the guidance states that in making the site and factspecific analysis to determine significant nexus the agencies will evaluate hydrology eg proximity to traditional navigable waters ecologic factors eg ability of wetlands to trap and filter pollutants or store flood waters and flow characteristics flow and functions of the tributary and adjacent wetlands the purpose of these tests is to demonstrate connection and the role of tributary and any adjacent wetlands in protecting the chemical physical and biological integrity of downstream traditional navigable waters 3 waterbodies not generally considered waters of the united states are swales or erosional features eg gullies and ditches including roadside ditches excavated wholly in and draining only uplands and that do not carry relatively permanent flow of water the agencies generally will not assert jurisdiction over these waterbodies to provide greater transparency of decisionmaking the 2007 guidance required the corps and epa to be more thorough in documenting their jurisdictional determinations than in the past to meet this requirement the corps is now using standardized documentation form and is posting results on district websites 46 these steps respond to criticism such as detailed in gao report that corps district offices have used differing practices in making jurisdictional determinations and that few districts made their documentation public 47 the 2007 guidance and accompanying corpsepa memoranda48 included several procedural changes that affected the regulatory progra m guidance issued in 2003 following the swancc ruling required corps districts to seek headquarters concurrence for actions where they would assert jurisdiction over nonnavigable intrastate waters including wetlands the 2007 guidance replaced coordination procedures that were established after swancc to require that all decisions involving such waters be elevated for corps headquarters review regardless whether jurisdiction is asserted or not in addition the 2007guidance provided an opportunity for epa to review and coordinate the determination at higher level if there is dispute regarding an action undergoing significant nexus evaluation industry groups have complained that the extra scrutiny adds costly delay overall stakeholder groups including industry environmental advocates and states have expressed disappointment or frustration with the 2007 guidance and 2008 revisionsome believing that it goes too far in narrowing protection of wetlands and us waters others believing that it does not go far enough generally most agree that implementing the significant nexus test is especially difficult because the guidance is complicated and vague industry groups said that because there are clear guideposts on this key point the guidance fails to provide the certainty desired by the regulated community environmentalists said that the significant nexus test in the guidance is more limited than the standard described by justice kennedy because although his opinion recognizes the impact of losing wetlands or other small tributaries on large 46 the corps has eight us divisions which generally

in evaluating significant nexus the guidance focuses only on tributary and wetlands adjacent to that tributary the 2008 revised guidance did not modify the 2007 guidance with respect to evaluating significant nexus overall industry groups reportedly believe that the 2008 revisions provide modest improvement over the earlier guidance and could make some jurisdictional determinations easier but environmental advocates assert that the guidance substantially limits the waters that will be protected by the clean water act50 one issue that has caused considerable confusion following the rapanos ruling concerns cwa jurisdiction over wetlands not immediately adja cent to traditional navigable watersincluding how jurisdiction will be applied in states within the seventh and ninth circuits where appellate courts have subsequently said that the kennedy test alone is controlling as noted the 2008 guidance adds some clarification about determin ing adjacency but continuing questions about this and other interpretive issues are possible it is also possible that the guidance will continue to evolve the 2008 revisions were made after epa and the corps reviewed public comments on the 2007 guidance and evaluated the agencies own implementation of the guidance however they noted in 2008 the agencies will continue to monitor implementation of the rapanos guidance and as we gain experience consider appropriate opportunities to provide additional guidance or to initiate rulemaking 51 this statement encourages those who argue that revised regulations are needed to resolve lingering interpretive questions others contend that legislative remedy is required the potential for litigation to challenge the guidance is unclear epa and the corps acknowledge that questions are likely to remain and noted in 2007 while todays guidance provides more clarity for how decisions of the jurisdictional status of nonnavigable tributaries and their adjacent wetlands will be made it is likely that legal challenges to the scope of cwa jurisdiction will continue 52 since the initial 2007 guidance was issued the cwa permitting process has become more complex and is slower according to many

instances where the enforcement priority of case was lowered due to jurisdictional concerns and 61 cases where lack of cwa jurisdiction has been asserted as an affirmative defense in an enforcement case the memorandum goes on to say the greatest burden on the government results from the implied presumption of nonjurisdiction in the plurality test for the most common types of waters in our country intermittent and ephemeral tributaries to traditionally navigable waters and headwater wetlands this presumptive exclusion can only be overcome by resourceintensive significant nexus analysis the kennedy test described in the guidance the memorandum recommended few targeted revisions to the guidance that oeca believes would address these issues while remaining consistent with the rapanos decision for example it recommended revising the guidance to incorporate justice kennedys suggestions that when evaluating jurisdiction it is appropriate to consider wetlands either alone or in combination with other similarly situated lands in the region the 2008 revised guidance did not address this recommendation echoing the epa memorandum corps official stated at may 2008 conference that making jurisdictional determinations is 8 to 10 times more resourceintensive for corps staff who must consider multitude of factors to determine what constitutes significant nexus representatives of developers and environmental advocates concurred that the joint guidance exacerbates permitting delays 54 concern about this reported impact on cwa enforcement drew the attention of two house committee chairmen th eir staffs reviewed large number of epa and corps documents and concluded that there has been significant decline in cwa inspections investigations and enforcement actions since the rapanos ruling and the 2007 guidance55 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 as with the legal questions the policy questions associated with these caseswhat should be the outer limit of cwa regulatory jurisdiction and what are the consequences of restricting that jurisdictionalso have challenged regulators landowners and developers and policymakers since passage of the act in 1972 the act prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters without permit and it also prohibits discharges of pollutants from any point source to navigable waters without permit disputes have centered on whether wetlands and other waters are navigable waters legal term of art the answer to this question is important because it may determine the extent of federal cwa regulatory authority not only for the section 404 program but also for purposes of implementing other cwa programs critics of the section 404 regulatory program such as land developers and agriculture interests argue that the corps wetlands program has gradually and illegally expanded its asserted jurisdiction since 1972 they want the corps and epa to give up jurisdiction over most nonnavigable tributaries and allow other federal and state programs to fill whatever gap is created 54 kinney jeff clean water act jurisdictional d ecisions slower more complex

regulatory requirements of the cwa standards discharge limitations permits and enforcement nonjurisdictional waters in contrast do not have the federal legal protection of those requirements the act has one definition of navigable waters that applies to the entire law the definition applies to federal prohibition on discharges of pollutants section 301 requirements to obtain permit prior to discharge sections 402 and 404 water quality standards and measures to attain them section 303 oil spill liability and oil spill prevention and control measures section 311 certification that federally permitted activities comply with state water quality standards section 401 and enforcement section 309 it impacts the oil pollution act and other environmental laws as well for example the reach of the endangered species act is affected because that acts requirement for consultation by federal agencies over impacts on threatened or endangered species is triggered through the issuance of federal permits 56 thus by removing the need for cwa permit nonjurisdictional determination would eliminate consultation as well as discussed above the scalia opinion in rapanos concluded that narrow interpretation of the corps 404 jurisdiction would not impact these other provisions but many observers contend that the question is not fully resolved epa said in june 2007 that it may issue additional guidance concerning the effect of rapanos on other cwa programs that use the common waters of the united states definition57 but it has not done so in march 2008 epa officials reportedly asked states to assist in developing guidance to govern cwa jurisdiction decisions under section 402 because of continuing uncertainty on the laws scope especially in western states that have preponderance of intermittent and ephemeral streams 58 swancc found invalid the assertion of cwa jurisdiction over isolated nonnavigable intrastate waters solely on the basis of their use or potential use as habitat by migratory birds most of the post swancc cases have instead addressed tributaries and adjacent wetlands asking which of these have the significant nexus to navigable waters swancc was interpreted to say is necessary to establish federal jurisdiction wetlands are an important part of the total aquatic ecosystem with many recognized functions and values including water storage mitigating the effects of floods and droughts water purification and filtering recreation habitat for plants and animals food production and open space and aesthetic values functional values both ecological and economic at each wetland depend on its location size and relationship to adjacent land and water areas to the layman many of these values are more obvious for wetlands adjacent to large rivers and streams than they are for wetlands and small streams that are isolated in the landscape from other waters many of the functions and values of wetlands have been recognized only recently historically many federal programs encouraged wetlands to be drained or altered because they were seen as having little value even today while more federal laws either encourage wetland protection or regulate their modification pressure exists to modify drain or develop wetlands for uses that some see as more economically beneficial while regulators and the regulated community debate the legal dimensions of federal jurisdiction scientists contend that there are discrete scientifically supportable boundaries or criteria along the continuum of waterswetlands to separate them into meaningful

the importance of the functions and values of wetlands in support of their significant nexus to navigable waters59 in all but some very narrow instances scientists say terms such as isolated waters and adjacent wetlands are artificial legal or regulatory constructs not valid scientific classifications from this perspective even waters and wetlands that lack direct surface connection to navigable waters or that only flow intermittently are connected to the larger aquatic ecosystem via subsurface or overflow hydrologic connections wetland scientists believe that all such waterswetlands are critical for protecting the integrity of waters habitat and wildlife downstream in swancc the supreme court did not draw bright lin for purposes of determining the limits of federal jurisdiction many wetland scientists do not believe that bright line is possible in any case while the ruling reduced federal jurisdiction over some previously regulated wetlands even more than six years later it remains difficult to determine the precise effect of that decision many affected interests states and the regulated community contend that the 2003 guidance from the corps and epa did not adequately define the scope of regulated areas and wetlands affected by swancc and subsequent court rulings 60 the rapanoses and the carabells had hoped that the supreme court would clarify the jurisdiction issue and that the court would further narrow the programs geographic reach other interest groups disagreed with the petitioners views on the issues but also had hoped for clarity most say that the 414 ruling in which the three main opinions did not agree on what constitutes waters of the united states did not bring the desired clarity of meaning in legal and policy terms estimates of the types of wetlands and amounts of acreage affected by swancc rapanos and subsequent lower court rulings depend on interpretation of the cases and on assumptions about defining key terms such as adjacent tributary and significant nexus because in its regulations before swancc the corps had broadly defined waters of the united states including those encompassed by the migratory bird rule nearly all us wetlands and waters were subject to cwa jurisdiction since practically all are used to greater or lesser extent by migratory birds 61 depending on how key terms are defined reduced federal jurisdiction could affect very small or very large categories of waters and wetlands reflecting the uncertainties about how broadly or narrowly swancc would be interpreted one estimate made after that decision found that the possible changes in jurisdiction could range from 20 to 80 of the nations total estimated 100 million acres of wetlands 62 following the rapanos decision concern was expressed particularly about that rulings impacts in arid and semiarid western states to exclude intermittent or ephemeral streams and adjacent wetlands and riparian areas from cwa jurisdiction reduction in cwa jurisdiction affects implementation of the 404 and possibly other cwa programs early in 2006 epa estimated conservatively that the extent of nonnavigable tributaries and adjacent wetlands that could be affected by the narrow reading of the clean water 59 leibowitz scott g isolated wetlands and th eir functions an ecological perspective wetlands vol 23 3 september 2003 pp 517531 60 see eg us

was up to 59 of the total length of streams in the united states excluding alaska epa also estimated that 34 of industrial and municipal dischargers that are subject to cwa section 402 permits are located on these stream segments and that public drinking water systems which use intakes on these segments provide drinking water to over 110 million people63 because there is national database of non navigable tributaries epa analyzed surrogate data on the linear extent of intermittentephemeral streams and stream segments that lie at the head of tributary systems and have other streams flowing into them in terms of stream hierarchy these waters are often referred to as firstorder streams some estimate that the smallest or headwater first and secondorder streams represent about 75 of the nations stream network these streams if left unprotected by expansive interpretation of the courts rulings are at risk from variety of polluting activities due to urbanization construction and channelization for flood control purposes 64 in explaining the new guidance the corps and epa said we expect that many of these intermittent and ephemeral streams will be able to satisfy one of the standards established in the rapanos decision but that it will take time to evaluate casespecific data65 as noted the uncertainties resulting from the rapanos decision led to widespread anticipation that the corps and epa would take administrative action to clarify how they interpret the ruling and its impact on waters that are protected by the clean water act corps and epa officials testified before senate subcommittee in august 2006 that the agencies were working on substantive interpretive guidance to clarify cwa jurisdiction in light of the decision 66the guidance that was eventually released in june 2007 and was revised in december 2008 while many observers acknowledged that guidance will be useful some have argued that the corps must initiate rulemaking to revise its regulationsespecially since three justices in some fashion suggested one thus far the government has not committed to issuing new rules new regulations may clarify many current questions but are unlikely to please all of the competing interests as one environmental advocate observed however rulemaking would only benefit wetlands if it did not reduce the jurisdiction offered by current regulations and if the administration remained faithful to sound science if politics were to trump science in the rulemaking process the likelihood of such protective rule would not be promising also rules are subject to legal challenge and can be tied up in court for years before they are implemented 67 g8g146g149g149g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g9g138g153g156g561 whatever gaps in wetland

the wetlands reserve program and the coastal wetlands restoration program or private conservation efforts can provide protection even if the wetland is longer jurisdictional under federal law68 however others respond that such programs are likely to be incomplete in fill ing gaps since they apply primarily to rural areas and do not apply to the onethird of the nations lands in federal ownership moreover they were never intended to be seamless group that would fill all possible gaps swancc rapanos and the subsequent lower court decisions also highlight the role of states in protecting waters not addressed by federal law from the states perspective the federal section 404 program provides the basis for consistent national approach to wetlands protection but if larger portion of wetlands are longer jurisdictional they say it can be argued that the section 404 program longer provides baseline for consistent minimum standards to regulate wetlands none of these court rulings prevents states from protecting nonjurisdictional waters through legislative or administrative action but few states have done so prior to swancc 15 states had programs that regulate isolated freshwater wetlands to some degree but state officials acknowledge that these programs vary substantially from some that are comprehensive in scope to others that are limited by wetland size or have exemptions for agriculture and other activities 69 since 2001 few states have passed new legislation or updated water quality regulations the issue remains under consideration in several states where competing proposals that are viewed by some as strengthening and by others as weakening wetland protection are being debated 70 although some states have authorities to regulate waters of their state their ability to regulate effectively may be compromised because state rules often are tied to federal definitions the gap produced by reduced federal jurisdiction is most evident in the 32 states that have independent wetlands programs and that typically have relied on cwa section 401 water quality certification procedures to protect wetlands pursuant to section 401 applicants for federal permit must obtain state certification that the project will comply with state water quality standards consequently by conditioning certification states have the ability to affect the federal permit and to exercise some regulatory control over wetlands without the expense of establishing independent state programs however as desc ribed previously diminished cwa jurisdiction which affects the section 404 program also limits the reach of other cwa programs including section 401 analysts familiar with the political and fiscal environments of states believe that most states are either reluctant or unable to step boldly into the breach in federal wetlands protection the corps and the us environmental protection agency not to mention congress have little cause to rely on the notion that states will effectively backstop federal protection for isolated wetlands 71 many states are barred from enacting laws more stringent than federal rules or are reluctant to take action due to budgetary and resource concerns as well as apprehension that regulation will be judged to involve taking of private property and require compensation 68 us environmental protection agency advance

that the corps may pursueis legislative action to affirm congress intention regarding cwa jurisdiction others contend that although the rapanos decision did not resolve the issues it also did not substantially affect congress willingness or interest in acting on issues that have been pending for several years without congressional action related to this is the view that because the current questions are highly technical in nature simple fix may not address the problem or may create others such as impacting rights that the cwa reserves to states in the 109 th congress bills were introduced to address the cwa jurisdictional issues in different ways but congress took action one proposal the clean water authority restoration act of 2005 would have provided broad statutory defini tion of waters of the united states would have clarified that the cwa is intended to protect us waters from pollution not just maintain their navigability and would have included set of findings to assert constitutional authority over waters and wetlands other legislation intended to restrict regulatory jurisdiction also was introduced the federal wetlands jurisdiction act of 2005 it would have narrowed the statutory definition of navigable waters and defined certain isolated wetlands that are not adjacent to navigable waters or nonnavigable tributaries and other areas such as waters connected to jurisdictional waters by ephemeral waters ditches or pipelines as not being subject to federal regulatory jurisdiction legislation similar to the clean water authority restoration act of 2005 was introduced in the 110 th congress hr 2421 the clean water restoration act of 2007 and s 1870 slightly different bill also titled the clean water restoration act of 2007 the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings on hr 2421 and related jurisdictional issues on july 17 and july 19 2007 and third hearing on april 16 2008 the senate environment and public works committee held nonlegislative hearing on issues related to the rapanos and swancc rulings on december 13 2007 and legislative hearing on s 1870 on april 9 2008 proponents of the legislation contend that congress must clarify the important issues left unsettled by the supreme courts 2001 and 2006 rulings and by the 2007 corpsepa guidance bill sponsors argue that the legislation would reaffirm what congress intended when the cwa was enacted in 1972 and what epa and the corps have subsequently been practicing until recently in terms of cwa jurisdiction however critics assert that by making activities that affect waters of the united states in addition to discharges subject to the cwa s jurisdiction the legislation would expand federal authority and thus would have consequences that are likely to increase confusion rather than settle it critics question the constitutionality of the bill arguing that by including all nonnavigable waters in the jurisdiction of the cwa it exceeds the limits of congresss authority under the commerce clause supporters contend that the legislation is properly grounded in congresss commerce power in light of the widely differing views of proponents and opponents future prospects for this legislation are uncertain at the end of the 110 th congress proponents were reportedly discussi ng options for advancing the legislation but further
