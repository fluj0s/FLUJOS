possess or license sensitive personal information15 information security laws are designed to protect personally identifiable information from compromise unauthorized disclosure unauthorized acquisition unauthorized access or other situations where unauthorized persons have access or potential access to personally identifiable information for unauthorized purposes data breach notification laws typically require covered entities to implement breach notification policy and include requirements for incident reporting and handling and external breach notification single federal law or regulation governs the security of all types of sensitive personal information determining which federal law regulation and guidance is applicable depends in part on the entity or sector that collected the information and the type of information collected under federal law certain sectors are legally obligated to protect certain types of sensitive personal information these obligations were created in large part when federal privacy legislation was enacted in the credit financial services health care government securities and internet sectors federal regulations were issued to require certain entities to implement information security programs and provide breach notice to affected persons 16 the applicability of particular law depends in part on the information owner for example there are federal information security requirements applicable to all federal government agencies and federal information security law applicable to sole federal department veterans affairs in the private sector different laws apply to private sector entities engaged in different businesses this is what is commonly referred to as sectoral approach to the protection of personal information some critics say that current laws focus too closely on industryspecific uses of information like credit reports or medical data rather than on protecting the privacy of individuals 17 others believe the sectoral approach to the protection of personal information reflects not only variations in the types of information collected eg government private sector health financial etc but also differences in the regulatory framework for particular sectors others advocate national standard for entities that maintain personal info rmation in order to harmonize legal obligations18 the type of information collected also determines in part whether particular law is applicable information on individuals collected maintained or processed by covered entity is regulated in some cases laws scope extends to information created received maintained or transmitted on behalf of covered entity by contractor or subcontractor another approach taken is where the law targets specific category of information eg federal agency health customer financial 15 for discussion of section 222 of the communications act of 1934 as amended 47 usc 222 which establishes duty for telecommunications carrier

misuse has occurred or is reasonably possible it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with criminal investigation and provides the institution with written request for the delay the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will longer interfere with the investigation if financial institution can determine which customers information has been improperly accessed it may limit notification to those customers whose information it determines has been misused or is reasonably likely to be misused in situations where the institution determines that group of files has been accessed improperly but is unable to identify which specific customers information has been accessed and the institution determines that misuse of the information is reasonably possible it should notify all customers in the group the guidelines also
