chad c haddal analyst in immigration policy january 6 2009 abstract the data in this report shows that there is uniform inﬂow trend across oecd countries relating to refugees or asylumseekers one of the main ﬁndings is that several oecd countries with historically greater numbers of asylumseekers such as the united states have had the levels of their asylumseeker inﬂows converge5 moreover the level at which these asylumseeker levels have converged is in most cases markedly lower than asylumseeker inﬂows during the 1990s other oecd countriesmainly those on the periphery of the euhave recently experienced an upward trend in the asylumseeker inﬂows this pattern is likely due to their geographic proximity to noneu countries and the existence of safe third country provisions concept discussed later in this report additionally refugee data demonstrates that the united states continues to be the main host country of resettled refugees both in the oecd and worldwide despite lower numbers of refugee resettlements in the united states from decade ago the number of refugee resettlements in other oecd countries has also declined therefore the resettlement burden of the united states as compared to other oecd countries has remained consistenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117crs report for congress prepared for members and committees of congress refugee and asylumseeker inflows

and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service summary refugee is person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion asylumseekers are individuals that claim to be refugees and apply for sanctuary from within potential host country but whose claim for refugee status has not yet been evaluated and determined the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr collects data on the millions of refugees and asylumseekers worldwide and their inflows to the united states and other countries including member states of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the recent economic downturn could lead to an escalation in the worldwide supply of refugees and asylumseekers thus potential issue for congress is whether the united states should increase admissions of asylumseekers and refugees during worldwide economic downturn maintain current admission levels or whether the economic circumstances warrant diverting refugee resources to other concerns in terms of refugee populations the united states is one of 13 oecd countries that participates in largescale resettlement of refugees its leadership role in refugee resettlement is substantial for every year since 1994 the total unhcrregistered refugee resettlements to the united states have exceeded the cumulative total for all other oecd member states resettlement levels relative to the rest of the oecd however have declined since the mid1990s because of security concerns and political sensitivities over immigration numerous oecd countries have moved to restrict the inflows of asylumseekers through unilateral measures or multilateral agreements particularly in countries that are members of the european union eu in the united states numerous measures for inflow control have been implemented some of which other oecd countries have mirrored efforts such as the safe thirdcountry agreements and various cost control programsas well as forthcoming securitybased efforts in the european unionhave lowered asylumseeker inflow rates in the major receiving oecd countries in recent years the united states proportion of asylumseeker inflows in 2007 registered at 17 of the oecd cumulative total germany france canada and the united kingdom each received approximately 69 of the asylumseeker inflows the data in this report show that there is uniform inflow trend across oecd countries relating to refugees or asylumseekers one of the main observations is that several oecd countries with historically greater numbers of asylumseekers such as the united states have had the levels of their asylumseeker inflows converge with each other moreover the level at which these asylumseeker levels have converged is in most cases markedly lower than asylumseeker inflows during the 1990s other oecd countriesmainly those on the periphery of the euhave recently experienced an upward trend in asylumseeker inflows this pattern is likely due to safe third country provisions and their geographic proximity to noneuropean union countries one set of comparative measures frequently employed is the relative burdens for countries hosting refugees when placed in the context of national income the united states on average took on larger refugee hosting burden than almost every other oecd country from 2002 to 2006 only germany had higher relative burden than the united states the united states average relative burden was lower than that of 14 other oecd countries between 2002 and 2006 this report will be updated as necessary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117refugee and asylumseeker inflows in

and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service 1 introduction worldwide there are millions of people that flee their homes and cross international borders due to threatening circumstances including refugees and asylumseekers refugee is person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion asylumseekers are individuals that claim to be refugees and apply for sanctuary from within potential host country but whose claim for refugee status have not yet been evaluated and determined the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcran agency mandated to lead and coordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwideattempts to register and assist as much of this population as possible unhcr contributes to statistical database that allows for the tracking and analysis of what it describes as populations of concern that includes asylumseekers and refugees specifically this database allows for the comparison of refugee and asylumseeker inflows and populations in the united states and other countries such as member states of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 1 unhcr data generally show that the united states ranks among the highest recipients of refugees and asylumseekers in the oecd2 while the refugee and asylumseeker situation has been of concern to policymakers for many years the recent economic downturn may hold implications for the worldwide population of concern international slowdowns in the availability of capital as well as the accompanying unemployment means that resources shortages are developing due to tightening government revenues some countries may develop shortages of vital food and agricultural imports which could lead to foodbased migration and displacement resource shortages have historically also served as the basis for conflict which could mean an escalation in the worldwide supply of refugees and asylumseekers yet the united states is also being severely impacted by the economic downturn and the demand for government assistance is growing thus potential issue for congress is whether the united states should increase its admissions of asylumseekers and refugees during worldwide economic downturn maintain current admission levels or whether the economic circumstances warrant diverting refugee resources to other concerns providing comparative and historical analysis of refugee and asylumseeker inflows to the united states is of particular informational value especially relative to other oecd countries3 such information informs members of congress as to how policies in the united states and the rest of the oecd are impacting refugee and asylumseeker inflows and populations other crs 1 historically the oecd has served as consortium of advanced industrial countries the oecd has as its mission to promote democracy and market economies by providing forum where governments compare policy experiences seek answers to common problems identify good practice and coordinate domestic and international policies oecd about oecd online at httpwwwoecdorg it has process by which countries may be invited for membership and be included in the reports and analyses so long as they meet certain accession criteria eg democracy rule of law human rights thus membership in the oecd may be used as proxy for countries with economies in more advanced stages of development 2 although the oecd publishes some of its own analysis of refugee and asylumseeker flows to oecd countries the data employed in these publications stems from the unhcr database oecd findings are generally published in international migration outlook also known as sopemi published annually by the oecd 3 there are currently 30 full members of the oecd australia

service 2 products provide extensive discussion of united states refugee and asylum policy4 the aim of this report however is to provide members of congress with comparative data context various patterns will be extracted from the data and the inflows to the united states will be analyzed in comparison to other oecd member states the policy analysis will provide some discussions regarding policy developments in oecd countries that may impact their respective inflows of refugees and asylumseekers the vast majority of these policies relate to the flows of asylumseekers since this group tends to foster less political support in the oecd the data in this report shows that there is uniform inflow trend across oecd countries relating to refugees or asylumseekers one of the main findings is that several oecd countries with historically greater numbers of asylumseekers such as the united states have had the levels of their asylumseeker inflows converge 5 moreover the level at which these asylum seeker levels have converged is in most cases markedly lower than asylumseeker inflows during the 1990s other oecd countriesmainly those on the periphery of the euhave recently experienced an upward trend in the asylumseeker inflows this pattern is likely due to their geographic proximity to noneu countries and the existence of safe third country provisions concept discussed later in this report additionally refugee data demonstrates that the united states continues to be the main host country of resettled refugees both in the oecd and worldwide despite lower numbers of refugee resettlements in the united states from decade ago the number of refugee resettlements in other oecd countries has also declined therefore the resettlement burden of the united states as compared to other oecd countries has remained consistent concepts and definitionalcontextual background refugee policy in the united states and other oecd countries is rooted in postworld war ii context as state parties to the convention relating to the status of refugees of 1951 and the subsequent 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees 6 all member states of the oecd have committed themselves to admitting an unspecified number of individuals fleeing persecution the intent of the convention was to end an ad hoc approach to refugee admissions and resettlement that had previously characterized refugee policy the united states has adopted the principles of the convention in statute 7 after state officially grants sanctuary to an individual under the 1951 convention and 1967 protocol the state is obligated to provide law abiding admitted refugees with many of the same rights and privileges that citizens enjoy such as access to courts the right to pursue gainful employment public education medical access artistic expression and the like these rights and privileges do not necessarily extend to individuals that have not been officially granted protective status yet under the principal of nonrefoulment which prohibits the expulsion or involuntary return of refugee or person seeking asylum to 4 for background on the international context see crs report rl31689 us international refugee assistance issues for congress by rhoda margesson and crs report rl31690 united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr by rhoda margesson and johanna bockman 5 the term converge is used throughout this report in reference to the range of various country inflows becoming smaller thus countries with converging levels are witnessing increasingly similar inflow levels 6 these agreements are more commonly referred to as the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol or in some cases the new york protocol united nations convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees geneva switzerland united nations high commissioner for refugees 2006 hereafter cited as united nations convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees 7 see immigration and

life or freedom would be threatenedall parties to the 1951 convention or 1967 protocol must provide some evaluation of claims for sanctuary from persons within its jurisdiction in oecd countries sanctuary is normally offered on permanent basis us context for the united states two historical elements were essential in shaping current us law 1 the conflicts in south and central america in the 1970s and 1980s and 2 the collapse of the former soviet union each of these factors compelled policymakers to examine the mechanisms for dealing with displaced populations seeking admission these events caused policymakers to conclude that the previous ad hoc refugee efforts were inadequate for dealing with such populations and in the late 1970s steps were taken by congress towards codifying such measures into statute that eventually became part of current law the admission of refugees to the united states and their resettlement are authorized by the immigration and nationality act ina as amended by the refugee act of 1980 8 the 1980 act had the dual purposes of providing uniform procedure for refugee admissions and authorizing federal assistance to resettle refugees and promote their selfsufficiency under the ina refugee is person who is outside his or her country and who is unable or unwilling to return because of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion refugees are processed and admitted to the united states from abroad 9 in addition to refugees the ina also employs the notion of asylees aliens present in the united states may apply for asylum with the united states citizenship and immigration services bureau uscis in the department of homeland security dhs after arrival into the country or they may seek asylum before the department of justices executive office for immigration review eoir during removal proceedings aliens arriving at us port who lack proper immigration documents or who engage in fraud or misrepresentation are placed in expedited removal however if they express fear of persecution they receive credible fear review with an uscis asylum officer andif found credibleare referred to an eoir immigration judge for hearing 10 us law also specifically addresses certain populations when civil unrest violence or natural disasters erupt in spots around the world concerns arise over the safety of nationals from these troubled places who are in the united states humanitarian provisions exist in the ina to offer temporary protected status tps or relief from removal under specified circumstances 11 the ina also contains other ongoing provisions for certain country nationals12 8 the ina is act of june 27 1952 ch 477 codified as amended

person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of particular social group or political opinion is outside of the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country asylumseeker person who has made claim that he or she is refugee but whose claim for refugee status has not yet been evaluated and determined internally displaced person idp person who has been forced to move from his of her home but remains inside the country of his or her nationality population of concern an overarching term used by the unhcr to cumulatively describe refugees asylumseekers idps stateless persons and other victims who have been displaced or are in need of protection migrant according to unhcr wideranging term that concerns most people who move to foreign country for variety of reasons and for certain length of time immigrant person who takes up permanent residence in country other than his or her homeland economic migrant person who leaves hisher country for financialeconomic reasons rather than refugee reasons while the us approach to refugee issues is anchored in the ina the unhcr approach for dealing with refugee issues is rooted in global context refugees and asylumseekers are subset of larger population that unhcr refers to as populations of concern this larger population can also include such individuals as internally displaced persons idps stateless individuals or other victims who have been displaced or are in need of protection while both asylumseekers and refugees claim to have been persecuted or fear they could become victims of persecution under unhcrs definition they are distinct populations for classification purposes before their request for asylum has been granted however these individuals are classified as asylumseekers for classification purposes unhcr categorizes most people fleeing their home country as refugees if they have not specifically applied for sanctuary from the host country refugees and asylumseekers that are registered as part of the unhcr population of concern undergo status determination these status determinations are set of evaluation procedures used to determine their eligibility for sanctuary in host country while the 1951 convention and 1967 protocol establish standard by which to evaluate claims for sanctuary individual states receiving applications retain the right to determine their own procedures for recognizing and granting protective status evaluations of refugees and asylumseekers are usually conducted by national governmentsponsored program 13 through program administered by unhcr 14 or continued and issues by ruth ellen wasem and crs report rs21349 us immigration policy on haitian migrants by ruth ellen wasem 13 when an individual applies for sanctuary in given country that country is normally responsible for determining whether the individual is to be granted official refugee status in oecd countries such status determinations occur mostly with asylumseekers although for some countries it may involve refugee resettlement populations as well these obligations usually exist within the countrys national legislation and derive from the 1951 convention some oecd countries will also conduct their own efforts to identify refugees for resettlement concurrent to unhcr the united states is one of the few oecd countries with concurrent national program resettlement identification efforts although referrals from unhcr are the norm the united states accepts resettlement referrals from several sources 1 unhcr 2 us embassies and 3 designated voluntary agencies that provide assistance to refugees overseas it is us policy to admit at least half of the refugees referred by unhcr for resettlement each year depending on the continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117refugee and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service 5 through jointly operated program15 shared by unhcr and the respective national government16 yet despite the existence of unhcr evaluation programs the potential host country has the final authority to grant sanctuary within its borders overview unhcrs population of concern as mentioned above the unhcr tracks official data worldwide on groups and individuals labeled as unhcr populations of concerna classification that includes several categories such as refugees asylumseekers idps and other populations of concern in 2007 the worldwide population of concern was approximately 317 million of this population approximately 36 were refugees 2 were asylumseekers with pending cases 43 were internally displaced persons and the remaining 19 were other populations of concern eg stateless persons note that these figures represent those registered with unhcr but do not represent the full total worldwide as many are not registered as shown in figure 1 the period between 1998 and 2007 witnessed shift within the unhcrs population of concern for most of the time period there was downward trend in the refugee population yet in 2007 the yearoveryear growth number of refugees rose by 15 to approximately 114 million due mainly to the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 17 asylumseekers experienced declining numbers during the latter half of the 10year period asylumseekers dropped from peak in 2001 of 11 million asylumseekers to roughly 740000 at the end of 2007 decline of 32 persons categorized as other populations of concern increased notably in recent years before declining in 2007 to 57 million yet the population that has undergone the largest absolute change in the previous few years has been the worldwide

in country with an existing resettlement agreement mandated by the unhcrs charter resettlements are used as protection tool and durable solution for resettled individuals among oecd countries the united states is somewhat unique in its continued participation in largescale resettlement of refugees the majority of oecd countries do not participate at all in refugee resettlement and fulfill 1951 convention terms by processing asylumseekers that arrive within their borders in the past decade only 12 other oecd member states have participated in refugee resettlement 18 and one of those

inflows the depiction of refugee resettlement in industrialized countries in figure 3 below reveals the large refugee resettlement inflows into the united states relative to other oecd countries for every year since 1994 the total inflows to the united states have exceeded the cumulative total for all other oecd member states although the inflow level was multiple times higher than the remaining oecd countries during the mid1990s the two levels nearly converged in 2002 and 2003 this trend toward convergence was mostly due to declining inflows into the united states following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 us refugee inflow levels dropped by approximately 76 from 1994 to 2002 since 2002 the united states has experienced general upward trend and in 2007 the united states resettled over 48000 refugees comparatively the cumulative total for other oecd countries has remained more consistent fluctuating in range between 2200032000 resettlements annually from 1996 to 2007 another notable aspect of figure 3 is the depiction of refugee resettlement to the united states and other oecd countries in relation to unhcrs worldwide refugee population total 19 while the oecd as whole has annually resettled at least 50000 refugees since 1994 these inflows have not exceeded 1 of the worldwide refugee population for given year because the process for refugee resettlement is challenging and resourceintensive relatively few refugees are chosen or even eligible for resettlement according to unhcr the selectivity of resettlement must remain focused on protecting refugees who are at risk in addition refugee resettlement requires close coordination with national governments and nongovernmental organizations ngos these agencies frequently work with unhcr in the identification and screening of resettlement candidates and facilitating such interaction can be both time and resourceintensive although some observers argue that the 1 proportion indicates that more refugees could be resettled in industrialized countries the numbers in figure 3 speak equally to the significant size of the refugee population in the world what is more apparent from figure 3 is that the fluctuations in the proportion of refugees resettled to the worldwide refugee total could be largely attributed to the changes in inflows to the united states from 1994 through 2001 the contribution of the united states to refugee resettlement in all oecd countries hovered between 73 and 77 consequently the ratio of the worldwide population being resettled in other oecd countries largely mirrored the resettlement pattern to the united states this mirroring pattern continued when this same ratio experienced large drop in 2002 since 2003 the mirroring pattern has continued although the relatively large change in the ratio is likely more attributable to worldwide decline in the refugee population during this period than due to changes in united states inflows also the share of refugee inflows to the united states as percentage of total oecd refugee resettlement inflows ranged between 5867 from 2003 to 2007 consequently while the united states st ill accounts for ro ughly twothirds of refugee resettlements in oecd countries its share has diminished somewhat since the mid1990s 19 this worldwide refugee population total does not include the other categories

yearbook 2007 trends in displacement protection and solutions geneva unhcr 2008 migration concerns and political values the policy approaches that countries have taken towards refugees and asylumseekers has been largely intertwined with the political value countries have placed on immigration in general while countries such as the united states canada and australia have traditionally had relatively proactive immigration policies many european countries have not historically accepted many immigrants and have practiced highly restrictive legal immigration policies these divergent immigrant experiences are partly reflected in the united states willingness to accept hundreds of thousands of permanent immigrants annually consequently refugees have constituted smaller share of permanent inflows into the united states 20 by comparison most european countries tend to prefer admitting foreign nationals on temporary basis and in many european countries asylum has become main avenue for entry and perceived loophole for immigration the sizable inflows of asylumseekers to many european countries has led to perception in number of states that their asylum systems are overburdened in many countries the expenditure of resources towards special accommodations financial assistance and providing temporary 20 in fy2008 the ceiling for refugee admissions was 80000 compared to 70000 from the previous six fiscal years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117refugee and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service 10 employment has led to dissatisfaction with the asylum system additionally the wave of migrants that arrived in western europe with the collapse of the soviet union and communist control over eastern europe placed burden on public resources that many european policymakers are not eager to see repeated thus many of the restrictive policy trends that are noted in subsequent sections have emerged out of these political developments in europe over the last two decades moreover the lack of geographic barriers make travel to europe less strenuous and as result make some countries on the european periphery especially susceptible to asylum seeker inflows an additional development affecting asylumseeker and refugee policies in european oecd member states has been the expanded number of member states in the european union eu for eu member states their nationals may freely travel settle and seek employment in other member states while such an arrangement should benefit the economic development of the entire eu area in the long term political and cultural concerns have been raised about the impact this openness may have on various countries moreover since countries cannot restrict flows from within the eu area they have shown greater eagerness to restrict unwanted flows from outside thus asylumseekers have become prominent target for certain proponents of immigration restriction eu countries are increasingly attempting to coordinate immigration and asylumseeker policies such as the recently passed european pact on immigration and asylum 21 the inflow of large numbers of unauthorized immigrants has prompted security concerns amongst policymakers in europe as it has in the united states the new european securitybased provisions are likely to impact asylumseekers since the proposed changes to eu policy will be based upon the concept of country reception capacitythereby suggesting that inflows to each country beyond the level of reception capacity constitutes security risk 22 for many oecd countries however the most confounding factor is illegal migration the difficulty for many countries is separating illegal economic migrants from actual asylumseekers that have migrated inside their borders moreover asylumseekers may have economic considerations when migrating to destination country although less than 1 of unhcr populations of concern

economic migrants to travel to these states in either an authorized or unauthorized manner but not necessarily for asylumseekers more recent asylumseeker policies throughout the oecd however have seemingly been based upon the assumption that asylumseekers are economically rational actors similar to many illegal immigrants the response in the united states and throughout other oecd states has been to develop proactive measures to control the flows of asylumseekers by way of unilateral measures or via multilateral agreements efforts such as safe thirdcountry agreements and various cost control programs have been the likely cause of the convergence of asylumseeker inflow levels in certain oecd countries with historically higher inflow rates convergence that is depicted in figure 4 inflow control number of efforts to control the inflow of asylumseekers embrace concept that political scientists refer to as beggar thy neighbor commonly used to refer to protectionist trade barriers the term describes policy whereby the objective or benefit sought by one country is achieved at the expense of others in the case of asylum flows number of oecd countries have employed mechanisms and advocated policies that transfer the asylumhosting obligations and costs to other countries while some advocates view this shift as avoiding obligations others contend that it constitutes an equitable distribution of cost in sheltering asylumseekers and refugees few of these policy mechanismsdiscussed in the sections beloware employed in the united states while others are more unique to other oecd member states asylumseekers in the united states controlling the mass inflow of asylumseekers has been concern of us policymakers for decades 24 prior to 1996 aliens arriving at port of entry to the united states without proper immigration documents were eligible for hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether the aliens were admissible aliens lacking proper documents could request asylum in the united states at that time if the alien received an unfavorable decision from the immigration judge he or she also could seek administrative and judicial review of the case critics of this policy argued that illegal aliens were arriving without proper documents filing frivolous asylum claims and obtaining work authorizations while their asylum cases stalled in lengthy backlogs the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira 25 made substantial changes to the asylum process including establishing expedited removal proceedings codifying many regulatory changes adding time limits on filing claims and limiting judicial review in certain circumstances but it did not alter the numerical limits on asylee adjustments foreign nationals arriving without proper documents who express to the immigration officer fear of being returned home must be kept in detention while their credible fear cases are continued opportunity to screen candidates from outside its borders yet academic analysis of asylumseeker behavior has suggested that once compelled to flee their country of origin asylumseekers may undergo similar costbenefit calculations as economic migrants in addition to employment considerations the costbenefit calculations of asylumseekers tend to account for such factors as cultural adjustments the preexisting family or group ties

research service 12 pending26 moreover the reforms established serious consequences for aliens who file frivolous asylum applications iirira also codified many regulatory revisions of the asylum process that the former george hw bush and clinton administrations made most notably aliens are statutorily prohibited from immediately receiving work authorization at the same time as the filing of their asylum application now the asylum applicant is required to wait 150 days after the uscis receives hisher complete asylum application before applying for work authorization 27 the uscis then has 30 days to grant or deny the request iirira also added provision that enabled refugees or asylees to request asylum on the basis of persecution resulting from resistance to coercive population control policies but the number of aliens eligible to receive asylum under this provision was limited to 1000 each year safe third country one form of cost shift and inflow control in the oecd has been through safe third country provisions safe third country is country the asylumseeker has passed through route to the receiving country and with which the receiving country has reciprocal agreement under safe thirdcountry agreement the receiving country can refuse to make an asylum determination if the safe third country the country an asylumseeker passed through is technically responsible for examining the application 28 these types of arrangements are most common among the oecd states that belong to the eu major recipients of refugee flows in the eu have generally advocated such agreements between the eu member states as it allows these countries to shift some asylum determination responsibilities to other countries without violating the direct terms of the 1951 convention or 1967 protocol the unhcr has stated that responsibilitysharing agreements between states can when appropriate safeguards are in place enhance the international protection of refugees by ensuring the orderly handling of asylum applications the united states has only one similar arrangement in place the uscanada safe third country agreement 29 effective since december 29 2004 the program is run

same time period canadian authorities returned 303 individuals to the united states as result of the application of the agreement 33 the concept of safe thirdcountry mechanism first emerged in 1990 as part of the socalled dublin convention of eu member states34 the objective of this convention was to determine which member state would be responsible for examining an application for asyluma matter not explicitly declared in the 1951 convention or 1967 protocol35 the parties agreed to abide by the order of responsibility laid out in the dublin convention and subsequent agreements included conditions for accepting third country asylumseekers critics however have contended that adequate safeguards are sometimes not in place one of the main concerns about the concept of safe third countries for asylumseekers has been its potential for unilateral application by receiving country without bilateral agreement removing asylumseekers from receiving country to third country could result in refusal by the third country to accept the asylumseeker critics have referred to such phenomenon as refugeesinorbit wherein the asylumseeker is deported from country to country until government chooses to accept the asylumseeker in the eu third country responsibilities are required between member states but the same requirements are not applicable to nonmember states 36 eu

in dublin ireland on june 15 1990 was named after the location where the diplomatic relations occurred the original 12 signatories to the dublin convention were belgium denmark france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal spain and the united kingdom prior to the member states recognizing each other as safe third countries the notion had been based on the unilateral decisions of individuals states by 1998 the agreement had been extended to austria finland and sweden 35 the 1990 dublin convention addressed these issues by explicitly setting out rules for determining which countries had adjudication responsibility under number of potential asylumseeking scenarios the agreement took effect on september 1 1997 and was subsequently adopted by later parties to the agreement in 2003 the agreement was replaced by the socalled dublin ii regulations the 2003 regulations were intended to build on the asylumseeker determination responsibilities

agreements has resulted in numerous eu member states having mismatched lists of safe third countries presumably because of different interpretations of what constitutes compliance with the 1951 convention since 1999 38 the eu has been working toward harmonizing minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status including creating an eu list of third countries as safe countries of origin39 several other oecd countries outside the european union have set up their own bilateral safe third country provisions safe thirdcountry provisions have likely caused some shift in the distribution of asylumseekers among oecd countries with high inflow rates such as the united kingdom as country located in the northeastern region of europeand thus effectively containing buffer zone from many asylumseeker countries of originone would expect to see notable number of asylumseekers categorized as not subject to asylum consideration because of the availability of safe third country cumulatively from 1996 through 2007 the united kingdom refused consideration to roughly 20200 principal applicants but annually it never accounted for more than 8 of all asylum applications during that time period 40 deterrence mechanisms notable cause of shifting burdens of asylumseeker inflows in some oecd countries has been policy mechanisms designed to control flow rates and deter fraud and abuse working on the belief that asylumseekers are economically rational numerous governments and immigration critics across the oecd area have argued that some migrants engage in socalled asylum shoppingthe practice of applying for asylum in several countries in order to maximize the likelihood of positive asylum determination andor receiving the most generous public benefits the united states has implemented deterrence mechanisms among other ways through the previously discussed expedited removal mechanism as well as the ongoing efforts to implement the provisions of the real id act 41 several tactics have been attempted or implemented in various other oecd countries most widespread has been the development of shared databases on asylumseekers the inclusion of fingerprints and other biometric identifiers in systems like eurodac 42 as well as the issuance in some cases of special identification cards43 provides governments with improved tools

were aimed at preventing asylum fraud illegal immigration and human smuggling the first of these efforts was voucher program for asylumseekers that was implemented in place of cashbased social security benefits although small cash allowances were also received asylumseekers were required to collect vouchers for most purchases at the post office and use the voucher in place of cash or credit at businesses review of the program by the uk home office found that the voucher scheme had encountered number of operational problems such as business owners refusing to accept vouchers moreover complaints from asylumseekers and advocates claimed that the program was causing further stigmatization of asylumseekers and that many users suffered embarrassment 47 the uk government eventually did away with the voucher program in 2002 and instead instituted smart card identification requirements including biometric identifiers such as fingerprints48 in the united states such voucher program has not been attempted as the ina bans asylumseekers from receiving any public benefits until they become legal permanent residents49 44 jim brunsden eu agrees wideranging immigration plans european voice

immigration and asylum act of 1996 and its mandate that local authorities be responsible for the care of asylumseekers few local governments began their own dispersal actions through private contracts and lobbied for greater burden sharing subsequently the government implemented the immigration and asylum act of 1999 which included dispersal scheme to send asylumseekers throughout the united kingdom with the objective of controlling asylumseeker inflows the national government has maintained that dispersion has been necessary to more widely distribute service costs among municipalities 51 yet some observers believe the policy has been unduly harsh52 in addition news reports have sometimes linked the dispersal policy with increased incidences of racism harassment and violence against refugees and asylumseekers53 studies have suggested that improved communication efforts between local authorities national government and refugee groups could potentially improve the tensions between asylumseekers and local populations 54 whether or not these mechanisms effectively deterred asylum remains unclear from 1996 to 2002 new asylum applications in the united kingdom increased by 248 to 103080 applications in 2002 yet in subsequent years the levels dropped by 73 to level of 27905 in 2007 55 because of the cluster of asylum flow control measures being implemented in both the united kingdom and european union during this time period multiple factors likely contributed to the downturn in applications for advocacy groups however the introduction of programs partially aimed at controlling asylum flows raises numerous normative questions about asylum policy in the united kingdom and elsewhere thus despite the recent reduction in new asylum applications tensions surrounding deterrence mechanisms and asylumseekers remain catalyst for political and social divisions 56 50 concentration of asylumseekers in sectors of major urban areas has occurred in number of european

policies the beggar thy neighbor policy approach within the european union has elevated concerns among numerous observers causing some advocates and academics to label the eu as fortress europe57 while empirical data do not support the implication that the eu member states nor other oecd countries for that matter are closing off asylumseeker inflows entirely statistics do indicate that there have been marked inflow level shifts downward in several traditionally larger receiving countries for asylumseekers asylumseekers represent the largest inflow population into oecd countries table a1 in appendix shows that the inflows of asylumseekers into oecd countries has declined in recent years the table also includes information for eu countries in total the oecd took in 638539 asylumseekers in 2001 while in 2005 this number had been reduced to 319050 drop of 50 the corresponding drop in the worldwide asylumseeker population was 29 58 although these trends are likely the results of inflow control policies implemented by the various countries other factors such as regional stability cannot be ruled out as causal variables convergence and increases within the oecd data shows that the larger states have begun converging in the number of asylumseeker admissions the convergence point sits at lower inflow level than during the previous decade for most of the countries in other countries however pattern of increasing inflows has emerged overall asylumseeker inflows to the oecd still exceed historical lows from the past two decades convergence of asylumseeker inflows to illustrate the aforementioned convergence pattern figure 4 below maps out the asylum seekers from 1996 to 2007 of five recipient countries in the oecd with historically large inflow levels the united states france the united kingdom germany and canada from the illustration the convergence trend of these five countries becomes evident while these countries still vary in their respective annual refugee admissions the range of these admissions in 1996 was 28 times greater than in 2007 this convergence has been driven by both decreases in some countries and increases in others for example the united states inflow rate dropped by 35 from 1995 to 2007 by 2001 germany and the united kingdom were each experiencing higher asylumseeker inflows than any other oecd member states although the five major recipient countries included in figure 4 witnessed fluctuations in their annual inflow levels over the entire interval all the countries exhibited downward trend beginning around 2002

asylumseeker inflows that ranged from low of 26 in 1996 to high of 51 in 2007 escalating asylumseeker inflows development that may be partially attributed to the thirdcountry policies in the european union is the significant increase in asylumseeker inflows in certain smaller member states these countries generally border noneu states and serve as either land or seabased access points to the eu unlike certain oecd states that are geographically prohibitive for refugees to reach other than by expensive and restrictive air travel such as australia new zealand or japan european states are

other european portal countries have also witnessed increases over the same span although most did not exhibit similar sized shifts in their relative inflow rates asylum decisions in countries with relatively high inflow levels of asylumseekers antiimmigrant groups have criticized their respective governments for being too permissive in their admissions policiesa factor that is in some cases cited as attracting more asylumseekers in response governments have focused their efforts on reducing incentives for asylumseekers with respect to public httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117refugee and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service 20 benefits as those discussed above yet for some critics the question remains whether higher rates of positive asylum decisions could create higher asylumseeker inflows causal relationship that could lend credence to the assumption of informed asylumseekers conducting rationalized asylum shopping if such relationship did exist one would reasonably expect that the countries with higher positive decision rates should demonstrate higher asylumseeker inflow rates the average annual rate of positive decisions for asylum applications where decision was taken shown in figure 6 indicates markedly large range between oecd countries from 2004 to 2007 59 on the one hand turkey had an annual positive decision rate of roughly 78 the highest of all oecd countries by contrast greece granted positive asylum decisions in 1 of cases where decision was taken this disparity in the decision rate occurred despite the inflows of thousands of asylumseekers annually to each country in the united states the average positive decision rate for 20042007 was higher than the majority of oecd countries the oecd average for this time period was 28 7 below that of the united states moreover these figures do not account for the additional number of asylumseekers that are granted asylum on appeal the main analytical conclusion that may be drawn from figure 6 is that the positive decision data demonstrate almost relation to the inflow levels of asylumseekers during the given time period for example in spite of different trends shown in figure 4 from figure 5 canada and poland have similar average positive asylum decision rates greece has one of the highest rates of increase in asylumseeker inflows in the oecd from 2004 to 2007 while simultaneously accounting for the lowest positive decision rate statistical analysis performed by crs confirms these visual observations 60 therefore while socalled asylum shopping might occur based on the public benefits country offers the evidence suggests that the recent rates of positive asylum decisions have been of little consequence for such behavior on asylumseeker inflow levels in general more likely the driving factors behind asylumseekers are the accessibility of country cultural and linguistic ties the existence of diaspora or family members and similar considerations 59 in many countries an initial rejection of an asylum application can be appealed or granted some form of administrative review the statistical figures on positive decisions in this report do not include administrative review data or rates on appeals 60 simple pearson correlation of average rate of positive decisions to average inflow level of asylumseekers was 05 for 20042007 meaning there was virtually statistical correlation between these two measures in other words change in the positive decision rate showed effectively relationship to any changes in inflows in statistics correlation indicates the strength and direction of linear relationship between two random variables the pearson correlation represents one way to calculate this relationship the correlation is 1 in the case of an increasing linear relationship 1 in the case of decreasing linear relationship and some value in between in all other cases these values indicate the degree of linear dependence between the variables the closer the coefficient is to either 1 or 1 the stronger the correlation between the variables in the cases where the variables are independent then the

counted more than once once at first instance and once on appeal these data allow analysts to monitor the number of positive decisio ns taken but they are not indicative of the final outcome of the procedure for negative decisions the decisions taken in these cases may include 1 recognition under the 1951 convention 2 complementary form of protection or 3 rejection the positive decision percentage is calculated by adding the 1951 convention recognitio n decisions and the complementary protection decision and subsequently dividing this sum by the total number of decisions taken cases

asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service 23 sanctuary capacity and contributions of oecd countries the preceding data analysis has largely been based on inflow levels while such analysis is both informative and valid in an overview of capacity for and contributions towards these populations it does not fully address the relative costs that countries experience from such inflows employing additional economic and demographic indicators would provide fuller view of refugee inflows in oecd member states therefore this section attempts to place these inflows into comparative context that emphasizes the relative burden of refugee populations in terms of economic costs and population size one approach to contextualizing inflows in oecd countries is to analyze countrys existing refugee population relative to the size of the national income and productivity the map shown in figure 7 shows these data and uses gross domestic product gdp 61 adjusted for purchasing power parity ppp62 to account for given countrys potential relative financial burden specifically figure 7 maps out the average number of refugees per 1 gdp ppp per capita from 2002 to 2006 thereby adjusting national income to both exchange rates and the size of the population this measure makes assumption about the longterm net costbenefit of refugee because such factors are entirely dependent on how economically integrated into the host country this population becomes the map in figure 7 demonstrates that when placed in the context of national income the united states has taken on larger refugee hosting burden than almost every other oecd country only germany with 263 refugees per 1 gdp ppp per capita had higher relative burden than the united states 109 on worldwide basis both the united states and germany ranked in the top 35 for this same measure moreover the map shows that the majority of oecd countries had an average population of one refugee per 1 gdp ppp per capita or less consequently the united states had an average burden at least 11 times greater than most oecd countries for the 2002 2006 time period relative to national income the lowestranked country in the oecd for this measure was iceland which had over 100 times fewer refugees than the united states relative to national income 61 the gross domestic product gdp is one of the measures of national income and output for given countrys economy gdp is defined as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within the country in given period of time usually calendar year 62 purchasing power parity ppp is an economic technique used when attempting to determine the relative values of two currencies it is useful because often the amount of goods currency can purchase within two nations varies drastically based on availability of goods demand for the goods and number of other difficult to determine factors purchasing power parity solves this problem by taking some international measure and determining the cost for that measure in each of the two currencies then comparing that amount in terms of the cost of countrybased activities using ppp allows for more accurate comparison by adjusting for some factors that affect cost variations thus ppp gives more accurate measure of countrys ability to pay httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117 refugee and

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117refugee and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states congressional research service 25 another way to contextualize burden sharing worldwide is to consider given countrys existing population such an approach removes economic conditions and considers refugees in terms of the number of residents in country this measure serves as one type of indicator for the demographic impact of refugee inflows depicted in figure 8 is world map showing the 2002 2006 average cumulative number of refugees to every 1000 inhabitants in each country unlike the measure for national income the united stateswith 17 refugees per 1000 inhabitantsfigured more toward the median of oecd countries for this demographic measure overall the ratio for the united states was lower than that of 14 other oecd countries and ranked 56 th worldwide the highest ratios among oecd countries were for sweden denmark germany and norway swedens ratio ranked 11 th worldwide thus the top 10 hosting countries for refugees per 1000 inhabitants worldwide were all outside the oecd63 plurality of oecd countries averaged 10 or fewer refugees per 1000 inhabitants from 2002 to 200664 63 the top ten countries for this measure were armenia 709 djibouti 356 serbia and montenegro 216 congo 211 chad 202 jordan 171 zambia 161 tanzania 159 iran 154 and guinea 124 64 third way to measure the hosting contribution of countries is to measure the refugee population relative to the geographic area this ratio can be useful to highlight the potential population density burden of additional inflows on smaller countries however as an indicator this ratio becomes problematic because of the builtassumptions that are not adjusted for for example country such as canada may have large areas of land and low aggregate population density but much of the area is either undeveloped or uninhabitable similarly such large countries may have areas which are protected from development thus without any adjustments conclusions drawn from this measure could bias results to be lower for countries with large areas of land but fewer effectively inhabitable areas

recipients of public benefits on per person basis in the united states yet as advocates will note the costs either presented or implied in the figures above do not convey the benefits of hosting refugee or asylumseeker populations many benefits cannot be quantified in monetary terms but nonetheless have affected host countries enormously in the united states for example refugee populations frequently contribute to multicultural diversity and global awareness in the population moreover some refugees that chose to remain have become successful entrepreneurs and strong contributors to economic development historically recipient countries have benefitted from the human capital that refugee populations have represented by using that human capital for intellectual and technological advancement in this regard notable refugees to the united states include nobel prize winner and scientist albert einstein and former secretary of state madeleine albright while costs of refugee resettlement and asylumseeker programs are necessary considerations for any government these costs must also be weighed against the many contributions to the political economic cultural and religious life that these populations make in oecd countries conclusion the findings of this report indicate that currently the united states resettles more refugees and has higher inflow rate of asylumseekers than any other oecd country despite having numerous deterrence mechanisms in place additionally the rate of positive asylum decisions when decision is taken is above the oecd average but the data also indicate that there are millions of refugees and other populations of concern worldwide and in recent years these populations have grown and with the worldwide economic downturn occurring these populations are likely to increase yet the united states is also being severely impacted by the economic downturn and the demand for government assistance is growing thus balancing the availability of resources against the demand for refugee assistance will likely continue httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40117 refugee and asylumseeker inflows in the united states and other oecd member states crs28 appendix
