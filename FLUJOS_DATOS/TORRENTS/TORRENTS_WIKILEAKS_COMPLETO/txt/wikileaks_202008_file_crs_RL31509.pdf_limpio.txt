defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31509europe and counterterrorism strengthening police and judicial cooperation summary the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states gave new momentum to european union eu initiatives to combat terrorism and other cross border crimes such as drug trafficking hum an trafficking and financial fraud for many years eu efforts to address such challenges were hampered by national sovereignty concerns insufficient res ources and lack of trust among law enforcement agencies howeve r the terrorist attacks nd the subsequent revelation of qaeda cells in europe changed this status quo as it became increasingly evident that the eus open borders and different legal systems allowed terrorists and other criminals to move around easily and evade arre st and prosecution thus eu officials renewed their efforts to harmonize nationa l laws and bring dow n traditional barriers among member states police intelligence and judicial authorities as part of this initiative the eu has also sought to enhance ongoing cooperation with us law enforcement and judicial authorities so that information can be meaningfully shared and suspects apprehended expeditiously the march 11 2004 terrorist bombings in madrid spain injected greater sense of urgency into eu efforts to boost police and judicial cooperation within the eu and improve eu external border contro ls despite the eus progress however the union faces number of political legal and cultural hurdles as it seeks to introduce more effective law enforcement tools for example some member states were slow to implement the euwide arrest warrant which eliminates extradition proceedings among member states for 32 offenses including terrorism and other eu legislative instruments to counter terrorism national police and intelligence services remain reluctant to share information contenti ous issues such as the use of the death penalty in the united states and different data pr otection regimes have also posed challenges at times to more robust useu cooperation the 911 commission recommended that the united states should engage other nations in developing comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism the house and senate have passed intelligence reform legislation hr 10 and s 2845 with elements that seek to enhance internationa l cooperation against terrorism the bush administration back ed by members of congress supports eu efforts to strengthen its counterterrorism capabilities and welcom initiatives aimed at complementing and improving existing bilateral cooperation between us and eu member states intelligence and law enforcement agencies the united states has concluded two informationsharing agreem ents with europol

to improve cooperation in the police and judicial fields among its 25 member states and with the united states1 the administration hopes that eu efforts will augment european counterterrorist capabilities pr omote better informationsharing among member states and ultimately lead to rooting out terrorist cells in europe that could be planning other attacks against us inte rests washington is keen to keep the dialogue with the union on such issues ope n viewing it as serving us interests to weigh in early and often give n europes role as key u s partner in international law enforcement efforts and the presence of terrorist cells in some eu countries this is in line with the 911 commissions recommendations that the united states should develop comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism exchange terrorist information with trusted allies and improve border security through better internati onal cooperati on some provisions in us inte lligence reform legislation passed by the house and senate hr 10 and s 2845 seek to enhance international collaboration against terrorism at the same time us officials claim they have been proceeding cautiously in pursuing more robust cooperation with the eu in order to avoid actions that could damage currently good bilateral relations or impede ongoing criminal investigations eu member states have long sought to improve police and judicial cooperation among themselves as part of the unions drive toward further political integration and its desire to create european area of freedom security and justice european interior and justice ministries law enforcem ent agencies and security services began cooperating informally in the mid1970s to combat terrorism and other crimes amid significant increase in crossborder travel by european citizens and other nationals the 1992 maastricht treaty on european ion formalized this intergovernmental cooperation into third pillar of justi ce and home affairs jha aimed at fostering common internal security measures and the free movement of people within eu borders2 despite this instituti onalization progress in the police and judicial fields was hampered for years by member states concerns about main taining sovereigntyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31509crs2 3 prior to the september 11 terrorist att acks only six eu members had specific anti terrorism legislation france germany it aly portugal spain and the united kingdom 4 the eus plan of action against terrorism also includes diplomatic humanitarian and economic assistance measures not addressed in this reportover national law enforcement authorities insufficient resources and lack of trust among police and intelligence agencies the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the subsequent revelation of qaeda cells in europe however served as wakeup call for eu governments in the weeks after the attacks police in many eu member states flushed out dozens of suspected terrorists linked to osama bin den germany and sp ain were identified as key logistical and planning bases for the attacks and numerous arrests were also carried out in belgium france italy and the united kingdom as the 911 commission notes qaeda was able to exploit relatively lax security environments in western europe this fact was readily appreciated by european leaders who quickly recognized that the eus open bor ders and different gal systems allowed terrorists and other criminals to move ar ound easily and evade arrest and prosecution most eu member states for ex ample lacked antiterrorist legislation or even legal definition of terrorism3 without strong evidence that suspect had committed crime common to all countries such as mu rder terrorists or their supporters were often able to avoid apprehension in one eu country by fleeing to another with different laws and criminal codes more over although suspects could travel among eu countries quickly extradition requests often took months or years to process since the attacks on the united states eu leaders have demonstrated renewed political commitment to boosting police and judicial cooperation both among member states and with us law enfo rcement counterparts the march 11 2004 terrorist bombings in madrid spain have further energized eu efforts to combat terrorism although many eu initiatives in the police and judicial fields are directed primarily against the terrorist threat obser vers note that several of them such as the euwide arrest warrant will also improve eu abilities to investigate and prosecute other transnationa l crimes and could be the first building blocks of an eventual eu judicial identity nevertheless translating these eu political agreements into effective law enforcem ent tools has not be easy number of political legal and cultural challenges remain progress to date eu leaders meeting in special emergency session made key decisions on september 21 2001 to boost police and judicial cooperation within the eu close off sources of terrorist financing and enha nce useu law enforcement coordination as part of comprehensive plan to counter terrorism4 they also endorsed detailed work

the eu views all of the measures agreed since september 2001 as essential to building common internal security area see appendix for additional background on the initiatives below and information on others boosting eu police and judicial cooperation the bulk of eu initiatives in the police and judicial fields set forth in september 2001 and march 2004 focus on establishing greater crossborder compatibility among eu member states criminal laws and imp roving cooperation among national police intelligence and judicial authorities key measures include the following establishing common eu definition of terrorism and common penalties in december 2001 eu member states reached political agreement that defines as terrorist offenses various types of crimes committed with the intent to in timidate population or destabilize countrys political or economic system it also standardizes penalties for par ticipating in terrorist group defining common eu list of terrorist organizations the eu maintains two lists of persons and entities with terrorist links one list is directed against persons and entities associated with osama bin laden qaeda and the taliban it essentially enacts into eu law security council sanctions against these individuals and groups the other eu list currently names 91 additional terrorist individuals and organizations base d both in europe and worldwide examples include the basque group eta the turkishbased kurdistan workers party pkk the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc and hamas all eu members must freeze the assets of those named on both lis ts and provide assistance to each other in related police investigations and legal proceedings creating an euwide arrest warrant in december 2001 eu governments reached political ag reement to implement an eu wide arrest warrant to eliminate the need for extradition proceedings among eu member states for di verse set of 32 offenses including terrorism as well as organized crime trafficking in persons corruption and murder eu offici als claim the arrest warrant will expedite the apprehension of criminals given that the entire process from arrest to surrender to the issuing authority must be

failed to meet this deadline strengthening eu police and judicial institutions the eu has been working to give europol its fledgling joint criminal intelligence body more assertive law enforcement role since 1999 europol has functioned as an information clearinghouse for crossborder crimes such as terro rism and drug trafficking for member states law enforcement ag encies europol currently has staff of 391 including 60 liaison officers from national police customs immigration and intelligence agencies in april 2002 eu leaders agreed to allow europol to ask national police services to launch specific criminal investigations and to participate in eventual eu joint investigation teams eu ropol agents will still be prohibited from detaining or arresting suspects and can only participate in joint investigations into crimes that fall within their mandate since september 11 the eu has also incr eased europols budget by almost 50 percent to pay for more staff nd growing counterterrorist duties for 2004 europols budget is roughly 74 million6 eurojust the eus nascent unit of prosecutors and magistrates was officially established in february 2002 it is charged with helping to coordinate the investig ation and prosecution of serious crossborder crimes in eu member states some eu officials would also like to bolster the eu chiefs of police task force which meets once every six months to foster more sy stematic information exchanges increasing cooperation among po lice and intelligence services following september 11 the eu called on member states police security and intelligence services to intensify informationsharing both among themselves and with eu ropol eu leaders directed the heads of eu police counterterrori st units to begin meeting and called on national security and intelligence services to consult on regular basis however many national services have remained reluctant to share information the march 11 2004 terrorist attacks in madrid highlighted this problem as reports surfaced that several of the madrid suspects were known to security services in spain and other eu states but fell through communication cracks since then the heads of the security services of the eus 25 members have established counterterrori st group committed to meeting regularly in brussels to exchange information and analysis on the terrorist threat the eu is also considering two new

financial investigative tools some have built on eu initiatives that date from before september 11 to clamp down on moneylaundering major fforts in this area have focused on the following aspects expanding the eus moneylaundering directive in november 2001 eu finance ministers agreed to broaden the scope of its 1991 directive on preventing the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering previous ly applicable only to drug trafficking proceeds to all serious crimes intended to include terrorism the directive also expa nds the types of professionals who must notify law enforcement of suspicious transactions whereas initially only those in the banking industry had such obligations now lawyers accountants and others deemed vulnerable to misuse by money launderers do as well in june 2004 the european commission proposed new moneylaundering directive that would consolidate the two previous dir ectives and expand the definition of moneylaundering to include legally acquired money used to financehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31509crs6 terrorism the new directive woul d also further extend the range of professions subject to reportin g requirements and enhance the knowyourcustomer rules eu finance ministers will now consider whether to adopt this new proposal establishing an euwide assetfreezing order in february 2002 eu justice and interior ministers reached political consensus on an agreement that will require national courts to enforce orders issued by other member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists and other criminals such orders could apply to investigations into any of the 32 offenses subject to the eu arrest warrant the eu formally adopted this initiative in july 2003 after six countries cleared the measure with their respective legislatures facilitating asset confiscation in august 2002 denmar k proposed two measures to ease the confisca tion of criminal assets throughout the eu in december 2002 memb er states reached political agreement on one of these proposal s which would relax the burden of proof but it has not yet been fo rmally adopted because two states must still gain approval from their national parliaments the other proposal related to the mutual forcement of confiscation orders was more controversial but political agreement was reached in june 2004 although these measures will apply to wide range of crimes it is hoped they will prove us eful tools in the fight against terrorism also strengthening external eu border controls eu progress on new proposals to counter terrorism and other crossborder crimes has been slowest in the border control area border control was the least well defined category of initiatives to emerge from the eus emergency sessions in september 2001 developments in this area have also been hampered because many are linked to eu efforts to decrease ille gal immigration which c ontinue to founder upon different national policy preferences and domestic po litical considerations in the spring of 2002 however eu leader s endorsed several measures aimed at preventing terrorists and common criminals from gaining footholds in the eus territory these centered on improving cooperation among national customs and immigration officials and combating visa and asylum fraud by 2003 the eu also began focusing greater attention on travel document security including the use of biometric information and pa ssenger data sharing the madrid attacks on march 11 2004 have given additional imp etus to efforts in these areas key initiatives to

initiatives such as the arrest warrant into national law by the end of june 2004 several member states however have still not fully met this goal in addition to sorting out these issues among 25 member states the eu is confronting challenges in improving co ordination with us law enforcement authorities and putting judicial relations with the united states on an euwide footing although some useu problem s are similar to obstacles facing the eu internally such as law enforcement communi cation issues or differences in terrorist definitions others have their origins in different legal

eu life that considerable lag times often exist between when an agreemen t is reached by eu leaders in brussels and when it is implemented or enforced at the national level often member states must alter their laws to bring them into line with eu decisions or directives following the march 2004 attacks in madr id the european commission released summary of eu legislative instruments to fight

enter into for ce in the czech republic in november 200416 some observers suggest that some eu member states may not implement all parts of the eu arrest warrant immediately they note that it may take germany austria denmark and greece five years or more to enact new constitutional provisions permitting their nationals to stand trial in other eu member states despite such possible delays all members will likely claim they are in compliance by 2004 because they will be able to execu the warrant against citizens of other states within their territory for example danish judicial officials could still execute the arrest warrant on french national wanted in germany17 other critics question how effective the eu counterterrorism coordinator will be in promoting the implementation of

interpretations despite eu efforts to harmonize national laws and criminal codes related to terrorism eu definitions and common penalties will still be open to interpretation by individual member states the european commission originally recommended specific standardized sanctions for terrorist activities ranging from maximum pe nalties in each member state of at least two to twenty years depending on the offense member states however could not agree on such exact penalties and f ound the proposed system too complicated as result specific penalties were spelled out for only two offenses leading terrorist group and participating in or fina ncing the activities of terro rist organization sanctions for other offenses such as murder kidnaping or hijacking are largely left to the discretion of each member state although the eu decision allows for the imposition of heavier sentence if the acts were committed with terrorist intent observers note that even for those sentences specified in the decision the maximumminimum construction leaves states free to set penalties as high as they want but also allows lesser sentences to be imposed june 2004 report by the european commission on the implementation of common eu definition of terrorism and common penalties found that considerable divergences still ex ist in the interpretation and transposition of these measures among the member states19 cultural barriers the eu views increasing communication and information sharing among members national police judicial and intelligence services as crucial to improving its ability to counter and pprehend terrorists nd other crossborder criminals this issue has received renewe d focus in the aftermath of the madrid bombings news reports indicate that veral individuals suspected in the madrid attacks were known to security services in spain and other eu states but this information was not shared as in the ited states longstanding law enforcement traditions against informationsharing as well as rivalries between and among the various local regional and national services must be overcome in order to improve cooperation and close security loopholes thus such cooperation is tall order because it will require changing wellen trenched police cultures and mentalities perhaps nowhere are such tensions mo re evident than in europol which is dependent on receiving information from member states law enforcement services jürgen storbeck europols director and former german po lice official summed the problem up this way for policem an information about his own case is like property he is even reluctant to give it to his chief or to nother department let alone giving it to the regional or national services for an international body like europol it is

austria and belgium in the wake of march 11 for creating centralized euwide intelligence agency the lack of common language in the eu can also pose problems for closer cooperation among police services especially at local or regional levels along the frenchbelgian border for example belg ian police officers are not required to speak french and most french police officers do not speak flemish and in some states such as germany where the history of its nazi past still weighs heavily legal prohibitions restricted informationsharing between police and intelligence services despite these difficulties eu officials c ounter that the changing nature of crime and the growth in crossborder terrorist and criminal organizations will increasingly force police agencies to cooperate at th national and interna tional level they recognize that building trust and fostering greater communication among these law enforcement authorities will take time but note that this is key reason for the eus backing of the european police college nd other common training programs they also point out that the probl ems facing the eu in this regard are not that different from those currently confronting the united states as it seeks to improve the flow of information among the fbi state and local police forces and customs officials to prevent suspected terrorists and other criminals from falling through the cracks21 lack of enforcement capabilities strengthening eu police and judicial institutions especially europol has emer ged as central piece of eu efforts to bolster cooperation ne vertheless critics point out that europol and eurojust are still largely talk shops remain minimally f unded and have few enforcement capabilities even though eu leaders have agreed that europol should have more operational role in crossborder investigations and the right to ask national authorities to initiate criminal investigations these new powers will not take effect until all national parliaments ratify the requi red changes to europols 1995 convention eurojust can recommend that national aut horities initiate an investig ation but cannot launch one itself data privacy issues have also sl owed some efforts to enhance europol and eurojusts capabilities for example eu leaders agreed in pr inciple in december 2002 to grant europol and eurojust par tial access to the schengen information system sis to help improve informationsharing but this has not yet been formally adopted because of ongoing data protection concerns the sis is an eu database used primarily by customs and immigration officials containing information on convicted or suspected criminals forg ed passports and stolen vehicles eu officials however believe these cr iticisms that europol and eurojust lack sufficient authority and the underlying assumption that these bodies provide little value are unfair they note that europol and eurojust are still in the early stages of development key current objectiv of these bodies is to foster closer coordination routine communication and gr eater trust among police intelligence and judicial offici als from the member states other proponents point out

national sovereignty and do mestic considerations traditionally law enforcement and criminal justice have been jealously guarded national prerogatives progress in building an eu police and judi cial sphere has thus been brought about through mutual recognition of member states legal systems rather than wholesale harmonization despite the eus achie vements since september 2001 in pushing forward its common judicial agenda some euwatchers maintain that member states will proceed cautiously leaders will resist measures that smack of eu judicial federalism thereby exposing th emselves politically to domestic opposition and public outcries that they are ceding national sovereignty to brussels many european politicians note the rise of extreme right parties like those in france and the netherlands that have made electoral ga ins partly on antieu platforms and number of antieu parties especially in the uk did very well in recent european parliament elections sk eptics suggest these concerns will inhibit europols development into the equivalent of the fbi or eurojusts maturation into european public prosecutors office able to initiate and direct criminal investigations as well as prosecute cases in national courts for th foreseeable future they point out that the proposal in the eus recentlyagr eed constitution to develop public prosecutors office limited to handling crimes against eu financia l interests provoked fierce british opposition initially the uk eventu ally relented how ever in order to secure other negotiating priorities furthermore skeptics suggest that enha ncing external eu border controls has been difficult because some member states have been reluctant to relinquish any control of national borders or police activity within them to brussels at the seville summit in june 2002 eu leaders stopped s hort of calling for common eu border guard corps for precisely this reason nd although agreement has been reached to soon establish the european borders ag ency critics conte nd it will have limited powers and resources and law enforcement role23 some analysts also point out that the effectiveness of eu efforts to strengthen external border controls w ill partly depend on the eus success in combating illegal immigration and sta ndardizing immigration and asylum rules throughout the eu for years eu attempts to do so were impeded by vastly

crossborder police deal the guardian november 7 2003states have reached politi cal agreement on package of measures to harmonize asylum rules managing other aspects of immigration and asylum policy remains complicated24 several common measures proposed over the last few years have been deemed excessively draconian by some member states and have been rejected for example in june 2002 britain and sp ain proposed suspending eu financial assistance to developing countries that failed to crack down on illegal immigration or refused to readmit their nationals france and sweden led the charge against this initiative they argued that imposing sanctions on development aid would only add to the poverty that forces people to migrate commentators noted that france whose bulk of both legal and illegal immigrants come from africa also feared that sanctions would upset its bilateral relations with those countries and produce domestic unrest at home similarly fr ance and sweden continue to oppose on human rights grounds proposals to establish as ylum centers outside the eu to process refugee claims other analysts argue that national sovereignty issues are becoming less important to many eu member states they claim that the eu continues to knit itself closer together on number of fronts and less integrationistminded states such as the uk ireland and denmark are in the minority for example many members including france germany and italy b ack the formation of an eu border police force these optimists also point out that some member states attitudes toward crossborder policing and arrest capabilities may be changing within the schengen area some hot pursuit bilateral agreements already exist between member states to allow each others police officers to pursue but not arrest suspects that cross into another members territory france however has found receptivity in germany belgium and spain to proposals that would gi ve their police forces the right of arrest on each others soil25 some view these bilateral arrangements as potentially paving the way for similar euwide accord in the future civil liberty concerns distrust among some mbers of other countries legal regimes and wariness bout the degree of protection they offer for individual civil rights may also pose obstacles to closer police and judi cial cooperation as noted earlier civil liberty concerns have slowed the passage of implementing legislation for the eu arrest warrant in germany conservative opposition parties in sweden and the uk also objected albeit uns uccessfully to the arrest warrant on grounds that it would compromise domestic lega l protections they feared that their fellow citizens would be exposed to the whims of other judicial systems that they considered less than

with the europolbased counterte rrorism task force but was withdrawn in august 2002 some observers suggest that eu task force officers were less than welcoming to the us representative and not cooperative at the same time they point out that given the informationsharing problems among eu police and intelligence services this should not have been surprise other analysts question how effective europol officers in washington can be given that they are housed in the european commissions wash ington delegation office and not with us law enforcement agencies eu officials counter th at this practice is neither unusual nor disadvantageous they point out that us legal attaches abroad for example fbi officials are customarily located in us embassies rather than in the headquarters of their foreign counterparts critics also ar gue that direct liaison with europol is unnecessary given the good bila teral relationships between us law enforcement agencies and counterparts in eu member states and in light of europols capability deficiencies supporte rs contend that europol may still evolve into more capable and coherent eu law enforcement agency and therefore it behooves us interests to establish clos ties now the united states has announced that it will appoint an fbi liaison officer to coordinate with th counterterrorism task force being reestablished at europol27 definitional differences the united states and the eu have been working to bring their respective lists of indivi duals and groups that engage in terrorist activities closer together the united states views this as important not only for its symbolic value but also because of the assetfreezing requirements that the eu attaches to those on its list some eu member states were hesitant initially to name certain groups that are based in nations w ith dubious human rights records to the list such as the turkishbased kurdistan workers party pkk the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc and

palestinians replace any frozen hamas funds associated press september 8 2003 interviews of eu officials spring summer 2003number of commentators also suggest that the eu has been slower to add such groups on its list because some member states view them as more revolutionary than terrorist in nature in other cases the eu drew distinctions between the political and military branches of the same organiza tion such as hamas although the eu terrorist list included hama ss military wing since its first iteration in december 2001 the eu did not agree to add the political wing until early september 2003 some member states argued that hamass political wing provided crucial social services in the west bank and gaza and worried that listing it would only further inflame the israelipalestinian conflict the eus decision to include hamass political wing came amid an escalation in suicide bombings and growing sense that hamas is single organization the eu was unable to reach agreement however on adding related charities or individuals suspected of raising money for hamas the united states and other countries such as turkey colombia and israel have successfully lobbied the eu to include the pkk farc hamas and other organizations on its terrorist blacklist th united states has also taken some cues from the eu adding to its terrorist assetfreezing list number of basque separatists several northern ireland paramilitary organizations nd two sikh separatist groups among others the united states and israel continue to press the eu to add the lebanonbased hezbollah to its terrorist list as with hamas previously however some member states remain concerned that including hezbollah which also provides needed social services would be counterproductive28 data protection worries in order to forge cl oser police and judicial cooperation with the eu the united states had to overcome worries that it did not meet eu data protection standards the eu considers the privacy of personal data basic right eu data privacy regulations set out common rules for public and private entities in the eu that hold or transmit pers onal data and prohibit the transfer of such data to countries where lega l protections are not deemed adequate according to the eu the united states falls short european officials insist however that this view stems more from fundamentally diffe rent data privacy regimes than from eu beliefs of nefarious us practices they note that the european approach has been structured to keep personal data out of the hands of authorities as much as possible in the united states this is not as much of concern because there is greater confidence that the judicial system will correct law enforcement mistakes us officials believe the underlying problem is different perceptions of law enforcement while americans see the police as providing societal benefit europeans regard law enforcement as necessary evil that must be constrained lest it run amok europes past experience with totalitarian regimes clearly informs this view and contributes to the demand of european politicians nd publics for strict data privacy rules bridging the gap between us and eu data protection reg imes has been and will likely remain challenge negotiations to allow us law enforcement officers and europol representatives to share per sonal information on suspected terroristshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31509crs19 29 interviews of us and eu officials 2002 and 2003 30 in june 2004 the european commission issued paper aimed at launching debate on eu privacy rules for

requiring airlines operating flights to or from the united states to provide us authorities with passenger data pnr information from their reservation and parture control systems in may 2004 the united states and eu signed an agreement that sought to calm european concerns about the length and type of data stored nd how it could be used by us law enforcement the european parliament and european ci vil liberty groups however continue to challenge the deal the european parlia ment has lodged case against the pnr agreement in the eu court of justice wh ich could nullify the deal if the court finds it violates eu privacy rules the court is not expected to issue its ruling for at least 18 months the eu will abide by the terms of the may 2004 accord until then washington would like to establish an umbrella agreement in which the eu would largely accept us data privacy sta ndards as adequate nd permit the routine transfer of personal data be tween eu bodies and us law enforcement agencies the eu resists this idea claiming that only tailored agreements will guarantee an added level of protection for eu citizens against possible us infringements of their privacy rights they point out that it would be burdensome for eu citizens to gain redress for any wrongs committed through the us judicial system29 regardless some us analysts assert that the c onclusion of the europol and pnr agreements establish us data protection adequacy in practice and predict that similar useu efforts in the future to improve inform ationsharing for law enforcement purposes will face fewer challenges they also note that the eu has begun to reconsider its data privacy rules and their relation to law enforcement in part in response to the need to improve communication among eu police and intelligence agencies to better counter the terrorist threat30 crime punishment and diverging views the eu was keen to establish cooperation agreements with the united states on extradition and mutual legal assistance to aid the fight against terrorism and other transnational crimes help harmonize member states policies visà vis the united states and expedite the judicial process concluding these useuwide accords proved challenging however because us and eu negotiators had to grapple with number of contentious issues rooted in different us and european societal attitudes toward crime and punishment many europeans are increasingly wary of what they view as widening divide between the two sides of the atlantic over concepts of justice and us tendencies toward retr ibution rather than rehabilitation they struggle to understand how country with which they sh are such fundamental values regarding the protection of individual human rights can take such different perspective on capital punishment for many in the eu th us handling of qaeda prisoners at guantánamo bay and the bush administrations decision to unsign the treaty creating the international criminal c ourt are further proof of underlying philosophical differenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31509crs20 31 eu agrees to extradition deal with united states reuters june 6 2003 interviews of us and eu officials 2002 and 2003topping the list of eu concerns in th extradition treaty negotiations was the use of the death penalty in the united st ates eu law bans capital punishment among member states and prohibits the extradition of suspects to countries where they could face the death penalty the eu laid down clear redline that it would not conclude an accord in which suspect extradited from an eu member state could be subject to capital punishment with little room fo r compromise by the eu side washington effectively agreed to eu demands that suspects extradited from the eu to the united states would not face the death penalty eu officials say this merely formalizes past ad hoc practices in which eu member states have extradited suspects wanted for capital crimes on casebycase basis on the condition that the death penalty would not be imposed or carried out eu memb er states may refuse extradition to the united states if these conditions are not guaranteed some eu leaders and european human rights activists oppose the useu extradition treaty and could slow its transposition into national law in certain member states these critics contend that the guarantees against the imposition of the death penalty in the current text are not strong enough moreover they point out that the guarantee to fair trial is ambiguous and worry that the treaty does not explicitly prohibit trial by military tr ibunal many europeans oppose the proposed use of military tribunals for suspected terrorists in the united states on grounds that they lack transparency and curtail civil rights protections31 impact on bilateral cooperation many workinglevel us police and judicial officials were initially hesita nt to pursue useuwide cooperation on extradition and mutual legal assistance m because they were doubtful it would add much value to existing bilateral arrangements in particular they worried that an euwide accord on mutual legal assistance could weaken currently strong and effective mla treaties with individual member states they pointed out that the difficulty of reaching consensus among the 25 eu member states often results in common positions founded upon the lowest common denominator such as conditions acceptable to all but that may not be optimal us officials feared that certain issues such as german views on data protection could hold useu negotiations hostage they noted that berlins redline that even basic legal assistance provided by german authorities must not lead to the pursuit of capital case in the united states had precluded the conclusion of usgerman bilateral mla treaty for over ten years us officials asserted that they were not interested in signing onto an euwide accord that might have to subscribe to this principle in order to get german agreement and that could call into question us bilateral mla treaties with other individual eu members that were less restrictive us officials were somewhat more enthusiastic about th potential benefits of useuwide extradition accord they had hoped to secu re provision permitting any eu national to be handed over to us judicial authorities under current bilateral arrangements only some eu countries permit the extradition of their nationals to the united states ultimately the resulting useu agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance reflect several compromises us concerns

protocol with the united states reconciling the terms of its bilateral treaties with the new euw ide agreements these protocols will spell out which parts of the bilateral treaties will be retained and which parts will be added to or replaced by provisions in the wider useu treaties both us and eu officials claim that this procedure should pr otect those parts of the bilateral treaties that are stronger or more effective than those in the useu accords although washington failed to obtain the extradition of all eu nationals to the united states us policymakers point out that the euwide extradition treaty will update and modernize existing bilateral accords in th end us negotiators were pleased with the mla treaty which will provide us authorities access to european bank account information on potential terrorists and other criminal suspects establishes expedited procedures for processing mla requests and permits setting up joint investigative teams they note that accepting the banking information provision was difficult for many eu member states because of their concerns about protecting privacy rights eu and us officials also point out that the mla agreement captures all current and future eu member states in one agreement washington has active bilateral mla treaties with only 18 of the eu s current 25 member states32 european perspectives the march 11 2004 terrorist attacks in ma drid spain refocused eu attention on the threat of terrorism in europe and ve injected greater sense of urgency into eu efforts to boost police and judicial coope ration within the eu and with the united states as noted the eu has reasserted its commitment to fully implement existing legal instruments aimed at fighting terrorism some observers worry however that as memories of the terrorist attacks fade so will the eus renewed political will these skeptics believe the eus commitment to pushing its common police and judicial agenda forward will wane as competing priorities emerge and as further progress in this area starts to encroach even more on national sovereignty some suggest that the new eu arrest warrant may represent the current outer limits of eu judicial coopera tion critic s also doubt that the eu will devote the resources necessary to build more effective euwide police and judicial institutions other european commentators stress that sufficient momentum exists to sustain the eus effort to boost poli ce and judicial cooperation pecially in the aftermath of the madrid attacks they argue that european publics feel heightened sense of vulnerability and eu leaders know that the costs of failure are high although the eu as an entity and many individual member states are struggling with establishing proper balance between law enforcement i ndividual privacy and civil rights in the postseptember 11 world the changes in some domestic laws demonstrate that european governments recognize that law enforcement officials need new tools to tackle emerging challenges observers note that even in germany which has among the strictest data protection laws of any eu country legislators passed series

relatively sma ll unlike the anticipated large defense equipment expenditures necessa ry to make the eus rapid reaction force effective moreover they claim that eu publics are more amenable to spending scarce budgetary resources on measures aimed at enhancing homeland security than on new peacekeeping capabilities for use outside of europe supporters also assert that the eus r ecent

further into the balkans areas that are havens and conduits for organized crime and other criminals by joining the eu new members will have to beef up their own border controls introduce tough visa requi rements and subscribe to the provisions of new eu law enforcement tools such as the arrest warrant furthermore eu officials point out that while septembe r 11 provided the initial spark to accelerate cooperation in the police and judicial field the rapid pr ogress since then was only possible because work on many of the in itiatives had been underway for several years eu leaders have always viewed greater cooperation in the law enforcement and judicial fields as cr ucial step on the road to further european integration the eu recognizes that increased coope ration with us law enforcement and intelligence authorities particul arly with the fbi cia and agencies under the us department of homeland security is essen tial to improving its internal security preventing future terrorist attacks in europe and ensuring the safety of eu citizens in addition observers point out that the desire of many eu leaders to build an eventual judicial identity complete with common eu institutions such as public prosecutors office is also driving eu fforts to increase cooperation with the united states both at the investigative level and with policy counterparts at the us state justice and homeland security departments the eu views establishing external relationships with the united states and other countries in the police and judicial field as an essential part of developing common judicial identity eu officials recognize this will take many years to accomplish especially as eu efforts to formulate common policies definitions nd sanctions for crimes beyond terrorism such as drugtrafficking or child exploita tion lag behind analysts estimate that common eu judicial identity is at least decade away given the ongoing national sovereignty concerns of some member states some analysts suggest that transatlantic tensions could negatively affect future useu cooperation against terrorism differences in us and european approaches to counterterrorism have b ecome more evident as washington has broadened the war against terrorism bey ond qaeda and afghanistan most eu members continue to view terrorism primarily as an issue for law enforcement rather than problem to be solved by military means europeans are increasingly worried that the united states is losing the ba ttle for mus lim hearts and minds not only because of the war with iraq and washin gtons traditional support for israel but also because of us decisions that some char ge violate human rights such as keeping suspected qaeda terrorists at guantánamo bay the 911 commission recognizeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31509crs23 33 interviews of european officials 2002 and 2003that allegations of us prisoner abuse make it harder to build the diplomatic political and military alliances that the untied states needs in order to combat terrorism worldwide provisions in both hr 10 and s 2845 echo the commissions call for the united states to develop common coalition approach toward the detention and human treatment of capture d terrorists despite ongoing useu frictions others argue that europe remain s vulnerable to terrorist attacks and law enforcement cooperation will continue because it serves both eu and us interests33 us policy and perspectives the 911 commission recommends that the united states should engage other nations in developing comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism including through multilateral institutions the bush administration backed by many members of congress supports eu efforts to enhance its counterterrorism capabilities and hopes they will ultimately lead to rooting out terrorist cells in europe that could be planning other attacks against us interests the administration also welcomes eu initiatives designed to increase cooperation with the united states and enhance ongoing bila teral law enforcement and border control relationships this is in line with entreaties in the 911 commission report to do more to exchange terrorist information with trusted allies and improve us and global border security standa rds through extensive international cooperation some measures in hr 10 and s 2845 also mirror these sentiments the us departments of state justice homeland security the fbi and cia are actively engaged in efforts to step up coordination with eu police judicial and intelligence counterparts some workinglevel police and judicial fficials continue to caution that us euwide cooperation must add value and not detract from good existing bilateral law enforcement relationships or imped ongoing crossborder investigations although mindful of these concerns th bush administration appears to have determined that the political benefits of engaging the eu as an entity on police and judicial matters outweigh potential negativ us officials stress they are proceeding cautiously in engaging the eu to avoid damaging good bilateral relations but they also believe that the unions re newed efforts on the po lice and judicial front may be the first steps on long road toward common eu judicial identity thus they claim it is in us interests to weigh in early and often in this eu process given europes role as key us partner in in ternational law enforcement efforts and the fight against terrorism administration officials assert that this strategy has already garnered some successes for example useu coor dination in naming terrorist suspects and freezing their assets is improving and th eu has taken us concerns into account in formulating its common arrest warrant original language in the eu arrest warrant agreement gave priority to member stat in the event that multiple extradition requests for particular suspect existed from countries both within and outside

of the offense nd the place where the offense was committed for example if an alleged criminal located in italy is wanted in germany for car theft but in the united states for terrorist act italian judicial authorities could decide to extradite the suspect to the united states rather than to its eu partner the administration also believes that room exists for closer cooperation between the united states and the eu in the border control area and has been seeking more systematic exchanges of customs nd immigration information us officials hope this will help both american and eu authorities keep better track of suspected terrorists and prevent them from entering the united states or finding sanctuary in europe as the 911 commission report notes the united states can only guarantee the security of its own borders through close collaboration with other governments the new useu highlevel dialogue on bor der and transport security not only seeks to boost collaboration and communication am ong border control officials but also aims to provide forum in which each side can provide the other with early warning of and input on emerging legisl ative proposals on issues such as travel documents cargo security pa ssenger data transfers bi ometrics and sky marshals congress is keenly interested in the measures being developed by the eu to improve the ability of its member states to combat global terrorism salient issue for congress in relation to eu efforts to strengthen police and judicial cooperation will be whether the useu agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance add value to existing strong bilateral arrangements or threaten to reduce them to the level of the lowest eu common denominator us negotiators stress that the us eu treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance protect all us bilateral agreements with member states and merely add to update or strengthen the existing accords34 congressional decisions related to improving us travel

will effectively end the practice of nonextradition of eu nationa ls within the union and abolish dual criminality the principle that crime must be defined and verified as crime in both the issuing and enforcing state fo r the 32 agreed upon offenses hence it will transform the formal diplomatic pro cess of extradition into an administrative procedure and permit suspects to be handed directly from one judicial authority to another for example an italian judge could issue an arrest warrant for french citizen who committed crime in rome and give it to the dutch police to enforce if the suspect had fled to amsterdam dutch police would then arrest the suspect and transfer the individual back to rome to face trial the ma ximum 90day time frame for this process includes an appeals proce dure the 32 offenses must be punishable by at least three years incarceration in the requesting state for the warrant to apply38 europol european police office europol was established by the 1992
