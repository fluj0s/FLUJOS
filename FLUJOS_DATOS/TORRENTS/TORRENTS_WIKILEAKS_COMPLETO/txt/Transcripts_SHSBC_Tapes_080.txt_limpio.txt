shsbc 80 routine 3a lecture given on 7 november 1961 thank you well youre lucky people youre lucky you are you dont know it but you are what have you done in the last two hundred trillion years to make you this lucky hm now what have you done female voice got smart enough to come here aha got smart enough to come here all right now your immediate direct business today which is the what is this the 7th of female voice 7th of november november ad 11 all right your immediate direct business today is routine 3a and the talk im going to give you is totally concerned with routine 3a and you should have in your possession hco bulletin of november 7th 1961 this is one of those rare occasions where the lecture the bulletin the data and the cases are all assembled at one point of conjunction now may i call your attention to safety table which i think was the 26 october hm female voice 29th of october 29th of october the safety table what it is safe to process well it is safe to process goals terminal its quite safe to process one but its not safe to process any other than goals terminal therefore the only people who should run routine 3a are of course those people who have been trained and the only terminals that should be run are those that have been checked out by graduate of saint hill period that puts sort of limiter on the amount of auditing done until you realize that i have simply said checked out checked out that takes those zones and areas of the world that are too lazy to send anybody to saint hill or something of the sort and that leaves them unclear but they can go ahead and beef up their banks and have ball but were not going to worry about them our next concern after this is after all of the bad assessments have been done and all of the bad runs have been done and everything is all messed up how to salvage case that has been put into that condition by auditing which is unauthorized and i call to attention class ii at this moment is the only authorized auditing anyplace in the world where saint hill graduate is not that means all the field that means all organizations and so forth that means class ii which consists of security checking problems getting rudiments in theres tremendous numbers of things that can be done under classes i and ii and weve been doing them for years and getting good wins on them so why everybody has to stretch up against class iii activity is little more than i can comprehend because when you get up to this level of class iii if you dont know your business you can really tear somebody to shreds now hitherto we have been running routine 3 and this is one of those milestones in line of research and we cease as of now to run routine 3 it has ceased and desisted we will never again run routine 3 it is ended because it is modified and the modification of routine 3 is extremely simple and all it consists of is simply adding step to routine 3 there is just step added in now in routine 3 we found goal and we did this by getting the pc to do list or we wrote down the list the pc gave us and we didnt do it by the way by taking the pcs list and then filing it and saying well of course the pc doesnt know whats wrong with him so his goal cant be on this list and so we put this away in the files now we get another list and we ask him if he has any more goals and we cant find any more of those goals so we try to find were the rudiments out and then of course the rudiments are out nobody can get the rudiments in and so and you dont have to look at an emeter either because it doesnt know either and then decide that the person has lots of marital difficulties so that their terminal must be of course husband that is not the way we do did should do such thing what we do is get goals list its all too elementary i get at this point and i go into little bit of confusion about this point because i never can quite guess what people are going to add to something they can always add something like well what i just said you know the pc never knows whats wrong with him so therefore his goal that he gives you couldnt be right and you have to make up goal for the pc dont think it hasnt been done i mean thats how they miss goals assessments terrific invalidation and all that sort of thing but we learned in routine 3 that it was very difficult to get goal we learned that you had to get goal with the rudiments in in in and we had to be very careful of this and we had to not invalidate the pc and we had to be very very sharp in getting our goal and nothing of that is altered in routine 3a in fact it might now become just little bit more difficult because we have found another piece of the puzzle now having found the goal having found the goal by doing an assessment as in steps 1 2 and 3 of routine 3 also same thing we got it checked out of course by somebody else we made sure that this was the right goal and then we asked the pc in routine 3 what terminals would answer up to that goal and we had cause and effect type terminals and we made lists of these and then we assessed this by elimination and we finally came up with one terminal only one terminal sounding just as we had only one goal remaining in then we came up with one terminal remaining in and that thing stayed in and was not sporadic or fluctuating it always gave instant reads that was the pcs terminal and then we assessed this on the prehav scale and having assessed it we put together found the level of the prehav scale and we put that into fiveway bracket and having put it into fiveway bracket we then ran the pc on this along with this we of course did security checking thats routine 3 now if youve learned routine 3 it is absolutely nothing to do routine 3a theres wild difference between these two routines but not in the way to do them now we come to this problem with routine 3 difficulty of assessment skip it that is merely matter of auditing skill you can assess or you cant assess you can audit or you cant audit i mean thats all there is to that given assessment and then assessment of terminal and then run on the prehav scale we had only small percentage of the people running in this particular fashion going clear rapidly why why what was this rest of this percentage and this has been my action and activity through april may june july august september october of 1961 why they all would apparently running on the right terminal they all obeyed the rules of terminals and so on so we went off into hidden standards and we investigated that very thoroughly and we did lot of good for cases and we found whole new chapter in processing and we found out that you get the prior confusion and blow off the stuck circuit and you could do lot of tricky things with this hidden standard we learned how to take problems apart this way and actually right now all you have to do is just find the prior confusion to an outrudiment and the rudiment will go in i mean this was big gain so its easier now to get rudiments in if we just did them by prior confusion we would get our rudiments in these were wins and cases ran bit better we had the idea of group mores and that the individual was breaking down third dynamic mores and all of sudden we have moved clear from the status of first dynamic clear through second dynamic clear to third dynamic clear weve gotten that far in other words were cleaning up the first second and third dynamic clears made prior to this date are beautifully cleaned up on the first and just between ourselves they sometimes act like it so without graduating somebody up through first dynamic clear we can at this particular stage of the game thats crack on the thing but i have actually had some backlashes in this direction that were very first dynamicy theyre very reasonable but very first dynamicy which was objection on my part i never rolled them under because of it but that was the way it was and we have here were looking at third dynamic clear particularly in routine 3a because were going to run it in this particular direction we keep broadening this concept of clear and we keep broadening the stability and the expected stability of clear and we keep shortening the number of hours to clear and shortening down the hours to clear has been my main action but it also has lets just knock out all of this slow gain and i have been fighting on that research front here all during this summer working with students and so forth not experimentally we were always doing exactly where we were going and what we were doing and most that we knew but all of sudden there was violent blue spark and it went from one corner of the saint hill to the other corner of the saint hill and it left ozone behind it all the way in short i had cognition of some magnitude what on earth keeps goal hanging why does goal why is goal alive at all i mean how has this goal come down the track endlessly endlessly endlessly endlessly eons and eons and eons what is keeping this goal there well we know of only one mechanism that does this only one mechanism does this and that is the mechanism of problem problem definition postulate counterpostulate and because theyre postulate counterpostulate the thing gets suspended in time in other words you have postulate and that postulate would just evaporate unless it had resistance and there are two postulates counteropposed and each one of them are of equal force so if these two postulates are of equal force you get something hung up in time the way you can unsettle this postulate counterpostulate of course is very easily as we have recently discovered just find the area of prior confusion and of course it weakens or strengthens one or the other of the two postulates as you get the overts and the withholds off and the thing tips over and the problem disappears but lets look at the difficulty of keeping problem alive the great difficulty of it it has to be two balanced forces otherwise one force overbalances the other force and ceases to be problem becomes solution or ceases to exist we have husband and wife and they have fought and they have fought and they have fought and finally one of them gives up they dont fight anymore maybe they arent maybe one of them isnt happy maybe the other one isnt happy but thats beside the point they arent problem any more theyre solved situation its solved area or they get divorced and separate and they arent problem any more there either until an auditor comes along to it and tries to settle why theyre having difficulty in their current marriage and he finds this past marriage still hanging fire someplace in the bank but the problem has to have two more or less two or more more or less balanced forces counteropposed you have bull weighing twentyseven hundred pounds with his forehead pushed up against bull weighing twentyseven hundred pounds and these two bulls are pushing with twentyseven hundred footpounds of thrust and theyre trying to collapse their heads into each other to the depth of one foot in other words but there they are and if you consider them from the standpoint of problem there they would be theres nothing going to happen because one twentyseven hundred pound bull is pushing against one twentyseven hundred pound bull and unless somebody makes their foreheads skid or trips one bull or something like that there they are going to stand in the pasture now that is problem and that is the problem and that is the anatomy of problem when the pc says to you i have present time problem and you get fall on your meter and so forth this is the kind of thing thats happening the pcs effort to go in some direction is being countered by an effort of him not to go in the direction or somebody elses effort to go in different direction and these two forces are counteropposed and you get an nonresolved situation its nonresolved it is not nonresolvable as some pcs would have you believe it just doesnt happen to be resolved because its in counterpoise and thats what happens there now you run off of course the pcs end of this and it then will cease to be very often problem with the other party now why does it cease to be problem with the other party well it takes two twentyseven hundred pound bulls and youve just taken one twentyseven hundred pound bull and you have either made him go up to three thousand pounds you see or you have headed him in an opposite direction with regard to this sort of thing and of course you dont have postulate counterpostulate now you have something else and the other person who has the other side of the problem in present time of course has nothing to push against and so that postulate evaporates you see why this mechanism exists this happens very often i mean all too often for just happenstance we process pc on her family and we process her on her family and we spend hours at it and so on and we finally finish up and she seems all cleaned up on the family shes not worried about her family now she doesnt not trying to make her family guilty or not not make her family guilty and there she is and she suddenly receives letter telephone call or something and it says dear amy all is forgiven come home or something like this will occur you know its quite amazing one particular instance there was somebody worried about money disappearing out of the cash box in an organization money disappearing out of the cash box money disappearing out of the cash box this person was worried about it blaming herself blaming herself blaming herself for money disappearing out of the cash box couldnt figure out how the money was disappearing out of the cash box thought she must be guilty about it worried worried worried worried worried got it run in an auditing session the second that she had it run in the auditing session almost within the hour following it the person who had been taking the money out of the cash box came in paid the money back mysterious wasnt it well apparently the person worrying about it all the time and force and so forth had this interlocked in some peculiar way in the theta universe in some fashion where nothing resolved nothing was happening now there were getting little esoteric do you see thats little bit out beyond the understandable boundary but we have this of course as the most obvious thing theres the husband and he goes home and he has an awful fight with the wife and they chop each other up and then the husband gets audited and then all of sudden why hes nicer to the wife or she hasnt got anything to push against or shes baffled she has new problem maybe who is this you know something on that order and of course the problem has ceased to exist by very material understanding i mean we can understand how that problem would cease to exist weve changed one of the protagonists but how about this other one five thousand miles away the girls family havent written to her for years we process her on her family and all of sudden the family goes into communication with her this happens all too often but these are all examples of things suspended in time as long as youve got two interlocked forces you get time suspension and when youre dealing with the mind this is not necessarily true in the physical universe these two bulls actually are moving on the time track but in straight thinkingness there is apparent motion on the time track where two things are interlocked youve got postulate counterpostulate and its all mental so its not really tied down to the physical universe anyway and it just goes on drifting in time well an examination of this demonstrates that there must be something on the other side of the goal if this person has had goal for the last eighteen trillennia what has kept it there you see thats just the how come how come it doesnt asis how come he never realizes it how come he never backs off of it how come he never quits on the subject how come he never wins on the subject it just stays there hes got goal to pick gooseberries or something and there it is and if youd put him on meter six trillennia ago im sure that you would have gotten some kind of reading to pick gooseberries you see well how come it stayed there that long well its the same anatomy as the problem there is on the other side of every goal thing called modifier the exact definition of modifier you have in this bulletin modifier is that consideration which opposes the attainment of goal and tends to suspend it in time that is modifier just as you have the husband fighting with the wife and the wife fighting with the husband and their equal velocities of fighting then suspend that fight in time in the same way let us think of the husband as having goal and the wife as the reasons why he isnt going to make one and you get their counterpoise then carrying forward the whole thing as problem dont you see all right or let us say the wife has goal and the husband is damned if shes going to realize it and so in similar circumstances youve got this whole thing carrying forward in time in other words youve got these two people locked horns to horns and theyre not moving well persons goal found by common goals assessment you dont do anything different in goals assessment you do it the same way you have always done when you get the list of goals and so forth the next step to that is to find out how come it is locked in space and you find out how it is locked in space by finding the modifier modifier is technical term i invite you to use it as such you could call it lots of other things but we dont happen to have called anything modifier so it doesnt mess up our it doesnt mess up our nomenclature but it certainly does modify the goal and thats what it sounds like when you get one the thing it sounds most like is modifier now in doing routine 3a after getting your goal proved out and totally checked out on the person you would then do list of modifiers this list i think you will commonly find is very short and i think the modifier is very easy to attain but the reason the modifier does not come about is by the pure mechanics of its notasisness it has characteristic of not asising its denyer if you know your old dianetics all pcs have denyers and theyll go running along through an engram yoppetyyoppetyyoppetyyoppetyyoppety yoppetyyop and then skip and they obviously theres something else went on there and then they go on to the end of the engram yoppetyyoppetyyoppetyyoppetyyop and when you finally find this middle of the engram itll be something like it isnt here you know somebody has said at that point it isnt here or somebody has said well nothing is happening just now and the pc runs down the engram hits this nothing is happening just now never notices it because of course nothing is happening just now in other words they take it literally dramatize it and it becomes truth you see so if theres nothing there why of course the pc never runs that part of the engram and after youve run it and run it and run it and run it and run it clever auditor in the old days would eventually ask for the bouncer which made him get out of it or the comeback the pullback or something like that hed ask for one of these types of phrases and amongst those that he asked for was denyer something that says it isnt here something that says it doesnt exist and hed ask is there denyer there and the pc would say theres nothing here and the clever auditor would say repeat that and the pc would say all right theres nothing here theres nothing here theres nothing well what do you know thats my mother talking she is saying there is nothing here similarly i have you can get phrases and that sort of thing and meanings and senses doing all kinds of queer things i ran into case one time that had sonic only on one section of the track for one instant and he always had sonic at that point of the track and you run him along through engrams and so forth and he had sonic but hed get into this one particular incident which he just couldnt seem to run by the way and he kept it around it was good showpiece and run it down and just before the sonic turned on we finally found out it says get away listen and the pc of course listened and he heard for the next few words hed hear pure sonic for the next few words hed hit this bouncer and then hed hit the listen command and then hed have sonic for few words and then the sonic would disappear people can become totally obedient to this type of phraseology an oldtime dianetic auditor knows this very well theres nothing not much mysterious about this but people who have later on the line have never had too much experience with this particular type of phraseology and so forth so when i tell you that all modifiers found so far were denyers at the same time youll realize why the pcs intelligence doesnt go on over into them theyre all it isnt here see theyre all doesnt exist but you couldnt have any money anyway you see but you couldnt that is one but you couldnt have any money anyway they would take it all away from you well of course the pc states the goal and then theres the rest of this thing over here if it occurred in an engram that would be the way it is occurring as goal he runs along and he says well the goal is to rob banks and you say thats fine you assess it you go find terminal for it and everything else well to rob banks but theres little more to the goal and its denyer but you couldnt have any money and they would take it all away anyway see so that end of the goal disappears thats disappeared end of the goal now actually it doesnt take any real skill to get these modifiers once youve got the goal the skill is to get the goal the goal is what is important here but as you get to step 4 you ask the person to make list of modifiers maybe therell only be ten of them maybe therell only be one maybe theyll come up with the first one bang and so on but they get maybe eight ten of these modifiers theyve got goal to play violin and you find that all assessed out it proved out just the way youve been doing it now when you come to step 4 here you say all right now what would make that goal difficult to achieve what would be the consequences of achieving it what would make it impossible to realize that goal and write down anything the pc says and make list of these and that list you dont write down to play violin and so forth you just write down and and the remaining tail you see just write down the tail dont keep chugging the goal down his throat because youll never be able to assess the modifier if the goal is in as part of it youve got to assess the modifier the tail of the cat has got to be assessed all by itself you keep saying the goal each time and of course youre going to get the thing will stay alive and youll never find the modifier because the goal of course and the modifier react alike youve got to assess the modifier as itself to play violin and youve got that now youve got it all proved out everything is fine now youre going to come back to step 4 and youre going to ask him well what makes it difficult to do that what would make it impossible to do that what would be the consequences of playing violin and so forth and every time he says something that this would be you write it down on this list and of course the pc actually is much more likely if youve got the actual goal to give it to you just bang you see and its just matter of whether or not its an of or an as or just some little wording change so you write it down every way that the pc tells you and youve got this list of tails of the cat and their modifiers and now you turn around and assess those and you assess those by elimination just exactly as you assessed the goal but dont call the goal off every time while youre eliminating them because of course none of them will ever eliminate if you keep calling the goal you just want the tail all right and you finally find out to play violin but all the strings are missing you know the pcs intelligence never gets on to that type of phraseology because its missing theres way you can get to it the pc will tell you youre liable to get into arguments with the pc but he says but there isnt any more of it there isnt any more to the goal you see and then eventually hell say well it well it does seem theres something missing here oh i see what it is oh well yeah well its to play violin but all the strings are missing well thats the modifier all the strings are missing and you write down all the strings are missing and then you say well is any other thing thatd modify and keep you from doing this well the instrument is gone that might be it the strings are gone or to play violin that doesnt have any strings on it all right you write down doesnt have any strings on it you see you write down any way he phrases this thing all right you get dozen of these things or whatever it is you ask him if there are any more modifications than he has given you you get knock on the meter you get knock on the thing youve got the modifier list now you simply go down this modifier list one two three four five six just do it by elimination just read them off to the pc the same way you assess goals and youll find that one is left alive and that is it now having done that you combine the goal and modifier and you write that down you combine the goal and modifier thats step 6 here and you combine the goal and modifier as the question for the terminal but its to play violin but all the strings are missing and that was what proved out now you want to know who or what would play violin with all the strings missing now this is very tricky stuff youve got with this sort of thing because it gives you different terminals assessment than plain routine 3 assessment it gives you realer completely real terminal to the pc which scoops up if youve done it right all of his hidden standards at the same time thats what ive been gunning for now it is true that the terminal the pc has been running which was to play violin and you have assessed out virtuoso and virtuoso did prove out theres doubt about it and youve been running virtuoso and virtuoso has been running and it runs hard and the pc goes vague on it and theres sort of circuitry stays in but the pc goes through it and youre winning and so forth well there are many explanations for this and i dont particularly care to be nailed down on the exact explanation but i would say that you had offhand more general terminal or you had terminal too early on the track to asis easily or something of this sort youve got something else it is on the goals terminal line theres doubt about that but you probably have the original form or youve got something there and the earlier you go on the track you might know this rule the earlier you go on the track the tougher the energy masses are so you get rougher run and youve been running virtuoso very nicely but to play violin with all the strings gone and of course you assess who or what would play violin with all the strings gone and of course we get something of the order of circus clown and then you assess it circus clowns clown well its clown and youve got it its clown well maybe its very decayed form of the terminal you were running originally but it runs like bomb because its very close to the pcs reality and its very close to his circuits so it runs more easily and youll find out it integrates more easily to the pc im not trying to tell you that routine 3 terminals are wrong if they are hang but it doesnt matter all im trying to tell you is that they are apparently very resistive they are quite hard to run and the pc bucks into them and he goes through big energy masses and most of this to is the symptom of trying to run too damn early on the track trying to run into the whole problem all at once because look if he had this goal for while and the goal was actually pure goal you of course would get different kind of terminal for the pure goal than the goal modified you see now youve got different kind of terminal you may have kind of degraded type of terminal you may have different terminal anyway itll make different sense to the pc and it actually assesses faster and you will get faster terminals assessment with it so you take the goal modifier you say all right who or what would play violin with the strings gone well obviously you could have got hundreds and hundreds of terminals for who would play violin but you dont get too many for who would play violin with all the strings gone an idiot uh clown uh party cutup urn fake you see few things like that because its so restricted and you get much shorter list and it assesses rather easily so now you make up your terminals list combining the goal and modifier as the question who or what would goal plus modifier who or what would play violin with strings gone and you make nice list of these and then just exactly the way youve handled any other terminals assessment you do this one now by elimination and youll wind up at the other end with terminal which is the only terminal in the lot that would react on the meter now you of course there are several things you could do now we get in because we accumulated more technology we were doing it the hard way we accumulated lot of technology to do it the hard way you could do several things you could address it to groups with this group type of command you could address it to you could simply date it on the time track and find prior confusion to it and do sec check on it and youd probably blow the whole goal terminal mess you know whens the first time you ever ran into clown oh well thats different the first time i ever ran into clown yeah who was trying to play violin with all the strings gone oh oh oh well you mean that type of clown well all right lets see that particular type of clown well and you could probably date the thing and you could find an earlier area of confusion and so forth you see door opens there you get easier processes or you could run the terminal on sec check sort of business or fool around with that or you could find out how you wouldnt make the terminal guilty and how the terminal wouldnt dare make you guilty negativeguilt run i can just think of dozens of ways to handle this exact situation why because it handles exactly as present time problem handles youre now getting rid of goals and terminals with the modifier in there youre getting rid of them on the same basis that you would get rid of present time problem so how many ways are there to handle present time problems well itd be that many ways to handle goals terminal it all becomes should become at that moment very comprehensible to you you know that present time problem is rough to handle you know that its sometimes very difficult to get rid of them you know very often that they blow very easily you know several processes that get rid of present time problems they dont dismay you you know that they take little bit of monkeying with sometimes and it takes some twoway comm and so on so dont be surprised if any of these things went dont be surprised if any of these things blew the goals terminal see so theres reason for to say didactically theres only one way to do this we have just opened wooden door and found that an iron door was there and then we opened the iron door and were on our way you see there are many ways to do this now the proven way to do this is to assess on the prehav scale get fiveway bracket and do run and that is proven way to do that so that is the way we will say you had better do at the moment because it shouldnt be too long run it shouldnt be as difficult run as youve been doing all right i just wanted to make it plain to you that there are other ways that you could handle the same situation because i think now you can understand what goal is and what how goal stands in space and then therefore what goals terminal is goals terminal is something that epitomizes both the goal and the resistive modifier that would be the goals terminal youre looking for its the thing that epitomizes both of these things in one terminal now we admit that at one time or another one terminal had the goal and another terminal had the modifier and that there was collision someplace along the two and so forth we admit that there you could dream up all sorts of anatomy to all this but where the pc is concerned he never asises postulates which arent his own and we must consider that neither the goal nor the modifier are the pcs if theyre still in suspense they must belong to terminal haha you see that actually its just the goal has been hanging out like little tiny red flag showing what the terminal was now when we get the modifier this really puts an enfilade fire on what the terminal is in other words we got two tags on the terminal now so we can get more finite squarely placed type of terminal and admittedly the terminal may be later on the track admittedly the terminal may not take care of the entirety of the entire entire but itll certainly unbalance the goals terminal modifier pardon the goals and modifier situation thatll certainly become unbalanced and as fast as it does you can expect blow of that goals modifier situation and as soon as that situation is gone you of course are in the position of being able to do another complete routine 3a as soon as you cant get knock on the goal you cant get any reaction out of terminal anymore and you cant get any reaction out of goal anymore and you cant get any reaction on modifier anymore thats it you test all those things now how you do repeat on this thing might prove little more complicated than routine 3 because you got to check the modifier and then check the goal and then check the modifier and then check the goal again before you give it all up because you could be fooled if you didnt you check the modifier now the person has blown the terminal but still has the idea you check the idea and the person looks at the idea and that idea sort of surges you see you look at the goal let us say and you get surge on the goal now the goal has surged so you say well its still alive so wed better do something else its not it may not be at all you check the goal then check the modifier and we get bang bang surge on the modifier now we go back and check the goal and we find it isnt there then we go back and try the modifier and we find it isnt there because they will still stay hung up and youve got to check both sides couple of times to get them separated the pc may still hang onto the idea after the terminal has gone you see the pcs been living this life for long time but if you checked it off that way and thereafter couldnt get the goal to react and couldnt get the modifier to react and then couldnt get the goal to react and couldnt get the modifier to react you get all of your rudiments in you get all these terminals that you had you check over all these terminals the pc also gave you make sure you got all that old terminals list straight then wed better get all the rudiments in like mad and wed better check that goal again wed better check that modifier again we cant get any tick out of them we cant get any tick out of any of the rudiments then you go into new routine 3a you got it and you just go right down from the beginning again of course you use the pcs old list the first goals list the pc gave you this has to be assessed again you will now find that some of those are alive you naturally add to it anything but you do the same thing you did see but instead of having pc write goals list your next run on this is take the pcs original goals list and anything that you added to it in assessing it and then you add various types of goals to the list you know new goals and then you assess the whole list locating goal by elimination and then you go into it again you ask for modifiers to that particular goal now when youve found the modifier for that goal then you get list of terminals for the goal and modifier you assess the list of terminals and here we go again but i dont think youre going to be able to do that very much i think after you get the first one two or three all of sudden youre going to start getting blow blow and youll find the goal and youll get the modifier and it unsettles the two and you never get to terminals assessment and you go boom boom and there youre left with empty hands again and you keep on blowing these things and i think youll eventually blow most of the pcs goals list i think every one of them had modifier tiny one that was overridden by the fixation of attention on the goal dont you see but once the goal is gone these other ones start getting little bit live too now thats the way you would tackle this picture and thats routine 3a now you get lets take case now that has been run with goal and lets say that goal was to be willow wand lets look over here and we find that some cases will have just modifier and we will have gotten the modifier before we got the goal now im just only prepared to find that i havent found it but i would be prepared to find it the person has come up on the goals list with modifier and youve got pc sitting there who has modifier now you have to find the goal but the goal will be right adjacent to the modifier and probably be in front of the modifier and not instead of behind the goal lets say somebody has one well lets put something fairly factual to leave all hospitals alone and weve gotten this as goal and it checked out on the goals list and thats what we have to leave all hospitals alone well hey you know that really sounds like modifier doesnt it so whats on the beginning of this thing thats what we want to know now wed come over and wed say all right well what would you want to be doing which would be modified by leaving all hospitals alone and so forth what would be the front end of this thing i think youd probably come up with the terminal or some terminal that the pc has already given you you got the idea it possibly is lets say the terminal was willow wand and to leave all hospitals alone okay leave all hospitals alone and you want the goal well the pc assessed out on terminal willow wand well it may be something on the order you just ask the pc about it and sort it out who would want to leave all hospitals alone why or whatever what other goal would person have what goal would this modifier modify you know ask him any type of question which is just straight on explain to them anything that you want to explain to them but try to get the front end of this thing and you possibly will find its to be willow wand and leave hospitals entirely alone now your terminals list is longer the pcs terminals list its going to be different and you say all right now who or what would want to be willow wand and want to leave all hospitals strictly alone and it doesnt make any sense to you but itll make sense to the pc theyve been living with it for trillennia now youll get very finite terminal you get very sharply defined terminal itll be distinctly different and well within the pcs reality of the situation you should thats what you should do now i dont know that that has happened and i havent any case histories of that happening at all i am just prepared for it to have been done im just saying well theres possibility here that after youve done i mean in the future not just in the past and youve worked and slaved and youve sweated away and youve gotten your goals list and your goals list to always jump out of second story windows all right take it as goal and write it down but remember its probably the modifier now just how you get around to that other end of it will be proved out in time if we have to face this problem im just facing the problem before we come to it and you say well what else what else would this goal consist of reason to work hard at it the pc very well might give you something idiotically simple like well well to burn down houses of course and you say well what would that consist of well to burn down houses and always jump out of the second story window didnt i tell you before is liable to be sort of the idea behind all this now these goals that are total occluders like and never find out about anything if you had goal like that never find out to never find out about anything it sounds to like they were they wanted to or wanted to be or wanted to have you know and never find out about anything see thats the whole goals modifier situation so these things could be found backwards as well as forwards as i say i dont know of these conditions ive experience with that at this particular time but theres provision for it all right now how about the terminal that you are running on the pc right now will it do any harm whatsoever to leave it unflat i dont know of any harm itd do to leave it unflat because certainly the horribleness of this situation is this is that which is unknown to the pc he tends to dramatize he tends to be aberrated about that which is unknown to him and is close to him and influencing him he tends to be aberrated about all right what about this well if youve got terminal on the pc and its to collect gold bricks and we audit this pc and the pc says well im very sad and it makes very apathetic and we go on auditing the pc and gradually they climb out of this but every once in while he mentioned being apathetic about it and theyre not quite happy about this and so on when we get the modifier we are very likely to find out and to act apathetic enough so nobody will find out that i have them see to collect gold bricks and to act apathetic enough so that nobody will find out i have them see thats the modifier yeah but by having the goal youve been kicking the goal kicking the goal kicking the goal and of course its restimulating the modifier all the time so the pc is acting like he doesnt have any engrams acting like he doesnt have any bank acting like he doesnt have any anything dont you see apathetically its all part of the modifier situation interesting huh well now i think possibly some goals have been found which are the goal and modifier i think this condition already possibly exists to be willow wand and have everything go crazy thats obviously goalplusmodifier situation theres numerous conditions of this but if you just get down the basic anatomy of it youre all set youve got to find goal see youve got to find goal and thats just routinely and then having found the goal youve got to find the modifier or if while doing the goal you got only modifier and it was only the modifier available now youve got to find the rest of it which is the goal youve got to get this package and then youve got to get the terminal that fits both your pc may have struggle giving you one that fits both or he may not but the terminal that fits the both of them of course is giving you sevenleague boots in the direction of clearing because its got both sides of the problem and its got the individual who epitomizes both sides of these things and you should be able to roll along with it rather well rather easily it should be faster run in other words you havent lost any ground particularly youve just won some ground here in this particular wise now we take what i want you to do if you have found if your pc has goal well just enter in here youve already got the goal proven out i dont care if they have terminal and its been run or anything else just enter in here at step 4 take that goal compile list of modifiers and go right on down the remaining steps of routine 3a youll find youll shortcut this situation there is the rest of the package is what youve got to find instead of running off onehalf of this thing to unsettle the goalsmodifier situation you see actually it would unsettle if you just ran off half of the problem its longer run lets find the one that unsettles both sides of the thing simultaneously and is contained in one person and i think youll find in that all of circuitry the pcs been packing around and all of the hidden standards and anything else will probably be combined in these things this is not very hard to do this is not very hard to do it shouldnt take you very long ill go over it once more i just you know what the pcs goal is and just say well what would make that goal difficult to attain what would make it impossible what would be the consequences of attaining it any such question as that or if somebodys heard this lecture say well whats the modifier to your goal its as elementary as this you know and then you make whole list of these things you see and when youve got your list done just assess em by elimination then you find yourself with your goals goal plus modifier and now that whole thing by the way will react itll react very nicely you never saw goal react as nicely as when its combined with modifier bang bang all right now take that goal plus modifier and ask for terminals list who or what would want to be willow wand and jump out of second story windows and you know who would want to play violin without any strings what would what would play violin without any strings and so forth and hed give you very short list doesnt matter whether the list is short or long the idea is just to get complete list well you shake that list down you shake of course the modifier list down you say well are there any more modifiers you get reaction on the emeter similarly when youve got your terminals you say well are there any more terminals that you can think of now well thats blank all right do your assessment by elimination get your rudiments in of course frequently and routinely if you want to do smooth fast job of it do your assessment by eliminations and youll wind up with his terminal as soon as youve got that terminal the easiest way to handle terminal and the one that you understand best is to assess it on the prehav scale and you will find that there it sits and put fiveway bracket together or something on that thing and just run it and its simple theres not too much to that it requires auditing skill however to do this this is what fools the untrained relatively or partially trained auditor everything i have told you sounds very simple and it is very simple but that is the trouble with it so many things can be added to it so many complications and what people always neglect and they wont admit this about themselves is good auditing requires superb auditor you have to have good auditing skill just the mechanics of auditing have to be excellent in order to audit and you cant do one of these things with halfwaythroughhpa mechanics of auditing thats all i mean your pc is too far out your rudiments are too far out youre juggling with the emeter in one hand and something else in the other hand and trying to smoke cigarette at the same time with your feet on this window sill and just somehow or another you cant seem to get anything to work so you eventually and you say well its perfectly all right dont know the auditors code you see you say its perfectly all right i know what this persons modifier is i know what it is already and evaluate for it and say well its actually husband thats what i ought to be running assess for husband you see and just kind of pick out the level at random and put it in the command and run it all yeah obviously the person has done routine 3a only theres visible result its all mysterious it takes weeks and weeks and weeks to do the terminal assessment they just cant seem to get terminal or the terminal they got you get ahold of sheet they did the terminal on it hasnt got any marks on it you say well what is this what is it and they say well thats the terminal list well what did you do with it well we picked out the best terminal of course its the complications that foul this up but basically as hidden background to all of this type of activity is superb auditing skill it is good auditing presence its being able to hold pc insession why so particularly with this see i mean you can go halfway through an hpa course and give security check and miss question the guys upset for couple of days and somebody else gets the question and straightens it out and so forth and everybody lives you see and its all all right but what makes this so peculiar well in the first place ive been asking this question you see myself from the first time it happened that peter who i just got through training in running course in south africa and he got well trained running that course and he did very well and the students did well and peter goes home to australia and he has sixweeks course i think it was during the first week we had nearly all the goals and terminals we were very upset because there were two or three students that didnt have any goal or terminal at the beginning of the second or third week down in south africa wasnt it oh we were quite peeved and he goes through six weeks and i dont think he had enough goals and terminals to put in your eye he had three or four he made two clears on particular unit which was very well done but he didnt get any goals and he didnt get any terminals worth nickel and its worried him sick he says why does everybody take forever to do it and i was sitting down here at the beginning of this summer and so forth and everybody was having such an awful time doing it relatively skilled auditors so we started shaping up auditing skill thats what we started working on the smoothness and the skill of the auditor and sure enough when i finally got down to it just relatively month or two ago couple of months ago i said you remember how discourteous i was i said well youre in games condition with the pc and you just havent got the rudiments in and thats all there is to it and find them remember everybody all of sudden busily got the rudiments in and bangbangbang everybody had their goals and terminals remember its crime now if at the end of two weeks of twoandahalfhouraday auditing when we havent got somebodys goal and terminal it just seems to be very very peculiar and we begin to think of the case as peculiar and we wonder what the auditor is doing really and so on lots of questions get asked well what is that basically thats twentyfive hours of auditing if its gone twentyfive hours without this result why what oh dont tell that case hasnt got his goal and terminal yet hey wait minute whats this and its just all based on this one thing superb auditing skill that is all why all summer long i wanted to know this burning three letter word why its because every time you ask for goal the modifier restimulates and the modifier is usually disability its as silly as that so youre walking uphill the whole distance that youre doing goals assessment but of course it becomes dead easy after youve got the goal and the modifier because youre longer kicking against the modifier lets say were looking for this goal now we dont know what the goal is we have list of two hundred goals and we dont know what the goal is but beforehand before we find out what the goal is let us take future peek with crystal ball and we find the goal is to be lute player and hate everyone horribly well thats fine now were looking down here and we finally get down weve gone across lute player every time we turn around and we go three or four goals further than lute player and we found that the rudiments all out why well the pc is hating everyone horribly now we dont know that the pc has got this as goal and we didnt even know the modifier was there so as we come down the dress parade see we keep crossing this and every time we hit the goal we restimulate the modifier so the pc goes out of session now in view of the fact that all the other goals on the list have modifiers too look at the potpourri which finally finishes up here oh we find this pc arc breaks with the greatest of ease and we finally find out that we have dug up goal which says to be lute player and hate everybody horribly and we had to hate everybody horribly in full restim the entirety of the goals assessment right down to the time when we got it as modifier its right there and you have to be good enough as an auditor and smooth enough as an auditor that this thing never has ripple to get moving on its got to be done perfectly and when its done perfectly it never of course knocks and if it does you put it straight back in place and you get down to the end of the list with perfect auditing of course you found the persons goal and terminal rather easily ah but lets look at somebody else someplace who is not that well trained every time they drop the command drop the ball drop the emeter let the cigarette go out and so forth and make noises as they remove and take off and put on their shoes you see during the auditing session and some things like this and just miss here and there you know like well miss clearing the command and miss starting the session and you know few misses of that character and what happens the pc goes dzudzuuzzuzz you know because remember even though you dont know it you havent pushed the pc into this valence the pc was sitting in this valence all the time from the moment he walked in and got his first auditing he is solidly in the valence and the closer you get to the valence of course the less he is in it but until youve got the whole thing youre living right on borderline you see youre not in it youre in it and so forth and if theres hidden part of it that youre never mentioning that thing will just start going alive like small volcano and anything you do which crosses the goalsterminalline mores throws the thing into full panoply so here we go and we find him hating you horribly he doesnt know why never never find anything anyplace well of course this makes tough tough assessment but what do you know you can actually assess across such level you can actually assess across such modifier now lets say we had modifier like and never to let anyone come close to ever oh man think of what that would do youd do sort of detour around the goal every time youd get down toward the goal now that its position is known by the pc reactively you get down toward the goal the second that you got on the goal youd get an arc break just before you got to the goal or youd get something going here and youd never the pcd never be reached he would have made his modifier it isnt his goal its his modifier so you finally get the goal but the modifier is still there so the pc is therefore hard to audit so i can get you to look forward to some much easier auditing it isnt so difficult to get the terminal or hold the pc into prehav level run if youve got the modifier that becomes very easy auditing why because the fangs are gone out of the situation youre just auditing both sides of it the pc knows full well its to hate everybody horribly and hell even make wisecrack at you youd better not make wisecrack at the pc the pc can always make wisecrack about his owntheres little rule in this thats almost technical fact the pc can always joke about his own goal or terminal but youd better not you get some of the sourest looks its quite amusing but anyway there was the trickiness back of it all but this doesnt say that it requires less trickiness in the future it requires the same amount or better auditing to get that goal particularly if the pc knows youre now going to pull his modifier and the pc is liable to sit there saying well lets see oh thats my goal huh to be lute player well thats pretty good i wonder what the modifier is hm do you suppose its soandso soandso soandso i hate everybody horribly pc is kind of doing selfaudit on it you know and youve got to hold him in line and get it anyhow so it might be little tougher to get the goal than it was before on somebody thats aware of this and it might not be but some of you are going to laugh madly about the final modifier that appears after your goal because this is the craziest thing anybody ever heard of itll be something that makes it just its just the complete voltevis there you were minding your own business and all you wanted to do was play the violin and so forth and yet theres this whole long tail on this kite particularly hit people over the heads with it or something like this you see or to play violin so that i will never under gods green earth become god oh that kind of thing you see its so i will never become so i will not have so it will not happen these are all denyers now the mechanics the basic mechanics of this are pretty easy to see you dont have to say that these things were implanted into the pc you dont have to say they were you dont have to figure it out this way or that the pc implanted it into somebody else the pc will immediately realize that this makes quite game but in the past when you started to run the game out you were running up against the modifier and the first few levels of the prehav scale would find pc pretty feeling pretty bad because the modifier was in and it wasnt asising but the games condition involved with it gives us great understanding of it the pc has goal to build or make violins let us say well what do you think happens in the course of existence the person goes on for millennia and hes good violin maker and hes going to make violins what do you thinkll eventually happen hell eventually certainly pick up packaged counterpostulate wont he thetans being thetans for instance were building beautiful fireplace out here people have been coming by making the wildest cracks about that sort of thing youve got to be awfully careful because it the state bricklayer is about to drop brick or two on their heads you see but its perfectly nice fireplace very effective and so forth it hasnt got any of its trim or anything so it merely looks massive but they cant see something like this happening as forward goal without adding counterpostulate you got the idea they just cant do it theyre in games condition with life and any degree whatsoever why somebody says i would like to teach cats to race somebody the least somebodys liable to say is well its been tried or i dont think itd be easy to do that and if you had mother or father who was particularly in games condition with life everything you said got something of this order dont you see so your overt of course is that youve been doing it too and one gets into this sort of thing somebody has an ambition to shoot your head off youre liable to get counterpostulate on the subject and youre liable to say you shouldnt have such goal and youre liable to dream this up in such way well only madmen have goals of that character and eventually you could see that the person would wind up with goal something on this order to shoot everybodys head off even though only madmen do it you see hed get the same combo hed get the goal and the modifier would get united to some degree well thats all well and good and that would apparently work out all right but theres this other piece of nonsense connected with this thing one must have overts on the person who has the goal and modifier see its the other person that has done that and the overts of the pc are against the person who has the goal and modifier its very complicated isnt it somebody else has to have the goal and modifier otherwise if they were the pcs terminals they would have asised i mean if they were the pcs ideas or postulates they would have asised right now but they havent theyre still stuck there so the other way of sticking them is to have them in terminal and you get the goal plus modifier in terminal which doesnt have the postulates that the pc has see so the postulates goal plus modifier belong to terminal and now the pc is against the terminal and thats the way you get that out the pcs overts and other rambunctiousness against this terminal and the overwhelmingness of the terminal toward the pc eventually winds the pc up in this terminal which has this goal and modifier we can see how the goal and modifier got together thats very easy to see but how did they get perpetuated to this degree so they never got asised well you put them in valence see and you had nothing to do with the ideas of the valence and of course they didnt asis thats about all there is to the mechanics of the situation its not actually very difficult mechanical situation its more humorous than not because once you start looking over the modifiers which are actually on the ends of the purest of goals why this goal is the purest sweetest goal you ever saw you could just hear brahms playing in the distance you see its just marvelous but it winds up with something like and never tolerate anyone if i can kill them first you know see or something weird like this you see to benefit all children i just leave it up in the air what you can count on is that it will be denyer therell be denyer about it itll be something missing about it all the thing will be worded in such way as to say it isnt there and that it will modify the living daylights out of it and itll give you an entirely different more finite real terminal picture which is very central to the pcs immediate case and worries all this is pretty easy do you find anything difficult about it hco bulletin of november 7 1961 covers all of this data ive been going over it with you because i want you to do it now as soon as you audit your pc again i want you to perform those actions just like that now you can go ahead and get these things checked out and go through them as before and so on because theyre relatively easy to check out you think you can do this all right this thing this thing looks pretty simple all right might not look simple to you does it look simple audience yes all right you can see that funny thing has happened here is the front end stays as hard or even harder and all of sudden the routine gets much easier down toward the end well let say that this thing only works when accompanied by security checks i was rather interested in very well known auditor who wont come near anybody for any training hasnt for years and years and years and years and years and he was insisting somebody find his goal and terminal for him but he wouldnt have it done if he were going to get security check too and somebody has actually consented to do goals terminals assessment on that person on those conditions i imagine the tail end of that goal is to get help and kill myself in the process because he actually would know better than to do something like that even him but i think thats quite amusing so security check must go along with routine 3a and youll find the most fruitful security check that you can run on pc it requires bit of an imagination and skill is to do dynamic assessment on the pc weve been doing this youve been getting this in your auditors report notes and so forth and ive not said too fabulous much about it but if you can get dynamic assessment and get the dynamic that is out and then compartment the dynamic i gave you lecture on it but im just saying you do this off the cuff you dont need lot of paraphernalia and sec check that dynamic smartly on the pc you actually will pull what the pc considers withholds you will pull those much more strongly and id like to add one more note this is almost enough discoveries for one lecture wouldnt you say offhand the earth shakes when you look at something like this i actually i feel little bit contrite about suddenly giving you steer to this degree it was quite startling to that piece of the jigsaw puzzle was sitting right there you know there was missing piece of the puzzle right there that was making it much harder and it was making it much longer and much more arduous yeah you can do it by running out one side only but it is evidently much harder now theres another piece of the puzzle thats enough and i should say nothing more about it but i cant forbear as long as i brought up security checking to give you an interesting little discovery on the subject of security checking the person who will not i found this out the other evening person who will not admit to overts or withholds or react on overts or withholds will react on direct notknow question you know they dont consider it an overt really and they dont consider they have withhold and the sec check question would be clear otherwise will apparently react on whole channel particularly on another person with notknow question but its simple one not the original notknow version that came out two or three months ago but very simple version such as well lets say were security checking an employee and wed simply say well what doesnt your boss know now you could have said what have you done to your boss what have you withheld from your boss and you wouldnt have gotten any reaction on the needle but if you say what doesnt your boss know or what have you done that your boss doesnt know about you get needle response thats quite interesting thats an interesting thing to know just this little piece of stuff as you go down the line youll very often find this girl shes been very unhappily married for years or find this guy and hes been having an awful hard time and you say well what have you done to your wife and he says nothing hes never done anything to her well what have you withheld from her nothing never withheld anything from her and i can put this little slingshot in your hands which is well what doesnt your wife know boom evidently it isnt crime but its an awful reaction because its basic disagreement youre asking for the most fundamental disagreement there is the reason the trick works he knows something she doesnt know and of course thats the most fundamental disagreement there is and of course youre asking right at the center of overts and withholds and after youve got these off dont be surprised if he explains it all to you that these are overts and that these are withholds and youll now get reactions on overts and withholds never considered them overts before but now after youve stripped this one little question off just what doesnt blank know is the clue to all of this thats the wording that goes into it youre liable to get all sorts of ramifications to the whole thing but they will eventually come down to needle reaction on it its good thing to know good thing to use all right finishing off this data on routine 3a who is to use routine 3a well i would say anybody who has been thoroughly trained at saint hill can use routine 3a who else can use routine 3a nobody is that plain enough i think wed save an enormous number of casualties by just laying it down right there and of course having laid that down and having publicized it broadly and so forth just look at the people you could make guilty when they come limping in and saying well i went around to glutz up in chicago and they get your bulletins regularly theyre sent in to them by the ama and so on and they found my goal and terminal all right and ran on it and then ever since that time ive had this this this odd this odd leaping sensation and so forth well at that time remember you at least have the solace of being able to make them guilty also and say well why didnt you get the cotton out of your ears the time you were told nobody was supposed to use this except certain definitely trained auditors okay well its all yours go ahead im not going to probably tonight aside from one or two im not going to do too much with your reports im going to be very interested in tomorrow night when youve had crack at all this okay female voice thank you all right well its all yours thank you very much
