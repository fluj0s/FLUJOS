hours legislation it was designed only to establish reserve to collect funds from repealed oil and gas subsidie s that could be used to support new incentives for energy efficiency and renewa ble energy the goal of the reserve was to reduce foreign oil dependence and to s erve other purposes the actual uses of the reserve would have been determined at later date by furt her legislation the issues involving the reserve were further addressed by the budget resolution process2 at that point hr 6 was not an omnibus energy policy bill senate amends hr 6 on june 21 2007 the senate adopted an amendment in the nature of substitute to hr 6 samdt 15023 this action transformed hr 6 into 500page omnibus energy policy bill with primary focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy the new

21 billion in tax subsidies for oil and natural gas subsequently the white house released statement of administration policy on the housepassed bill it threat ened to veto the bill because it raises taxes in way that will increase energy costs facing consumers it would also impose national renewable ectricity standard that would ignore the specific energy and economic needs of individual states17
