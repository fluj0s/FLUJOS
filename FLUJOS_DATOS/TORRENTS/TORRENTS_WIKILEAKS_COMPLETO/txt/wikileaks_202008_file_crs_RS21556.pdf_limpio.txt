by mutual agreem ent until january 11 2008 time would likely be required to reach intraeu agreement to lift the prohibitions on already approved ge products or to launch court challenges to require mber countries to lift their prohibitions on ge products1 background in may 2003 the united states canada and argentina re quested consultations the first step in wto dispute settlement with the eu concerning the latters facto moratorium since 1998 on approving new ge products us agricultural interests contended that these policies not only blocke d their exports to the eu but also fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of ag ricultural biotechnolog throughout the world although the eu recommenced approvals in may 2004 with the approval of ge corn variety for human consumpti on number of eu member st ates continue to block dissemination of approved biot ech varieties the eu re started its pproval process following adoption of new labeling and traceab ility rules for ge crops and foods in 20032 the united states accounted for 54 of the 252 million acres 102 million hectares planted globally with ge crops in 20063 in 2005 85 of all us soybean 76 of us cotton and 45 of us corn acres were plante d with ge varieties designed mainly to control pests weeds and insects4 ge production is not segregated from production from traditional varieties because the us regulatory system recognizes ge crops once approved for commercializa tion as substantially equivalent to nonge varieties gaining market acceptance of ge crops within the ited states has been easier than overseashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556crs3 5 before the moratorium the eu had approved the commercial release of 18 genetically modified organisms gmos including m on810 and roundupready soybeanshowever where in markets like the eu c onsumers and their governments have been more wary of biotechnology with minor exceptions the eu and its member states approved ge products between 1998 nd 2004 as of january 2004 22 ge products or crops were awaiting approval bloc of eu stat had effectively halted the release of any new ge crops into the environment saying that they would not implement the euwide legislation for approvals until new stricter regulations for labeling and tracing gecontaining products discussed below took effect5 in the three years before the facto ban us corn exports to the eu averaged about 300 million annually according to usda data spa in and portugal were the largest eu importers during the ban they declined to less than onetenth of that value annually the result according to analysts of the eus moratorium on the approval of new corn varieties already approved in th united states although one variety of biotech corn was approved by the eu prior to the moratorium th united states grew other varieties thus us export of any corn to the eu was impractical because of the difficulty of segregating approved from unappr oved varieties the wto case the united states and cocomplainants argued that the eu moratorium violated the wto agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures the sps agreement permits countries to regulate crops and food products to protect health and the environment but their rules must be sc ientifically justified and approval procedures must occur without undue delay us in terests contend that there is scientific evidence that ge food and feed crops are substantially different from or any less safe than conventional varie ties conclusion they say even european scientific authorities have reached the united states contends that eu biotechnology measures also are inconsistent with provisions of other wto agreements namely the technical barriers to trade agreement tbt the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the agreement on agriculture eu officials counter that their cautious approach to regulating biotechnology is necessary to cultivate trust among european consumers at the same time they also assert that they have shown good faith in m oving quickly to restar t the approval process in may 2004 the eu effectively ended the mora torium by approving ge corn variety syngenta bt11 for human consumption since then the eu has approved ge corn varieties monsantos nk603 for both hum an and animal consumption pioneers 1570 corn for feed use and 17 strains of ge corn seed all derived from the mon 810 strain approved in 1998 for commercial usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556crs4 6 see httpheinonlineorgholpagehandleheinfedreg 051123id96collectionfedreg 7 httpeuropaeuinteurlexp rienojdat2001l_106l_10620010417en00010038pdfdiffering regulatory approaches the united states has embraced the concep t of substantial equivalence with regard to ge products if ge produc t is substantially the same as its conventional counterpart it should be regulated differe ntly than the conventional pr oduct the eu on the other hand takes precautionary approach whic h means that if scientific evidence is insufficient or inconclusive regarding pr actices or products pot ential dangers to human or environmental health it s hould be more vigorously regu lated or even prohibited if there are reasonable grounds for concern thus providing safeguard against future unforeseen problems under this approac h the products of biotechnology are deemed to be inherently different from their conventional counterpa rts and to require separate regulatory regime united states the basic federal guidance fo r regulating biotechnology products is the coordinated framework for re gulation of biotechnology 51 fed reg 23302 one of its key principles is that ge pr oducts should be regulated according to their characteristics and unique features not acco rding to their method of production once approved food products do not have to be labeled as to wh ether or not they contain any genetically modified organisms except to the extent that ge food is substantially different eg contains an allergen or s changed nutritional content because they are deemed substantially equivalent ge pr oducts are regulated under existing federal statutory authorities6 european union the eu has established separate structures specifically for approving ge products and fo r labeling products derived fro m them currently the key measure is council directive 2001 18 as amended in july 20037 which spells out steps for assessing human health and environm ental risks before any ge product can be released into the environment or marketed prior to the 2003 amendments the competent authority in the eu member state where th product was to be re leased was responsible for assessing its safety and if approved notifying other mber states opening the way for marketing throughout the eu with eul evel intervention if one member state disagreed with anothers decision the am ended directive provide s for onedoorone key approach whereby the european f ood safety authority efsa conducts all scientific risk asse ssments and communicates risks to the public then the eu council of ministers decides whether or not to pprove ge product for the eu market eu regulations empower the european commission to approve applications by default if the council of ministers fails to act on them within three months labeling and traceability the wto case does not involve new st ricter eu labeling and traceability regulations which us agricultural interests argue continued to discriminate against us exports even after the ge product appr oval moratorium was lif ted the labeling and traceability regulations adopted in july 2003 re quire that most foods ingredients and for the first time animal feed s from ge products be labeled even if they longerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21556crs5 8 personal communication with economic research service january 21 2005 9 details on these surveys can be found at ers economic issues in agricultural

labeled however traceability provisions now require all firms th at produce store move or process ge products to track and keep records on them fro m farm to consumer compliance with the eu labeling rule requires segr egation of ge crops and foods derived from them from the time they are planted all the way through the processing and marketing chain this entails prevention of pollen drift from ge to nonge fields and difficult and costly handling procedures such as us ing separate equipment storag and shipping containers or at least painstakingly cleaning them u s interests argue that food companies forced to label accurately all ge pr oducts face huge risks and liabilitie s all of these problems discriminate against us shipments even though they are as safe as conventional shipments they contend in practice many us manufacturers have opted not to market ge products in the eu in part due to the eus stricter ge regulations8 differing public attitudes differing us and eu perspectives may reflect the fact that us consumers apparently have been not only less fearful of ge foods than their european counterparts but also more confident in their food safe ty regulators according to usdas economic research service ers surveys of cons umer attitudes toward ge products conducted both here and overseas have yielded mixed results still us consumers have voiced little objection to genetically modified foods while eu consumers have been vocal in their disapproval ers observed9 europeans may be much more wary of changes in how their food is produced due to series of recent food safety cris during the 1990s bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease emerged in the united kingdom and spread to other parts of europe uk food safety authorities first in

recently concerns have been voiced by eu ropean grain and feedstuffs traders and compound feed manufacturers about eu regu lations and attitudes about ge corn and soybeans10 they point to short

stance with respect to eu biotechnology regulations senator grassley the ranking member of the senate finance committee has expressed hope that the eu would soon come into compliance with the wto ruling in the biotechnology case he noted that although he would have preferred the us trade representative to take harder line in the cas he recognized that hard approach of seeking retaliation might not be successful11 at the same time many lawmakers are well aware of the risks involved in escalating useu trade tensions to new heights pending house and senate ve rsions of new farm bill hr 2419 to
