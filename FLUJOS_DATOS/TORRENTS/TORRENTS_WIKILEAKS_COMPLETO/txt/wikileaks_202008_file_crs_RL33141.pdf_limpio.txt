made landfall on the gulf coast between the major cities of new orleans louisiana to the west and mobile alabama to the east along the gulf coast and inland in the swath of the storm hurricane katrina impacted hundreds of thousands of families in three states louisiana mississippi and alabama and contributed to the deaths of more than 1000 people while crs estimates that 58 million people in three states may have experienced hurricaneforce winds the majority rode out the storm safely the geographic range of katrinas hurricaneforce winds corresponds quite closely with the 88 counties declared as disaster areas by the federal emergency management agency fema see figure 1 depicting hurricane katrinas storm track estimated extent of hurricane and tropical force winds counties designated fema

concentrated along the gulf coas t within 100mile radius of where the storm made landfall within this area damage due to high winds and storm surge resulted in significant vastation but flooding largely resulting from breached levees and flood walls affected the great est number of people with much of new orleans flooded crs estimates that 700000 or more people may have been acutely impacted by hurricane katrina as result of residing in areas that flooded or sustained significant structural damage this estimate is based on geographical analysis of federal emergency management agency fema flood and damage assessments and year 2000 census data the estimates in this report are subject to the methods and assumptions used other agencies and organizations are conducting assessments using alternative and complementary thodologies estimates may differ depending upon the specific methodologies used in th case of this analysis the estimates reflect the numbers and characteristics of people families and households in 2000 who lived in areas that suffered dama ge or flooding from the hurricane in 2005 the analysis shows that the louisiana parishes of orleans and st bernard were especially hard hit by flooding with an estimated 77 of orleanss population affected and nearly all re sidents of st bernard in mississippi 55 of hancock countys population is estimated to have been affected by flooding andor structural damage and in the more populous harris on county about 19 of its population in louisiana an estimated 645000 people may have been displaced by the hurricane based on 2000 census data and in mississippi 66000 hurricane katrina had varying impacts on the population crs estimates that of the people most likely to have been disp laced by the hurricane about half lived in new orleans due to the citys so cial and economic composition the storm impacted heavily on the poor and african am ericans crs estimates that onefifth of those displaced by the storm were likel to have been poor and 30 had incomes that were below 1½ times the poverty line african americans are estimated to have accounted for approximately 44 of the storm victims an estimated 88000 elderly persons age 65 and older many with strong community ties may have been displaced along with 183000 children many of whom were just starting the school year when the storm struck katrinas impact on individuals families and communities will be felt for years to come and will take time to fully comprehend this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33141contents introduction

college dormitories and other group quarters fourteen counties with combined population of 25 million people experienced some flooding andor structural da mage based on fema flood and damage assessments all of these counties are within the 100mile radius of the storms landfall included in this region are the cities of new orleans estimated to have 445000 people the biloxigulfportpa scagoula mississippi metropolitan area estimated at 364000 people and mobile county alabama estimated at 393000 persons4 the populations of these 14 counties bore the brunt of the storm however the impact was not uniform across the counties using combination of fema damage assessment and census data crs estimate s that within thes 14 countie s about 700000 people may have been the most acu tely impacted by hurricane katrina experiencing flooding andor sign ificant structural damage see figure 2 which provides an overview of the areas most directly impacted by the storm it is this population those most severely impacted that is the reports primary focus structure of the report this report begins with discussion of femas disaster declaration process nd its application to hurricane katrina it then presents crs estimates of the population living with in 14 of the 88 counties designated as eligible for disaster assistance who were most affected and most likely displaced by the storm in total and in each of the three affected states louisiana mississippi and alabama these estimates are broken down by whether people were living in areas that experienced flooding ndor structural damage nd further by the level of structural damage the balance of the report presents socialdemographic profile of this acutely affected population looking at such characteristics as poverty and raceethnicity status homeownership and hous ing status separate discussions are also provided of the aged children and wo rkingage adults although this report does not explicitly discuss policy implications its findings are relevant to numerous aspects of the postkatrina debate on how to address the immediate and ongoing needs of the affect ed populati ons both in their home counties as well as the many other parts of the country to which some have relocated crs estimates in this report are based on the mapping of fema flood and damage assessments september 21 2005 dat applied to census 2000 data the estimates provide rough approximati on of the numbers and characteristics of persons families and households that ar most likely to have been impacted by the hurricane other agencies and organizations are conducting assessments using alternate and complementary thodologies estimates may differ depending upon the specific met hodologies used the estimates presented in this report rely heavily on the completeness and accuracy of the fema flood and damage assessment data the fema data ar likely to have captured most but not all hurricanerelated damage and miss inland damage along the

and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of catastrophe in any part of the united stat 42 usc 51221 6 for comprehensive list of the types of aid authorized by the stafford act see crs report rl33053 federal stafford act disaster assistanc presidential declarations eligible activities and funding by keith bea 7 see regulations as 44 cfr 20648bhurricane katrina fema declared disaster areas the presidential declaration of major disaster identifies the types of disaster assistance available in affected areas usually counties or the state equivalent of counties or independent cities the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act authorizes range of federal aid for states localities and households in the event of presidentially declared major disast er the declaration process for emergencies is similar to that used for major disasters but the criteria based on the definition of emergency are less specific5 the two major categories of assistance are public assistance which encompasses various forms of aid to state and local governments and some nonprofit organizations and federal assistance to individuals and households6 federal assistance is provided to individuals and households who are uninsured or underinsur ed to pay for necessary expenses as result of the disaster that cannot be met otherwise and may include fina ncial help to occupy alternative housing provision of temporary housing units home repair and aid for other expenses fema has issued regulations that specify the criteria for determining whether individual and household assistan ce is available in an area though the stafford act provides for presidential discretion in designating areas as eligible for disaster aid the regulations include the following fact ors for considering whether individual and household assistance should be available in an area 1 concentration of damage 2 the degree of trauma to state and communities such as large numbers of injuries or deaths large scale disruptions of normal community func tions and emergency needs such as extended or widespread ss of power 3 special populations such as whether the area includes lowincome elde rly or unemployed persons 4 the extent to which state and local or voluntary agen cies can meet need s 5 the amount of insurance coverage in an area and 6 the amount of individua l assistance provided by the state7 in all total of 31 parishes in louisiana 47 counties in mississippi and 10 counties in alabama were declared eligible for individual and household disaster assistance government entities in wider areas of these states were declared eligible for other forms of disaster aid hurricane katrina estimates of population affected in impacted areas the analysis that follows focuses on the population in those areas that were hardest hit by the hurricane those communities that experienced significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33141crs6 8 areas of assessed damage and flooding we re apportioned by census block the smallest unit of census geography based on the population in the block and the blocks overlapping and nonoverlapping habitable area ie land as opposed to water with the assessed damage areas apportioned census block populations by percent in flood areas andor areas with assessed structural damage were then summed up by census tract the apportionment rates were then applied to census 2000 summary tract level data which provide information about the social demogr aphic income and housing characteristics of the populati on in order to describe populations most severely impacted by the hurricane for fuller description of the methodology used see appendix damage from flooding excluding areas with saturated soil or that had assessed structural damage excluding limited damage the estimates are based on an analysis of census 2000 census tract leve l data and fema dama ge assessment data mapped into geographic information system gis8 it should be emphasized that the estimates are based on 2000 census data reflecting the number and characteristics of the population at that time as if hurricane katr ina struck in april 2000 as opposed to august 2005 fema damage assessment criteria femas damage assessment is characterized by several damage categories structural damage catastrophic damage most solid and all light or mobile structures are destroyed extensive damage some solid structures are destroyed mostsustain exterior and interior damage eg roofs are missing interior walls exposed most mobile homes and light structures are destroyed moderate damage solid struct ures sustain exterior damage eg missing roofs or roof segments some mobile homes and light structures are stroyed many are damaged or displaced limited damage generally superficial damage to solidstructures eg loss of tiles or roof shingles some mobile homes and light structures are damaged or displaced floodwater damage flood indicates separate vere damage category related to the specific effects of flooding saturated area indicates the possibility of water damage dueto saturated soil it should be noted that flood and wate r damage are assesse d separately from structural damage consequently areas th at are designated as flooded may or may not also contain areas of assessed structural damage similarly some areas with structural damage may so be assessed as flooded httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33141crs7 population estimates crs estimates that more than 700000 people were most acutely impacted by hurricane katr ina having lived in neighborhoods that either experienced flooding or significant structural damage catastrophic extensive or moderate persons who lived in areas that experienced only limited damage unless also flooded or in nonflooded sa turated areas are excluded from this estimate approximately 657000 people lived in areas that were flooded accounting for over 90 of those most acute ly impacted by the storm among the 657000 people likely impacted by flooding approximately 25000 also lived in areas with significant structural damage that was either catastrophic 5000 extensive 4200 or moderate 15400 in nonflooded areas approximately 54000 people were impacted by catastrophic 35000 exte nsive 5600 or moderate structural damage 13700 likely due to wind andor surging water because areas could be affected by both flooding and structural damage we have regrouped areas affected into the following nonoverlapping groups to avoid double counting and to capture the populations most directly impacted by the storm catastrophic damage regard less of flood status 40000 flooded excluding areas of catastrophic damage 652000 nonflooded extensive damage 5600 and nonflooded moderate damage 13700 people who lived in areas that were ffected only with limited damage 144000 or nonflooded saturated areas not assessed in this analysis are grouped with the remainder of the population in the 14 countie sparishes chosen for this analysis based on the fema dama geflood assessment see table 1 flooding as noted above flooding is separate assessmen t criterion which may or may not overlap with assessed structural damage here areas that had flooding and structural damage other th an catastrophic damage are classified as flooded along with those areas that onl had flooding and assessed structural damage the preponderance of the popula tion who lived in flooded areas were concentrated in louisiana 97 of the tota l st bernard parish to the southeast of new orleans was especially hard hit by flooding with an estimated 65000 affected nearly its entir populati on 97 over threequarters 372000 of orleans parishs population is estimated to have been affected by flooding nearly half 13000 of plaquemines parish s population also to the southeast of new orleans and about twofifths 181000 of jefferson pa rishs population just to the west and south of new orleans see figure 3 in mississippi nearly 22000 people appear to have been affected by flooding with the majority 20000 concentrated in hancock county the western most county on the mississippi gulf coast just to the northeast of new orleans louisiana alabama

flood and damage assessments and us census 2000 summary file 4 sf4 data files hurricane katrina social impacts hurricane katrina likely made one of the poorest areas of the country even poorer among those displ aced by the storm many lost their homes material possessions and jobs some had insurance to replace their material property losses received help from fema or small business loans to get by on an emergency basis or replace property or received unemployment insurance or disaster unemployment insurance to replace lost wages however some who lived in the areas most impacted by the storm may now be destitute while having financially gotten by before the storm in the storms aftermath they may have joined the ranks of the poor further the socioeconomic profile of the areas hardest hit by katrina indicates that these newly poor would join population that was already disproportionately poor and disadvantaged before the storm th 700000 people acutely affected by katrina were more likely than americans overall to be poor minority most often african american less likely to be connected to the workforce and more likely to be educationally disadvantaged ie not having completed high school education both those who were poor before the storm and those who have become poor following the storm are likely to face pa rticularly difficult time in reestablishing their lives having few

the nonelderly as well as the poor source estimates prepared by the congressional research service crs with assistance from the library of congress congressional cartography program based on analysis of fema flood and damage assessments and us census 2000 summary file 4 sf4 data files it is unclear whether this lower rate of homeownership will impact the return of residents displaced by hurricane katrina renters are more mobile and may have an easier time resettling in new communities than homeowners who will need to either repair and return to damaged homes or sell them assuming that they are worth more than the amount of debt still owed on them note that 65 of owneroccupied homes in the impacted region had some fo rm of mortgage at the time of the 2000 census while census data cannot answer the question of who will return the data do indicate that homeowners in the impacted areas had lived in their homes for many years possibly indicating strong community ties more than half of all homeowners had lived in their homes for 20 or more ears compared to 42 nationally and just under third had lived in their homes for 30 or more years compared to 22 nationally the data also

assumption that population is evenly distri buted within the census block because of the small area geography of the census block error introduced at the block level is less than it would be if the appor tionment methodology had been implemented directly at the tract level apportione d census block populations by percent in flood areas andor areas with assessed stru ctural damage were then

square mile one quarter of the tracts covered less than 038 s quare miles and onequarter over 58 square milesapportionment rates applied to census 2000 tractlevel data the apportionment rates derived above were then applied to census 2000 data summarized at th census tract level27 the census 2000 summary tract level data provide the lowest leve l of geographical detail that is publicly available on broad range of social demographic in come and housing characteristics of the population as an example if census tract had population in 2000 of 3200 people28 and 20 of its population was estimated to have lived in flooded area based on the census block population apportionment rate procedure described above then 640 people would be estimated to have lived in flooded areas and 2560 in nonflooded areas if 40 of that census tract s population was african american 1280 people then under the methodology empl oyed the same share for the tracts overall population estimated to live in its fl ooded area ie 20 would be applied to the black population in the tr act 1280 to arrive at an timate of 256 black people who lived in the flooded area of th tract while the methodology estimates proportionate shares of census blocks populations affected by flooding andor structural damage at the aggregated census tract level it does not distinguish within census tract where individuals with different characteristics lived for example it assumes at the census tract leve l the entire population was affected proportionately regardless of their character istics or where they lived within the tract regrouping of areas for analysis the ten mutually exclusive areas of flooding andor damage described earlier were regrouped into areas presented in the analysis areas with catastrophic damage were combined into one grouping regardless of whether there was also flooding ie categories 1 and 2 above all areas with flooding other than those that also had catastrophic damage 2 we re combined into flooded areas ie 1 7 8 and 9 above comprehens ive data on the depth or dur ation of flooding by area were not available when we conducted this analysis so we are unable to distinguish the severity of flooding areas without fl ooding that had extensive 3 or moderate damage 4 were combined into single category lastly areas with limited damage and flooding 5 were combined with areas where there was flooding or damage 10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33141among the 14 counties or parishes where any damage or flooding was assessed the estimated populations in the redefined areas based on their april 2000 census populations were as follows catastrophic damage regard less of flood status 40000 flooded excluding areas of catastrophic damage 652000 nonflooded extensive damage 5600 nonflooded moderate damage 13700 damage or flooding or limited damage only 1747000
