internal oversight services internal audit division ii audit of unus resource management ae200537001 executive summary in october 2005 oios conducted an audit of unus r esource management the audit covered administrative activities of the unu centre with n allocation of 376 million for the 20042005 biennium unu administration adequately performs i ts tasks but lack of funding resulting from vacancies in key positions resulted in weak interna l controls in the procurement and travel functions unu needs to adopt an enterprise resourc management system to improve its records and reports unu has accepted almost all of the re commendations and is in the process of implementing most of them funding and staffing of the administration there were vacancies in key resource management pos ts resulting from lack of funding according to unu at the date of the audit except for the directo r there were only two staff at the professional level in administration ie the chief personnel and general services p4 and an acting finance officer p4 for finance bu dget and travel key vacant posts were that of procurement officer p3 building man agementconference development officer p2 an assistant personnel officer p3 and fin ance officer p3 administration expects unus core income in the 200 62007 biennium to be 15 per cent less than the 30 million of the previous biennium sequently the planned number of core posts to be funded by specific programme contributions t hat was only 20 per cent of the total income in 20042005 would increase by some 70 per cent if income reduces further even the current staffing levels and activity levels are not sustain able and unu will have to consider outposting academic and administrative units of the unu centre to lowercost locations outside of japan number of specific outposting possibilities of t he unu centre units were considered and formal proposal to the unu council was expected in december 2005 unus management is fully aware of the situation and is in the process of finding solutions in the interim and until vacant key posts are funded and filled the adminis tration will not have enough staff to perform its functions adequately finance the financial budgetary and personnel management s ystem developed at cost of some 300000 did not fully modernize unus financial m anagement platform personnel and project management systems were not included the system also lacked adequate reporting functions in particular for accounts receivables the administration was in the process of identifying an improved system within the that c ould be implemented at unu unu had 19 bank accounts as it did not monitor ce ntrally its cash certain regional training centres and programmes did not have enough cash whi others had excessive cash balance unu is in the process of taking corrective actions including that of centralizing its treasury functions the number of bank accounts at the rtc ps and the unu centre is under review and the centre has already identified two bank acco unts from unuintech and one bank account from unuwider which will be closed as soon as april 2006 system is also being put in place to analyze monthly bank balances of rt cps in relation to their budget implementation to ensure that excess of cash is kept in their accounts oios noted the corrective measures taken and improvements in cash management procedures but is of the opinion that the centre should consider introducing treasury management function as separate function within budget and financial servi ces with the appropriate expertise however oios recognizes that the skills review th at unu will undertake will first have to be completed before any formal decision can be made on the structure of such function internal controls in the issuance of allotments re gistering of obligations and the recording and payment of expenditures were adequate but clearanc procedures in respect of travel advances were unclear this resulted in delayed submission nd settlement of individual travel claims and advances for workshops some of the outstanding cl aims dated as far back as 2002 significant efforts were made to clear outstanding travel autho rizations monitoring system is being put in place to review the accounts receivable accounts on quarterly basis for outstanding claims furthermore unu administrative instructi on on administration of travel claims will be issued shortly to introduce 100 per cent ad vance payment of travel expenses including all terminal expenses the system will reduce the cost of managing travel claims and ultimately should provide more reliable control over travel ex penditure procurement unu did not make optimal use of the lcc whose compo sition is outdated there was chief procurement officer chief transport officer and the legal adviser did not attend the meetings held in the past two years since only ca ses above 50000 had to be submitted to the lcc only two cases were submitted and reviewed in 2004 and one case in 2005 related contracts below that amount in respect of hq buildi ng maintenance were issued without lcc review unu considers that the current lcc members have res ponsibilities comparable with the list of functions listed in the delegation of uthority however it should be noted that the posts of legal adviser and chief transport officer do not appear anymore on the unu staffing table although the functions of these posts are ndled directly or indirectly by the executive officer and chief personnel and general services respectively the post of chief procurement officer is not funded under the approve d budget due to lack of funding therefore unu will communicate to new york the list of curr ent members and will seek advice on the need to amend the delegation of authority according ly also unu reckoned that the limit of 70000 for the submissions to the hcc is in accord ance with its authority and that the limit proved to be effective oios does not dispute the limit of 70000 for subm issions to the hcc but the limit required for submissions to the lcc that is 50000 which means that even without procurement officer the procurement func tion could enter into procurement up to 50000 without any submission to the lcc this li mit is too high especially under the current circumstances in which the unu is without procure ment officer therefore oios suggests that unu reconsider and reduce the limit to reaso nable level especially because there is procurement officer procurement procedures did not always ensure that b est value for money fairness and transparency was attained multiyear contracts of up to five years and contracts renewal were entered into without proper review and assessment t determine their cost effectiveness as illustrated below only few companies received request for proposals for the provision of building maintenance and operation including security servic and custodial cleaning of the unu which was awarded to sanko in july 2001 for perio d of five years for an amount of 116 million per year orders were placed with ebara reinetsu system kk to overhaul the directfired absorption water chillerheater unit for 2004 and 2 005 although the overhaul was only needed every five years after contract for the maintenance of the auto matic control system was entered into with yamatake building systems co ltd in june 2001 for three years totalling 180000 bidding or quotations were obtained for extension f current services similarly renewals of the last contract with fujitec co ltd that ended i n september 2002 were merely based on note for the file from the senior procurement assis tant because the annual contract value was below us 50000 the engagement was last discusse d in lcc meeting in 1997 unu commissioned unops in 21 september 2005 to prov ide services concerning its facilities and building management of the house unu headqu arters building in tokyo the project consisted of two phases phase i is desk review nd onsite facilities assessment resulting in the production of an assessment report listing find ings recommendations and identifiable cost savings measures completed in december 2005 phas ii is the formulation of request for proposal rfp for the provision of facilities mana gementoperations services the rfp will be made public by unops during the last week of mar ch 2006 unops building manager who will be assigned onsite will manage the ctor all procurement actions for the building will then be handled by unops unu will also explore the possibility of having other procurement actions for the unu centre handled by unops at the same time options are being conside red for strengthening the procurement function of the unu including relocation of the ad ministrative functions outside of japan which would provide an opportunity to undertake s kills assessment oios views these corrective actions as good progress to address the identified shortcommings

audit of the united nations universitys unus resource management the audit was conducte d in accordance with the international standards for the professional practi ce of internal auditing 2 unu was established by the united nations genera l assembly as an international community of scholars engaged in research postgra duate training and dissemination of knowledge in furtherance of the purpose and princip of the charter of the united nations its mission is to contribute through research and capacitybuilding to the resolution of pressing problems that are of concern of the united nations its peoples and member states the aforementioned is underlined by five key roles these are that unu should be an international community of scholars form bridge between the and international academic community serve as thinktank for the u n contribute to capacitydevelopment particularly in developing countries and serve as platform for dialogue and new and creative ideas 3 it consists of the unu centre in tokyo ten unu research and training centres and programmes rtcps and network of associated an d cooperating institutions and scholars the rector is the chief academic and administrative officer of unu with the responsibility for the direction organization administration and programmes in accordance with the general policies and criteria formulated by the council of 24 members who serve in their individual capacities there are three exofficio members the secretarygeneral of the the directorgeneral of unesco and the executive direct or of the institute for training and research unus rector is also council membe r 4 unu centre assists the rector in planning progr amming and monitoring the subjects of research and areas of training for the universit and administers the overall university programme the overall resource requirement for th biennium 20042005 amounted to 813 million of which 376 million was allocated to the unu centre 5 as regards the management of resources administ ration provides overall support for the academic work of unu that includes administrati ve human resources budgetary and financial services logistical and organizational b ackstopping for the unu centre and rtcps 6 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 20 october 2005 with the rector and the director of administration draft report was then shared wit h the executive officer of the office of the rector on 2 march 2006 and reply was received from the rector of unu on 21 march the comments are shown in this report in italics unu has accepted almost all of the recommendations and is in the process of implementi ng most of them ii audit objectives 7 the overall objective of the audit was to evalua the efficiency and effectiveness of unu resource management and compliance to united na tions and unu regulations and 2 rules this includes square4 assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the u nu centres administration including budget financial personnel and procurem ent as well as travel functions square4 assessing the unu centres compliance to and unu regulations and rules square4 assessing the integrity of data that supports manag erial decisionmaking on resource management iii audit scope and methodology 8 the audit focused on the unu centres administra tion and reviewed expenditures incurred within the 20042005 biennium of 376 mil lion the audit assessed processes interviewed staff and reviewed records and reports iv audit findings and recommendations resources funding and staffing of the administr ation 9 income for the unu centre totaled 37 million as of 31 august 2005 for the 2004 2005 biennium of which 30 million 80 per cent c onsisted of core income and 7 million 20 per cent specific programme contributions dowment fund contributions to rtcps and the unu centre were pooled and the income was d istributed according to the ratio of contributions core or specific programme contribut ions to rtcps are not used for resources at the unu centre even though substantial part f the unu centres resources management is devoted to rtcps especially personn management but also procurement and financial services 10 unu centres core income was not sufficient to fund all post in administration and certain key posts that depended on the receipt of s pecific programme contributions remained unfilled for lack of funds at the date of the aud it and except for the director there were only two staff at the professional level in administrati on ie the chief personnel and general services p4 and an acting finance officer p4 for finance budget and travel vacant posts were that of procurement officer p3 b uilding managementconference development officer p2 an assistant personnel fficer p3 and finance officer p3 11 the unu centre expected its core income for the 20062007 biennium to be 15 per cent less than the 20042005 biennium and the numbe r of posts to be funded from specific programme contributions to increase by almost 70 pe r cent three of these are within administration two in procurement procurement off icer p3 and general service clerk gs4 and the chief of budget finance travel uni t p4 12 unu faces many of the same challenges of other organizations in mobilizing resources and in the 20062007biennium will have l ess income especially for the unu centre because of reduction in investment income from the endowment fund coupled by less income from the host country japan over the past years therefore number of cost saving measures were introduced and it became neces sary to abolish unfilled posts if income reduces further the current staffing levels and ac tivity levels are not sustainable and unu 3 will have to consider outposting academic and admi nistrative units of the unu centre to lowercost locations outside of japan number of specific outposting possibilities of unu centre units are considered and formal proposal t the unu council was expected in december 2005 in the interim and until vacant key posts are funded and filled the administration will remain under pressure to perfor m its functions adequately b treasury 13 the budget and financial services at the unu ce ntre had the overall responsibility to manage and report on the financial resources of unu fund management was excluded private firm managed the endowment fund also hos t countries of rtcps deposited their operational contributions core funding besides the endowment fund and special contributions and specific contributions directly in bank accounts of the rtcps and not in the bank accounts of the unu centre therefore and although some treasury functions are performed the centre does not have fullfledge t reasury function 14 internal controls over unu funds were found to be adequate but there were many bank accounts there were 19 bank accounts in tota l with two rtcps unu wider and unu iist having three each and unu intech four bank accounts this weakened the unu centres central control and oversight over rtc ps fund management and the practice to keep funds only in bank accounts in countries wh ere the rtcps are located resulted in excess cash being kept at some banks with potenti loss of revenue the bank account opened with the representative office in paris for example had balance of 340000 that equaled more than 20 months expenditures recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should introduce treasury management function within the budget and financial services to manage unu funds including that of rtcps to ensure that unu obtain the best retur n on its cash funds or at least prevent potential loss f revenue rec 01 15 unu accepted the recommendation and is in the proce ss of taking corrective actions already opening of bank accounts appointment of c ertifying officers approving officers and bank signatories is coordinated centrally in cl ose relation with the treasurer of the united nations secretariat conscious of the impor tance of the treasury function and anticipating the growing budgets of unu the combin ed budgets of the rtcps in the approved biennium budget of 20062007 grew by 423 per cent while at the same time the budget for the unu centre decreased by 149 per cen t the council of unu at its 50th session in december 2003 established separate fu nd managed by the unu centre the revolving cash fund to meet the shortterm cash fl ow requirements of duly authorized unu activities the number of bank accounts opened for the rtcps and the unu centre is currently under review and the centre have already identified two bank accounts from unu intech and one bank account from unuwider which wil l be closed as soon as april 2006 system is also being put in place to analyz monthly bank balances of rtcps in relation to their budget implementation to ensure t hat excess of cash is kept in their 4 accounts skills review within finance services w ill be undertaken to identify any gaps in expertise and if required appropriate measures wil l be taken including training oios noted the corrective measures taken and improvement s in cash management procedures but is of the opinion that the centre should consider i ntroducing treasury management function as separate function within budget and financial services with the appropriate expertise however oios recognizes that the skills review wil l first have to be completed before any formal decision can be made on the structure of suc h function oios will record the recommendation once the structure of the function h ad been determined c budget 16 budgets are prepared by organizational units an d are similar in format the 2004 2005 approved budget was not sufficiently resultsb ased but for 20062007 the guidelines for preparation specifically encourage organization units to reflect resultsbased budgeting approach it is however understandably difficult to determine expected outputs for academic activities even more difficult to link such outpu ts with resources utilized inputs therefore resultsbased budgeting is an approach t hat unu could only achieve over period of time as organizational units become more convers ant with the approach and identify more measurable outputs 17 the status of expenditure report c revealed verobligations totaling some 500000 in number of object lines because the lotments were not revised we requested the administration to review and revise the allotme nts in consultation with the programmes prior to yearend the administration undertook to review them d unus finance and accounting system fbpms 18 the financial budgetary and personnel managemen t system fbpms developed at cost of some 300000 did not fully modernize th unus financial management platform it did not include personnel or project management systems and had shortcomings the systems coding structure did not have enough flexi bility some important functions and control procedures such as fundsufficiency checks reporting payroll bank reconciliation and the clearance of accounts had to be performed m anually or in separate systems that were not linked to fbpms the system also lacked adequa reporting functions 19 according to report of consultancy firm th ere were technical problems and weaknesses in the system it also lacked system doc umentation therefore the administration viewed the possibility to further velop the system as slim and embarked on finding another system at other organizations when found comparative study would have to be carried out that should take into consid eration the strengths of fbpms which were found in its subsystems within the expenditur cycle ie allotment obligation and payment functions and cost implications expenditure cycle and related internal controls internal controls and supporting documentation 5 20 oios found the internal controls in the expendi ture cycle especially in the issuance of allotments and registering of obligations as st rengths in the unu centres financial management sufficient supporting documentation was found for payroll individual contracts and purchase orders however clearance procedures were not clear to properly settle advances for workshops and trainings and final cont ract payments to institutions also programmes did not always provide adequate supporti ng documentation to finance to clear advances travel authorizations individuals 21 travel is one of the main categories of expendi tures with 1400 travel authorizations issued since the beginning of 2004 22 claims were not submitted in timely manner w ith outstanding advances dating as far back as 2002 as ageing reports were not avail able in fbpms to facilitate followup the task to followup on claims was too time consuming and one staff members time was solely devoted to travel claims for individuals the list of travel authorizations pt8i which was the only control mechanism was not complete 23 an automated system or improvement in fbpms i s required to provide information on outstanding claims per staff member in the int erim finance should record all outstanding claims from the travel authorizations group them p er staff member and send reminders with deadline to settle advances recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should prepare complete list of outstanding travel authorizations pt8 i group them per staff member and send reminders to them with deadline to submit their claims rec 0 2 24 unu agreed with the recommendation and for the 2004 2005 biennium significant efforts were made to clear outstanding travel autho rizations monitoring system is being put in place to review the arl on quarterly basis for outstanding claims furthermore unu administrative instruction on administration f travel claims will be issued shortly to introduce 100 per cent advance payment of travel expenses including all terminal expenses the system will reduce the cost of manag ing travel claims and ultimately should provide more reliable control over travel expenditu re oios concurs with the actions taken and will record the recommendation as implemented u pon receipt from unu of confirmation that the outstanding travel authorizations have bee n cleared travel authorizations workshops 25 finance did not have complete documents to ver ify settlement of advances for workshops and to follow up on outstanding advances because programme offices which prepared settlement sheets to clear these advances did not forward them to finance list of outstanding travel authorizations pt8 ms was not available but we noted advances of 2004 that were still not cleared in general adva nces for workshops were substantial one obligation was for 73000 with 28000 still to b cleared since may 2004 the practice to 6 keep the settlement sheets in programme offices is understood because they are bulky but they are needed by finance for proper review and pport of settlement of advances recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should compile li st of outstanding travel authorizations pt8m per progr amme unit and request programme managers to submit the c learance sheets for verification by finance rec 03 head2right the unu programme units should in future submit ll clearance sheets to finance advances should not b cleared until verified by finance rec 04 26 unu agreed with the recommendations and as for reco mmendation 02 is in the process of clearing out the advances for workshops oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon receipt of confirmation that th outstanding workshop advances have been cleared and clearance sheets are submitted to finance f account receivables 27 on 12 october 2005 the accounts receivable led ger in fbpms reflected balance of 24000 but the accuracy of the ledger could t be substantiated and some accounts reflected account payables expenditures were also not separated by category of expenditure nor recorded per debtor therefore and without tim econsuming manual calculations it was not possible to determine the amounts outstanding p er individual debtor andor the totals for each type of advance ie travel advances worksho ps education grants and operational advances this hampered effective followup proced ures for settlement or collection of accounts 28 the manual workings and calculations could how ever not be avoided and until solution is found should continue also and until an improved finance system is introduced administration should request the campus computing centre to create separate accounts receivable subaccounts in the accounts receivable ledger in fbpms to enable finance to register obligations per category of expenditures nd per creditor for example pt8 i pt8 m salary and education grant advances as well as advances to institutions ica finance should be able to create new accounts for creditors as and when needed recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should request the campus computing centre to create separate accounts receiv able sub accounts in the accounts receivable ledger in fbpms to enable finance to record receivables per category f transaction and per debtor rec 05 29 unu accepted the recommendation and will consult th campus computing centre and more specifically the programmer of the oracle database tata cie to assess the technical feasibility and the cost implications u nu also acknowledged that the recommended action would provide increased function ality and control the 7 recommendation is therefore under further considera tion the recommendation remains until unu makes decision following their consultations g procurement delegation of authority and local committee on cont racts lcc 30 the delegation of procurement authority and the establishment of local committee on contracts lcc to unu was issued in 1 997 the financial delegation was limited to purchase amount of 70000 or less per transaction above this amount the case had to be submitted to the united nations headquart ers committee on contracts 31 the composition of the lcc had been approved b ut is outdated there was chief procurement officer which might have affected the delegation in itself chief transport officer and the legal adviser did not attend the etings held in the past two years 32 the unu centre decided that all procurement cas above 50000 had to be submitted to the lcc oios found this limit to be too high considering the inadequate procurement staffing number of contracts and pu rchase orders especially in respect of unu hq building maintenance were issued without lcc review and inputs merely because the amount was below the 50000 limit unu did t make optimal use of the lcc only two cases were submitted and reviewed in 2004 and ne case in 2005 recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should update the composition of the local committee on contracts lc c and reduce the 50000 limit above which all cases had to be submitted to the lcc to more reasonable level of 20000 to strengthen decisionmaking in and accountability ov er procurements also the administration should cons ider making better use of the lcc rec 06 33 unu considers that the current lcc members have res ponsibilities comparable with the list of functions listed in the delegation of uthority however it should be noted that the posts of legal adviser and chief transport officer do not appear anymore on the unu staffing table although the functions of these pos ts are handled directly or indirectly by the executive officer and chief personnel and general services respectively the post of chief procurement officer is not funded under the pproved budget due to lack of funding therefore unu will communicate to new york the l ist of current members and will seek advice on the need to amend the delegation of autho rity accordingly also unu reckoned that the limit of 70000 for the submissions to t he hcc is in accordance with its authority and that the limit proofed to be effective oios does not dispute the limit of 70000 for submissions to the hcc but the limit required for submissions to the lcc that is 50000 which means that even without procurement office r the procurement function could enter into procurement up to 50000 without any submissi on to the lcc this limit is too high especially under the current circumstances in which the unu is without procurement officer therefore oios suggests that unu reconsider and reduce the limit to reasonable level especially because there is procurement fficer 8 procurement records workload and staffing 34 monitoring of procurement cases needed improvem ent better record keeping was required in general including that for purchase r equests orders minutes of lcc meetings and contractor information register should have been introduced to keep track of purchase requests purchase orders issued and finalized the re is only one senior procurement assistant who issued 1200 purchase orders since t he beginning of 2004 including 1000 for the unu centre per fbpms records the staffing tabl provided for procurement officer but the position was not filled as it was not funded contracts and purchase orders specific cases 35 the procurement function was understaffed and in some cases the procedures followed prior to entering into contracts did not nsure that unu engaged the best available contactors at the best prices contracts were also entered into for substantial periods up to five years while other contracts were renewed with out proper review and assessment to determine whether the contractor remained the most preferred contractor and as to whether the contract was costeffective this was oios as sessment after reviewing the main contracts in particular the following contracts t hat were of substantial amounts 36 proper bidding procedures were not followed as the request for proposal were submitted to few companies only in the fiveyear contract on provision of building maintenance and operation including security servic and custodial cleaning of the unu with sanko in july 2001 for an amount of 116 mill ion per year 37 there was bidding quotations andor even co ntracts after 2003 for extension of services for the maintenance of the automatic cont rol system first entered into with yamatake building systems co ltd in june 2001 for three years totaling 180000 38 there were also contracts on file for the re newal of contracts with nihon bisoh co ltd for the maintenance of the façade g ondolas and the maintenance agreement for elevators and escalators by fujitec co ltd for the latter the last contract found on file was for the period october 2001 to ptember 2002 the subsequent renewals with annual contract amount below 50000 were mer ely based on note for the file from the senior procurement assistant the engagement of f ujitec co ltd was last discussed in lcc meeting in 1997 39 unu ordered in excess of needs the request fo r proposal for the overhaul of the directfired absorption water chillerheater unit radg013 specified that the service was needed only every five years however two orders one dated 21 june 2004 for 49000 and the other 1 july 2005 for 47000 were placed with ebara reinetsu system kk to cover this service for 2004 and 2005 respectively 40 the bidding for threeyear maintenance ct for the central building control system and security control system entered into in october 2004 with nec corporation for total amount of 180000 60000 per year appea red improperly carried out the request for proposals were sent to six firms and three decl ined of the remaining three two of them submitted proposals with bids that differed for as little as japanese yen 300 us 2 both 9 proposals used the same summary sheet furthermore the three proposals all submitted on 2 april 2004 included exactly the same additional i nformation ie time period of maintenance which differed from the required addit ional information as per the request for proposals sanko evaluated the proposals but d id not report any of the discrepancies to the unu centre the requests for proposal were xtensive documents but the practice to only request few vendors to submit proposals is n ot acceptable there was evidence that the requests were properly distributed 41 unu engaged unops to perform review of unu he adquarters building management including related contracts the resul ts were not yet known at the date of the audit but administration gave clear indication t hat major changes could follow the review these included the possibility to outsource main pr ocurements to unops from an audit perspective the procurement function needed to be strengthened current contracts should be reviewed to ensure that current contractors are the preferred contractors at the best prices in future the request for proposal should be more w idely distributed to attain best value for money fairness and transparency proper submissio ns should be made to the lcc and where required the headquarters committee on contracts or lcc for renewals recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should either stren gthen the procurement function andor consider outsourcing ma in procurements to an appropriate agency specializ ing in procurement rec 07 42 unu already commissioned unops on 21 september 2005 for provision of services concerning facilities and building management of th house unu headquarters building in tokyo the project consists of two phas phase i is desk review and onsite facilities assessment resulting in the production f an assessment report listing findings recommendations and identifiable cost savings measu res completed in december 2005 phase ii is the formulation of request for propos rfp for the provision of facilities managementoperations services the rfp should be m ade public by unops during the last week of march 2006 unops building manager who w ill be assigned onsite will manage the contractor all procurement actions for the bu ilding will then be handled by unops unu will also explore the possibility of having oth er procurement actions for the unu centre handled by unops at the same time options are being considered for strengthening the procurement function of the unu including relo cation of the administrative functions outside of japan which would provide an opportunit to undertake skills assessment 43 oios views unus actions to strengthen the proc urement function adequate and good progress had been made considering that the recom mendation is under implementation oios will record the recommendation as implemented when formal arrangement with unops had been reached recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should review the c urrent headquarters building contracts to ensure that curr ent contractors are the preferred contractors at the be st prices rec 08 44 unu agreed and referred to their action already tak the main contract with the 10 current service provider for building maintenance and operation including security services and custodial cleaning ends on 30 june 20 06 the plan is to finalize the ongoing procurement action by that date to ensure continuit of service other services related to the building which are currently contracted to separat companies have been integrated under the same rfp this will hopefully result in additio nal cost savings for unu oios will record the implementation when the procurement proc ess is completed recommendation head2right the unu centres administration should in future di stribute the request for proposal more widely to attain be st value for money fairness and transparency rec 09 45 unu accepted the
