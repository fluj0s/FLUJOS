fundamental and often interlocking responsibilities that orient the majority leaders work institutional and party from an institutional perspective the majority leader has number of duties scheduling floor business is prime responsibility of the majority leader although scheduling the houses business is collective activity of the majority party the majority leader has large say in shaping the chambers overall agenda and in determining when whether how or in what order legislation is taken up in addition the majority leader is active in constructing winning coalitions for the partys legislative priorities acting as public spokesman defending and explaining the partys program and agenda serving as an emissary to the white house especially when the president is of the same party and facilitating the orderly conduct of the houses business from party perspective three key activities undergird the majority leaders principal goal of trying to ensure that the party remains in control of the house first the majority leader assists in the reelection campaigns of party incumbents by for example raising campaign funds and traveling to scores of house districts to campaign either with incumbents or challengers of the party second the majority leader promotes the partys agenda by developing themes and issues important to core supporters in the electorate third the

field commander for daytoday management of the floor im the speakers agent stated recent majority leader1 another majority leader said i see it that the speaker is the chairman of the board and i am the chief executive officer2 or as one speaker put it the majority leaders job is to run the floor and keep monitoring committees and legislation3 elected every two years by secret ballot of the party caucus or conference the majority leader is usually an experienced legislator for example representative richard armey of texas became the gops first majority leader in 40 years when republicans won control of the 104th house in the november 1994 elections armey began his house service in 1985 became gop conference chairman during the 103rd congress and was one of the principal authors of the republican contract with america when richard gephardt dmo became majority leader in june 1989 he had been in the house for more than decade had served as chairman of the democratic caucus for four years and had been 1988 presidential candidate two fundamental and often interlocking responsibilities orient the work of the majority leader institutional and party from an institutional perspective the majority leader is principally responsible for exercising overall supervision of the order of business on the floor especially as it affects the partys program as lewis deschler the late house parliamentarian 19281974 wrote partys floor leader in conjunction with other party leaders plays an influential role in the formulation of party policy and programs he is instrumental in guiding legislation favored by his party through the house or in resisting those programs of the other party that are considered undesirable by his own party he is instrumental in devising and implementing his partys strategy on the floor with respect to promoting or opposing legislation he is kept constantly informed as to the status of legislative business and as to the sentiment of his party respecting particular legislation under consideration such information is derived in part from the floor leaders contacts with his partys 1 mark wegner the speakers agent national journals

24 crs2 members serving on house committees and with the members of the partys whip organization4 from partisan perspective the majority leaders paramount assignment is to employ his or her talents energy and knowledge of procedural rules and political circumstances to insure that the party maintains majority control of the house each of these major responsibilities gives rise to wide range of leadership activities before discussing the primary duties of the majority leader it is worth highlighting the historical origins of this party position origin of the majority leader position congressional scholars assert that in 1899 speaker david henderson riowa appointed sereno payne rny as the first officially designated majority leader5 prior to this date there is neither an accurate nor complete compilation of house majority leaders two factors seem to account for the absence of compilation first it took many decades before anything like our modern party structure emerged in the house as result not until nearly the end of the 19th century did the position of majority leader become recognized party office second neither official congressional sources nor party records of this early period identify lawmaker as the majority floor leader several historians of the house suggest that from the chambers early beginnings various lawmakers informally assumed the role of floor leader usually but not always these informal party leaders were the chairs of either the committee on ways and means established in 1795 or the committee on appropriations following its creation in 1865 speakers often appointed either their allies or their principal rivals for the speakership to head these panels explained the late floyd m riddick political scientist who served as parliamentarian of the senate from 1951 to 1975 in the house the early titular floor leaders were at the same time the chairmen of the ways and means committee before the division of the work of that committee the duties of its chairmen were so numerous that they automatically became the actual leaders since as chairmen of that committee they had to direct the consideration of most of the legislation presented to the house from 1865 until 1896 the burden of handling most of the legislation was shifted to the chairman of the appropriations committee who then was designated most frequently as the leader from 1896 until 1910 once again the chairmen of the ways and means committee were usually sought as the floor leaders during all of these years before the cannon revolution of 1910 the speaker who appointed all members to committees saw to it that his party opponent for 4 lewis deschler deschlers precedents of the united states house of representatives vol 1 washington dc gpo 1977 pp 211212 5 randall b ripley party leaders in the house of representatives washington dc the brookings institution 1967 p 24 crs3 speakership some representative with large following or one of his faithful lieutenants was made the floor leader6 thus these early titular floor leaders were appointed by the speaker rather than chosen separately as occurs today by vote of the majority party caucus7 appendix 1 contains list of house majority leaders since 1899 when the house revolted in 1910 against the autocratic leadership of speaker joseph cannon rill the power to designate the floor leader was taken away from the speaker in 1911 with democrats in charge of the house oscar underwood of alabama became the first elected by the party caucus majority leader in the houses history subsequently all democratic floor leaders have been selected in this manner underwood also chaired the ways and means committee and his partys committee assignment panel the political reality was that majority leader underwoods influence in the house exceeded that of the speaker champ clark of missouri for the first time the leader of the house was not at the rostrum but was on the floor8 probably majority leader ever has matched underwoods party power and institutional influence underwood left the house for the senate in 1915 when republicans reclaimed majority control of the house in 1919 franklin mondell of wyoming high ranking member of the appropriations committee became majority leader upon nomination by the gop committee assignment panel four years later the gop conference began the practice of electing their majority leader9 mondell set the contemporary practice of majority leaders usually relinquishing their committee positions and always any committee chairmanships 6 floyd

example in 1789 congress requested treasury secretary alexander hamilton to prepare plan to deal with the public debt representatives fisher ames and theodore sedgwick of massachusetts and jonathan

standing committees10 april 15 1929 the start of the 71st congress witnessed firstever event that remains the practice to this day the official announcement in the house of the selection of the majority leader representative willis hawley of oregon the chairman of the majority republican caucus addressed the presiding officer mr speaker the republican caucus of the house has reelected hon john q tilson of connecticut majority leader for the seventyfirst congress as house precedents state this was the first occasion of the official announcement of the selection of party leaders in the house11 separate election of the majority leader by the party caucus elevated the status and influence of the person who held this position the majority leader soon became the heir apparent to the speakership in the modern house democrat has been elected speaker without having been the majority leader immediately prior to his elevation republicans the minority party for 40 consecutive years until the mid 1990s do not have as welldefined leadership succession ladder when speaker newt gingrich rga retired from the house at the end of the 105th congress appropriations chairman bob livingston rla moved quickly and lined up the necessary votes to be the next speaker however when livingston announced that he planned to resign from the house for personal reasons soon after the 106th congress began republicans chose their chief deputy whip dennis j hastert of illinois to be the next speaker unfortunately there is scant scholarly commentary about the duties and functions that devolved upon the informal floor leaders of the pre20th century period nor are the duties and functions of todays majority leaders spelled out in the house rulebook or in party rules although those sources make brief reference to the position as recent majority leader stated each leadership position is defined by 10 for example starting in the 1970s democratic majority leaders held leadership designated positions on the budget committee and served ex officio on the permanent select intelligence committee since republicans took control of the house in the mid 1990s the majority leader has held standing committee positions however in 2002 majority leader richard armey rtx chaired select committee on homeland security this panel assembled the recommendations of several standing committees to craft legislation hr 5005 authorizing the creation of cabinetlevel department of homeland security as an historical point of interest it is worth noting that underwoods successor as majority leader was north carolinian claude kitchin 19151919 who also served as chairman of the ways and means committee however kitchin disapproved of president wilsons war policies and his floor and committee roles proved to be cumbersome and impractical as one scholar wrote separation of the two roles was effected after the democrats became the minority in 1919 ever since then the majority leaders job has existed as fulltime position see nelson polsby the institutionalization of the us house of representatives american political science review sept 1968 pp 157158 11 clarence cannon cannons precedents of the house of representatives of the united states vol viii washington gpo 1935 p 957 crs5 the person who holds it its not defined by job description12 in short factors such as tradition custom context and personality have largely defined the fundamental institutional and party roles and responsibilities of the majority leader several of the most important of these two overlapping categories merit mention however it bears repeating that the scope of the majority leaders role in carrying out these assignments is shaped significantly by the speaker and the sentiments of the majority party caucus or conference institutional the style and role of any majority leader is influenced by plethora of elements including personality and contextual factors such as the closeness of his relationship with the speaker the size and cohesion of the majority party whether the party controls the white house the general political environment in the house and the controversial nature of the legislative agenda despite the variability of these factors number of institutional assignments are now associated with the majority leader and members of each party expect him or her to perform them to be sure the majority leader is provided with extra staff resources beyond those accorded him or her as house member to assist in carrying out these diverse leadership functions majority leader armey even established new leadership post assistant majority leader at the start of the 106th congress and named two republican colleagues as assistant majority leaders their assignment was to assist him on floor scheduling legislative and communications strategy the policy agenda and leadership decisions13 scheduling floor business although scheduling is collective activity of the majority party the majority leader has large say in shaping the chambers overall agenda and in determining when whether how and in what order legislation is taken up everything from setting policy priorities drafting the schedule consulting with members committee chairs and the minority party in making up the schedule and announcing the schedule on the floor are within the purview of the majority leader scheduling is complex process and the majority leader must juggle wide range of considerations and pressures five concerns illustrate the scheduling role of the majority leader first the majority leader commonly lays out the daily weekly monthly and annual agenda of the house of course scheduling and agendasetting are responsibilities done in close consultation with the speaker majority whip and others the majority leader may specify in advance that certain priority bills are to be taken up prior to congressional recess he or she may even designate theme weeks reform high tech families first and so on for the consideration of related bills typically on thursday after the houses business for the day and week is winding down the majority leader will announce the projected agenda for each day 12 ben pershing delay adjusting to his new role roll call mar 17 2003 p 3 13 cq monitor jan 21 1999 p 8 crs6 of the next business week identify when votes are expected to occur and respond to inquiries from members about the houses program of activities second host of strategic considerations influence scheduling for instance with an eye toward upcoming elections the majority leader may schedule legislation that better defines his or her party for the upcoming presidential and congressional campaigns he or she may not schedule bill unless there is reasonable certainty that the senate will take floor action on it the majority leader may also coordinate strategy on measures with the senate party counterpart he or she may schedule floor action at specific times for instance constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration just before july 4 to maximize public attention on the issue the majority leader may use deadline lawmaking indicating to members that floor action on certain legislation must occur before the house will adjourn for district work period or he or she may suggest general themes messages or strategies that unify party colleagues around set of domestic and international policies majority leader may even propose his or her own annual legislative agenda even if the white house is controlled by the same party and present it to the speaker and the partys caucus or conference third majority leaders try to balance the houses workload requirements with members family or personal obligations family friendly scheduling aims to achieve better balance in the public and private lives of lawmakers fourth majority leaders advance or delay action on measures for variety of reasons including whether they have the votes to achieve their objectives to be sure there are occasions when measures are brought to the floor and it is unclear whether they will pass asked if bill would pass majority leader replied who knows were writing the bill on the floor14 fifth majority leaders recognize that timing considerations suffuse the lawmaking process there are timetables to meet pressures associated with the end ofsession rush to adjourn the electoral needs of individual members and multitude of other considerations that the majority leader must address as he strives to accommodate the rankandfile committee chairs the minority party the president and his own extended party leadership as one majority leader put it you have to find that elusive grail of harmony among this most heterogeneous mix of opinionated individualists15 manage floor decision making majority leaders are active in constructing winning coalitions for their legislative priorities to this end majority leader will consult with the chair of the rules committee to discuss procedures for considering legislation on the floor for example an open or restricted amendment process might be options for discussion or the majority leader might decide to call up bill under suspension of the rules 14 andrew taylor budget enforcement legislation founders in the house cq today june 24 2004 p 1 15 julia malone to jim wright being majority leader is one long juggling routine christian science monitor oct 19 1983 p 40 crs7 procedure which limits debate and bars any amendments to limit policy riders on appropriations bills the majority leader might invoke house rule xxi clause 2 d this rule grants preference to the majority leader to end consideration of an appropriations bill in the committee of the whole by offering successful motion to rise16 majority leaders engage in many other activities to promote policy success on the floor they may for instance meet weekly or biweekly more frequently if needed with committee chairs ad hoc groups or individual lawmakers to persuade them to support priority measures woo lawmakers through the provision of various legislative services or rewards coordinate vote counts with the party whip organization propose changes in bills to attract support from wavering members reach out to lawmakers on the other side of the aisle craft leadership amendmentsdesigned to attract majority support synchronize strategic activities with majority floor managers and rally outside support for the partys legislative issues and political messages majority leaders may also take on other functions relevant to floor action to forge winning coalitions for instance they engage in dealmaking appeal to members party loyalty enlist allies to overcome resistance to policyparty objectives devote considerable time and energy in promoting consensus among colleagues and work behindthescenes to get things done majority leaders might also encourage party colleagues to deliver oneminute morning hour or special order speeches that spotlight the partys program and defend it against criticism from the other party public spokesman there are two interconnected dimensions associated with this role external and internal externally especially in this 247 news cycle and internet era majority leaders are national newsmakers when he became majority leader in 1973 thomas p tip oneill jr dma said the media couldnt stay away i was interviewed 16 the rules of the house make specific reference to the majority leader in several other instances rule ii clause 6 states that the houses inspector general shall be appointed for congress by the speaker the majority leader and the minority leader acting jointly rule ii clause 8 states that the office of general counsel shall function pursuant to the direction of the speaker who shall consult with bipartisan leadership advisory group which shall include the majority and minority leaderships under rule ix question of privilege offered from the floor by the majority leader shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn under rule x clause 2 not later than march 31 in the first session of congress after consultation with the speaker the majority leader and the minority leader the committee on government reform shall report to the house the oversight plans of the standing committees along with any recommendation it or the house leaders have proposed to ensure the effective coordination of committees oversight plans by tradition the majority leader also serves as member of the house office building commission and he names three members to serve as private calendar objectors in addition the majority leader may after consultation with the speaker during any even numbered year convene an early organizational caucus or conference crs8 constantly17 majority leaders are expected to explain and defend the actions and decisions of the house and their party to the general public the role of the majority leader puts you in spokesman role noted recent majority leader18 accordingly these leaders appear on the major network and cable television programs the sunday morning news shows talk radio or internet chat rooms periodically they deliver major addresses in diverse forums and write articles or op ed pieces on the major issues before the house they meet with journalists and newspaper editors regularly they give news briefings socalled pen and pad sessions to reporters on the schedule and agenda of the house the priorities of the majority party legislative executive relations and sundry other topics internally majority leaders are ready on the floor to defend their party program or president from criticism by the opposition they participate in debate on measures and may make the closing argument on legislation majority leaders rise to defend the prerogatives of individual members offer critiques and rebuttals to minority party initiatives work with committee chairmen and others to coordinate and integrate the partys communication strategy employ floor speeches to set the tone on newsworthy issue or provide the proscribed leadership perspective before major vote19 and may establish websites to provide information to house members and others in brief majority leaders generally function as their partys chief spokesman on the floor and in other forums as well sometimes the internal and external roles coincide when majority leaders introduce legislation monitor executive branch actions or champion proposals nationally for example majority leader armey and another gop colleague traveled the country in scrap the code tour national campaign to take the tax reform debate directly to the american people20 armey also attracted national attention with respect to his legislative efforts to monitor executive branch implementation of 1993 law designed to measure the performance of government programs21 confer with the white house majority leaders regularly attend meetings at the white house especially when the president is of the same party to discuss issues before congress the administrationss agenda and political events generally for example the joint bipartisan congressional leadership including the house majority leader may meet 17 speaker tip oneill man of the house new york random house 1987 pp 226227 18 jim vandehei delay nears top

occasions too when the president will journey to capitol hill to meet with the top leaders of congress there are instances as well where majority leaders can be sharp critics of the president majority leaders consult with executive branch officials plus scores of other individuals foreign dignitaries governors mayors and so on majority leaders may also be active on international issues brokering foreign policy compromises with the white house championing the interests of certain nations or criticizing some foreign governments in general anyone who occupies the houses number two leadership post has strengthened leverage with the white house and greater public prominence on international issues people are now listening to what ive been saying because im majority leader declared former holder of the post23 strategically the role of majority leaders will be different depending on whether the president is of the same party in general majority leaders will strive to advance the goals and aspirations of their partys president in the congress if the president is of the opposite party then the procedural and political situation is more complicated when should the majority leader cooperate with the president when should he or she urge the house to reject administration policies when should he or she propose alternatives to the presidents priorities in brief the majority leader the speaker and their other party colleagues need to determine when to function as the governing party in the house and when to act as the loyal opposition facilitate the conduct of business to expedite the work of the house wide range of other responsibilities is typically performed by the majority leader for example the majority leader may ask unanimous consent that when the house adjourns that it meet again at specific date and time he or she may ask unanimous consent to dispense with the calendar wednesday rule the majority leader may either appoint people to certain boards or commissions or be selfnamed to various commissions or boards he or she may lead congressional delegations to different parts of the world the majority leader may act as speaker pro tempore offer resolutions affecting the operations of the house such as establishing the hour of daily meeting of the house perform various ceremonial duties and support initiatives to revamp or reform the internal procedures and structures of the house in brief the majority leader is responsible along with other members of the leadership for insuring the orderly conduct of house business 22 see ethan wallison

oneill once said helps set policy and carries out the duties assigned to him by the speaker24 one of the most important duties of the majority leader is to try to ensure that his or her party remains in control of the house after all legislative organization is party organization the majority party sets the agenda of the house and controls all committee and subcommittee chairmanships thus along with other party leaders and members the majority leader works in numerous ways to help elect and reelect rankandfile partisan colleagues to forge unity on priority legislation and to promote favorable public image of the majority party three activities of the majority leader illustrate these points assist colleagues reelection campaigns majority leaders are typically energetic campaigners on behalf of their partisan colleagues they assist incumbents and challengers in raising campaign funds and they travel to scores of house districts to campaign with either incumbents or challengers of their party majority leaders develop computerbased campaign donor lists so they can funnel campaign funds quickly to electoral contests establish their own leadership pacs to raise money and then donate money from their political action committee to candidates of their party help to raise large sums of money so campaign ads can be run on television and elsewhere in the months leading up to the november election and coordinate their campaign activities with congressional national and state party campaign organizations and encourage outside groups and allies to raise money for the party majority leaders assist in recruiting qualified challengers to take on incumbents they promote getoutthevote drives in part by devising strategies to energize their partys grassroots supporters in short majority leaders are heavily engaged in the electoral campaigns of many party candidates their ultimate goals to retain their majority status and if possible to increase the number in their ranks promote the partys agenda majority leaders may undertake variety of actions to accomplish this goal they develop legislative agendas and themes that address issues important to core supporters and swing voters in the electorate these agendas may be posted on their websites key aim of this form of message sending is to animate and activate their electoral base to turn out on election day another objective is to develop electorally attractive ideas and proposals that may enable their party to retain or retake the house the senate or even the presidency the majority leader may help to organize town meetings in members districts which publicize and promote the partys agenda or specific priority such as health care or tax cuts he or she may sponsor party retreats to discuss issues and to evaluate the partys public image the majority leader may also distribute 24 oneill man of the house pp 218219 crs11 reports memorandums briefing books and videotapes that highlight partisan campaign issues conduct surveys of party colleagues to discern their priorities organize issue teams or task forces composed of junior and senior lawmakers to formulate specific party programs and form message groups or theme teams to map media strategies to foster favorable press coverage of party initiatives sometimes the majority leader will attend partisan luncheons with senators to better coordinate interchamber action on the partys legislative and message agenda were having more bicameral meetings remarked majority leader so that we understand what each other is doing and what can and cant be done25 majority leaders are also named as conferees on major bills to represent the overall interests of the majority leadership26 in brief the majority leader is key strategist in promoting the partys agenda in outlining ways to neutralize the oppositions arguments and proposals and in determining when it is better to compromise with the other party on policy priorities or have agreement encourage party cohesion if party is to maintain its majority it is generally good idea to minimize internal factional feuds or disagreements that may undermine its ability to govern the house one majority leader explained this job as combination of evangelist parish priest and parttime prophet you have to be peacemaker in the family27 to forge party cohesion means in part that majority leaders will consult widely with the diverse factions within their party they will argue the need for party loyalty on crucial procedural and substantive votes they will try to offer persuasive arguments that educate colleagues on measures policy and political benefits and they will schedule breakfasts lunches or dinners to keep in touch with party members and to listen to their concerns aiding the majority leader in these efforts is his membership on various party units such as policy committees or the committeeoncommittees majority leaders may also enlist the support of outsiders such as lobbyists to assist in building party cohesion in fact majority leaders may develop an external network of contacts in universities think tanks or consulting firms to function as an informal brain trust in policy development and in strategic analysis suggesting how the majority party might mobilize the support required to enact their ideas into law majority leaders then work to boost their partys fortunes internally and externally by acting as political cheerleader negotiator consensusbuilder and peacemaker 25 alan ota delay sees improvement in communications between house senate

final observation the majority leaders duties and functions although not welldefined and contingent in part on his or her relationship with the speaker have evolved to the point where it is possible to highlight the customary institutional and party responsibilities as one majority leader said about his institutional duties the majority leader has prime responsibility for the daytoday working of the house the schedule working with the committees to keep an eye out for what bills are coming getting them scheduled getting the work of the house done making the place function correctly on the party side the majority leader added you are also compelled to try to articulate to the outside world what your party stands for what your party is fighting for what your party is doing28 28
