issues of concern to congress since the committee vote numerous expressions of opposition to and support for us adherence to the convention and agreem ent have been published during his march 23 2004 statement to the senate environmen t and public works committee assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs john f turner set forth administration re sponses to numerous opposing arguments7 proponents raised at least two sets of ar guments to support prompt senate approval of the conventionagreement p ackage they maintained th at us adherence to and participation in the convention would protect us interests during considerations of the commission on the limits of the continental shelf and enable the united states to submit its own limits with extensive supporting data and would provide an effective us role for the submission and consideration of proposed amendments to the convention commission on the limits of the continental shelf the mandate of the commission is to examine and make recommendations on coastal state extensions of their contin ental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles the convention gives the coastal state sovereign jurisdiction over the resources including oil and gas of its continental shelf under ar ticle 76 of the convention coastal state with broad continental margin may establish shelf limit beyond 200 miles subject to its submission of the particulars of the limit and supporting scien tific and technical data to the commission for review and recommendati ons the commission reviews the intended limits and supporting documentati on referring to criteria set forth in article 76 and makes recommendations to the submitting stat while the coastal state is not bound to accept these recommendations article 76 paragraph 8 stipulates that the limits established by coastal state on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding8 in this way the convention process w ould contribute to the goal of preventing and reducing the possibility of dispute and uncertainty eight submissions have been made since december 20019 the amendment process the conventions provisions delayed the possibility of amendment until ten years after its entry into force that is until november 2004 articles 312 through 316 deal with amendment with special process set fort h in articles 314 and 316

2003 psi participating states undertake continuedconvention provisions relating exclusively to activities in the area defined as the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof be yond the limits of national jurisdiction for amendments to provisions not relating to activities in the area the convention sets forth two procedural options leading to adoption after proposed amendment is sent by state party to the secretarygeneral proposal of amendment s with re quest that conference be held to consider and adopt the proposed ame ndment the convening of such conference would require favorable re sponses from at least half of the states parties within 12 months of the request article 312 proposal of amendment s with request for adoption by simplified procedure without convening conferen ce if within 12 months of this request state party objects to th proposed amendment or to its adoption by the simplified procedure the amendment shall be considered rejected if however within th same time period there has been objection the proposed amendment shall be considered adopted article 313 in either case entry into force of an amendment after adoption requires ratification or accession by twothirds or by 60 states parties whichever is the greater number amendments to provisions relating to activities in the area require different procedure proposed amendments are to be sent to the secretarygeneral of the international seabed authority isa the proposed amendment must be approved by the isa assembly after prior pproval by consensus by th isa council once approved the proposed amendment shall be considered adopted entry into force of any adopted amendment requires ratification or accession by three fourths of states parties after which it shall enter into force for all emphasis added states parties the united states would need to be part to the convention in order to block what it might consider objectionable amendments in two of the three approaches discussed under the conference option it might as an obs erver muster sufficient influence on some states parties to affect proposed amendment us national security interests some opponents to us adherence to the treaty package have suggested that such adherence is contrary to us national security interests especially in postseptember 11 world they maintained that under the tr eaty the united states would not be able to carry out counterterrorism pr ograms such as the proliferation security initiative psi under which shipments of weapons of ma ss destruction wmd etc would be interdicted referring to artic 92 and 110 of the convention they stated that the treaty does not explicitly guarantee right to board or interdict when evidence of terrorist intentions through wmd is involved10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21890crs6 10 continued effective measures for interdicting the transfer or transport of wmd their delivery systems and related materials to and from states and

hearings before the senate armed services committee addr essed the relationship betw een the convention and psi the convention will not affect our efforts under the psi to interdict vessels suspected of engaging in the proliferation of w eapons of mass destru ction he added the convention recognizes numerous legal bases for taking enforcement action against vessels and aircraft suspected of engaging in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for example exclusive port and coastal state jurisdiction in internal waters and national air space coastal state jurisdiction in the territorial sea and tiguous zone exclusive flag state jurisdiction over vessels on the high seas which the flag state may either by general agreement in advance or approval in response to specific request waive in favor of other states and universal jurisdiction over stateless vessels further nothing in the convention impairs the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefense point which is reaffirmed in the proposed resolution of advice and consent the united states has concluded psi ship boarding agreements with seven nations11 among other statements made by conve ntion opponents were the following the treaty effectively prohibits two functions vital to american security collecting intelligence in and submerged transit of terr itorial waters and the treatys articles 19 and 20 attempt explicitly to regulate intelligence and submarine activities in what are defined as territorial seas these are activities vital to us security that we should ensure remain unrestricted at all costs12 taft stated that articles 19 and 20 do not prohibit intelligence activities or submerged transit in the territorial sea of other states he continued the conventions provisions on innocent passage are very similar to article 14 in the 1958 convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone to which the united states is party the 1982 convention is in fact more favorable than the 1958 convention ship does notenjoy the right of innocent passage if in the case of submarine it navigates submerged or if in the case of any ship it engages in an act in the territorial sea aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the defe nse or security of the coastal state but such activities are not prohibited by the convention in this respect the convention makes change in the situation that has existed for many years and under which we operate today in summary the question of whether the nate will consider the convention in 2007 depends on whether the committee considers and possibly recommends it for positive action the presidents statement on may 15 2007 may be factor in the senates considerations if the treaty is not considered or withdrawn it will remain pending in the committee
