objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information 2 effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on 2004 programme activit ies under projects 04sbirqrp330 04sbirqrp331 and 04sbirqrp332 with expendit ure of us 20 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented by inter sos expenditure of us 2 million the salvation army expenditure of us 15 million ag ency for technical cooperation and development acted expenditure of us 05 milli on war child expenditure us 084 million and islamic relief expenditure of us 024 million and united nations office for project services unops expenditure of us 2 million oios was unable to carry out an audit of the activities implemented by the danis h refugee council cdrc expenditure of us 025 million as the accounting documentation had already been sent to their copenhagen headquarters from kuwait 8 included in our audit coverage was us 71 million that unhcr received from the undg iraq trust fund for the operations in southern iraq of this unhcr had expended about us 52 million in 2004 mainly through variou s ngos like intersos the salvation army acted and war child in addition the audit reviewed the nonfood relief items and assets procured in 2003 and held in the warehouses in jordan and kuwait 9 the audit reviewed the administration of cb bk and ioua with administrative budgets totalling us 3 million for 2004 the numb er of staff working for the unhcr operation in iraq ioua cbkk and iraq was 87 thi s included staff on regular posts united nations volunteers and staff on mission 10 after the august 2003 bombing and the sub sequent decision to pullout international staff from iraq to remotely manage the programme u nhcr established two offices in exile in amman and kuwait by october 2003 unhcr had to considerably rely on ngo partners for programme implementation furthermore with international staff travel to iraq prohibited unhcr had to resort to other methodolog ies to monitor programme implementation as the use of its traditional method s and mechanisms were not possible oios review of the implementing partners was confi ned to the examination of accounting and other records made available in kuwait and amma n also the ngos operating in iraq had serious constraints due to the deteriorating curity situation which eventually led them to switch to managing their operations remotely as det ailed below in southern iraq the international staff members f ngos working with unhcr pulled out at the beginning of 2004 with most of th em relocating to kuwait the iraqi national staff members of the ngos were delegated t he responsibilities of running operations in northern iraq ngos implementing unhcr projects have offices with both international and local staff except for unops the ngos did not have offices in jordan in the case of central iraq the international staf f members of ngos implementing 3 unhcr projects were based in amman the iraqi nati onal staff members of the ngos were delegated the responsibilities of running the operations 11 the audit activities included limited re view and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff available in kuwait and amman and analysis of applicable data iv audit findings and recommendations risk exposure 12 due to the security situation inside iraq and the absence of reliable banking system unhcrs implementing partners used money traders to transfer the required funds oios estimated that over us 14 million 70 per cent of the funds for operational projects were spent inside iraq in cash ngo national staff membe rs particularly in the south and central iraq were responsible for the receipt safekeeping and disbursement of most of these funds 13 oios noted that ngo staff kept considerabl hard cash at their residences for example oios found that us 40000 in cash was hel d at an ngos staff members house considering the security situation the economic ch allenges confronting iraq the disproportionate level of salaries to national staf f compared to their responsibilities as well as the remote management of the operations by the impl ementing partners oios concluded that unhcr is exposed to high level of operational and financial risks not to mention the physical risk to national staff members the office of the chief of mission explained that t his was an isolated case due to the lack of banking s ystem inside iraq implementing partners have option but to rely on national staff for ndling cash the continued use of money traders for the operations is still the most reliab mode of fund transfers 14 the audit also noted that intersos lost ab out us 12700 in cash in august 2004 due to an armed robbery in southern iraq the money wa s stolen from team of national staff members tasked to pay warehouse rental although report of the unhcrs field safety adviser indicated several security lapses on the pa rt of intersos the amount was not refunded to unhcr the case was reported to hamb and decision is awa ited nevertheless intersos disagreed to refund the amou nt specifying it was an operational loss considering the financial volume of the operations and the high risks involved the loss is not material consequently oios agrees with the decis ion of the office of the chief of mission whereby in this unique situation the funds need not be refunded from the partner nevertheless unhcr should remind partners of the r isks associated with holding considerable cash in the staff residences and call for thorough cash management policies compatible with the security situation 15 in general the procurement procedures fol lowed by unhcrs partners were not fully transparent intersos was responsible for the rece ption of returnees from iran and saudi arabia at transit centre and their onward transpo rtation to their final destinations in iraq intersos expended over us 75000 in transportation but documentation such as manifests and contracts were not available the audit found that it was not possible to relate payment vouchers to the incoming convoys and returnees sub sequent departure to the final destination from the transit centre oios recommended that int ersos maintain comprehensive details like final destinations paid for the number of ret urnees in each bus the distances covered and 4 the cost per km the office of the chief of mission explained that u nhcr national staff were closely involved in the reception of returnees and most of the documentation relating to the operations was available in basra the decisio n to engage vehicles off the market instead of service contract was based upon needs and in t heir opinion was the most cost effective 16 similarly acted which expended us 1850 00 on shelter construction activities did not have all the documentation in kuwait like b ills of quantities bidding documentation receiving and other warehouse reports for the mater ials procured and consumed their files in kuwait contained only the payment vouchers 17 some of the implementing partners explaine d that most of the missing documents were available at their offices in iraq oios appr eciates the logistical difficulties in moving documents from iraq to kuwait and the resulting ris ks involved and in these special circumstances will accept the partners explanation for the lack of adequate documentation to support the expenditures charged 18 most of the implementing partners explaine d that it was not always possible to institute open and fair procurement procedures f or example selection of suppliers contractors was restricted to the entities operatin g in the nearby village or district again for the fear of physical safety invitations to bid wer not widely circulated the office of the chief of mission added that it was unsafe for outsi bidders due to resistance from the local community 19 with remote management strategy it was d ifficult to ensure appropriate controls were in place to mitigate the various risks identif ied in the iraqi operation in some cases to ensure adequate controls were in place was neither cost effective nor feasible ioua explained that access to populations of concern was limited particularly in central iraq it was estimated that over 12 million persons were di splaced at the end of 2004 remote management does have and will continue to have rious impact on the unhcrs ability to discharge its core protection function b general programme matters programme monitoring 20 considering the specific limitations of th iraq operation oios appreciated and commends the initiatives adopted by the unhcr offic of particular significance were the ongoing efforts to engage professional firm t carry out technical evaluation of all the construction components of the 2004 programme imple mentation and b the implementation of webbased photo library displaying the activit ies implemented in southern iraq as well as the photographs and video clippings available in amman and kuwait the office of the chief of mission has expanded this website to inclu the activities carried out in northern and central iraq 21 in order to manage and monitor programme ctivities unhcr staff were involved in the implementing partners procurement process the received and analyzed detailed monthly progress reports on construction activities from pa rtners and they conducted regular financial verification of the spmrs in oios view however b etter results would be achieved if financial data was matched to the actual implementa tion level oios was pleased to note that workshops and trainings were organized for partner staff national and international to ensure 5 they were aware of and well trained in unhcr standa rds and guidelines eg procurement b asset management 22 at the time of the audit unhcr offices in jordan and kuwait had 59 new vehicles valued at about us 15 million parked in warehouse s yards and the office compound this included 51 light vehicles six armoured cars and t wo trucks with crane these vehicles had been parked in the open for more than 18 months and were exposed to the elements in addition toyota car which was used by liaison ffice kuwait had remained unused since 2003 upon enquiry we were informed that wi th the prevailing security situation the light vehicles are longer suitable for unhcrs u inside iraq as for the considerable future only armoured vehicles can be used oios re commended therefore that ioua explore the possibilities of their deployment to other unhc r operations though these vehicles are fitted with petrol engines oios still considers th at they could be better used in other operations the office of the chief of mission explained that 1 9 vehicles including truck were already put to use while some of these vehicl were handed over to the ministry of displacement and migration in southern iraq the re st were redeployed to various unhcr operations in the region in addition appropriate steps have been initiated through regional office riyadh to dispose off the toyota vehicle of kuwait oios is pleased to note the action taken but would highlight that there is sti ll fleet of about 40 unused vehicles valued at about us 1 million steps need to be taken to nsure they are effectively used or redeployed 23 in 2003 the supply management service sm s sent four vehicles costing over us 100000 for armouring to company in germany the cost of armouring was about us 442000 the enhanced vehicles should have been re ceived by the end of 2003 the contractor however went bankrupt and unhcr has not yet been compensated for the vehicles that cannot be returned as they are unusable oios noted that the legal affairs section is followingup on the issue sms informed oios th at the chief executive of the company has agreed to pay euro 85000 us 105000 to unh cr as compensation and has already transferred euro 10000 us 12500 out of this am ount recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in iraq sh ould initiate appropriate action to put to use or redepl oy the fleet of 40 new and unused vehicles valued at about us 1 million rec 01 head2right the unhcr supply management service and legal affai rs section should continue to seek compensation for th loss of four vehicles by vehicle armouring company and ob tain some euro 75000 us 94000 rec 02 c administrative expenses 24 the implementation of programme activities in such an extremely complex and challenging operating environment meant that consid erable administrative expenditures were incurred most of unhcrs partners operating in so uthern and central iraq maintained offices in kuwait and amman at significant cost office rental staff salaries communication costs etc for example the salarie s and administrative costs for the 2004 6 projects implemented by intersos was us 985000 7 2 per cent the salvation army was us 254000 18 per cent and war child was us 260 000 31 per cent 25 oios noted that some partners charged mont hly salaries that were in excess of the unhcr standard rates of us 3000 and us 4000 for example some staff members working for drc who worked on unhcr projects in so uthern iraq were paid more than us 7000 per month unhcr accepted these charges oios also noted that higher salaries were budgeted for under some of the 2005 subagreem ents ioua explained that as result of the high risks associated with the iraq operatio n the expensive cost of living in kuwait difficulties in recruiting qualified staff and in ngaging capable professional and recognized partners for unhcr programme activities unhcr had to pay for higher than normal administrative expenses as result unhcr headqu arters was requested to consider higher remuneration to expatriates us 8000 for m anagerial staff and us 6000 for other functional staff d audit certification 26 for 2004 subprojects competitive biddi ng exercise has been conducted to select an audit firm for audit certification purposes c review of implementing partners 27 from financial perspective for the six partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted f or and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements oios assessed that internal trols of most of the partners were generally in place and operating satisfactorily und er the prevailing circumstances united nations office for project services 28 at the end of 2003 unhcr internationally ordered materials like doors windows and timber for the construction of 3000 houses in northern iraq costing about us 6 million due to price increases the quantity of materials pr ocured had to be reduced meaning that only 2700 houses could be constructed with the initial budget of us 6 million 29 in 2004 unops under an exchange of lette rs eol with unhcr was delegated the responsibility to construct 500 houses using th materials procured by unhcr unhcr provided an initial budget of us 45 million to ops to procure other materials locally the project duration was four months from june 2004 but extended by further two months to december 2004 and liquidation period of three months ending march 2005 30 in addition unops under the agreement wa s requested to procure local construction materials for another 500 houses and deliver them t the sites selected by unhcrs partners this procurement was to be funded by the internatio nal reconstruction fund facility for iraq in conjunction with unhcrs internationally procure d materials upon signing of the eol unhcr paid an initial instalment of us 1 million t unops 31 the internationally procured materials did not arrive in iraq until the end of 2004 and in april 2005 some deliveries were still pending furthermore the weather conditions were not conducive work started in peak winter for the construction works when the materials arrived it was explained that the local authoritie s and the beneficiaries were not fully ready in 7 some cases these factors delayed the programme im plementation the 10 to 20 per cent escalations in prices of the local construction mat erials also had an adverse impact on the programme implementation 32 considering the low level of disbursements by unops unhcr reduced the budget to us 201 million in november 2004 and excluded t he local procurement for the additional 500 houses it should be noted however at that t ime unops expenditure commitments of us 21 million plus other disbursements of us 265 000 had already exceeded the reduced unhcr budget of us 201 million it appears that the budget was revised without taking into account the actual project expenditure 33 oios review found that unops documentati on for local procurement was comprehensive however their financial accounting and reporting were not complete salaries for international staff and certain admini strative costs were paid from its new york office while the bulk of the expenditure was incurr ed and recorded in erbil and amman there were reports from the undps atlas system available locally confirming consolidated costs in all locations in the absenc of comprehensive report of project expenditure recorded in the general ledger and agai nst which the spmr could be matched oios was unable to perform any meaningful work on t he spmr submitted by unops oios recommended that unops provide assurance as to the correctness of the amounts reported as disbursed in the spmrs 34 the office of the chief of mission explained that i oua and iraq support unit have been followingup closely with unops to resolve the issue due to technical difficulties caused by the implementation of the undpunopsunfp erp software atlas system unops was unable to produce the needed reports com patible with spmr this difficulty would be resolved once the new system reaches full functionality till then unops has to rely on multiple systems for spmr submissions oios reiterates that unops should be able to provide assurance that the spmr expenditure matc hes the amounts recorded in their general ledger atlas system 35 oios noted that programme implementation w as low for example according to the narrative report for march 2005 construction work was in progress for only 344 houses work had yet been started on the balance of 156 hou ses the office of the chief of mission stated that work was now in progress on 491 houses 36 ioua explained that the works would be com plete by the middle of 2005 but at an extra cost the operational plan with unops was finalized and t he exchange of letters with unops was signed in june 2005 to complete the outst anding works d supply management 37 oios reviewed the warehouses in jordan whe re nonfood items valued at over us 3 million were stored in general oios was satisfie d with the procedures in place for the receipt storage and despatch of the relief items however for the shipments sent to other unhcr operations like sri lanka chad etc conf irmations were on file that the goods had been received and were in good order 38 oios noted that internationally procured c onstruction materials valued at about us 6 million did not arrive in iraq until the end of 200 4 this was one of the reasons for the 8 delayed implementation of the shelter programme in northern iraq ioua explained the supply management service did not communicate clear ly the expected quantity received in partshipments and specifications of materials or the scheduled delivery dates the office of the chief of mission explained that the delivery of the construction materials to erbil was complete and the final report on the items received damaged or missing was shared with unhcr headquarters administration 39 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in jordan ioua and kuwait cbkk generally complied with unhcrs regul ations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review travel 40 with the embargo on official staff trav to and from iraq oios noted that the unhcr iraqi national staff travelled to amman and k uwait to participate in training andor meetings we were informed that the staff members u sed their annual leave and travelled at their own risk depending on the needs unhcr conv erted part of their annual leave into working days and paid subsistence allowance ioua also explained that if the travel related mainly for official business then the staff member s were fully reimbursed the travel cost oios recommended that ioua explicitly state in the travel authorization which was prepared after the presence of the staff member in amman that travel costs if applicable would be reimbursed upon submission of all the supp orting documents and the staff member made his own travel arrangement 41 since 2005 as the iraqi staff members hav security clearance to travel out of southern iraq to kuwait proper travel authorizatio ns should be established the deficiencies noted in this respect were rectified by cbbk in ddition the unhcr administration should establish the standard cost of transportatio n between kuwait and basra or nassiriyah to ensure staff members are treated fairly and equa lly b field accounting 42 two locations in iraq baghdad and erbil used the field office accounting system foas since there were unhcr offices inside i raq the computers with this software were kept at the residences of the finance assistan ts oios observed that while the finance assistants recorded the payments in foas after app roval by ioua the finance officer in ioua closed the data files for this purpose the finance assistants sent the data files before closure at the end of every month to ioua the fi nance officer also made the necessary reports and sent the closed data files back to erbi l and baghdad to facilitate data recording for the subsequent month oios pointed out that the pr actice was potentially risky if proper backup and restore procedures were not always follo wed it could also result in corrupt data files oios recommended that the local finance ass istants be encouraged to close the electronic files and any adjustments to the account s should be carried out in the subsequent month ioua explained that the implementing partner record ing was done in amman and it would be complex to send the spmrs to baghdad and rbil for recording there consequently the data files have to be closed in mman 9 v acknowledgement 43 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr in jordan and kuwait and its implementing partners egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office
