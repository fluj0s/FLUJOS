1935 vii 2099history of the enrollment process the enrollment process dates to the first years of congress with procedures to ensure its integrity initially laid out in jeffersons manual when bill has passed both houses of congress the house last acting on it notifies its passage to the other and delivers the bill to the joint committee on enrollment who sees that it is truly rolled in parchment when the bill is enrolled it is not to be written in paragraphs but solidly and all of piece that the blanks between the paragraphs may not give room to forgery 9 grey 143 it is then put into the hands of the clerk of the house of representatives to have it signed by the speaker the clerk th brings it by way of message to the senate to be signed by their president the secretary of the senate returns it to the committee of enrollment who presen ts it to the president of the united states8 from 1789 to 1876 the house and nate had joint ru with similar requirements in relation to enrollment in particular these rules directed the house clerk and secretary of the senate to enroll bills and mandated review and any corrections if necessary by joint co mmittee which would then report to the respective chambers9 the joint rules lapsed in 1876 but these practices were largely continued until the passage of the gislative reorgani zation act of 194610 the 1946 reorganization act provided that responsibilities pertaining to enrollment were now to be delegated to the newlyestablished committee on house administration which retained these au thorities until the beginning of the 107th congress when they were transferred to the house clerk and laid out in house rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34480crs4 11 house manual 727 p 452 12 lewis deschler deschlers precedents of the united

agreed iii hinds precedents 2598 14 the house clerk or secretary of the senate can order the printing of star print to correct government printing offi ce gpo printing errors in engrossment but after both chambers have acted on measure concurrent resolution is necessary to correct printing errors house practice p 761 v hinds precedents 7319 15 concurrent resolutions have been used to co rrect enrollments even when they involve only errors in spelling or the title for example in the 109th congress the adoption of hconres 502 directed that the word point be changed to pound in the enrollment of hr 5682 and in the 108th congress the spelling of house sponsors name was corrected in the enrollment of s 2238 pursuant to hc onres 458 concurrent resolutions directing changes in enrollment may however so involve substantive changes see house practice p 763 in addition on at least one occasi on congress used concurrent resolution to direct the house clerk to correct chapter title and section numbers in the enrollment of any general appropriations bills enacted during the remainder of the 82nd congress deschlers precedents ch 24 145 in the mostrecently completed congress the 109th congress

further action could instead be postponed indefinitely see deschlers precedents ch 24 165ii clause 2d211 the senate transferred authority over the enrollment process to the secretary of the senate in 1945 upon adoption of sres 64 79th congress12 this responsibility is now incorporated in senate rule xi v paragraph 5 changes in enrollment enrollment of measure must accurately reflect congressiona l action virtually changes may be made by the offices of the house clerk or secretary of the senate without an order of the congress to do so13 if in enrollment of measure it becomes apparent that congressional acti on did not accurately reflect congressional intent on the measure or if there was clerical error that resulted in the two chambers agreeing to differe nt text or if after printing an error is discovered14 both chambers must agree to concurrent resolution that directs the appropriate official to reenroll the bill with specified changes15 if the enrolled bill has been signed by the presiding officers the resolution rescinds their signatures and the measure must be signed anew after the enrollment has been corrected16 i f t h measure has already been presented to the president the concurrent resolution must also request the president to return the bill to the chamber of origin17 the correction is made by the officer house clerk or secretary of the senate of the chamber inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34480crs5 18 house practice p 763 in the 109th congress for example senate measure sconres 123 directed the house clerk to correct house measure h r 5946 similarly house measure hconres 324 directed the secretary of the senate to correct senate measure s 1281 19 house practice p 763 for an example in which the resolution was agreed to before the measure it corrected was see sconres 74 in the 109th congress which corrected the enrollment of hr 2863 an emergency supplemental appropriations bill before either chamber agreed to the conference report 20 house practice p 764 in the case of concurrent resolution requesting return from the president of measure not yet enacted or ve toed the house has typically considered the resolution by unanimous consent ibid 21 riddicks senate procedure p 826 22 ibid 23 riddicks senate procedure p 825 24 house practice p 764 in recent examples of the house agreeing to such resolution by recorded vote the vote occurred on socalle d selfexecuting special rule in which the recorded vote agreeing to the rule itself also had the effect of granting house approval to the concurrent resolution referenced therein 25 riddicks senate procedure p 825 for an example of one such concurrent resolution agreed to in the senate by reco rded vote see sconres 74 in the 109th congress which directed changes in enrollment to hr 2863which the measure originated but the concu rrent resolution directing that officer to make the specified changes can originate in either chamber18 in addition concurrent resolution for this purpose can be agreed to by one chamber even before the measure in question s passed either chamber19 in the house concurrent resolution directing changes in enrollment is not privileged and while typically considered by unanimous c onsent may also be taken up according to the provisions of special rule or under suspension of the rules20 in the senate house concurrent resolu tion to make changes is privileged though if the change is substantive it has been held that unanimous consent is required for its consideration senate concurrent resolution to make changes is privileged in the senate only if the changes are technical in nature21 senate conc urrent resolution making substantive changes would not be privileged and if any senator objected to its consideration would need to be re ferred to committee or go over under the rule22 senate precedents specify that concurrent resolutions used for correcting enrollment are subject to amendment but not of legislative or general nature except by unanimous consent23 concurrent resolution directing changes in enrollment is often agreed to by unanimous consent in the house but the house may agree to it by voice or recorded vote when it is considered under suspension of the rules or under the provisions of special rule reported by the rules committee24 in the senate the concurrent resolution is typically agreed to by unan imous consent and nate practice dictates that if the changes are substantive they may only be agreed to by unanimous consent25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34480crs6 26 after the president signed the legislation the senate by unanimous consent took up and agreed to sconres 80 109th which specified that the enacted measure be deemed the true enrollment of the bill re flecting the intent of the congress but the house did not consider the resolutionissues arising after enactment once an enrolled bill becomes law any changes to correct either an error in enrollment or other alteration of the measure between congressional passage and enactment must be made in new enac tment in this case congress could pass new legislation for the purposes of making technical corrections to law that did not accurately reflect congressional action or intent due to clerical errors or other changes made during the enrollment process in some instances it has been alleged that irregularities in enrollment resulted in the enactment of measure not in the form agreed to by both chambers if congress does not address the problem w ith subsequent new enactment the constitutionality of the measure may be challenged in federal court the disposition of these cases may hinge on variety of f actors including for example whether or not the party challenging the law has sta nding to do so when the courts have addressed such issues in the past th ey have frequently relied on 1892 supreme court ruling announced in marshall field co v clark 143 us 649 called the enrolled bill rule this rule provides that the courts do not look behind the enrollment process ie examine other legislative documents and records to determine if congress properl enrolled the text of measure as passed so long as each chambers presiding officer signed th enrolled bill thereby attesting that it accurately reflected final cong ressional action if court we re to rely on the enrolled bill rule in its refusal to review the preenactment process it would presumably permit the law to stand if however court agreed that the constitutional requirements for enactment were not fulf illed the court could invalidate the entire text or alternatively stri ke down only the portion of the law that is alleged to have been incorrectly or improperly enrolled one recent instance was s 1932 in the 109th congress the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 for which the enact ed text did not reflect the text agreed to by both chambers in the final stages of consideration of s 1932 the engrossment of senate amendment to the house amendment contained an inadvertent error that did not accurately reflect senate action because the senate had taken action to alter the house amendment in this way the house subsequently agreed to the senateengrossed text without correcting the error thus both chambers had agreed to identical text that did not reflect either chambers intent before sending the measure to the president the text that was agreed to in error was changed to reflect what each chamber apparently intende d although neither chamber adopted concurrent resolution to authorize this change to the text in question26 several parties have challeng ed the constitutionality of the w on these grounds in federal court to date c ourt has invalidated the law or any portion of it and those decisions issued thus
