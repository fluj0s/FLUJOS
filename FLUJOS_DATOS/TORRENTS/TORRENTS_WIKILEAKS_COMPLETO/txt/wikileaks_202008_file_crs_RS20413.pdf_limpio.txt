fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 since its inception the united states has subscribed 3196 billion to ibrd capital stock giving it the largest single vote 1652 of any member country of that amount 1998 billion has been paid in the rest is subject to call if the ibrd needs money to pay off its bondholders upon its liquidation for the same reason it made contribution those years to the international finance corporation ifc the world banks private sector finance affiliate since its inception in 1956 the united states has subscribed 5694 million all paidin to the ifc it has the largest single vote 238 total almost as great as the combined vote of the four countries with the next largest votes congress made appropriation in fiscal 1999 for the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga the world bank affiliate that insures or guarantees foreign private investors against noncommercial risk from their investments in developing countries the administration requested 10 million for miga in fiscal 2000 the conference report for the fiscal 2000 foreign operations appropriations bill would provide 4 million for miga since miga was established in 1989 the united states has subscribed 222 million enough to earn it the largest vote 1592 in the body this is almost as much as the combined total vote for the next four largest member countries the international development association ida is the world bank affiliate that receives contribution from the united states each year other world bank agencies finance their operations with money borrowed on private capital markets or by leveraging their capital base ida makes loans on highly concessional terms to the worlds poorest countries it uses money contributed by the worlds most prosperous countries to fund its loan program every three years the ida donor countries meet to determine how large the next replenishment of idas resources should be and what share of the total each donor should contribute in fiscal 1999 the administration sought and congress approved an appropriation of 800 million to fund the us annual share of the most recent ida replenishment for fiscal 2000 the administration requested 80343 million for ida congress appropriated 625 million imf and world bank administrative budgets calculating the budgets of the imf and world bank is more complicated issue than it might seem on its face the international financial institutions ifis have two kinds of budgets each financed separately the first is their administrative budget what they spend for staff travel and other expenses the second is their operational budget what they allocate annually for loans and other forms of assistance member countries do not provide any direct support for the ifis administrative budgets their contributions go to support the ifis operational programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20413crs3 2it received 7649 billion in income from loans interest and fees and 1716 billion in income from its investment portfolio it also received another 256 million in income from money invested in its pension plans and 18 million from other sources 3this included 6882 billion in borrowing expenses 246 million for additions to the loan loss reserve 849 million in administrative expenses and 18 million in other expenses imf administrative budget during its fiscal year ending april 30 1999 the imf budgeted sdr 3921 million 52062 million for administrative expenses these were offset in part by 405 million in reimbursements from governments or other organizations it also disbursed 439 million for capital improvements on its facilities the imf finances its administrative expenses with money earned through its lending operations it does not use money from its quota resources or other funds contributed by governments to defray its administrative costs the imf lends money to its borrowers at higher interest rate than the rate it pays for the money it borrows to finance these loans it borrows mainly from the quota sources subscribed by its member countries the imf also sometimes borrows supplementary funds elsewhere to date it has tapped only official sources governments or central banks though it has authority to borrow as well from private sources the imf executive board determines each year the interest rate it will charge rate of charge its borrowers calculated in terms of the interest rate paid on sdr for example the board might set the rate of charge at 105 of the sdr rate the imf pays countries interest rate of remunerationgenerally at the sdr interest rate for its use of funds drawn from the lines of credit they established when they subscribed their imf quotas during its 1999 fiscal year the imf paid interest to the united states and the other countries whose currencies it used to fund its operations at an average 382 it charged most borrowers an average 409 for loans financed with quota resources for loans financed from the new supplemental reserve facility however the imf charges its borrowers the basic rate plus surcharge ranging from 300 to 500 basis points ie 03 to 05 during its 1999 fiscal year the imf received sdr 2625 billion 3696 billion in operational income and it spent sdr 2104 billion 2962 billion in remuneration or interest costs from its net operational income of sdr 82767 million it covered all the imfs administrative expenses and had sdr 4356 million left over the executive board decided to transfer that amount to imf reserves world bank administrative budget each affiliate of the world bank has its own administrative budget and its own source of funds money contributed by governments is used to pay for world bank administrative expenses the ibrd s administrative expenses totaled 849 million during its fiscal 1999 it financed its administrative costs entirely through operational and investment income its income during its fiscal 1999 amounted to 9642 billion2 and its total expenses including administrative expenses amounted to 7995 billion3 from its net income of 1647 billion the ibrd contributed 129 million to charitable activities such as the campaign in africa against river blindness from the remaining 1518 billion the ibrd executive board gave 352 million to ida 90 million to the trust fund for gaza and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20413crs4 4the ifc received 1317 million during the year in equity subscriptions from member countries none of it from the united states this amount is netted into the cost of ifc borrowing to support its loan and investment operations 5the imf uses the term operational budgetnot as here in reference to the total volume of lending for the year but to decision by its executive board specifying the amounts of sdrs and selected member currencies the imf can use to facilitate new loans and loan repayments during the next 3month period west bank and 100 million for the trust fund for heavily indebted poor countries hipc the board put the remaining 976 million into the ibrds retained earnings ida has staff of its own it reimburses ibrd for the cost of personnel and administrative services devoted to ida projects in fy1999 ibrd charged 518 managemen t fee to ida for these services however it also credited ida with 150 million as its share of the income earned by the world bank pension plan consequently idas 1999 net administrative costs totaled 368 million this was less than the 409 million in net cash generated during fiscal 1999 by ida operational activities money contributed by ida donor countries was used to cover ida administrative expenses the ifc has the same president and executive board as the ibrd and ida but it has its own operational staff its administrative expenses during its fiscal 1999 totaled 25002 million the ifc earned net 46876 million in fiscal 1999 from interest charged for loans and 2652 million from income on equity investments it also had 10196 million in income from other sources mainly fees charged to customers and income from its pension plan and it set aside 33294 million as provision against future losses on its loans and investments4 the ifc also contributed 34 million to special programs after all costs were accounted for the ifcs net operating income for the year was 24926 million this was retained in its reserves miga also has its own operational staff in fiscal 1999 miga earned 2498 million from premiums and fees 2043 million from income on its investments and 374 million from its pension fund investments its administrative costs totaled 1524 million and it set aside 2327 million against future claims after meeting all its costs miga had net income of 1038 million for the year which it held as retained earnings miga received 607 million in capital subscriptions in 1999 from member countries figure subsumed above in its financing costs the amount listed as retained earnings for the year was greater than the amount of the new capital subscriptions imf and world bank operational budgets the imf and world bank do not have annual budgets from which they finance their operations rather they have financial resources contributed or supported by their member countries that they use to fund their programs as the situation seems to require their operations are demand driven countries apply for assistance the imf and world bank staff evaluate their requests and the bank and fund executive boards decide which applications should be approved at the close of their fiscal year the imf and world bank total up the amount they have committed and disbursed for projects this is in effect their operational budget5 money in the exchequer not used in one fiscal year may be carried over into the next without restrictions in order to finance future operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20413crs5 international monetary fund because it generally makes loans when countries in extreme circumstances come to it for balance of payments financing the imf does not have an annual budget limiting the amount it can lend during its fiscal year the imf has certain amount of money available to it through the lines of credit its member countries have accorded it through their quota subscriptions as of september 1999 imf member countries had subscribed quotas totaling sdr 215 billion about 298 billion not all of this is usable money however countries do not borrow their own currency or the money of other countries with weak currencies when they approach the imf for emergency assistance the imf reported in september 1999 that its usable currencies then totaled sdr 933 billion 129 billion while its outstanding loan commitments were sdr 164 billion 23 billion and the minimum working balances on its accounts were sdr 142 billion 20 billion thus its net uncommitted usable resources totaled about sdr 627 billion 87 billion the imf must be ready at any time to lend countries the full value of their reserve position in september 1999 it had potential liability of sdr 573 billion 80 billion from this source it is unlikely of course that all countries would draw simultaneously the full value of their reserve still in september 1999 the imf could have lent only an additional sdr 54 billion 7 billion before it would be in position where it could not meet new applications for assistance without utilizing resources that are traditionally reserved to cover countries reserve asset positions the imf has been in that position before in april 1999 at the close of its fiscal 1999 it would have been able to meet only 89 of the demands of its members if they tried to draw their quota reserve simultaneously in april 1998 it had only enough uncommitted usable resources to meet 45 of such demands the imf membership decided in 1998 to increase the funds resources in large part because its liquidity ratio had become so small the imf can also draw on special sdr 34 billion 37 billion line of credit provided by the major advanced industrial countries the gabnab provided they give their consent the gab and nab are intended primarily to finance loans to countries that have subscribed to the gab or nab in june 1998 however gab member countries authorized the imf to borrow gab funds to finance loan to russia the first such loan to noncontributor to the gab or nab world bank world bank officials have multiyear plan which shows how much the regional vice presidents may plan to commit for projects in their region during the next few years this helps the staff decide how many projects they should consider and it tells the treasurers office how much money it needs to raise the schedule is subject to change however if the priority among regions should change if new rush projects are added or if the projects currently under review take longer to prepare than anticipated among the world bank agencies the ibrd has the most flexibility in its finances the ibrd finances its loan program with money borrowed at commercial rates in world capital markets it charges its borrowers an interest rate that is onehalf percent higher than the average rate it pays to borrow funds member countries subscribe to ibrd capital in two forms three percent of their subscription is paidin capital the rest is subscribed as callable capital which is payable upon demand there has never been call on callable capital the bank would make such call if it were effectively bankrupt and it needed money to pay off its bondholders with the backing of its callable capital thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20413crs6 6in fiscal 1999 ida disbursed net 5094 billion to pay for ida project expenses it also made grants totaling 149 million for development activities it received 4071 billion in new contributions from donor countries and it used 697 million in earlier contributions which had been temporarily invested to finance its loan operations as noted earlier ida received net cash inflow of 409 million from its operations it also received net 114 million an accounting gain only as ida does not trade currencies as consequence of currency fluctuationsibrd can borrow funds commercially at advantageous rates its articles of agreement prohibit the ibrd from lending out more than the total value of its capital stock plus its retained earnings at the end of fiscal 1999 the ibrds capital stock was worth 18822 billion and the value of its outstanding loans including undisbursed commitments was 11723 billion the ibrds retained earnings totaled 1771 billion at that time ida funds its loan program with money contributed directly by its member country governments plus 100 million or so transferred annually to ida from the ibrds net income it cannot make loan commitments or disbursements in excess of the amount it has on hand in the twelfth ida replenishment agreement ida12 approved by the donors in 1998 countries agreed to contribute 116 billion in new money to ida during the period july 1999 to june 2002 ida is also scheduled to receive about 94 billion in loan repayments during that period if the world bank choses to lend out an equal amount of these funds each year it could make new ida loan commitments totaling approximately 7 billion annually during these three years the annual flow of contributions and loan repayments varies however as does the volume of ida lending during its fiscal year 1999 ida made new loan commitments totaling 681 billion down from 781 billion the previous year6 the ifc funds its operations both with money contributed by its member countries and with money borrowed in world capital markets at the end of its fiscal 1999 its market borrowing totaled 1254 billion it had also borrowed another 350 million from the ibrd the value of the ifcs capital stock was 245 billion while the total value of its outstanding commitments for loans and equity investments some not yet disbursed was 129 billion at the end of fiscal 1999 new commitments in 1999 totaled 28 billion there is limit other than that imposed by prudence and the willingness of the market to provide funds on the amount the ifc can borrow to finance its operations migas member countries increased the value of its capital stock to 195 billion during fiscal 1999 in the initial issuance of ifc capital stock countries had to payin 20 of the value of their subscription 10 in cash and 10 in nonnegotiable noninterest bearing promissory notes the rest was callable capital in the new capital increase 1765 is payable in cash and the remainder is callable capital miga writes insurance coverage and guarantees it does not make loans miga had set aside 340 million as of june 1999 as provision against future insurance claims at present miga may issue coverage for up to 35 times the value of its capital stock the miga charter says the gearing ratio may be increased ultimately to 5 times capital there is talk currently of raising it to 4 times capital stock in 1999 miga issued 13 billion in new insurance and guarantee coverage for private investments in 29 countries the total issued coverage in 1999 was 55 billion
