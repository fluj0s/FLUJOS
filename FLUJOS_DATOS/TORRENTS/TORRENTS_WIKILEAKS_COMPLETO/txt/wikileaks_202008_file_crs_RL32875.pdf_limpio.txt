domestic social policy division april 21 2005 abstract for the past 20 years since the 1984 amendments the cse program and major changes or modiﬁcations to it have consistently had bipartisan congressional support child support proposals that were introduced in the 106th 107th and 108th congresses and that have been reintroduced in the 109th congress seek to fully implement family ﬁrst policy by ensuring that more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families go to the family and that all of the child support collected on behalf of formertanf families go to the family in addition the proposed legislation has included additional child support collection methodsenforcement techniques to ensure that noncustodial parents of all children are made to be ﬁnancially responsible for their children these cse proposals are broadly supported but generally have been incorporated into the controversial welfare reauthorization legislation and therefore have not yet passed both houses of congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl32875 the child

enforcement program review of the data summary the child support enforcement cse prog ram is federals tate program that promotes selfsufficiency of families in which one of the biological parents is living outside of the home by ensuring that nonc ustodial parents m eet their financial responsibility to their children the cse pr ogram provides severa l services on behalf of children including parent location paternity establishm ent establishment of child support orders and collection and dist ribution of child support payments in fy1978 families who received cash we lfare comprised 85 of the cse caseload by fy2003 they comprised only 17 of the cse caseload and 9 of cse collections in fy2003 former cash welfar recipients comprised 47 of the cse caseload and 40 of cse collections fa milies that had never received cash welfare comprised 36 of the cse caseload and lmost 52 of cse collections this is consistent with the underlying premise of the cse program as child support becomes more consistent and stable in come sourcesupport former cash welfare families will never have to return to the cash welfare rolls and families that never resorted to cash welfare will never have to do so in fy2003 the cse caseload was comprised of 159 million families the cs program is estimated to handle about 60 of all child support cases the remainin g cases are handled by private attorneys collection agencies or through mutual agreements between the parents all of the data in this report are ex clusively cse program data before state can enfor cecollect child support obligation

collected 18 of the child support obligations for which it had responsibility in fy2003 ie 58 of all current collections and 7 of obligations that we re pastdue but during the period fy1999fy2003 child support payments collected by cse agencies increased 33 for the nation as whole from 159 billion to 212 billion child support collections have continued to increase even though the cse caseload has declined although the number and percent of cse cases with collections have been increasing over time the average monthl child support payment for families that actually receive payment has been decreas ing and is relatively small amounting to only 221 per month in fy2003 although st ates incurred cost of 355 million for the cse program in fy2003 and the federal government incurred cost of almost 23 billion 433 in child support was collected for every 1 spent on cse activities the cse program began as welfare costrecovery program however in fy2003 90 of cse collections went to cse

title ivd of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is federalstate program that promotes selfsufficiency of families in which one of the biological parents is living outside of the home by ensuring that noncustodial parents meet their financial responsibility to thei r children while the federal government plays an important role in setting program standards and policy evaluating state performance and providing t echnical assistance and traini ng states are responsible for administering the cse program directly or through local cse agencies and family or domestic courts all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds to qualify for federal matching funds each states cs plan must be approved by the office of child support enforcement ocse depar tment of health and human services hhs states also are eligible to receive incentive payments based on certain performance indicators th cse program provides seve n major services on behalf of children parent locati on paternity establishment tablishment of child support orders review and modification of suppor t orders collection of support payments distribution of support payments and tablishment and enforcement of medical support cse services are provided to both welfare nd nonwelfare families since 1975 the federal administration of the cse program has been in the ocse which was originally located in th department of health education and welfare hew renamed the department of health and human services hhs in 1979 from the beginning ocse has been required by law to review and approve state cse plans establish standards fo r effective state cse programs provide technical assistance to the states assist them with reporting procedures maintain records of program operations and child support expenditures and collections audit state cse programs and prepare and sub mit an annual report to congress the annual report to congress s always included collecti on expenditure and caseload data in fact section 452a 10 of the social security ac t stipulates that certain data must be included in the annual report in march 2004 the cse program was cite d by the office of management and budget omb as being the most costeffective program among all social serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875crs2 1 us department of health and human services administration for children and families hhs news child support effectiveness cited by omb mar 31 2004 2 the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant replaced the aid to families with dependent children afdc program in 1996 as the federal governments primary cash assistance program for poor families with children 3 an exception to this rule occurs when child support is collected via the federal income tax refund offset program in federal income tax refund offset cases the child support arrearage payment up to the cumulative amount of tanf be nefits which has been paid to the family is retained by the state and federal government s in other words if child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the family does not have first claim on the arrearage paymentsand block grantformula progra ms reviewed governmentwide1 in fy2003 212 billion was collected at combined federals tate cost of 52 billion thus in effect four dollars in child support was collect ed for every dollar spent while the extensive reforms made to the cse program in 1996 1997 and 1998 have helped to significantly improve child support co llections and the num ber of paternities established the cse program has since its beginning in 1975 been highly respected and valuable program which s made much progress in achieving its original goals of reducing public expenditures for actu and potential welfare recipients by obtaining ongoing support from noncustodial pa rents and establishing paternity for children born outside marriage so child support could be obtained for them many commentators agree that the mission of the cse program has changed over the years it began as welfare co strecovery program but the child support enforcement amendments of 1984 pl 98378 broadened the mission to reflect service delivery the criteria for making incentive payments to the states was broadened in 1984 to include collec tions for nonwelfare families some commentators assert the serv icedelivery goal was reem phasized in 1996 legislation which established the family first policy to help assure that former welfare recipients stay off the tanf rolls2 the family first policy requires that such families are to receive any child support rrearage payments collected by the state before the state and federal government s retain their share of collections3 additionally the sharp decline in the cash welfare rolls and reduced expenditures on cash welfare since the mid1990s helped shif t the program from recovering declining costs for smaller population to collectin g and paying child support to nonwelfare families for the past 20 years since the 1984 ame ndments the cse program and major changes or modifications to it have consistently had bipartisan congressional support child support proposals that were introduced in the 106th 107th and 108th

elig ibility or benefit amount6 other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 child support collected on behalf of nonwel fare families goes to the family usually via state child support disbursement unit the cse program defines current assistance case as one in which the children are 1 recipients of cas h aid under tanf title iva of the social security act or 2 entitled to foster care maintenance payments title ive of the social security act in addition the childrens support righ ts have been assigned by caretaker to the state and referral to the state cse agency has been made former assistance case is defined as case in which the children were formerly receiving tanf or foster care services never assistance case is defined as case in which the children are receiving services under the cs program but are not currently eligible for and have not previously received assistance under tanf or foster care figure 2 shows the trend in the cse casel oad separated by tanf cases and nontanf cases table 2 shows that tanf cases comprised 85 of the cse caseload in fy1978 but dropped to 17 of the caseload in fy2003 by the same token nontanf cases represented only bout 15 of the cse caseload in fy1978 and increased to 83 of the caseload in fy2003 available data show that non tanf cases increasingly are familie s that formerly received tanf in fy1999 ocse started reporting data fo r the following categories current assistance former assistance and never r eceived assistance rather than by tanf and nontanf the data indicate that the num ber and percentage of cse families who currently receive tanf has decreased over time while the num ber and percentage of cse families who formerly received tanf has increased the data also show that the proportion of the cse caseloa d comprised of fa milies who had never received tanf has remain ed relatively stable for the period fy1999fy2003 see figure 3 the decline in tanf families since 1994 see table 2 and the relative stability of the segment of the caseload that had never been on the tanf rolls resulted in smaller cse caseload former tanf families represent the largest portion of the total cse caseload in fy2003 the largest group of families w ho were participating in the cse program were families who had left the tanf rolls ie former tanf families httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875crs7 7 under the old jargon former tanf families would have been included among nontanf families 8 in fy2003 families currently receiving tanf comprised 17 of the cse caseload and received about 9 of cse collections in contrast former tanf families comprised 47 of the cse caseload and received 40 of cse collections families that have never been on tanf comprised 36 of the cse caseload and received almost 52 of cse collections 9 see httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramscsepoldcldcl0076htm47 see figure 3 7 families who had never been on tanf represented 36 of the cse caseload and families who were currently receiving tanf benefits comprised 17 of the cse caseload8 thus although the majority of the cse caseload is comprised of nontanf families most of them at some poi nt in their lives received tanfafdc this is consistent with the expanded mission of the cse program the expectation is that as child support b ecomes more consistent and stable income sourcesupport these former tanf families will never have to return to the tanf rolls and families that never resorted to the tanf program will never have to do so in its strategic plan for the peri od fy2000fy2004 the

obtaining child support order states generally follow standard sequence of events in determining paternity in order to be part of the cse program st ates are required to have procedures which permit the establishment of the paternity of child at any time before the child reaches age 18 federal cse law also requires states to have laws and procedures for simple civil process for voluntarily acknow ledging paternity under such process the state must ensure that the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity are explained to both parents and that due process safeguards are afforded to both parents the statute requires that vol untary acknowledgment procedures include hospitalbased programs that focus on the period immediately before or after the birth of child fy2003 was the first year for which data are available in which more fathers were legally identified through voluntary paternity ac knowledgment process 862000 than through the courts or admin istratively via the cse agency 663000 in fy2003 paternity was established or acknowledged for 15 million children in the cse program table 4 shows that during the period fy1999fy2003 the number of paternities estab lished or

is calculated as percentage of either 1 all births in given year for which paternity is established or 2 all cases in the state cse program for which paternity is established table 5 uses all cases in the state cse program for which paternity is established as the base table 5 shows the paternity establishment perfo rmance measure for fy2003 for the nation as whole the paternity establishment pe rcentage pep was 77 in other words in fy2003 there were little over 10 million children on the cse rolls who had been born outside of marriage and the cse agencies had determined paternity for 77 million of them in fy2003 the pep ranged from low of 20 in the district of columbia to high of 101 in maine and utah the reader should note that table 5 indicates that for some states the pe p was greater than 100 this occurred because paternity is established for more than just the children who were born outside of marriage in the specified year most states acknowledge that while they have made significant improvement in establishing paternity for newborns they are performing poorly with respect to blishing paternity for older childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875crs13 table 4

health and human services note percentages are imprecise due to rounding of data child support collected on behalf of tanf families the reader should note that the child s upport payments made on behalf of tanf children are paid to the state for distribution rather than directly to the family if the child support collected is insufficient to lift the familys income above the states tanf eligibility limit the fa mily receives its full tanf grant and the child support is collected by the state and distributed to the state treasury and the federal government in proportion to their assistance to the family if the familys income including the child support payments exceeds the states tanf limitations the familys tanf cash benefits are ended and all child suppor t payments are then sent directly to the family via the stat child support disbursement unit when the cse program was first enacted in 1975 welfare cost recovery was one of the primary goals of the program there has been movement away from this goal in part because of the changing nature of the cse program as discussed earlier in the caseload section the size of the component of the caseload that is comprised of tanf families is shrinki ng even though overall child support collections increased by 33 over th fiveyear period fy1999fy2003 child support collections made on behalf of tanf families decreased by 27 in fy2003 only 17 of the cse caseload was comprised of tanf families thus the policy shift from using the cse program to recover welfare costs to using it as mechanism to consistently and reliably get child support income to families is not surprising in fy2003 only about 9 of cse collections 18 billion were made on behalf of tanf families little less than half of that amount 46 actually went to the families pursuant to state child support p ass through provisions the rest was divided between the state and federal g overnments to reimburse them for tanf benefits to the families this meant th at in fy2003 90 of cse collections 190 billion went to the families on the cse rolls see table 11 according to the cse preliminary fy2003 data report paym ents to families increased 6 from fy2002 to

to families receiving cse services but only 222 billion was paid 157 billion current 65 billion pastdue this meant that the cse program only coll ected 18 of the child support obligations for which it had responsibility if current collections are examined separately table 14 indicates that the cse program collected 58 of all current collections in fy2003 if collections on pastdue support i arrearages are examined separately table 15 shows that the cse program collected only 7 of arrearage payments in fy2003 table 15 shows that the total amount of arrearages reported in fy2003 for all previous fiscal years was 958 billi on however 65 billion was collected in fy2003 the cse fy2003 preliminary data report states in 1999 53 of the child support cases had arrearages owed in 20 03 the proportion was up to 68 we obtained coll ections in 60 of these cases so we know that child support professionals are working hard on them and that obligors are trying to work on their debts but we collected an average of 600 per arrearage case while the average amount of arrears per arrearage case is 9000 so even though were collecting significant amounts of arrears we dont seem to be making dent in the problem and the overall debt continues to grow13 table 16 shows that there were 108 million cases with arrearages due in fy2003 and collections were made in 64 million of those cases this meant that 60 of noncustodial parents who owed pa stdue support made some payment toward their arrearages in fy2003 tables 13 and 14 indicate that although majority of noncustodial parents who owe arrearages make some payment toward those arrearages the percentages of all arrearages paid remains small table 13 collections on current child support obligations fy1999fy2003 in millions of dollars

defined in pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 table 21 shows that in fy2003 433 in child support was collected for every 1 spent on cse activities for an increase of 5

revamped and congress designated four additional indicators as reliable performance measures the five performance measures in the cse program currently are related to establishment of paternity see

administrative expenses the federal share of cse administrative expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875crs38 14 beginning in fy2002 child support incentive payments are longer paid out of the federal share of child support collections made on behalf of tanf families instead federal funds have been specifically appropriated out of the us treasury for cse incentive paymentsactual incentive payments to states hold harmless payments to states and the state share of cse collections similarly federal costs were computed by adding together the federal share of cse administrative expenses actual incentive payments and hold harmless payments and then s ubtracting the federal share of cse collections14 table 22 shows that the cse program is longer moneymaker for states since fy2000 the st ates in the aggregate ve not incurred savings on the cse program instead in aggregate states incurred cost of 40 million on the program in fy2000 193 million in fy2001 359 million in fy2002 and 355 million in fy2003 in contrast the federal g overnment has always lost money on the cse program in fy1987 the federa l government incurred cost of 823 million on the cse program and in fy2003 the cse program cost the federal government almost 23 billion part of the reason that the cse program has been consistently losing money is because nonwelfare collections are gr owing at faster rate than welfare collections while the state and federal governments share in portion of welfare collections nonwelfare collections go to the custodial pare nt via the states disbursement unit table 21

support enforcement department of health and human services conclusion the cse program is very complex multifaceted program its purposemission has been evolving over the years from welfare cost recovery and income producer for the states to deliver of services to custodial parents and promotion of personal responsibility among noncustodial parents this is not surprising given the changing compositi on of the cse caseload which is reflected in the decline in cash welfare families and the rise in former cash welfare families so far it seems that the multiple purposes or broadened mission has not had negative effect on the effectiveness of the cse program the data highlighted in this report bring the cse program into focus the data indicate that the program has grown tr emendously during the 25year period fy1978fy2003 cse collections increased almost sevenfold to 212 billion adjusting for inflation program expenditu res increased more than fivefold to 52 billion adjusting for inflation the number of children whose paternity was established or acknowledged through the cse program increased almost 13fold to 15 million the number of child support ob ligations established increased three fold to about 12 million and the cse caseloa d increased nearly threefold to 159 million from this viewpoint the cse pr ogram is seen as very successful the data presented also show that ev though the cse agency is second only to the internal revenue service irs in terms of its collectionenforcementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875crs41 apparatus it has consistently collected only small fraction of the child support obligations for which it has respons ibility 18 in fy2003 although this percentage is higher if pastdue child support payments ie arrearages which generally are hard to collect are not cons idered in the equation it is still relatively low at 58 that is in fy2003 the cse program collected only 58 of current child support paymentsobligations cse data indicate that the program is collecting child support for greater number and higher percentage of families but the average monthly child support payment for families th at actually receive payment is still relatively small 221 per month in fy2003 for the 10 million children in the cse program in fy2003 who were born outside of marriage the establishment of paternity is the first step in obtaining child support obligation fy2003 was the first year in which more fa thers were legally identified through voluntary paternity acknowledgment process 862000 than through the courts or administratively via the cse agency 663000 most states acknowledge that while they have made significant improvement in establishing paternity for newborns primarily thr ough voluntary paternity acknowledgment at hospitals when the child is born they are performing poorly with respect to establishing paternity for older ch ildren in fy2003 the cse program had established paternity for only 77 of its caseload so although the cse program exhibits improved performance there is much more to be achieved congre ss has consistently had high expectations for the cse program there was widespread congre ssional support for the cse provisions that were incorporated into the controversial 1996 welfare refo rm legislation and there is agreement that more progress in the program is possible when all states are in full compliance with the automated system s requirements enacted in 1996 and 1998 this report points out that in fy2003 onl about 9 of cse collections 18 billion were made on behalf of tanf families about half of that amount actually went to the families and the rest was divided between the state and federal governments to reimburse them for tanf benefits to the families this meant that in fy2003 90 of cse collections 190 b illion went to the families on the cse rolls thus the data confirm that the family first policy that was begun with the 1996 welfare law pl 104193 is being effectively implemented pl 104193 required states to pay higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare ie former tanf families by making these payments to the family first the order of payment of the child support collection is of tremendous importance because in many cases pastdue child support ie arrearages are never fully paid the 1996 we lfare reform law also gave states the option to pass through and disregard some all or none of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families bout half of the states currently passthrough and disregard some child support for tanf families if the currently pending tanf reaut horization legislation hr 240 s 667 becomes law states will have new choices to make about how far to proceed with the servicedelivery stable income sources upport perspective of the program there will be more federal money available for states that decide to pass through and disregard more child support collected on behalf of families w ho are still receiving tanf cash benefits and there will be new options for states to distribute more childhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32875crs42 support collections to families who are former tanf cash benefit recipients thus it is possible that in the near future even more child support collected by states on behalf of tanf families and former tanf families actually would go to families rather than be kept by the states and th federal government to reimburse them for tanf cash benefits that were paid to the family slightly different examination of the preceding discussion shows how pending cse legislation could severely restrict the ability of the cse program to recover cash welfare costs the data in this repor t indicated that in fy2003 17 of the cse caseload was comprised of tanf families 47 of the caseload was comprised of former tanf families and 36 of the caseload had tanf c onnection this meant that in effect 64 of the cse cas eload had some tanf connection another viewpoint shows tanf families represen ting 17 of the caseload and nontanf families representing 83 of the cse caseload under current law the state and federal governments can potentially recei ve reimbursements from 64 of the caseload if pending welfare reauthoriz ation legislation is passed the state and federal governments would be able to r eceive reimbursements from only 17 of the cse caseload although sometimes overlooked the cse prog ram is an integral component of welfare reform it is not surprising that child support payments are now widely recognized as very significant income source for singleparent families the data presented in this report indicate that the cse program is making great strides in ensuring that children get the support they are owed from their noncustodial parents
