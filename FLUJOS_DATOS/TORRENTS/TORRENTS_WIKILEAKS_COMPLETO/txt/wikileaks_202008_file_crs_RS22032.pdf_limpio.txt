trade division summary there are various views on how to total u s spending on foreign aid and how us transfers compare with those from other ma jor donors for the united states the size of the foreign aid budget is frequently m easured in terms of annual appropriations approved for international assistance programs in comparing the united states with other international aid donors the most common source of information is the development assistance committee dac of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd there are significant scope and methodological differences how ever between us appropr iations figures and those used by the dac this report explains th ose differences and discusses other issues related to the debate over how much wea lthy countries contribute to international development and what share us resources represent the humanitarian tragedy caused by the i ndian ocean tsunami in late 2004 and the subsequent gleneagles g8 summit focuse d on africa in mid2005 elevated the discussion of broader issue regarding how much the worlds wealthiest nations contribute to foreign aid and di saster relief and how united states aid compares with the transfers of other countries because of va rying definitions of what constitutes foreign assistance there is frequent confusion over what is the precise us foreign aid budget and some controversy over how to compare u s levels with those of other donors fundamental point of misunders tanding stems from the substantial differences in both scope and methodology between what cong ress annually appropr iates for foreign assistance and how the oecds development assistance committee dac presents data comparing aid performance of 22 donor s including the united states us foreign aid budget many regard the annual foreign operati ons appropriations bill together with relevant supplementals as the most reliable figures to use when assessing how much the united states spends on foreign aid the foreign operations measure combines most economic military and mu ltilateral assistance accounts into single spending bill andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22032crs2 is useful proxy for the si ze of the american foreign ai d budget nevertheless it does not represent the precise total of us fore ign assistance for two reasons first the foreign operations measure includes fundi ng for the exportimport bank eximbank an export promotion program that is not defi ned by the office of management and budget omb as foreign aid secondly foreig n operations does not include appropriations for international food assist ance programs and for porti on of international hivaids activities that are funded in the agri culture and laborhhsed spending b ills respectively in table 1 foreign operati ons appropriations have been adjusted to correspond to the more precise omb accounting of foreign aid funding excluding the eximbank and adding international food aid omb does t count international hivaids spending provided through the laborhhse d appropriations measures as foreign aid since the funds are channeled through domesticfocused agencies in most years foreign aid appropriations by ombs definition are so mewhat larger than amounts provided in foreign operations spending bills because in ternational food aid usua lly runs higher than resources for the eximbank table 1 us foreign

terror and tsunami and darfur humanitarian relief fy2006 does not include pending emergency supplemental hr 4939 that could add more than 2 b illion to the fy2006 total when enacted official devel opment assistance while foreign operations ppropriations or the adjusted figures shown in table 1 are the most common ways within the us government for measuring the size of american foreign aid they represent met hodology that is unique to the us budgeting system to overcome discrepancies nd inconsistencies among donor budgeting processes the development assistance committee of the oecd has established common definitions and methodologies for member countries to report amounts of official development assist ance oda for over 30 years the dac has been regarded as an authoritative source of government inte rnational aid spending and the standard to use in comparing assistance provide d by the worlds major aid donors but as can be seen by comparing foreign assistance appropriations figures with oda totals for the united states published by the dac table 2 there are significant differences in all years the difference in total us appropriations and us oda is several billions of dollars and in few years appropriations are roughly twice the level of oda several factors explain these differenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22032crs3 1 for purposes of oda acc ounting only 15 billion and 3 billi on of iraq reconstruction funds disbursed in calendar 2003 and 2004 respectively for 2005 the total rises significantly to 102 billiontable 2 us official development assistance oda

economic cooperation and development cy2005 is preliminary and subject to change oda excludes military aid the dac collects and reports only nonmilitary grant and lowinterest loan assistance to developing nations us fore ign aid appropriations include large amounts of military aid rang ing between 3 billion and 64 billion over the past 10 years in table 1 an estima of the amount of nonmilitary appropriations is shown figures that more closely align with oda data further of the roughly 22 billion appropriated for iraq reconstruction in fy2003 and fy2004 approximately 26 billion for iraqi national gu ard and military quipment and training is not c ounted as oda for this reason alone oda will always be substantially less than total us foreign aid appropriations oda represents net disbursements official development assistance is reported as net disbursements method that is closest to the us budgeting term of outlays us appropriations represent the amount of mone committed in particular year much of which may not be disbursed or outlayed for several years this means that oda figures will usually lag year or two behind actions taken by congress in foreign aid appropriations for example in fy1996 fo reign aid appropriations declined from the previous year while the us oda level ro by 27 the oda figure most likely reflected large appropriation in fy1995 for multilateral deve lopment bank mdbs contributions that did not disburse until calendar 1996 conversely the significant increases in foreign aid appropriations be ginning in fy2003 including large sums for iraq reconstruction are only partially reflected in the oda disbursement data for calendar 2003 and 2004 but had large impact on the us oda figure for calendar 2005 which represented 39 increase over the previous year1 the net disbursements measure takes into account recipient repayments to donors for previous oda concessional loans which are subtracted from new oda expenditures for particular year because the united states has maintained largely grant aid program for over two decades and has forgiven most debt owed by many aid recipients the net basis for reporting us oda is not significant fact or for other donors however it may have substantial impact oda excludes aid provided to higherincome countries economic aid extended by the united states and other donors to c ountries with per capita gnps of more than 9205 and to transition economies in central europe and the former soviet union are not counted as oda consequently us foreign aid appropriati ons of over 1 billion per year since 1991 for russia and the former eastern bloc have not been included in oda figures moreover in 1997 because of its rising income level the dac movedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22032crs4 israel out of the oda list of countries this partially explains the sharp drop in us oda disbursements in cy1997 and betw een 350 million and 12 billion in annual economic assistance to israel has not b een counted as oda in more recent years oda includes some funds not counted in foreign aid appropriations certain amounts of international prog rams funded out of domestic and defense appropriations rather than foreign operations appropria tions are counted as oda for example humanitarian disaster and civic aid incl uded in annual dod appr opriations 62 million in fy2006 and department of health and human res ources and the centers for disease control appropriations for interna tional hivaids malari and tuberculosis 590 million in fy2006 are included in oda figu res reported to the dac indeed the share of total us oda represented by usai d and state department programs has been declining in recent years with other nonfo reign policy agencies providing more out of their budgets for cy2005 the united states reported that usaids share of oda was 42 and state departments 13 the re maining 45 was disbursed by other us agencies including 185 fo r the defense department oda reports data on calendar year not fiscal year basis the timing for passage of foreign operations measures can have significant impact on amounts reported to the dac if foreign operations bill is enacted several months after the beginning of the new fiscal year but passed on time before september 30 the following year it is possible that rapidly disbursing appropriations such as contributions to the mdbs from two fiscal year appropriati ons will be included in si ngle oda calendar year total comparing oda transfers of major donors dac statistics published annua lly compare donors in numbe r of ways total dollar amounts aid as percent of gross national income gni aid dollars per capita grant composition multilateral contributions income level of recipients purposes of aid etc the most commonly cited comparisons are the total volume of oda disbursements and oda disbursements as percent of gni the fact that the united states as illustra ted in figures 1 and 2 is the leading donor in terms of volume but nearly last in rms of gni percentage sharpens continuous debate over whether the us provides an appropriate share of international oda those who argue that the united states is the largest provider of foreign assistance emphasize the volume of oda disbursements as the most relevant indicator pointing out that us oda in 2005 represented 258 of the 1065 billion in total dac disbursements moreover the 2005 figures they emphasize do not yet fully reflect significant new us foreign aid initiatives for hivaids prog rams and the millenni um challenge account that will push oda levels higher in the coming years they further reject the exclusive focu s on public or govern menttransferred aid noting that private transfers in the form of direct investments and aid from non governmental organizations ngos with f unds raised through charitable contributions have become far more significant sources of development financ ing over the past two decades at the very least those calling for considerati on of charitable donations made by private citizens to ngos for overseas ac tivities maintain that they should be an additional indicator of countrys intern ational development commitment according to dac figures the united states account ed for 63 billion of total of 102 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22032crs5

oda volume from major donors 2005in grants by private ngos in 2003 many analysts believe however that the dac figures significantly understate the amount of us private donations adding these figures to the total volume of oda would push the united states even higher as the leading donor some also believe that personal remittances of immigrants working abroad should also be included in calculations of financial flows to developing nations the hudson institute estimate s that in 2004 remittances from workers living in the united states totaled 47 billion overall the institutes study finds that total us flows to developing nations in 2004 reached 99 billion of which official oda represented only 197 billi on or 20 of the total the index of global philanthropy 2006 p 15 moreover some believe that there are ma ny inkind and intangible contributions that are difficult to quantify in monetary terms the united states plays particularly large role in some of these activities especially where american military assets are used for transportation logistical support and s ecurity of aid workers in emergency and conflict situations they point to the indian ocean tsunami disaster in which the us military played critical role in the delivery of urgently needed relief supplies some of the expense associated with the militarys efforts will not be reflected in us oda figures aside from the money issue some policymakers emphasize that discussion about aid burden sharing should not be about the quantity of oda the focus they contend should be about the quality of development progra ms and government policies especially in the area of trade that provide benefits to poor countri far beyond the value of oda those that argue that the united states should provide more foreign aid generally regard oda as percent of gni as the best meas ure of us aid on this basis as share of national wealth the us ranks second to last among 22 major aid donors even if private donations are added to the total in 2003 the percent of gni would increase to 021 but still place the united states in the 21st position while acknowledging the importance of private direct investment in the promotion of economic growth in poor countries these analysts point out that private flows are even more unpredictable than public transfers and are distributed in relatively uneven pattern with large concentrations in more advanced economies such as india and china private direct investment in lowincome countries they point out has fallen over the past decade likewise some of these critic s do not believe that worker remittances should be included in foreign aid calculations due to the random nature of these transfers and their lack of integration into broad development strategies remittances generally come from wages paid to immigrants worker and should not be seen as charity according to this viewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22032crs6

advocate higher levels of us foreign aid further contend that if the volume of oda is used as point of comparison it is more appropriate to measure american oda against europe as whole rather than i ndividual european countries using this comparison european union eu countries that are members of the dac having comparable national income 1048 trillion with that of the us 1098 trillion provided more than twi ce the amount of oda in 2005 554 b illion vs the us 275 billion using somewhat differe nt terms oda per capita the eu with population 31 larger than the united states disbursed about 145 per person compared with 94 per american some analysts also assert that since the bush administration has added internati onal development as third pillar of us national security together with defense and diplomacy the growing importance of aid to american national interests should be reflected in higher resource allocations these critics commend the bush administration for committing to significantly higher foreign aid spending and launching the hivaids and millennium challenge account initiatives but believe the united states can and should do more if international development is key element of us national security they argue the private sector should not be responsible for meeting these important american national interests in many parts of the world for them the key question is not the us ranking as donor but whether th united states government is spending enough on development aid to achieve its stated national security goals an alternative comparison method for the past three years private us think tank the center for global development has compiled an alternative way to analyze the impact of the policies of 21 wealthy countries on veloping nations the co mmitment to development index takes far broader approach than usin g oda and private flows data to compare government performance by examining policie s on trade investment the environment migration security and technology in add ition to foreign aid based on the centers most recent release in mid2005 the united states ranked tied for 12th among 21 countries analyzed the united states by th is measure scored high on trade investment policies that promote development while scoring low in the areas of aid the complete results of the centers study can be found at httpwwwcgdevorg beyond the analytical results of the ce nters study it further illustrates the complexity of measuring the impact of us and other governments policies on promoting development and reducing poverty that go well beyond the comparison of oda data whether it be based on volume or as percent of national income
