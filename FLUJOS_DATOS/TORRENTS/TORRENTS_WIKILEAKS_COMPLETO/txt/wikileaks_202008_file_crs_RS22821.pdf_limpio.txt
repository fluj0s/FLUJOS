product safety commission current issues bruce mulock specialist in government and business government and finance division summary the consumer product safety commission cpsc one of the agencys two current commissioners stated recently is at crossroads according to cpsc commissioner thomas moore either congress will reverse the agencys steady decline or the cpsc will become so weakened as to be irrelevant created in the early 1970s the cpsc is small agency by washington standards slightly more than 400 employees nd 625 million fy2007 appropriation charged with seemingly overwhelming responsibility to protect american consumers against death or injury from unsafe products includi ng imported products series of high profile product recalls most notably of childrens toys imported from china has focused attention on the cpscs resources in cluding its legal authority for the task at hand legislation hr 4040 and s 2663 to strengthen the commission is being considered the cpsc is but one part of growing congressional concern about the protection being afforded american consumers from uns afe imports food pet food as well as that intended for human consumption drugs and products fall under the jurisdictions of other federal regulatory agencies this report will be updated as events warrant about the agency the consumer product safety commission is perhaps best understood in the context of the surge of the consumer protection m ovement of the 1960s beginning with ralph naders efforts to dramatize the problems of auto safety genera l interest in product safety was stimulated the cong ress responded by passing ries of laws dealing with auto safety toy safety radiation safety fabric flammability and child resistant packaging for hazardous household substances these ws as well as several dating from the 1950s were in the opinion of some observe rs neither comprehensive in scope with respect to the wide range of consumer products nor adequa in protection while industry was originally opposed to federal regulatory pproach by the early 1970s the national association of manufacturers agreed there was need for

rogue that plays by the rules the washington post sept 2 2007 p b3to pass product safety law1 key reason was because manufacturers were increasingly having to contend with complex and conf using assortment of state laws and the prospect of having to deal with unified regulatory approach appeared attractive although there are other histor ical factors the cpsc owes its existence primarily to the work of the national commission on pr oduct safety ncps legislation was introduced in 1966 and the following year pl 90146 authorizing the ncps was approved in march 1968 president lyndon johnson appointed the sevenmember bipartisan commission to conduc t comprehensive study and investigation of the scope and adequacy of measures now employed to protect consumers ag ainst unreasonable risk of injuries which may be cause d by hazardous household products2 the agencys statutory purposes are to 1 protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer pr oducts 2 assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of cons umer products 3 develop uni form safety standards for consumer products and minimize conflicting state and local re gulations and 4 promote research and investigation into the cause s and prevention of pr oductrelated deaths illnesses and injuries in addition to the authority assigned to the cpsc by its enabling legislation major consumer programs were transferred to the new agency from the food and drug administration the health education and we lfare department now known as health and human services and the commerce department included were the federal hazardous substances act of 1960 as amende d by the toy safety acts of 1969 and 1984 and the child protection amendments of 1966 the poison prevention packaging act of 1970 the flammable fabrics act of 1953 nd the refrigerator safety act of 1956 the cpsc was designed to be relatively sm all rather than relying on thousands of inspectors the agency relies on the onus placed on firms by its enabling statute section 15b for example requires manufacturers to report unsafe products to the commission this general approach appears to have wo rked reasonably well for domestically produced consumer products because of the nations re gulatory regime when it comes to imported products however the absence of key f actors may make safe ty oversight more problematic in china for example inspections cannot with anything approaching confidence be left to chinese factory owners china reportedly suffers from the absence of rigorous regulatory system endemic problems of corruption and lack of free press3 recent recalls beginning in spring 2007 newspaper stor ies began appearing with increasing regularity about dangerous and sometimes deadly def ects in imported products httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821crs3 4 for more information see crs report rs22713 health and safety concerns over us imports of chinese products an overview by wayne m

first came reports about toothpaste manufactured in china containing chemi cals unsafe for human consumption then awareness of unsafe products was brought hom to millions of pet owners when it was discovered that some pet f ood manufactured in china contained melamine contamination which was blamed for causing kidney failu re in hundreds of an imals subsequently health and safety concerns were raised about seaf ood tires and chemical and pharmaceutical products5 throughout the summer of 2007 additional reca lls of toys appeared some involved danger because of loose magnets some because of beads containing toxic chemical if ingested and toy ovens with the potential for finger entrapment and burn hazards large number of recalls involved jewe lry and painted toys containi ng unsafe levels of lead thus it is not surprising that there is concern among many american consumers if all these problems have been detected or uncovered in spite of various underfunded and understaffed inspection systems have we been seeing just the tip of the iceberg cpsc funding reflects increasing congressional concern throughout the summer and fall of 2007 ppropriators took note of the growing concerns about the adequacy of the agency s funding at oversig ht and appropriations hearings in both the house and senate witn esses from consumer organizations industry and the agency were among those who advo cated providing cpsc with more money to get the job done the cpscs fy2007 budget was 6227 million the house following the recommendation of the appropriations committee proposed increasing the agencys appropriation to 6683 million for fy2008 fo r its part the senate proposed 70 million in the end under the omnibus funding measure hr 2764 cpsc received 80 million for fy2008 an increase of 177 million for fy2008 or 28 the appropriators directed cpsc to use its additional funding to increase staff workspace and information tec hnology resources in particul ar appropriators instructed the agency to hire in the areas of hazard identification and reduction as well as compliance and field operations consumer groups and others have repeat edly expressed concerns over the cpscs staffing level in 1977 three years after the commission opened its doors it had staff of 900 the staffing level has declined sharply over the past three decades from high of 978 in 1980 the budget for fy2007

under the jurisdictions of other federal regulatory agencies on july 18 200 7 president bush issued an executive order eo 13439 establishing the interagency working group on import safety6 the working group comprises senior administration officials it includes the secretaries of agriculture commerce health and human services tr ansportation and homeland security the administrator of the environm ental protection agency and the chairman of the cpsc hhs secretary mich ael leavitt who chairs the working group presented an import safety action plan to president bush on november 6 2007 noting the sheer magnitude of the importexport enterprise the plan c oncludes that the united states cannot inspect its way to safety rather the plan pres ented number of short and longterm recommendations designed to improve the safe ty of imports entering the country the recommendations include creating stronger certification process encouraging various best practices increasing transparency exchanging import data increasing us presence overseas enhancing standards and strengthening penalties the working group presented president bu sh with strategic framework to increase import safety that called for several immediate steps one of these steps was directive to federal agencies to accelerate their participation in an automated single window system for reporting imports electr onically the aim is to achieve better coordination and efficiency thus facilitating information exchange among government agencies and between the government and the importing community in real time legislative proposals to strengthen the cpsc although major consumer groups such as the consumer federation of america consumers union and us public interest research group had been voicing concern about the cpscs declining budgets in real rms and staffing for decades and had tried for years to persuade congress to amend and strengthen the agencys powers until the recent uproar over dangerous

house energy and commerce committee on december 18 2007 and passed in the house the following day by vote of 4070 among the bills major provisions are the following would require mandatory thirdparty testing of childrens products and requires premarket tes ting of many childrens products for lead and other hazards by cer tified laboratories would prohibit the cpsc from usin g agency rulemaking actions to preempt state common law claims and increase the cap on civil penalties to 10 million current level 18 million would authorize state attorneys general to enforce cpsc standards would create new lead standards for childrens products when fully phased in the bill would lower the st andard for lead from 600 parts per million to 100 parts per million or trace amounts it would mandate that the agency periodically review and re vise this standard to require the lowest amount of lead science and t echnology make feasible to achieve would require mandatory safety st andards for nursery products eg cribs and high chairs calls for cpsc to examine the current voluntary safety standards for toys starting w ith dangerous magnets and if found to be inadequate mandatory standards must be adopted would require manufacturers to pl ace distinguishing marks on products and packaging of childrens products to aid in recalls it would prohibit the sale and export of recalled pr oducts prohibit the export of products that violate us consumer product safety rules and would provide cpsc with 80 million for 2009 90 million for fy2010 and 100 million for fy2011 it would also restore the agency to full panel of five commi ssioners and include 20 million to modernize the agencys testing lab in the senate commerce science and transportation committee chairman daniel inouye and the committees ranking member ted stevens announced on february 15 2008 they had joined with senator mark pr yor sponsor of s 2045 the cpsc reform act of 2007 to announce new compromise bill8 the new bill s 2663 does not include several of s 2045 s more controversial provisions including giving whistleblowers financial incen tives for reporting defects nd hazards in products made by companies with whom they were employ ed and giving state attorneys general power to enforce product safety standards those two provisions had represented key differences from hr 4040 and had been opposed by the bush administr ation nevertheless important differences remain between the h ouse and senate bills s 2663 provides larger authorizations for the agency for longer time period furt her the senate bill contains higher civil penalties for violations and unlike hr 4040 the senate bill contains number of provisions aimed at single product issues thes include specific provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22821crs6 9 for an overview and analysis of this issue see crs report rs22869 bisphenol bpa in plastics and possible human health effects by lindajo schierow and

ability to ask court to remove product from store shelves authority not included in hr 4040 s 2663 however does not allow states to sue for damages as s 2045 would have would grant whistleblowers various protections unlike s 2045however s 2663 does not include pr oviding financial rewards for disclosing information about dangerous products would restore the cpsc to five members as with hr 4040

eliminating mandatory advanced notice of proposed rulemaking step and would allow cpsc to expedite the disclosure of industryprovided information in the interest of public health and safety senate and house conferees were appointed on april 29 and may 14 respectively and having missed an earlier ta rget date of the week follo wing the memorial day recess now hope to reach compromise before the july 4 holiday even as the conferees work to reconcile important differences between the two cpsc reform bills another highvisibility issue has moved to the front burner for several regulatory agencies including the cpsc th safety of phthalate s and bisphenol bpa in childrens products at house energy and commerce committee hearings on june 10 2008 scientists presented evidence on the toxi city of class of industrial chemicals known as phthalates used to make plastic toys and childcare products the testimony which was not conclusive with regard to possible harm may help conferees decide whether to include ban of these chemical s in the final version of the cpsc reform legislation9 while spokesmen for both cpsc and the food and drug administration said the evidence of danger from bpa was insu fficient to corroborate concerns canadas health agency announced in april that it pla nned to put bpa on its list of toxic substances and would ban plastic baby bottles made with the chemical
