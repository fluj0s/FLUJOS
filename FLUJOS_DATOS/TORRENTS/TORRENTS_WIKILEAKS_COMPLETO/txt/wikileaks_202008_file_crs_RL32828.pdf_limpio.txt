lowincome beneficiaries who qualify for transitional assistance have enrolled in the card lowincome medicare beneficiaries could realize the most tangible benefit from enrolling since they would

discount card programs offering different prices for specific drugs some variation in covered drugs and distinct pharmacy networks thus beneficiaries ve many considerati ons when selecting card to make such choice they first need to know the program exists next they need both information to determine whether to enroll in the program and decision supports to help them select the card most suited to their own circumstances many of the same outreach and educati on methods cms has used in the past to inform beneficiaries about new medicare bene fits are being employ ed and intensified for the discount drug card program in particular cms has placed increased emphasis on the internet as an informa tion vehicle for bene ficiary information some observers have commented that th complex decisions beneficiaries must make about program enrollment and card selection have d to confusion and inaction among older people these factors coupled with the approximately 70 of medicare beneficiaries who are unable to use the internet for any purpose some suggest have constrained program enrollment cms s improved its outreach and education strategies as it obtained more beneficiary f eedback many acknowledge that reaching lowincome people with information that would encourage their enrollment in new programs is difficult challenge one faced by many governmental programs the outreach and education experience of the discount card program can offer lessons for implementing the medicare pres cription drug benefit beginning in 2006 then decisions beneficiaries must make are likely to be more complex and the stakes higher for not enrolling andor selecting prescription drug plan that does not target an individuals needs as well as alterna tive plans this report will be

medicare beneficiaries who are also enrolled in medicaid receive drug coverage through that program and are therefore not eligible for transitional assistance3 program enrollment challenges when implementing any new public program federal agencies are faced with the challenge of making the intended participants aware of the new benefits and getting the assistance to people who need it the most when the target population is lowincome older persons achieving significant level of program enrollment is particularly difficult based upon the experi ences of other federal programs targeted to this group intensive education and outr each efforts are required and even then significant proportions of the elig ible population may not participate4 several factors present particular complications in designing information strategies targeted to lowincome medicare beneficiaries literacy rates among low income persons are lower than for the rest of the population5 in addition low income beneficiaries are less likely to have access to certain communication vehicles frequently used to disseminate program in formation particularly the internet6 finally some research indicates that there are agerelated cognitive declines in the ability to comprehend comparative information and apply it to ones own circumstances7 for the drug discount card program not only does information about the program need to reach lowincome beneficiaries but information also needs to facilitate their ability to c hoose which card bests fits th eir needs individuals can choose from 38 cards

this group s part b premiums until the annual allotment has been spent some states allow individuals to retain additional income or assets and still qualify for each of these three msp categoriesspecific drugs some variation in covered drugs and distinct networks of participating pharmacies thus beneficiaries have num ber of distinctly different factors to consider when comparing and selecting card current program enrollment as of february 2005 nearly 62 million beneficiaries were enrolled in medicareendorsed drug disc ount card of these only 17 million persons received the lowincome credit8 number significantly below expectations when the program began cms estimated that 7 million persons would quality for the 600 annual credit and 47 million would enroll9 almost half of the 62 million card partic ipants were automatically enrolled by entities that had the authority to act on th eir behalf of these at least 24 million persons were enrolled in card by th eir medicare managed care plan and 350000 were enrolled by state pharmacy assistance programs established by some states with their own funds to help older people pay for prescription drugs thus about 35 million persons enrolled in the card program through their own initiative data are not available on the proportion of lowinco persons who enrolled through each of these methods at the urging of beneficiary organiza tions cms recently decided to facilitate enrollment in the discount card program for beneficiaries who pa rticipate in one of the medicare saving programs msp10 because these programs which cover various medicarerelated outofpocket costs are targeted to lowincome beneficiaries virtually all participants would meet the income criteria for receiving the drug card credit in october 2004 cms mailed drug cards to 11 million msp participants once these persons calle d 1800medicare or the phone number of the card sponsor to which they had been randomly assigned enrollment would be activated as of january 2005 less than 10 of those who were mailed cards had enrolled in the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs4 this report addresses the approach cms has been using to inform beneficiaries about medicare s covered benefits and options but most specifically it focuses on education and out reach strategies adopted to both inform beneficiaries about the prescription drug discount card pr ogram and assist them in choosing the card that best fits their circumstances lessons learned from these current efforts can help congress oversee the design and imple mentation of strategies for assisting beneficiaries to understand an even more complicated medicare prescription drug benefit and make informed decisions in th fall of 2005 about new private drug plans evolution of beneficiary outreach and education programs enactment of medicare the challenge of educating older people about new medicare be nefits dates back to the programs enactment in 1965 then federal officials needed to locate all 19 million persons age 65 and over to enroll them in the medicare program all older people were initially covered by the hospital insurance program medicare part participants in social security were automatically enrolled in part by the social security administrati on ssa but about 45 million older people did not receive social security payments primarily because they were retired from federal state or local governments that had established sepa rate public pension systems for their employees to participate in part these individuals were required to submit an application to ssa all older people also had the choice of enrolling in the voluntary supplementary medical insurance smi program medicare part b thus they needed to learn about this option and determine whet her they wanted to participate beneficiary outreach in 1965 ssa launched massi ve effort to enroll all older people in part and part b of the medicare program with the assistance of the internal revenue service the federal civil service commission now the office of personnel management nd state and local governme ntal retirement systems practically all older persons who were not eligible for social security were identified and eventually enrolled in part those individuals along with all social security beneficiaries were mailed applications for part b enrollment about half of the target population res ponded to the first mailing most choosing to enroll in part b second mailing media campaign and targeted doortodoor 72 million outreach effort operation medi care alert sponsored by the us office of economic opportunity achieved pa rt b enrollment of 88 of the eligible population congress enacted legislation to extend the part b enrollment deadline for two months after which the participa tion rate increased to 90 in addition about 1 million older persons declined part b participation meaning that almost allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs5 11 national academy of social insurance implementation aspects of national health care reform reflections on implementing medicare mar 15 1993eligible individuals proac tively responded to the various outreach efforts during the ninemonth enrollment period11 beneficiary enrollment achieving 90 enrollment rate in the medicare program at its inception was truly remarkable accomplishment communication methods used today such as national to llfree telephone lines and the internet were not available eligible individuals without any prior connection to federal benefit program had to be located and many older people who had limited exposure to insurance terms needed to learn about premiums deductibles and copayments in order to make decision about enrolling in part b on the other hand compared to the co mplex decisions individuals must make when enrolling in the drug discount progra m enrollment in part b was relatively straightforward process when beneficiar ies decided whether to enroll in medicare part b their primary consideration wa s whether the monthly premium of 3 was worth the programs benefits only small percentage of older people had to compare part b benefits with their existing insurance plan since so few had private health care coverage for physician services and the other new part b benefits in contrast the decisions be neficiaries face in choosing drug discount card are complicated due in part to the number of cards available and the variation among them in drug prices covered dr ugs and participating pharmacies also because in 1965 older people had onl two choices to enroll in part b or not the ssa was able to mail each person standard application form that asked for simple yesno response to be nt back to ssa in contrast when the discount card program began lowincome person who wanted to enroll in card and apply for the 600 credit needed to ma il an application to particular card sponsor rather than apply through co mmon point in the fall of 2004 cms began permitting card sponsors to accept beneficiary applications for both the card and the credit through an online link to the sponsors website posted on httpwwwmedicaregov or over the phone current cms efforts to educate medicar beneficiaries about the programs covered services and to f acilitate consumer decision making in choosing drug discount card are rooted in two prior si gnificant congressiona l reform initiatives these are 1 the creation of standardized supplemental insurance plans in 1990 and 2 the establishment in 1997 of new types of managed care plans under the medicarechoice program both provided new program options to beneficiaries who often needed tailored information and decision supports in order to take maximum advantage of the choices created by these initiatives omnibus budget rec onciliation act of 1990 medigap plan choices with passage of the omnibus budg et reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101 518 congress enacted reforms to restru cture medicare suppl emental insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs6 12 section 1851dcommonly known as medigap in respons to both widespread fraudulent sales practices and concerns that medigap insurance

created th information counseling and assistance program later renamed the state health insurance assistance program ship funded by federal grants to states aw arded by the health care financing administration hcfa now cms fifteen states already had similar programs upon which the federal program was modeled in each state the governor designated the state agency to manage the program in twothirds of the states state offices on aging have that responsibility and in th remaining onethird state insurance commissions administer the ship initially ships were charged with pr oviding information counseling and assistance to beneficiaries in making choices about medigap and longterm care insurance and more generally helping them understand their medicare coverage reconcile erroneous b illings and recognize fraudulent in surance practices over the past 14 years their roles have signifi cantly expanded as subsequent legislation created medicare managed care options and established dicareendorsed drug discount cards and medicare prescription dr ug benefit the oneonone counseling and decision support provided by ships has evolved to meet beneficiary needs for information and decision support in selectin g from among these new types of options the resources allocated to the program however remained relatively stable when it was first established the initia l level of support was 10 million for fy1991 over the next 12 years annual funding vels fluctuated up and down along band ranging from 10 million to 16 million with enactment of the mma and the new benefit choices it created cms increased funding for the ship program from 12 million in 2003 to 21 million in 2004 and 31 million in 2005 to provide higher level of benefici ary decision support balanced budget act of 1997 choice of managed care plans the second major medicare policy chan ge that triggered new consumer education efforts was the creation of medicarechoice manage d care plans coupled with an intensified emphasis on increasing beneficiary enrollment in managed care when enacting these changes in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 congress specified set of ac tivities hhs was requi red to conduct to educate older people about the medicare program in ge neral and assist them in making choices between traditional medicare and the new plans authorized in the act12 for variety of reasons managed car options did not increase over the next several years but broad range of effo rts to help older people better understand medicare and choose among existing options was instituted these remain today as the core components of what has become known as the national medicare education program nmep as discusse d below the nmep included the ship as well as the activities mandated by bba 97httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs7 congress established the building blocks of the nmep out of two concerns first it had heard recurring beneficiary concerns about how difficult the medicare program is to understand second it wanted to encourage expansion of medicare managed care options and recognized that many beneficiaries would need extensive information in order to elect new form of health care delivery that was different from the traditional system to which they had become accustomed bba 97 mandated specific methods to be used by hhs for the provision of beneficiary information to promote informed choice these include written materials sent nnually to beneficiaries to coincide with the open enrollment period for medicarechoice plans which provide 1 detailed description of be nefits covered under the original medicare feeforservice progra m 2 congressionallyspecified comparative information about medicarechoice plans available in beneficiarys geographic area 3 medigap policy benefits and requirements and 4 procedural beneficiary rights under traditional medicare and medicarechoice tollfree telephone number to respond to beneficiary inquiries an internet site providing info rmation on medicare plan choices and specifically on availabl medicarechoice plans and nationally coordinated educational and publicity campaign to inform beneficiaries about medi carechoice plans and how to elect them these components are now taken for gr anted as routine ways of providing consumer information about medicare and ar cited in the mma as core mechanisms for disseminating information about the privat drug plans that will become available in 2006 however when these methods were mandated by congress in 1997 hcfa now cms had to create entirely new in formation products and vehicles their evolution forms the basis for current beneficiary educational efforts written materials the medicare and you handbook was substantially revised to meet the mandate for provi sion of comprehensive yet understandable written materials the ne w version underwent extensiv testing to ensure that information was presented in language unde rstandable to consumer audience to provide comparative information on medicarechoice plans available in specific geographic areas in the fall of 1999 hhs published tailored versions of medicare and you mailed to beneficiaries living in distinct areas because this endeavor was such complete overhaul of previous materials provided to beneficiaries hhs decided to test use of these materials in five pilot states beginning in fall of 1998 before di sseminating them nationwide the pilot states were arizona florida ohio or egon and washington these states were chosen to provide mix of places with varying degrees of managed care penetration and range of beneficiary demographic char acteristics in particular arizona and florida provided an opportunity to test the spanish version of medicare and you tollfree number establishing nationwide 800 help line number presented different set of challenges related in part to limitations in the capacity of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs8 nations telecommunication infrastructure at the time several years previously ssa had introduced an 800 number that was fra ught with implement ation problems ssa underestimated the call volume it would r eceive neither the telecommunication network nor the number of service represen tatives hired to handle the calls could effectively res pond leading to an angry public outcry about service failures therefore hhs was anxious to avoid similar outcome implementation of the tollfree number was piloted in the same five states that were testing medicare and you scripts were written for service representatives to use in answering the most typically aske d questions and protoc ols were developed to identify more complicated questions that should be referred to other sources such as medicare contractors or the appropriate ship eventually 1800medicare was expa nded to achieve nationwide coverage by phasing in regions of the country on rolling basis while hhs monitored the lines capacity to handle increased call volume while access to the number was available nationwide following the five state pilot test nationwide publicity announcing the number was put on hold while state and local publicity about the help line was incrementally rolled out website in 1998 the health care fi nancing administration hcfa established new website httpwwwmedi caregov targeted to beneficiary audience its initial content included general information about the medicare program detailed informati on about benefits and covera ge under the traditional fee forservice program and comparative da ta about medicarechoice plans organized by zip code it also included compone nt that provided information about various programs designed to help older people pa for prescription drugs these included state pharmacy assistance prog rams established by some states with their own funds to help older people pay for prescripti on drugs and special assistance programs offered by individual pharmaceutical manufacturers when the website was launc hed beneficiary organizati ons voiced some of the same concerns as those being raised today in particular questi ons were raised about reliance on the internet as major vehicle for providing comparative information about medicare options because of the relativ ely low level of internet usage by older people in general and partic ularly among the oldest and the lowest income segments of the beneficiary population those concerns were somewhat offset by hcfas publication of geographically tailored versions of medicare and you which included detailed written in formation about medicarec hoice plans available in distinct areas of the country nationally coordinated educat ional and publicity campaign i n addition to mandating in bba 97 the th ree specific activitie s described above congress laid out more ge neral requirement that hhs conduct an educational and publicity campaign in the fall of each year concurrent with the medicarechoice open enrollment period th is mandate was initially implemented through the production of television and ra dio public service advertisem ents and by health fairs sponsored by hcfa regional office staff under the rubric of regional education about choices in health reach in addition the annually updated medicare and you handbook was mailed to all medicare beneficiaries in the fall of each yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs9 previously it was only sent to persons when they initially enrolled in the program or upon request national medicare education program from the start hcfa viewed the ships and all of the components estab lished in the bba 97 to be part of an overall effort which it termed the national medicare education program national organizations representing older people and persons with disabilities were solicited by hcfa to become partners in carrying out educational efforts at the state and local levels partners were gene rally organizations that had an existing relationship with beneficiaries and coul d help educate them about medi care as the partners carried out their primary roles and hcfa began scribing and budgeting for education and outreach activities

detailed ex pectations in the mma for education strategies to be adopted in the fall of 2005 and in subs equent years to help beneficiaries choose among new private drug plans the statute mandates

lowincome older people in mandating education and outreach activities to be conducted for the prescription drug discount card the mma ta kes slightly different approach from the processes laid out for the prescription dr ug plans it requires use of the 1800 medicare number to respond to inquiries and complaints about the card program but it does not specify additional vehicles that must be employed for outreach and consumer decisionmaking support instead hhs is required to broadly disseminate information to discount eligible individuals about f eatures of the card program and provide comparative informa tion about the endorsed cards to promote informed choice by beneficiaries the mma also specifies that to the extent practicable information dissemination is to be coordinated with dissemination of educational information on other medicare options13 building on its previous efforts under th nmep initially created to implement bba 97 cms has been conducting similar ac tivities

because many beneficiaries were unaware of the new benefits and th mma not only authorizes but in fact requires that we inform benefi ciaries of the new bene fits provided in the mma15 gaos legal

members of cong ress cms released examples of ways the previous administration had used this same communication method and contended that video news releases are wellestab lished and wellunderstood use of common news and pub lic affairs practice17 gaos legal opinion issued on may 19 2004 stated that the key difference between the news videos released by th previous administration and the videos addressing the new prescrip tion drug benefit was that the ones produced in 2004 did not inform viewers that the story was produ ced by the administration it concluded that the prescription drug video

communication initiatives that addressed the mma in general in late april 2004 cms began running paid tele vision radio and print ads focusing specifically on the medicare drug disc ount card program which would become operational june 1 2004 the ads urged be neficiaries to call medicares tollfree telephone line or access its web page to lear n more about the cards benefits and how to enroll in the card of their choice given the detailed amount of informati on beneficiaries need to choose card and enroll coupled with the time limitations of 30 and 60 second ads cms conveyed consistent message in these and subseque nt ads for further information the ads directed people to cmss two major information portals httpwwwmedicaregov its consumer website and its to llfree telephone line 1800medicare second set of television and radio ads was launched in late summer and early fall of 2004 using similar message with an added emphasis on savings beneficiaries could achieve by enrolling in medicare drug discount card third series of ads with the same message wa s released in october 2004 coinciding with the annual coordinated election period during which bene ficiaries could change their enrollment from the drug discount card they initially chose to different one for 2005 the ability of beneficiarie s to make that change however was not part of the publicity campaigns message given the relatively low beneficiary participation rate in the card program the message focuse d on encouraging more people to enroll medicare internet website making beneficiaries aware of the medicar drug discount card is just the first challenge in facilitating their access to pr ogram benefits the next is providing comparative information about specific drug cards to enable older people to decide which card to choose since individuals roll in specific card rather than in the program generally the 600 yearly credit to ward the purchase of prescription drugs by lowincome older people only becomes available after selecting card one of the primary vehicles cms uses to inform beneficiaries about the various medicareendorsed drug discount cards is its website targeted to beneficiaries httpwwwmedicaregov in the very s hort time frame between cms selection of drug card sponsors and the date established in the mma when program enrollment must begin cms posted on its medicaregov website details about each endorsed card prescription drug assistance program tool called the prescription drug assistance program pdap was deve loped to present information about each card sponsor the pharmacies included in its network the drugs each sponsor covers in its formulary and their prices thus wide range of information has been made available to beneficiaries to use in deciding whether to enroll in the card program and in selecting the card that best suits their needs to use the pdap be neficiaries enter their zip c odes and respond to series of questions that establish their eligibility to enroll in card and to qualify for its credit next they enter the drugs they use on re gular basis their dosage and the monthlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs13 quantity of each drug taken the search engine produces list of card sponsors that cover all of their drugs along with their prices since some beneficiaries want to ensure the pharmacy they typically use is included in card sponsors network the tool enables individuals to search for list of cards particular pharmacy accepts when the pdap was inaugurated in may 2004 it received great deal of attention in the press and among stake holder organizations some hailed the comprehensive scope of the data availa ble to help consumers make informed decisions others pointed to what they perceived as its limitations such as the level of computer skills required of users to enter the required information and to navigate the tools search functions for making comparisons among cards the speed with which cms was able to post such detailed data on each card sponsors offering had downside in some cases the pharmacies listed as part of sponsors network had moved or gone out of business having more serious effect on public confidence some drug sponsors publi cally stated that some of their posted prices were too high cms responded that some sponsors provided to cms range of prices for specific drugs and without more precise information it posted the maximum price cited by sponsors in their applications to become selected as medicareendorsed card sponsor other sponsors were not ab to submit all of their pricing information before the pdap was launched as result initial calculations of potential savings individuals might achieve by enrolling in card program were lower than expected this led cms to advise beneficiaries to wait few weeks before enrolling because it expected drug costs to drop due to both competition among sponsor s and more accurate postings of the sponsors prices within several week s the website did reflect lower costs pdap changes over the following several months cms made changes to the pdap to make it easier to use after hearing consumers comments on the difficulty of reviewing pdap search resu lts that produced detailed information on 38 national cards and often so regional ones cms created an option called price compare when selecting this option the search results displayed are limited to the five cards offering the west price for the combination of drugs used by the beneficiary cms also made it easier for consumers to enter their drug information and improved the way drug prices are displayed so users can compare prices between comparable generic nd brand name drugs cms also added information about other programs that help older people reduce their outofpocket drug costs such as state pharmaceutical assistance programs usually such programs are targeted to low and moderateinc ome persons and may consider assets when determining an applicants eligibility to help people determine if they might qualify for statespecific program the pdap can provide them with an immediate preliminary assessment of their eligibility by collecting

recent addition to the pdap ma kes several requests of beneficiaries to enter the amount they pay for each of their prescription drugs so the tool can calculate the total savings they will achieve by

of these were automatically enrolled by either their medicare advantage plan or state pharmaceutical assistance programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs21 lowincome participants who meet the eligibility criteria for the cards credit comprise 17 million of the programs enro llees as of february 2005 using data from the current population survey nd medicare administrative files cms estimated that 7 million benefici aries would meet the eligibility criteria for receiving the credit more than four times the number of lowincome persons currently enrolled in the program of the estimated number of eligible persons cms projected at the start of the program that 47 million woul d enroll these estimates do not include lowincome medicare beneficiaries also enrolled in medicaid since they are precluded from receiving discount drug car d due to their existing drug coverage the challenge of reaching persons with low incomes and motivating them to participate in the drug card program is mo re complex than outreach efforts conducted by other incometargeted programs previous education and outreach experience by itself provides complete roadmap since efforts for this program are needed to both make lowincome persons aware of its benefits and to support them in deciding among various program options identifying lowincome persons who might be eligible for various income targeted programs such as food stamps ssi and the medicare savings programs msp has been continuing struggle the substantial outreach efforts targeted toward persons potentially eligible for m sp for example have resulted in the enrollment of less than twothirds of those who could qualify and while the programs themselves can be somewhat complicated individuals choices are to enroll or not furthe r decisions are required the national medicare education programs previous experience with facilitating choice focused on helping beneficiaries decide whether to participate in the traditional feeforservice medicare program or select managed care plan in this situation beneficiaries are already rolled in health care program and while the task of choosing specific managed care plan can be mo re complicated than selecting drug discount card the implica tion of making proactive decision about health plan options is much different th beneficiary continue s to have traditional medicare coverage failing to choose di scount drug card means that lowincome beneficiary forgoes 1200 in financial ssistance two annual credits of 600 each that would have been available to meet prescription drug expenses after 10 months of implementation expe rience some consensus is emerging among researchers and beneficiary organiza tions about aspects of both the drug card programs design and the mix

functioning comprehension skills and pre existing knowledge of the subject matter the most recent available na tional data on literacy levels is from the national adult literacy survey administered in 1992 to representative sample of 13600 adults age 16 and older30 the results indicate that onethi rd of persons age 65 and over have only rudimentary skills at the lowest level measured and thus by definition have substantial difficulty with reading writing communicating comprehension and solving problems in the context of health care systems low literacy results in low health literacy defined as the ability to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make ppropriate health decisions31 one of the most frequently cited studies that measured health literacy among persons aged 65 and over was conducted of 3250 enrollees in medicare mana ged care plans located in four states overall 339 of englishspeaking re spondents and 539 of spanishspeaking respondents had inadequate or marginal functional health literacy persons aged 85 and over had even higher rates of impaired health literacy32 the study concluded that even after adju sting for years

the conclusions of some studies are strikingly applicable to the drug discount card experi ence suggesting that information overload can be dysfunctional and can frequently lead to making decision at all or it can lead to making decisions toward the mean where the inability to sort relevant information leads to discarding the outliers even the best choices34 the common theme of all of this research is to simplify available options so people will be able to make better decisions hibbard in particular has applied decisionmaking theory to the behavior of medicare beneficiaries and suggests that if beneficiaries have di fficulty understanding progra m information andor are overwhelmed their choices veral outcomes are likely some beneficiaries will simply not make choice others will make choice but take short cuts in decision making that fail to address all of the important aspects and many will make decisions in response to emo tion laden adver tising messages35 to assist beneficiaries in their decisi onmaking she proposes strategies such as breaking down the process into smaller steps formatting and highlighting key information to draw attention to important factors narrowing options and identifying those who have marginal or inadequate literacy who need oneonone help from long range policy prospective she sugg ests that the best solutions would be simplifying options by standardizing benef it designs and offering reasonable default option communication vehicles preferred by older people research on ways beneficiaries prefer to receive information about

design features of the program itself influenced benefici ary participation first the large number of cards from which beneficiaries could choose and the variation among them in drug prices nd participating pharmacies meant that one simple message could satisfy all of the information needed by beneficiaries to assess their own situation many researcher s and constituency representatives have commented that the large number of cards from which to choose meant that many beneficiaries made decision second the initial release of information about the program was confusing with inaccurate information posted on the web and long waits to talk to an operator on the 1800medicare line extensively covered by the press thes initial glitches led to the public perception that accessing the drug card program was problematic cms made major strides in overcoming these initial difficulties but the negative impressions lingered third some questions initially arose about the cards fi nancial value fueled in part by the early inaccurate web postings of prescription drug prices available through the cards within several weeks of the initial postings the prices listed for many of the cards were lowered in part due to mo re precise informati on provided to cms by the card sponsors subsequent studies have documented that the cards have provided savings on drug costs for many benefici aries according to several studies of beneficiaries opinions about the drug car d program uncertainty about the cards potential benefits was major factor in dampening program enrollment43 44 fourth drug card enrollment procedures for most of 2004 were cumbersome and may have discouraged some bene ficiaries who began the process from completing it persons seeking to both enroll in card and apply for transitional assistance needed to mail signed application to the address of their selected card sponsor and while cms did post standard ized enrollment and application forms on medicaregov some have repor ted that initially the forms were posted in location that was hard for beneficiaries to find as result they had to call the sponsors 800 telephone number to obtain applications so enrolling in card required beneficiaries to initiate several actions all points at which beneficiaries could fall out of the process based on input from beneficiary organiza tions cms has take n several steps to

evaluations of activities conducted to implement the bba 97 at recent meeting of the advisory panel on medicare education cms said it would soon make available the results of its internal research this information will add to congress knowledge of how cms evaluates its efforts and makes modifications based on its findings the experience of the discount drug car d program coupled with research on consumer decisionmaking indicates that cms current approach of using multiple communication channels is needed to re spond to differing characteristics of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32828crs27
