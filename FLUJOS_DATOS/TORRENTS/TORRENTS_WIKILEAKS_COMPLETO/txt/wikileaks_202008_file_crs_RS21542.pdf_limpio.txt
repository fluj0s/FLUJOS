division summary federally funded research and development center s ffrdcs were first established during world war ii to provide specific defense research and development rd capabilities that were not readily available within the federal government or the private sector the federal government currently operates 36 ffrdcs title iii of the department homeland secur ity dhs act pl107296 ca lls for the creation of one or more ffrdcs including homeland security institute on september 10th the dhs released sources sought notice requesting that contractors indicate their interest in competing to operate an ffrdc for dhs those responding must include 400 words or less qualifica tion statement by october 30th dhs plans to release formal request for proposal for the ffrdc be fore the end of this year in the past several years some congre ssional and noncongre ssional critics have questioned the use of ffrdcs including the continuing need fo r such centers diversification into areas beyond the centers original missions and oversight of each ffrdcs activities by its sponsoring agency this report will be updated to reflect most recent events background ffrdcs are notforprofit organizations wh ich are financed on solesource basis exclusively or substantially by an agency of the federal government which are not subject to office of personnel mana gement regulations they ope rate as private nonprofit corporations although they are subject to certain personnel and budgetary controls imposed by congress andor their sponsorin g agency each center is administered through contract with the sponsoring federa l agency by either an industrial firm university or nonprofit institution center personnel are not c onsidered federal employees but rather employees of the organization that ma nages and operates the center ffrdcs were established by the federal government during and immediately following world war ii for various reasons the federal government was not able to attract the tophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21542crs2 scientific and technological talent due to lower pay than in the private sector and slow hiring procedures necessary to meet its broad rd requirements because ffrdcs are not allowed to compete for federal or private sector contracts gove rnment officials have often asserted they are free from conflict of interest and in better position to protect classified andor pr oprietary information there are four categories of ffrdcs research laboratories rd laboratories study and analysis centers and systems engineeringsystems integration centers see table research laboratory is usually limited to basic and applied research that includes efforts directed towards the solution of specific pr oblems but short of engaging in major development related activities an rd laboratory engages in variety of research activities ranging from basic and applied research through the actual development of hardware for experimental or demonstration purposes study and analysis centers are involved in analytical activities in which ve ry little hardwarerelate d laboratory research or development is carried out these study centers were initially established to provide the office of the secretary of defense the three services and the defense advanced research projects agency with help in so lving organizational or operational problems systems

establishing ffrdcs the office of federal procurement polic ofpp letter 841 and the federal acquisition regulations far which implement the policy letter are the two primary regulatory documents that govern the establishment of an ffrdc2 the purpose of the letter was to establish govern mentwide policies for the establishment utilization and evaluation of ffrdcs in 1990 the office of federal procurement i ssued regulations to implement the policy letter 3 in general the implementation regulations state that ffrdcs should not be established unless th agency cannot accomplish the activity in house through other government agencies or through traditional pr ocurement procedures the regulation also states there should be fficient work to be performed by the ffrdc that cost controls should be established to protect the government and that the parameters of the mission of the ffrdc are spelled out clearly enough to enable the differentiation between ffrdc responsibilities and the agencys nonffrdc work4 to establish an ffrdc an agency must follow the guidelines of the ofpp according to the national science founda tion once the agency implements the ofpp guidelines the new ffrdc should have the following characteristics 1 its primaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21542crs4 5 federal funds for research and development p 8 9 6 ibid office of technology ssessment otabpiss157 p6 far

have longterm relationship with its sponsor ing agency usually 5 years with review of the centers progress conducted by the spons oring agency during the third year of the agreement 6 most or all of its facilitie s are owned by or are funded under contract with the federal government 7 it has an average annual budget operating and capital equipment of at l east 500 000 and 8 when renewing the solesource contract the sponsoring agency is required to determine if it still needs to sponsor an ffrdc or if the work could be done in federa l facility or through traditi onal private sector contract5 to minimize conflicts of interest centers are established as notforprofit entities that cannot compete with forprofit companie s for additional government contracts and are not allowed to produce and market co mmercial products as result government officials argue that ffrdcs are allowed access to key government officials and highly sensitive data from industry nd government sources such privileged access enables the centers to address complex longterm problems with high degree of objectivity based on their restrictions concerning selling products to the govern ment or joining forces with those who do while remaining outside of the government itself while centers are not forprofit entities they are allowed to charge the government fees above and beyond the cost of carrying out their responsibilities some centers charge fees to cover ordinary and necessary costs of doing business that are not otherwise reimbursable but that the government recognizes must be incurred thes fees can also be used by an ffrdc to conduct independent researc h the far acknowledges the legitimacy of such fees6 dhs ffrdcs within title iii science and tec hnology in support of homeland security of the homeland security act pl107296 there are two provisions that call for the establishment of ffrdcs section 305 of the act states that the secretary acting through the undersecretary for science and t echnology may establis h or contract with one or more ffrdcs to carry out other responsibilities of the act including the coordination and integration of the agency s extramural and intermural research programs7 section 312 directs the secretary of dhs to tablish an ffrdc known as the homeland security institute according to the legislation the institute among other things should conduct systems analysis ri sk analysis and simulation and modeling to determine vulnerability of the nations critical infrastructure8 however the legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21542crs5 8 continued development centers 9 if the dhs establishes new ffrdc rather th an utilizing an existing center the new ffrdc can officially establish itself as an independent notforprofit entity chartered in the state where it was originally established with its own board of trustees 10 department of defense federally funded research and development centers us congress office of technology assessment otabpiss157 june 1995 p 8also states that the institute shall terminate three years after the effective date of this act some have raised concerns that th is provision could make it difficult for dhs to recruit the best people for this center this legislative language provides the secretary of homeland security with the authority the agency needs to establish multiple ffrdcs as long as the department complies with ofpp letter 841 and th implementing far 350172 once these requirements have been met the dhs can velop request for proposals to establish one or more ffrdcs it should be noted that the competition in contracting act cica permits the government to use solesource procedures to establish or sustain an ffrdc proponents of this practice contend this allo ws the government to select the highest quality bid rather than the lowest cost bid that applies to traditional federal procurement actions however to help control costs congress can set ceilings on the total annual spending andor established personnel levels for the center in addition to universities and private sector firms existing ffrdcs can also compete to operate and manage dhs sponsored ffrdc if the mission of the proposed ffrdc is similar to the existing ffrdc ffrdcs operate under five year c ontract with review of the centers performance by the sponsoring agency after the third year of operation this review is to determine if the ffrdc shoul d be renewed for another 5 years recompeted as an ffrdc abolished or decertified as an ffrdc while continuing to operate as an independent nonpr ofit organization once the dhs selects the organization that will administer and operate an ffrdc the board of trustees for the ffrdc will establish operating procedures and select the director of the ffrdc9 while the sponsoring agency has some input in the selection of the centers director the boar d of trustees is ultimately responsible for selecting the director of the ffrdc the dir ector is then responsible for hiring the remainder of the centers personnel who like the director are employees of the organization that operates the ffrdc not the sponsoring federal agen cy the primary objective of this unique arrangement between the sponsoring agency and the center is to help ensure the independence of the center while concomitantly establishing longterm close partnership relationship as oppos ed to the arms length requi red with forprofit federal contracts further the personnel policie s allow the ffrdc to rapidly employ if necessary new scientific and technical expertise that are difficult to recruit sustain and manage through the federal civil service system10 potential congressional issues for many years ffrdcs have attracted the attention of congress in their early years of operation congress primary concerns regarding ffrdcs centered around the growinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21542crs6 11 us department of defense office of the in spector general

quality of products more recently congressional c oncerns have focused on the continuing need for ffrdcs diversificati on into areas beyond the centers original mission and each sponsoring agencys oversight of its ffrdcs activities public sector advocacy groups such as the professional services council psc have pointed out that the na tions scientific engineering and technological capabilities have increased dramatically since ffrdcs were first introduced in the late 1940s specifically psc contends that given that th private sector has developed significant capabilities to perform studies and analysis and systemsengineering and integration work it seems logical that this work could be performed in the private sector however proponents of ffrdcs argue that the responsibility of the proposed dhs ffrdc includes the coordination and integration of the agencys extramural and intermural research programs which they contend is ideal since ffrdcs are not allowed to compete for federal contracts and are not llowed to develop commercial products finally it is unlikely that any of the dhs ffrdcs will be performing systems integration activities with the end of the cold war and declining dod rd budgets observers in the private and public sectors are concerned that ffrdcs might have diversified into areas beyond their originally defined missions some individuals inside nd outside of congress assert that this has already happened representatives from the psc have also argued that these centers have received number of c ontracts from various federal agencies for which private service companies had originally competed however representatives from dod and doe have indicated that their resp ective ffrdcs have been asked to develop definitions of their core work for each center as result of this exercise each agency has identified work that could be competed through traditional pr ocurement process 11 some members of congress ve expressed concerns about the adequacy of the oversight of many ffrdcs in general ccounting office gao report prepared for the house appropriations subcommittee on ener gy and water gao stated that despite does many reforms our review of more than 200 audit and consulting reports issued since 1995 reveals that the department has pe rsistent management weaknesses that have led directly to wide range of performance problems including major cost overruns and schedule delays in variety of noteworthy projects12 to control cost and maintain mission focus at dods ffrdcs congress continues to mandate employee ceiling levels for each dod center while these are leg itimate congressi onal concerns it is important to note that dod and doe ffrdcs employ thousands of people and have budgets in the hundreds of millions of do llars in contrast dhs ffrdcs are likely to be smaller centers with initial employme nt levels ranging from 50100 people along with budgets ranging from 15 million to 30 million
