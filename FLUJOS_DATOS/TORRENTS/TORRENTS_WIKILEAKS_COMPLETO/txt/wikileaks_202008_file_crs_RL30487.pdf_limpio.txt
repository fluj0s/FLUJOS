technicians summary military technicians are federal civilian employees who provide support primarily to wartime deployable reserve units unlike regular civilian employees military technicians are generally required to maintain membership in the selected reserve as condition of their employment these technicians are referred to as dualstatus technicians reflecting their status as both federal civilian employees and military reservists the intent of this requirement is to guarantee that when reserve unit is mobilized the military technicians who support that unit will be mobilized as well some military technicians however are not members of the selected reserve these technicians referred to as nondualstatus technicians cannot be ordered to deploy with their unit when it is mobilized the number of nondualstatus technicians especially within the army reserve has troubled congress for many years concerned that the large proportion of non deployable technicians within the technician workforce was undermining the readiness of reserve units congress passed legislation in 1983 and in every subsequent year up through 1995 aimed at reducing or eliminating the number nondualstatus technicians these past efforts however did not produce the results congress had hoped for the mandatory retirement provisions of the national defense authorization act for fy2000 are the latest attempt by congress to ensure that the technician workforce is virtually all dual status the mandatory retirement provisions do not affect technicians in the national guard they only apply to technicians in the army reserve and the air force reserve who do not hold dual status now or who lose dual status at some time in the future there are military technicians in the naval reserve marine corps reserve or coast guard reserve under current legislation army and air force reserve technicians who do not hold dual status and who are eligible for an unreduced annuity will be required to retire if they do not hold dual status but are not yet eligible for an unreduced annuity they may be allowed to continue working until they become eligible for one at which time they will be required to retire an annuity or pension is key component of the retirement benefits of federal civilian employees an unreduced annuity is an annuity that is not subject to reduction by reason or age or years of service it is important to point out that the annuity referred to here is the one which technicians earn as federal civilian employees not the military retired pay which they may be entitled as result of their simultaneous service in the selected reserve critics of the mandatory retirement provisions claim that this policy is unfair because some technicians will suffer financially by having to retire earlier than planned these critics also argue that it will undermine military readiness by forcing experienced technicians out of their jobs they believe that the policy should be repealed or at least modified in order to minimize the negative financial impact on technicians however supporters of the provisions argue that the policy is fair to technicians as it allows them to continue working until they are eligible for normal pension they also argue that it enhances the military readiness of reserve units by ensuring that technicians can deploy with the units they supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487contents introduction 1 what is military technician 1 origin and evolution of the military technician program 3 congress and the dual status requirement past

continuedmilitary technicians the issue of mandatory retirement for nondualstatus technicians introduction the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 20001 contains policy changes affecting many us military technicians most notably provision which mandates the retirement of certain retirementeligible technicians under this legislation army and air force reserve technicians who do not hold dual status and who are eligible for an unreduced annuity will be required to retire if they do not hold dual status but are not yet eligible for an unreduce d annuity they may be allowed at the discretion of their respective service to continue working until they become eligible for one at which time they will be required to retire although congress has settled the question for now advocates for some military technicians argue that the policy should be repealed or modified this report will describe the duties of military technicians and the history of military technician programs in the national guard army reserve and air force reserve it will outline the importance of the dual status requirement in these three distinct technician programs explain the interest of congress in this requirement and recount the legislative attempts to strengthen its application finally this report will discuss the stated rationale for the recently enacted mandatory retirement provision linking it to congresss past efforts to strengthen the dual status requirement and assess the impact of this provision on military technicians what is military technician the reserve component2 rc of the united states armed forces employs small core group of full time employees to administer rc units train rc personnel and maintain rc equipment these employees are known as fulltime support fts personnel there are four distinct types of fts personnel civilian employees active duty military personnel active guard and reserve agr personnel and military technicians3 military technicians are federal civilian employees hired under statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs2 3 continued the term used in the most recent federal legislation has been military technicians and is the terminology generally used throughout this paper the term technicians however is sometimes used as an abbreviation it should be considered synonymous with the term military technicians unless stated otherwise 4 the selected reserve subelement of the ready reserve contains those units and individuals most essential to wartime missions members of the selected reserve generally perform at minimum one weekend of training each month and two weeks of training each year for which they receive pay and benefits 5 unit membership requirement for certain military technicians was enacted november 18 1997 as part of p l 10585 and is codified in title 10 us code section 10216 d similar unit membership requirements have existed for many years within the administrative agreements which govern the military technician programs in the army reserve and the air force reserve in the case of the army reserve the annual department of defense appropriations acts from fy1984 through fy1996 also contained language barring funds to certain technicians who did not hold reserve membership in the same unit which they worked for in their civilian capacity see footnote 63 for full listing of these provisions 6 they are also sometimes referred to as status quo technicians 7 nondualstatus technicians may volunteer to deploy with their units as some did during the gulf war but they are under obligation to do socontained in titles 5 and 32 us code who provide support primarily to wartime deployable units of the selected reserve4 unlike regular civilian employees however military technicians are generally required to maintain membership in the selected reserve as condition of their employment they may also be required to fulfill their reserve obligation ie drilling one weekend month and attending two weeks of annual training in the same unit they work for in their civilian capacity5 the principal intent of this policy is to guarantee that when reserve unit is mobilized the technicians who support it will be mobilized as well this ensures that the expertise and skills of the technician workforce remain available to the unit when it needs them most military technicians who hold membership in the selected reserve are referred to as dual status technicians because of their status as both civilian employees and reservists however for variety of reasons which will be discussed later not all military technicians belong to the selected reserve these technicians are referred to as nondualstatus technicians6 precisely because they are not members of the selected reserve nondualstatus technicians cannot be ordered to deploy with their unit when it is mobilized7 thus the supported unit is largely deprived of the technicians expertise and skills during its deploymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs3 8 statutes at large june 3 1916 chapter 134 section 90 9 p l 90486 82 stat 755 august 13 1968 10 the naval reserve marine corps reserve or the coast guard reserve have never had military technician programorigin and evolution of the military technician program as federal program the military technician program is over 80 years old and its history is fairly complex the following section provides brief overview of the programs origin and evolution more detailed account is contained in appendix of this report military technicians are descended from the personnel described in section 90 of the national defense act of 19168 this act authorized the use of federal funds for the compensation of competent help to take care of the material animals and equipment in national guard units subsequent legislation renamed the competent help as caretakers and clerks until 1968 these caretakers and clerks were state employees governed by state laws but paid with federal funds in 1968 however congress passed the national guard technicians act9 which converted all caretakers and clerks from state employees to federal employees and renamed them technicians the air force reserve and the army reserve established technician programs similar to the national guards in 1957 and 1960 respectively10 however unlike the national guard program which was established by federal law the reserve programs were established administratively under the broader statutory umbrella of the federal civil service as such the reserve technician programs differed substantially from the national guard program furthermore because the reserve technician programs operated under the authority of federal civil service laws the air force reserve and the army reserve needed the approval of the civil service commission now the office of personnel management before they could establish their technician programs to win this approval the air force reserve and the army reserve each had to negotiate an agreement with the civil service commission concerning employment conditions for the technicians these agreements were negotiated separately and as result the air force reserve technician program differed substantially from the army reserve technician program one of the key differences among these three military technician programs national guard air force reserve and army reserve lies in the degree to which they required their technicians to maintain dual status strict dual status provision would require military technicians to maintain membership in the selected reserve as condition of their employment usually in the same unit they work for in their civilian capacity less strict provision might make exceptions in certain cases or merely encourage dual statuswhile not requiring it httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs4 11 for comparison of dualstatus requirements of the three programs see appendix 12 p l 104106 section 513c 110 stat 306 february 10 1996 13 p l 10585 section 523 111 stat 1737 november 18 1997 the caps on the number of nondualstatus technicians which could be employed by the other reserve organizations were as follows 1500 nondualstatus technicians in the army reserve 2400 in the army national guard 450 in the air national guard and zero in the air force reserve by the end of fiscal year 1998 of the three military technician programs the army reserve had the weakest dual status requirement11 the effect of this weaker dual status requirement was to create technician program in the army reserve with relatively high number of nondualstatus technicians this eventually attracted the attention of congress which was concerned that the army reserves readiness was being degraded by the presence of so many technicians who could not be required to deploy with their units in the case of mobilization congress and the dual status requirement past legislative provisions from 1983 to 1995 congress repeatedly included provisions in defense appropriations bills aimed at reducing the numbers of nondualstatus technicians within the army reserves military technician program yet in spite of these efforts the composition of the army reserves technician workforce did not change appreciably for detailed history of these legislative efforts and their impact see appendix b as result beginning in 1995 congress began to take broader and more aggressive approach towards managing the military technician workforce in 1995 congress included provision in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 which established strict dualstatus requirement for all newly hired technicians whether in the army reserve the air force reserve or the national guard12 two years later the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 contained several provisions related to military technicians and the dual status requirement specifically it placed limit on the number of nondualstatus technicians that could be employed in each of the technician programs and required the secretary of defense to submit report to congress outlining plan for ensuring that on and after september 30 2007 all military technician positions are held only by military technicians dual status13 the clear implication of this latter provision was that congress was interested in phasing out the employment of all nondual status technicians and wanted advice from the department of defense on how to accomplish this objective the department of defense submitted report to congress in 1999 which contained plan to ensure that only dualstatus technicians held military technician positions by the end of fy2007 however the report raised number of concerns about the fairness and feasibility of doing so with respect to fairness the report predicted that meeting the 2007 deadline would require dod to involuntarily separate 2655 nondualstatus technicians many of whom would not be eligible for civilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs5 14 department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs plan for full utilization of military technicians dual status august 2 1999 pages 7 and 8 numbers are derived from the estimated reductions in force rifs required by september 30 2007 without benefit of additional retirement incentives 15 department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs plan for full utilization of military technicians dual status august 2 1999 page 3 16 similar argument has been made by some military technicians with respect to the army reserve small proportion of army reserve military technicians are assigned to non deploying headquarters units where they perform functions similar to those performed by national guard state headquarters at present 558 military technicians or 9 of the army reserves technician workforce fit this description thus they argue if the national guard has bona fide need for some nondualstatus technicians in its headquarters units so too does the army reserveservice retirement when separated14 forced reductions of this sort the dod report argued were unfair to the individual technicians nondual status military technicians were hired and are managed according to various reserve component policies nondual status military technicians had reasonable expectation that their positions carried career potential the department feels moral obligation to recognize previous commitments and reasonable individual career expectations and to avoid forced reductions to the extent practicable15 another significant point raised in the dod report dealt with the limited need for nondualstatu s technicians in the national guard national guard units usually operate under the authority of the governor of the state or territory in which they are located each state or territory maintains headquarters to oversee its units and military technicians are frequently employed in these headquarters if these technicians hold dualstatus then they could potentially be mobilized by the federal government in times of national emergency and deployed with the unit they maintain membership in this dod contended could cripple the ability of the state headquarters to carry out its own important mission the national guard the report concluded cannot operate without workforce that includes some employees who do not have to mobilize with the units they support from this perspective the national guard has bona fide need for at least some nondualstatus technicians16 congress and the dual status requirement legislative provisions in the national defense authorization act for fy2000 including the mandatory retirement provisions as result of the concerns raised by the department of defense congress substantially modified the idea of simply filling all military technician positions with dualstatus technicians by 2007 the national defense authorization act for fy2000 contains new initiative which attempts to reconcile the desire of congress to have an all dualstatus technician workforce with the issues of fairness and necessity raised by the department of defense with regards to the issue of necessityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs6 17 p l 10665 section 523 october 5 1999 this figure represents about four of the total number of technicians currently authorized for the national guard 18 the national guard was not included in this part of the act because as mentioned congress recognized that the guard had legitimate need to employ small number of non dualstatus technicians applying the mandatory retirementprompt separation provisions contained in this part of the act to nondualstatus technicians in the national guard would run counter to congresss intent of allowing the guard to employ this type of technician as permanent part of its technician workforceraised by the national guard the congressional response was fairly straightforward the act authorized the national guard to employ up to 1950 nondualstatus technicians on and after october 1 200117 reconciling congresss desire to have dualstatus technician workforce with the desire to treat nondualstatus technicians fairly howeve r was more complicated issue and the relevant legislation was therefore more complex the issue is addressed in section 522 of the national defense authorization act for fy2000 first by categorizing military technicians in the army and air force reserves only18 in two separate ways first it categorized technicians based on the date they were hired on or before or after february 10 1996 the date of enactment of the national defense authorization act for fy1996 this distinguishes between those technicians who were hired when there was an ambiguous dualstatus requirement and those who were hired after firm dualstatus requirement had been codified into law second it categorized them based on whether or not they held dualstatus on october 5 1999 the date on which the national defense authorization act for fy2000 was enacted into law this provision was principally administrative it facilitated distinguishing those technicians who would be affected immediately and those who might be affected in the future these two dividing lines produce four distinct categories of army and air force reserve military technicians 1 those who were hired on or before february 10 1996 and who held dualstatus on october 5 1999 2 those who were hired on or before february 10 1996 and who did not hold dualstatus on october 5 1999 3 those who were hired after february 10 1996 and who held dualstatus on october 5 1999 and 4 those who were hired after february 10 1996 and who did not hold dualstatus on october 5 1999 the legislative provisions contained in section 522 and description of how they impact each of these four groups are discussed below these provisions and their impact are summarized in table1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs7 19 technician could lose his or her dual status ie membership in the selected reserve in several ways including the following failure to meet military physical standards failure to be selected for promotion to the next higher military rank within the prescribed period of time or through disciplinary actions which lead to the technicians discharge from the reserves or ineligibility for reenlistment in the first two cases the technician would generally be considered to have lost dualstatus involuntarily while in the latter case the technician would be considered to have lost dualstatus voluntarily 20 for purposes of this section technician shall be considered to be eligible for an unreduced annuity if the technician is eligible for an annuity under section 8336 8412 or 8414 of title 5 that is not subject to reduction by reason of the age or years of service of the technician p l 10665 section 522a october 5 1999 title 10 us code section 10218c section 8336 of title 5 deals with immediate retirement under the civil service retirement system section 8412 of title 5 deals with immediate retirement under the federal employees retirement system section 8414 of title 5 deals with early retirement under the federal employees retirement system the practical implications of this definition of unreduced annuity on individual technicians are discussed later in the report 21 as members of the civil service technicians can earn an entitlement to an annuity either under the civil service retirement system csrs or under the federal employee retirement system fers generally federal employee must have 30 years of qualifying civil service and be 55 years of age in order to be entitled to an unreduced annuity although this is not always the case see footnote 30 for more information on this topic technicians may also be eligible for military retired pay to qualify for military retired pay they normally must have 20 years of qualifying military service the last eight of which must in the reserves and be at least 60 years of age since the end of the cold war however these requirements have been temporarily lowered to facilitate reserve force reductions 22 p l 10665 section 522a october 5 1999 title 10 us code section 10218 a3asection 522 its impact on various groups of military technicians in the army reserve and the air

is eligible for an unreduced annuity will be key factor in determining precisely how many technicians will be affected see footnote 30 for more information on this issue tom hawley professional staff member house armed services committee cites figure of 387 technicians who will be retired by april 5 2000 28 the accrual rates for each year of service under csrs are 15 for the first five years 175 for the second five years and 20 for all subsequent years this factor is then applied to the average of the employees highest three years of pay to determine the annuityfebruary 10 1996 did not hold dualstatus on october 5 1999 and were eligible for an unreduced civil service annuity on the latter date by the end of fiscal year 2005 it is estimated that an additional 779 technicians will be similarly forced to retire with further 358 retired by the end of fiscal year 2016 these are technicians who were hired on or before february 10 1996 did not hold dualstatus on october 5 1999 but were ineligible for an unreduced annuity on the latter date pursuant to the law they will be retired within six months of becoming eligible for an unreduced annuity this projection however does not account for technicians who were hired on or before february 10 1996 and held dual status on october 5 1999 but who lose their dual status at some future date according to the law these technicians will also be required to retire when they become eligible for an unreduced annuity as mentioned above those army and air force reserve technicians hired after february 10 1996 will not be allowed to stay in their positions until retirement if they lose their dualstatus however the legislation does allow them to stay in their positions for up to one year after losing dualstatus thus under this legislation there likely will be small number of nondualstatus technicians who are permitted to continue working during this one year transition period on an ongoing basis consequently the legislation permanently authorizes up to 175 nondualstatus technicians in both the army and air force reserves after october 1 2007 in order to accommodate these technicians arguments in opposition to the mandatory retirement provisions the mandatory retirement provision has been criticized by some especially by those nondualstatus technicians who will soon be forced into retirement their principal criticism is that the legislation is unfair to them as it forces them to retire and receive pension check when they would prefer to continue working and receive full paycheck the difference between civil service retirement payment and regular paycheck is substantial although it will vary from individual to individual depending on each individuals total years of service for example assume non dualstatus technician plans to retire at age 60 after 35 years of service at that time the technician would be eligible for an annuity equal to 6625 of his or her high3 average pay28 if on the other hand that same technician is required to retire at age 55 after 30 years of service the difference between pay and pension will be greater this technician will immediately be eligible to receive civil service pension check but it will equal 5625 of his or her high3 average pay thus assuming thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs12 29 note however that the difference in net income will not be as great as the difference in gross income technician who is covered by csrs has 7 of gross pay deducted from each paycheck in order to fund his or her pension that deduction is not taken out of pension payments 30 most of the technicians who will be immediat ely affected by the mandatory retirement provisions were hired prior to january 1 1984 and most of them are covered by the civil service retirement system csrs thus the example cited here is based on the parameters of csrs the age used here 55 years reflects the normal minimum retirement age of federal employees under csrs and the normal years of service 30 needed to receive an unreduced annuity title 5 us code section 8336 however if involuntarily separated federal employees covered by csrs become eligible for an unreduced annuity at age 55 with 20 years of service or age 62 with five years of service title 5 us code section 8336 d title 5 us code section 8336 f title 5 us code section 8339 h thus under this retirement authority some technicians could be forced to retire at age 55 with 20 years of service with an annuity worth 3625 of their high3 pay there has been some disagreement over whether congress intended this involuntary separation retirement authority to apply to nondualstatus technicians however ted newland from the retirement policy division of the office of personnel management recently stated that he met with staff of the house armed service and government reform committees and provided technical assistance in drafting the bill not only are the above criteria the retirement ageyears of service combinations consiste nt with the plain wording of the statute they are consistent with the intentions expressed in those discussions while most of the technicians who will be immediately affected by the mandatory retirement provisions are covered by csrs small number are covered by the federal employees retirement system fers rules for retirement due to retirement system conversions or as result of federal civil service credit for past military service under fers employees are eligible for an unreduced annuity at age 50 with 20 years of service at age 62 with five years of service or at any age with 25 years of service title 5 us code section 8414 b the accrual rates under fers are 1 per year of service the resultant factor is then applied to the employees high3 pay to determine the value of the annuityindividual does not find alternate employment between the age of 55 and 60 the technicians gross income will be reduced by 4375 full paycheck minus pension check and after age 60 the technicians gross income will be 15 lower than anticipated an annuity of 5625 of pay is worth 15 less than an annuity of 662529 thus assuming that they had desire to continue working the technician s who are retired under this provision could experience significant reduction in income from the federal government these retired technicians are free to seek employment in the private sector and the combination of their private sector earnings with their civil service pension could result in their earning higher income than before however as these technicians will all be at least 55 years of age at the time they retire opponents of the mandatory retirement provisions argue that they may have difficult time securing employment in the private sector30 to remedy this situation some propose repealing the mandatory retirement provisions altogether allowing nonduals tatus technicians to continue working indefinitely as long as they can fulfill the civilian functions of their job others propose modifying the mandatory retirement provision so that it will not apply untilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs13 31 as pointed out in footnote 21 technicians can qualify for two distinct types of retirement pay civil service pension and military retired pay note however that technicians do not automatically qualify for military retired pay to be eligible technician must have completed at least twenty qualifying years of military service either on active duty or as member of the selected reserve precisely because nondualstatus technicians lost their membership in the selected reserve at some point in their career there is good reason to believe that some of them are not eligible for military retired pay 32 john esposito president local 1900 american federation of government employees the technician reaches age 60 the age at which many of these technicians will be eligible to receive their military retirement check for their years of reserve duty31 opponents of the mandatory retirement provisions reject the notion that non dualstatus technicians undermine the readiness of reserve units they argue that such relationship has never been conclusively demonstrated32 on the contrary they argue that military technicians whether dualstatus or not contribute substantially to the readiness of reserve units from this perspective requiring some of the most experienced technicians to retire will hurt the readiness of reserve units rather than enhancing it arguments in support of the mandatory retirement provisions supporters of the mandatory retirement provisions reject the notion that mandatory retirement will undermine readiness in fact their principal argument is that it will enhance the readiness of the reserve units especially those within the army reserve which has the highest proportion of nondual status technicians nondual status technicians they argue may do excellent work in their civilian capacity but they cannot fulfill all the duties of their jobs unless they can be mobilized and deployed with their units this inability to deploy creates situation where some of the key fulltime personn of unit the nondualstatus technicians will remain at their homestation while the less experienced parttime personnel traditional reservists deploy to the theater of operations this they argue deprives the unit of key personnel precisely when they are needed most and thereby degrades the efficiency and effectiveness of the unit the way to remedy it is to replace nondualstatus technicians with dualstatus technicians who will be able to deploy with their units in the event of mobilization while conceding that nondualstatus technicians might not like the mandatory retirement provisions supporters of the provisions argue that the provisions are fair recognizing that there was clear dual status policy prior to february 10 1996 the provisions allow the department of defense to continue employing technicians who were hired before that date until they are eligible for an unreduced civil service pension regardless of whether or not they hold dualstatus allowing these technicians to continue working until eligible for an unreduced pension it is argued is fair way to reconcile the legitimate needs of the military with the legitimate career expectations of the technicians and in any case it is solution that is far preferablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs14 33 source colonel richard krimmer department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs 34 rise in the proportion of nondualstatus technicians within the air force reserve would be particularly troubling from the perspective of readiness given that the air force reserve routinely uses its technicians to fill critical positions like air commander base commander pilot and navigator according to colonel richard krimmer department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs the air force is unlikely to use the authority granted by congress to keep nondualstatus technicians in their positions until eligible for retirement rather it will almost certainly continue to enforce its dualstatus requirement and separate those technicians who lose their reserve membership this could trigger complaints of unfairness howeverto the reductionsinforce that would have occurred under the original plan to eliminate all nondualstatus technicians by 2007 other considerations the debate over the mandatory retirement provisions has generally been framed within the context of whether or not they strike an appropriate balance between military readiness and fairness to technicians supporters of the provisions say that they do strike the proper balance opponents say that they do not however another perspective deserves mention namely some may question whether the mandatory retirement provisions are unduly generous to technicians and as result undermine the readiness of reserve units if one accepts the argument that employment of non dualstatus technicians in the technician workforce works to the detriment of the readiness of reserve units then there are aspects of the mandatory retirement provisions which may be troubling from military readiness perspective specifically the existing provisions allow for the continued employment of any military technicians in the army and air force reserve who have lost their dual status or who lose it in the future provided they were hired on or before february 10 1996 at present 72 of all army reserve technicians and 99 of all air force reserve technicians were hired on or before february 10 199633 thus large number of technicians are potentially eligible to continue employment in their positions as nondualstatus technicians while there are substantial drawbacks associated with this position status such as ineligibility for promotion or transfer they may be tolerable especially for technicians who are happy in the position they currently occupy who have already reached the top of their promotion ladder or who are less employable in the private sector in light of this it is conceivable that significant number of technicians will choose to drop their reserve membership or will fail to maintain the standards necessary to maintain reserve membership with the understanding that they will be protected from separation until they are eligible for retirement such phenomenon could be particularly acute in the air force reserve which has historically imposed fairly strict dualstatus requirement on its technicians and which might see that policy undercut by provision which appears to guarantee full career to all technicians hired before february 10 1996 whether they hold dual status or not34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs15 35 department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs plan for full utilization of military technicians dual status august 2 1999when considering this possibility it is important to note that the legislation does not require the department of defense to allow nondualstatus technicians to continue in their technician positions until they qualify for retirement the legislation only permits this to happen by allowing dod to employ these technicians until 30 days after they become retirementeligible however given that the legislation was written in response to concerns raised by dod about fairness to the career expectations of technicians it seems likely that the department will use this continuation authority liberally to do otherwise would allow certain nondualstatus technicians to continue on until retirement while forcing others out without that benefit this would inevitably reopen the whole issue of fairness that dod was so concerned about in its 1999 report to congress35 the ongoing debate although congress established clear policy in 1999 when it enacted the mandatory retirement provisions for nondualstatus technicians in the army and air force reserve some technicians and their advocates are currently lobbying to have that policy repealed or modified repeal of the mandatory retirement provisions would return the situation to the status quo nondualstatus technicians hired before february 10 1996 when the dualstatus requirement was fixed in law would be allowed to continue their careers in the same manner as dual status technicians retiring only when they chose to do so under such policy nondualstatus technicians would be phased out of the technician workforce much more slowly than they will be under the current mandatory retirement provisions another proposal currently being advanced by some is to modify the mandatory retirement provisions so that nondualstatus technicians will not be forced to retire before the age of 60 if enacted such change would allow the affected technicians to continue working for up to five years longer extending the period in which they earn full paycheck and increasing the size of their retirement annuity additionally at age 60 many technicians become eligible for the military retired pay they have earned as members of the selected reserve thus under this proposal the difference in income between regular pay and retirement pay would be decreased for most affected technicians however if such policy change were enacted nondualstatus technicians would be phased out of the technician workforce more slowly than they will be under the current mandatory retirement provisions but more quickly than they would be if the mandatory retirement provisions were repealed this latter proposal appears to be gaining support in congress on march 2 2000 the chairman and ranking member of the military personnel subcommittee of the house armed service committee sent letter to the secretary of defense stating that we have become aware of the need to revise certain portions of section 10218 of title 10 usc to permit the mandatory separation to take place at age 60 instead of age 55 we are working to make this change part of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 the letter also indicated that the

descended from the personnel described in section 90 of the national defense act of 191636 this act which dramatically reshaped the relationship between the state militias and the federal army authorized the use of federal funds for the compensation of competent helpto take care of the material animals and equipment in those organized militia units known as the national guard37 in subsequent legislation the phrase competent helpwas replaced with caretakers and clerks from the programs inception in 1916 the personnel employed under this legislative authority remained state employees although they were paid with federal funds however this changed in 1968 when congress passed the national guard technicians act38 this act converted all of the national guards caretakers and clerks from state employees paid with federal funds to federal employees subject to certain measure of state control and administration it also renamed them technicians for many years the military technician program existed only within the national guard however in the late 1950s both the air force reserve and the army reserve decided to establish their own military technician programs39 unlike the national guard program which was established by independent statutory provisions the reserve programs were established administratively under the broader statutory umbrella of the federal civil service the air force reserve formally established its technician program in 1957 by successfully negotiating an agreement with the civil service commission later the office of personnel management the army reserve also wanted to establish technician program in the late 1950s but the civil service commission decided to postpone approval for such program until it had chance to assess the air force reserves program the air force reserves technician program was novel modification of traditional civil service rules and the civil service commission was reluctant to expand the program until its impact on federal employees the technicians could be assessed in 1960 the civil service commission rendered fairly negative assessment of the air force reserves technician program in the eyes of

however the difficulties that have been encountered have been sufficiently serious to cause misgivings about the wisdom of entering upon another similar programthere have been complaints about inappropriate imposition of military discipline on civilians in such matters as standing at attention saluting and wearing uniforms nonreservists have complained that their jobs have been abolished only to reappear with an art incumbent we have had allegations that civilians who joined the air reserve to qualify for technician job were later refused the job but not released from the reserves the failure to indoctrinate appointing officials with the true nature of the program and their responsibilities to it is indicated when an officer informed one of our regional directors that he would disregard civil service rules and the air force agreement whenever it suited his purposes to do so40 despite these problems the civil service commission agreed to approve an army reserve technician program in 1960 however the commission insisted that the program be designed in such way as to minimize or eliminate the type of problems associated with the air force reserve program the memorandum of understanding mou reached between the civil service commission and the department of the army was drafted with this goal in mind41 as such the agreement which governed the army reserves technician program at its inception differed substantially from that of the air force reserve furthermore in certain respects the provisions of both reserve technician programs differed from those of the national guard one of the key areas of difference among the three military technician programs national guard air force reserve and army reserve was in the stringency of the dual status requirement

authorize the use of civilian employees whenever it shall be found impracticable to secure the necessary competent enlisted caretakers43 similarly broad exceptions were contained in later versions of the statute despite these broad exceptions the national guard managed the technician program in such way that its technician workfor ce was almost exclusively dual status in 1968 congress estimated that 95 of national guard technicians held dual status44 in that same year congress passed the national guard technicians act45 which converted national guard technicians from state to federal employees the act also stipulated that every technician working for the national guard would simultaneously be member of the national guard except as specifically prescribed by the secretary of the army or air force46 in 1997 the language allowing the service secretaries to make exceptions to the dual status requirement was deleted47 as result of this fairly strict dual status requirement the

hired none was hired continuedtechnician workforce in the national guard48 the department of defense recently reported that 95 of national guard technicians held dual status at the end of fiscal year 1998 this figure represents the average of the figures for army national guard technicians 91 of whom hold dual status and air national guard technicians 99 of whom hold dualstatus49 dual status provisions in the air force reserves technician program the memorandum of agreement moa reached by the air force reserve and the civil service commission in 1957 contained fairly strict dual status requirement it stipulated that for all art air reserve technician positions there will be an established requirement that persons appointed to these positions must be eligible for and willing to accept active membership in the reserve unit in which they would be employed50 it further stated that employees who develop physical disabilities or conditions which do not permit continued reserve membership may not continue indefinitely in the art category51 subsequent versions of this agreement have included similarly strong dual status requirement52 depending on the importance of the position they occupied technicians who lost their dual status were either subject to separation from their technician position or allowed to continue in their technician position only until they could be placed in nontechnician position of similar or higher grade as result of this fairly strict dual status requirement the air force reserves technician workforce has been almost entirely dual status the air force reserve has allowed some technicians to continue working in their civilian capacity if they lost their dual status through fault of their own yet the number of technicians treated in this way is quite small in fiscal year 1998 only one percent of the technicians in the air force reserve could be described as nondualstatus53 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs21 53 continued as nondualstatus technician yet the fact remains that these status quo technicians do not now hold dual status thus they can accurately be referred to as nondualstatus technicians as the term is used in

status requirement contained in the agreement governing the air force reserves program the 1960 memorandum of understanding mou governing the army reserves program had more flexible provision for example while the air force reserve program required technicians to be members of the air force reserve when hired this was not an absolute requirement in the army reserve program according to the armys mou certain circumstances such as tight labor market might make the use of dual status technicians impractical in such cases any available qualified civilians including women will be employed through usual civil service procedures54 thus under this program individuals who were eligible for membership in the army reserve were the primary recruitment source for military technicians individuals not eligible for reserve membership constituted secondary recruitment source when reservists were not available55 another difference between the army and air force reserve programs was the way in which the programs treated technicians who lost their military membership under the air force rules technicians who lost their military status for any reason were normally separated from the program under the army rules technicians who lost their military status voluntarily could be separated from the program although this was not mandated more importantly technicians who lost their military status involuntarily for example by sustaining an injury that precluded meeting the physical standards of the military could not be separated from the program56 in 1970 the army reserve renegotiated its mou with the civil service commission and incorporated somewhat stricter dualstatus requirement57 the new agreement stated that membership in an active army reserve unit or eligibility and willingness to join the reserve shall be requirement to secure permanent appointment to position as technician there were still some exceptions to this policy but it was certainly stronger dual status provision than had previously been the case this provision however only applied to the technician at the time of initial appointment it did not constitute an ongoing requirement

congress has repeatedly passed legislation concerning the dual status requirement for military technicians often this legislation has been directed exclusively towards technicians in the army reserve reflecting special congressional concern with the manner in which the army reserve was managing its technician workforce in recent years however congresss approach to the issue has been more general in scope although the army reserves technician program has remained the principal concern when congress passed the national guard technicians act in 196860 it contained fairly strict dual status requirement for national guard military technicians however this act did not apply to the army reserve or the air force reserve these two reserve branches had set their own dual status policies for many years and congress took action to change that in 1968 this changed however in 1983 concerned about the growing proportion of nondualstatus technicians in the army reserve congress included provision in the department of defense appropriation act for fiscal year 1984 which addressed the dual status requirement for army reserve technicians the report which accompanied the bill in the house criticized the proportion of nondualstatus technicians referred to as status quo technicians within the army reserve in the following terms the department of the army estimates that approximatel 50 of the united states army reserve technicians are either status quo technicians or military technicians assigned to units other than the one in which they are employed as civilian the committee believes this situation is detrimental to mobilization readiness and unit cohesiveness61 to correct this the final version of the defense appropriation bill included language which prohibited the expenditure of funds to pay for any army reserve technician initially hired after the date of enactment of the actunless such individual is also military member of the army reserve troop program unit that he or she is employed to support62 virtually identical language was included in every subsequent dodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs24 62 continued areas other than army reserve troop program

fiscal year 199563 on its face this recurring provision would seem to preclude paying the salary of any technician whose initial date of hiring occurred after december 8 1983 the enactment date of the dod appropriations act for fy1984 and who did not hold or who failed to maintain dual status indeed the army reserve interpreted the appropriations language in just this way for many years nonetheless due to lack of coordination within the army reserves military technician program this requirement was not always implemented in some cases the employment contracts of technicians hired after december 8 1983 did not include clause specifying the technicians obligation to hold dualstatus64 more problematically in 1995 the army reserve substantially modified its interpretation of the appropriations language this revised interpretation was spelled out in 1995 memorandum we have reexamined the status of the involuntary removal policies as they affect dual status mt military technician personnel we have concluded based on the current legal interpretations the rules of post fiscal year 1983 fy1983 dual status alignments only apply to the initial fy of mt employment subsequent to the initial year

involuntarily separated from their selected reserve troop program unit without concurrent loss of mt civilian employment65 as result of this interpretation the impact of the appropriations language on the army reserves technician workforce was minimized newly hired technicians were now only required to hold dualstatus until the end of the fiscal year in which they were hired at the end of that

membership in the selected reservewas not due to the failure to meet military standards these nondualstatus technicians could continue to receive compensation for up to six monthsretain their civilian jobs moreover all the technicians hired since december 8 1983 now fell under this new policy as well they too could lose their dual status and retain their civilian job provided that their loss of dualstatus was not voluntary act66 congress moved quickly to close this loophole the funding ban provision in the dod appropriations act for fiscal year 1996 was nearly identical to those passed in previous years but an extra clause was added to the provision which extended the ban indefinitely67 by doing so the legal justification for interpreting the appropriations language as one year only dualstatus requirement was eliminated nonetheless this correction was not retroactive it only applied to technicians hired in fiscal year 1996 or later thus those army reserve technicians who were hired between fy1984 and fy1995 were longer bound by strict dualstatus requirement rather they were only bound by the less stringent dualstatus requirement found in the 1970 mou several months later congress reinforced the appropriations language with similar provision in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 the secretary of defense shall require the secretary of the army and the secretary of the air force to establish as condition of employment for each individual who is hired after the date of the enactment of this section february 10 1996 as military technician that the individual maintain membership in the selected reserve so as to be socalled dualstatus technician department of defense funds may be spent for compensation for any military technician hired after the date of enactment of this section who is not member of the selected reserve68 although this languag closely resembled that found in the earlier dod appropriations act it was broader in scope for it applied not only to the army reserve but to the national guard and air force reserve as well in spite of these legislative provisions the number of nondualstatus technicians in the army reserve continued to grow in june of 1996 there were 785 nondual status technicians in the army reserve fifteen months later that number had doubledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs26 69 source colonel richard krimmer department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs 70 the way in which the military promotion system operates is especially relevant here the military promotion system has an up or outstructure failure to be promoted to the next higher level within specified time period can result in separation from the military moreover as one advances through the ranks chances for promotion decrease as there are fewer authorized positions for the higher ranks thus after twenty or more years of service military technician might very well be passed over for military promotion and later separated from the selected reserve despite generally strong performance record 71 the house national security committee explained its rationale for the military technician provisions contained in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 in the following terms the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 public law 104106 established hiring restrictions that were designed in part to reduce the numbers of military technicians who never were members of the selected reserve or for one reason or another after being hired subsequently became disqualified from selected reserve membershipthe committee is disturbed to learn that contrary to the reductions in nondual status technicians contemplated by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996the number of nondual status technicians in the army reserve has grown from almost 800 in fiscal year 1996 to nearly 1300 in fiscal year 1997 house report 105132 report to accompany h r 1119 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 359 the figure cited in the report of 1300 in fiscal year 1997 is significantly lower than the figure cited above of 1582 the discrepancy can be attributed to fact that the former number comes from house report issued on june 16 1997 and reflects the figures available at that time while the latter number reflects the situation on september 30 1997 72 p l 10585 section 523 111 stat 1737 november 18 1997 the law also placed caps on the number of nondualstatus technicians which could be employed by the other reserve organizations more that 450 nondualstatus technicians in the air national guard 2400 in the army national guard and zero in the air force reserve by the end of fiscal year 1998to 158269 in large part this phenomenon was attributable to demographic imbalance within the army reserves technician workforce many of the technicians had been hired in the 1960s and 1970s and as they grew older more and more were unable to maintain their military status due to physical or other reasons70 realizing that its previous legislative actions were not having their intended effect congress returned to the issue in 199771 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 contained several provisions related to military technicians and the dual status requirement specifically it placed limit on the number of nondualstatus technicians that could be employed in each of the technician programs capping the number in the army reserve at 1500 by the end of the fiscal year and required the secretary of defense to submit report to congress outlining plan for ensuring that on and after september 30 2007 all military technician positions are held only by military technicians dual status72 the clear implication of this latter provision was that congress was seriously considerin g the abolition of all nondualstatus technicians and wanted advice from the department of defense on how to accomplish this objective the department of defense did submit report to congress in 1999 which contained plan to ensure that only dualstatus technicians held military technician positions by the end of fy2007 however the report also raised number of concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30487crs27 73 department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs plan for full utilization of military technicians dual status august 2 1999 pages 7 and 8 numbers are derived from the estimated reductions in force rifs required by september 30 2007 without benefit of additional retirement incentivesabout the fairness and feasibility of doing so with respect to fairness the report predicted that meeting the 2007 deadline would require dod to involuntarily separate 2655 nondualstatus technicians many of whom would not be eligible for civil service retirement when separated73 forced reductions of this sort the dod report argued were unfair to the individual technicians nondual status military technicia ns were hired and are managed according to various reserve component policies nondual status military technicians had reasonable expectation that their positions carried career potential the department feels moral obligation to recognize previous commitments and reasonable individual career expectations and to avoid forced reductions to the extent practicable another significant point raised in the dod report dealt with the limited need for nondualstatus technicians in the national guard national guard units usually operate under the authority of the governor of the state or territory they are located in each state or territory maintains headquarters to oversee its units and military technicians frequently are employed in these headquarters if these technicians are dualstatus then they could be mobilized by the federal government in times of national emergency and deployed with the unit they maintain membership in this dod contended could cripple the ability of the state headquarters to carry out its own important mission the national guard the report concluded cannot operate without workforce that includes some employees who do not have to mobilize with the units they support from this perspective the national guard has an ongoing need for at least some nondualstatus technicians
