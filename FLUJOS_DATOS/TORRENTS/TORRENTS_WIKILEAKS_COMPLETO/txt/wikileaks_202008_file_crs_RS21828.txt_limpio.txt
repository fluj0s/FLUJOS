division and will be updated as events warrant introduction economists generally agree that while capital markets are not perfectly integrated internationally they are far more integrated than was true only 20 years ago1 this integration has created pressures for enhancing transparency in the capital markets and for curtailing risks of contagion2 several supranational organizations are addressing these pressures some specifically with respect to insurance new international accounting standards may import new definitions of insurance and new transparency standards for reinsurers may help buyers shop for risk financing at the same time many other developed countries are synthesizing their supervision of financial services while in the united states insurance regulation remains fragmented these trends will likely affect the 1 crs report rl30514 global capital market integration implications for us economic performance by craig k elwell 2 ibid crs report rl32354 european

has determined to create principlesbased accounting for insurance contracts in two stages phase i was released on march 31 2004 as international financial reporting standard 4 ifrs 44 it is scheduled to become effective in the european union eu on january 1 2005 european insurers have objected to phase i because among other things it would require them to measure derivatives at fair or market value and to show their annual gains and losses on them derivatives do not appear on european balance sheets currently as they have little or initial cost us insurers that are publicly traded already measure their derivatives at fair value5 us insurers objected to several other aspects of ifrs 46 phase ii has just begun and will likely be implemented in 20087 the us standard setter the financial accounting standards board fasb has agreed to work with iasb in converging international and us accounting standards8 the national httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21828 association of insurance commissioners naic has decided to work closely with the iasb to incorporate its regulatory perspectives into development of phase ii9 several issues will have significant effect on the capital positions of us insurers one will be whether and how to measure insurance liabilities at fair value another will be whether and how to unbundle various kinds of insurance contracts insurers are also concerned about how the iasb will treat reserves for losses and expected investment income and premium on longterm contracts among other issues they fear that the phase ii rules will lead to greater volatility in their public disclosures and thus affect their capital positions and the markets perception of their capital positions unfairly and 3 further information and background on the board and its activities

september 2002 the financial stability forum fsf15 said that though the reinsurance industry had performed well fsf members were concerned about the opaqueness of the reinsurance market and of individual reinsurers disclosures it charged the international association of insurance supervisors iais with producing data on the market and with enhancing reinsurers disclosures qualitatively and quantitatively16 the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21828 iaiss task force known as task force re submitted its report to the fsf in march 200417 it described how data on the international reinsurance

in october 2003 the iais adopted new standard on supervising reinsurers21 the standard addresses reinsurers risk management relations with its ceding insurers investments and liquidity economic capital requirements and corporate governance it also imposes on the home supervisor of an internationally active reinsurer the obligation to share information about that reinsurer with other host supervisors it expressly contemplates global supervisory framework based on system of accreditation of home supervisorsand this standard22 though iais has begun survey of its members supervision of reinsurers it has not fixed timetable for creating global regulatory regime for reinsurers23 regulatory modernization in other countries some developed nations have unified their own supervisory regimes for financial services comprehensive regulatory reform of financial services began in australia in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21828 1996 since then the uk germany and japan have also unified their national supervisory regimes for all financial services sectors each country has taken slightly different approach australia formed one agency to craft and administer consistent and comparable disclosure requirements for broad range of products including deposit accounts securities insurance products and pensions it formed another agency to perform prudential supervision for bank and nonbank financial intermediaries germany unified financial supervision of banks securities and insurance into one regulatory agency to achieve consistent supervision of different sectors and of crosssectoral issues japans new financial services agency which reports directly to the prime ministers office supervises banks private insurers securities and securities markets24 perhaps of greatest interest because it is most accessible is the uks undertaking to unify its supervision of financial services the unification process began in 1997 and the new financial services authority fsa acquired its full powers in 2001 it now regulates banking insurance pensions and securities though the process of integrating those functions continues25 the fsas enabling legislation gave it four 19 ibid

adverse effects on competition and promote competition among regulated entities27 according to the fsa the insurance sector is key part of the uk financial services industry it is important both from an economic and social perspective that the uk has httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21828 an insurance market that operates effectively and remains competitive in european and world markets28 according to the fsa its creation as single regulator highlighted differences between the regulation of insurance and other sectors in respect of similar types of risks29 accordingly it has undertaken major overhaul of insurance regulation to strengthen it and to establish common riskbased approach to regulation across all financial sectors30 in revising its insurance regulation the fsa has cooperated closely with and contributed to both the formulation of eu directives on insurance and reinsurance as well as iais standards the eus financial services action plan fsap due to be completed next year contains directives that will directly affect the relative competitive positions of us and uk insurers including lloyds31 in addition the european commission ec has proposed directive on reinsurance that would allow reinsurer domiciled and licensed in an eu country under the new standards to do business throughout the eu 25 continued httpwwwfsagovukpubsannualar02_03ar02_03summarypdf visited april 25 2004 26

united states32 unified supervision of financial services may not be successful certainly neither australias nor the uks financial supervisory authority has been free from failures the efforts are noteworthy however for two reasons one is that their changes may like the proposed eu directive on reinsurance directly affect the competitive positions of us insurers and reinsurers the other is their express emphasis on maintaining the competitiveness of their domestic insurers in worldwide market33 conclusion representative oxley chairman of the house financial service committee has outlined roadmap to insurance regulatory reform he and representative baker chairman of the subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored entities have proposed achieving uniformity in some aspects of statebased insurance regulation by imposing federal standards but not federal regulation34 chairman httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21828 oxley in expressing his support for such reforms said that insurers are facing increasing competition from other financial services sectors which have significantly lower regulatory costs if insurers cannot raise new capital this marketplace is at risk for major collapse without change consumers face world with fewer options less competition and less coverage35 at the subcommittees hearing on march 31 2004 representative kanjorski expressed support for those goals and initial doubt about whether the proposal as outlined could achieve them senator hollings ranking member of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation has introduced s 1373 the insurance consumer protection act to mandate federal regulation of insurance as congress continues its efforts to modernize insurance regulation entities in other countries are taking steps that will affect the competitive positions of us insurers the naic is working closely with congress to assist in its efforts it is also working closely with international entities particularly the iais to develop new international standards for insurance regulation it remains to be seen whether or how all these efforts will coordinate for the benefit of the united states as whole 32 commission of the european communities proposal for directive of the european parliament and of the council sec2004443 april 21 2004 available at
