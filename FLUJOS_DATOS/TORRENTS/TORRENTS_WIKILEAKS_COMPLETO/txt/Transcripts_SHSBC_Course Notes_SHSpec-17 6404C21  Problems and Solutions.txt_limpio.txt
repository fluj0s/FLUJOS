6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions there are some research maxims standing apart from and monitoring the body of scientology having to do with how you figure it out excalibur was whole bookfull some of these maxims are in dianetics the evolution of science these maxims give the rationale and the how of how you figure it out every once in awhile one of them gives you grip on existence for instance one maxim was take body of knowledge that has produced bad effects and results you move it out and pay further attention to it you can eventually corral the truth by elimination by this approach you use this all the time when analyzing cases you see what didnt work so you dont run the pc on that the reverse maxim doesnt happen to be workable something having been true in one instance doesnt prove that it has any wide workability auditors who dont realize this get stuck in win with some offbeat process or approach and wind up with failures in trying to pilot way through the goals plot when items read one day and not the next when they checked out and then turned out to be something else lrh had datum to cover the situation problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions it is the number of solutions not their complexity that determines the complexity of problem this defeats the idea of the one shot clear beautiful though the dream may be the problem of government must be terribly complex since it has had many many solutions it is not that big solution equals big problem it is that complex problem equals many solutions this could be the situation that you are faced with when pc doesnt respond well to processing it could be that you have complex case on your hands that will only be resolved by complexity of processes if persons problem in life has required many solutions then it must be very complex and will require complexity of processes to resolve simple solutions dont work on complex problems you dont resolve all political problems by voting democratic there is another maxim solution must be as complex as the potentials of the problem in this context potentials means threats along the dynamics here you are talking about dangerous problem for instance problem that has the potential of knocking out survival along various fronts is big problem you will get defeated if you offer simple solution if person has dangerous problem and you give him simple solution he will reject it problems that are simple dont become dangerous only complex ones do they require complex solutions if this were not the case the person would have solved the problem already problem wouldnt be dangerous if the problem hadnt been allowed to coast along pretty far the proper course of action in handling problem is to find out all aspects of the problem that must be solved there are bound to be some that are not apparent at first find how many solutions will be needed you could look it over by dynamics the procedure is 1 get what the immediate pressure is indicate that there has to be solution 2 get the situation differentiated out into its component problems indicate the necessity for solution for each this takes the confusion out of the situation just getting the guy to sort it out makes him feel better because he can now at least see the area better also you have put the buffer of needed solution in front of every element of it the pc will be half way handled just by that action then you can find solutions on gradient he could start gradiently to see which problem could be solved now this makes level 0 breeze when it is usually rough level 0 is rough because most peoples problems are so big that they dont know they have them they dont look at the importances in their vicinity at all man is in this condition because solutions have been possible simple solutions to complex problems fail the international city idea is good and complicated it has to be because of the size of the problem that it is trying to solve the usual solution vote republican is utterly useless as you go up the levels it may appear that you are confronting more complex problems but actually both problems and solutions become simpler as you go up the levels as you go up you are actually confronted with fewer problems and fewer demanded solutions the psychologist and psychiatrist think that you go down through mans psyche to the bottom they are wrong you are there you have to go up to heightened awareness person on his way up has to get more and aware of kinds of awareness and of existence his only route is up psychiatrists think that you have to go down in mans psyche to get to rockbottom motivations etc through three or four subvolitional layers this is untrue you dont go down in mans psyche you are there there isnt any hidden deep motivation all you have left is the individual and he is motivated you have to go to higher levels this fellow hasnt got an unconscious to be probed he is unconscious the psychiatrists are looking for the wrong thing they are looking for the hidden depths below guys level of awareness those deeper levels of unconsciousness that they are looking for are sitting in the chair right in front of them it is not the recesses that are hidden you cant get the individual further down with drugs etc and learn anything in order to discover anything about the individual youve got to make the individual more aware not make him less aware in order to find out more about him psychiatrists are asking the fireman in ship to help them find the fireman and the fireman having lost his identity and beingness will willingly try to help out by looking for himself you are looking for mans spirit but he is the spirit thetans increasing awareness of his beingness his awareness of existence and the problems and solutions of life are what delineate the seven levels of processing you could draw up the levels just by asking people at various levels what is problem to you if persons awareness of his relationship to existence is increased you can bring about heightened condition of livingness performance ability etc and that is the only way to do it regardless of claims for drug enlightenment or high performance on drugs drugs reduce awareness people can think that they perform better when drunk or drugged that is because they are less aware of their condition the logic that if we became little less conscious we would be lot better off has been extant since the beginning of this universe the final solution to problems has been to become unaware of them the penultimate solution is im doing right the assumption that whatever you are doing is right so if someone wants to improve himself he has two courses 1 to become more aware 2 to become less aware and hope that you dont get run over the latter is treacherous it is hoping that everything will be all right hope substitutes for control confront awareness and certainty ill just forget about it and hope that it doesnt bother ill become less aware is the idea for instance women in the 19th century fainted as solution this is like the black panther mechanism only worse because one is not simply ignoring the black panther one is becoming unaware people get somewhat terrified when you reverse the flow on them and get them to confront all the things of which they have become unaware the trick of becoming unaware is that you never actually get there this universe is progress towards less and less awareness its the route to total sleep and the trick is that its so rigged that you never get to sleep the lower you go the more problems youve got because now the littler problems seem bigger becoming unaware of the big problem brought the thetan less power or force it reduced his confront so now he is less able to confront little problems so the little problem now seems as big as the big problem seemed one stage back it seems far more threatening the power and threat of the big problem is vested now in the smaller one there was bigger problem of the same gradient that he had ceased to confront say gale he became unaware of it almost purposely and this put him into confront only of slight wind but the big problem was full of terror so the breeze is full of terror there is the trick of uncovering hidden memories occasionally you can uncover memory by trickery and increase the pcs awareness slightly and he will lose little fear but it doesnt improve his condition much he just shifts to another fear symptom substitution all little fears are irrational and are based on bigger fear freud pointed this out this happens because the individual solves the bigger fear by becoming less aware you can find the bigger fear that caused the lesser fear this is what freud was looking for but you can also throw the pc into the bigger fear and knock him for loop by not bailing him out you mustnt increase persons awareness beyond his ability to confront he has the choice either to cognite or to bolt he is very likely to bolt that is why analysands commit suicide in analysis when they do dont process by reaching into the deeper states to find the fears that motivate this individual there is deeper subconscious for the individual to go into if you exteriorize person without taking off the charge of why he was in his head if you take him out of his head and make him confront problems that he had gone into his head not to have to confront you will find that now you cant get him out again with can opener you can put someone into higher level of awareness he now becomes aware of the problems that he has not handled this alone makes it necessary for him to progress by gradients you will make it as long as you let him sit down for awhile and enjoy the view he is victim of selfcreated charge great masses of it when he gets more aware he backs off from it you have to take charge off by getting ta action then he can easily move up to where you can get more charge off it is not spectacular activity as the pc moves up the line his problems look bigger but only because he can see more reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions this is the key to processing person at level 0 has dangerous problems and must have complex solutions how do we get around all this the old solution is what he is sick from cures cures cures it is use to solve somebodys problems for him what gets us away from this is that we arent giving people solutions the basic error is the most fundamental part of the problem that can be asised because of the chain of solutions as an auditor you are not giving the pc new solutions for his livingness you are taking out of existence old solutions which now exist in the form of problems youre asising what has been solved in the past and caused the person to become more unaware youre asising old problems you are asising past solvents you are backtracking the way he came down running solutions is running yesterdays problems you are taking out the old think that made him drop doing and be unaware on r1c and r1cm this is r1c with the meter you follow the bd after you complete the cycle of action you were on see p 623 below you are backing the pc through yesterdays problems by getting his solutions if you run such thing as problem you are running it below its proper level of awareness here is the trick problem by definition is something that you cant confront and solution is way by which you dont have to confront something so your effort to handle the problem is to solve it and if the way in which you solve it is to become less aware of it you have moved into lower awareness levels you are looking at yesterdays solutions whether you are running problems or solutions you are actually running solutions when you ask for problems you are asking for something that the pc couldnt confront when you ask for solutions you are asking for something that the pc could confront running problems requires you to confront only the pcs noconfront therefore you dont run problems you run solutions which latter really are problems but which can be confronted its the difference between running noconfront and confront though you are actually running the same thing from different point of view if you call them problems then you are saying the individual couldnt confront them if you call them solutions then you are saying he could so when you run solutions you get rid of the problems that he sets up to avoid confronting things by backtracking his solutions when you do this the pc becomes more aware and more capable of confronting up to the point where he can confront the problems that made him decide to become unaware in the first place and he finds that those in turn were solutions so he finds out what that was solution for etc and he is all set to move on out to freedom this way out is route 2 this principle holds true all the way up gpms were very complex solutions which must have had complex problems behind them the main problem was an unwillingness to confront so you dont ask the pc to confront it all at once you do it gradiently that is why levels are there they are there on the basis that the individual at any given time is at his lowest level of awareness you bring him up from there not down you reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions youve got to walk him back up into further awareness for him to hold his own in the environment he has now entered that is how to process someone that is why manic sometimes turns on where the pc gets boosted up bit too high for him at particular time so realize that you are getting off the charge that debars the individual from confronting the problems that he has the most complex being you will confront is the lowestlevel pc if you reduce the complexity of the problem by asising yesterdays complex solutions you can get charge off and the pc can act better now because his awareness level came up when you first ask for datum you wont get it but you will get off charge then when you ask for the datum again since you have gotten charge off the area you will get it this is how processing works the road into this universe is successive unawarenesses and the road out is successive awarenesses he got himself into trouble by solving himself into trouble there are lower levels of awareness for you to explore there are only upper levels the road out is not spectacular you take the pc out via the road he came in successive unawarenesses undone
