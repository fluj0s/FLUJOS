security updated september 13 2000 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress pension policy the connection to job stability and job security summary the view of pensions as delayed benefit to which job leavers have right has combined with concern over the adequacy of workers retirement income to motivate federal pension policy mobile workers may sacrifice pension benefits if they leave job before meeting plans lengthofservice requirement because of inflation induced erosion of accrued funds in definedbenefit plan db between the time of departure from firm and eligibility for retirement if they do not preserve the value of vested accumulations from definedcontribution dc plan because portability of benefits is not widespread or because they often use the funds immediately or if they are employed by firms that do not provide pension benefits these possibilities have led congress to pass some measures and consider others meant to spur more firms to provide pensions thereby increasing the chance that job changers will move from one pensioncovered company to another in addition policymakers have imposed and strengthened vesting schedules so that fewer employees completely lose their right to accrued benefits when they change employers small majority of adult workers do not stay at firms long enough to reach the typical 5year vesting period however congress also has tried to adapt the pension system to the nations mobile workforce by preserving the accumulated balances of jobchangers through portability of benefits but relatively few participants in db plans are covered by portability provisions moreover only slight majority of participants in dc plans are permitted to rollover or transfer accrued funds when they leave their current firms and majority of benefit distributions to jobchangers are cashed out for use as current income rather than preserved as pension savings for use upon retirement interest in the nexus between pension policy and worker mobility has intensified in recent years due in part to firms ongoing efforts to restructure their internal operations to become more competitive corporate restructuring has sometimes involved downsizing in which the total workforce size has been reduced it also has sometimes meant assigning functions once performed internally to contingent workers with whom firms typically do not develop longlasting ie secure relationships the continuing use of corporate layoffs and of contingent workers has created the image of more turbulent labor market which in turn has prompted interest in adjusting pension policy to better match the needs of seemingly more mobile labor force based on analysis of job tenure worker displacement and contingent employment data as well as review of the economic literature it appears that neither job stability nor job security has thus far undergone substantial longterm decline hence one argument in favor of pension reform that workers today are more often moving from job to job is not supported by the available empirical evidence policymakers may think that jobchangers are at risk of accumulating insufficient funds for use in retirement even at current levels of labor mobility however and that this circumstance justifies considering further modification

1997 and 1999 16 pension policy the connection to job stability and job security crs2 in the late 1800s companies viewed pensions as way to charitably remove from their payrolls older employees whose productivity had diminished1 in addition some firms eg those with sizeable hiring and training costs wanted to discourage employee turnover and develop stable workforces2 they established and structured pensions toward that end namely as reward for longtime continuous service for these reasons pensions often were not offered to employees who left firms before retirement with the passage of time perceptions about pensions changed they now are generally regarded as deferred compensation to which jobleavers or shorttenured workers are entitled3 pension policy and job changers the view of pensions as delayed benefit to which jobleavers have right has combined with general concern over the adequacy of workers retirement income to motivate federal pension policy workers such as women who historically have had more sporadic employment patterns than men or employees in industries with high job turnover may sacrifice pension benefits when they change jobs mobile workers may forfeit

and definedcontribution pension plans definedbenefit plan legally obligates employers to pay retirees an annuity based on formula specified in the plan at retirement age the size of the benefit is typically based on salary and years of service the employer is responsible for making contributions to the pension fund investing the funds assets and paying benefits with this type of plan the employer has considerable latitude in deciding how to invest plan assets but the employer also bears the entire risk if investments perform poorly if plan investments perform extraordinarily well however the employer may be able to reduce or suspend contributions to the plan for some period of time definedcontribution plans typically specify the level of employer contributions to the plan but not the actual benefits that will be paid upon retirement definedcontribution plans may contain provision for employees to contribute to their accounts often on pretax basis funds available at retirement depend on how much the employee and employer contribute to these accounts as well as investment earnings in contrast to definedbenefit plans employees in definedcontribution plans bear the entire risk and reward of their investment decisions there are several types of definedcontribution plans including savings and thrift plans deferred profitsharing plans money purchase pension plans and stock plans some definedcontribution plans allow workers to contribute part of their earnings to an individual account and to defer income taxes on these contributions until the money is withdrawn usually at retirement these plans sometimes are called 401k 403b or section 457 plans after the sections of the internal revenue code that permit them to be established most of these salaryreductiontaxdeferred plans are savings and thrift plans although salaryreduction features are sometimes included in the other types of dc plans and in freestanding 401k plans to which employers do not make any contributions source us department of labor report of the american workforce chapter 3 employer provided retirement plans washington 1997 these possibilities have led congress to pass some measures and consider others that are intended to encourage more firms to provide pension plans thereby increasing the likelihood that jobchangers will move from one pensioncovered company to another4 policymakers also have modified the nations private pension system so that fewer employees will completely lose their right to pension benefits if 4 congress has for example enacted several laws aimed at encouraging small businesses to offer dc plans legislation has been introduced in the 106th congress that is intended to spur small employers to offer db plans see the following for more

and crs report rl30122 pension coverage recent trends and current policy issues by patrick j purcell crs5 they change employers congress first imposed vesting schedules which have been strengthened over time in the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa today singleemployer db plans usually provide 100 vesting of accrued benefits to employees who have completed 5 years of service with entitlement to employer contributions before then this type of vesting called cliff vesting also is commonly found in multiemployer db plans to which several firms contribute under collective bargaining arrangements full vesting of benefits in multiemployer db plans typically occurred after 10 years of service but under law will now be treated like other db plans with regard to vesting schedules when labor contracts are renegotiated although erisa applies the same vesting requirements to employer contributions to db and dc plans participants in dc plans more often receive immediate full vesting or graduated vesting of benefits5 of the relatively fewer participants in dc plans with cliff vesting most are fully vested after 5 years in 2000 however 54 of workers age 20 or older had not yet been at their firms for the typical 5year vesting period 52 of adult men 56 of adult women6 congress also has taken steps to adapt the private pension system to the nations mobile labor force by preserving the pension balances of workers who change jobs portability currently exists in two forms service credit portability allows employees cumulative work time at previous firms to count in determining benefits upon retirement from their last employer and asset portability allows employees to deposit accrued pension funds into iras or to switch accrued sums into pension plans offered by subsequent employers relatively few participants in the dwindling number of db plans7 are covered by portability provisions8 however the recent move toward cash balance plans is changing the portability situation for workers in db plans9 most db participants covered by portability provisions are in multiemployer plans negotiated by labor and management as the unionized share of the labor force has declined so too has the share of pension participants in multiemployer plans in addition very 5 with graduated vesting the employees right to the dc plans employer contributions increases incrementally and usually reaches 100 after 5 years although up to 7 years are allowed under law employee contributions to either db or dc plans are immediately vested us bureau of labor statistics

report rl30196 pension issues cashbalance plans by patrick purcell crs6 slight majority of participants in dc plans are permitted by their employers to rollover or transfer accumulated benefits when they change jobs10 and according to an analysis conducted by the employee benefit research institute of hewitt associates data 60 of distributions to workers who changed jobs in 1996 were cashed out as current income rather than preserved as savings for use upon retirement although the rollover rate has increased since 1993 and large dollar distributions are rolled over more often than small distributions the frequency of job change over workers career could argue for the importance of preserving relatively small vested pension balances11 more labor mobility interest in the nexus between pension policy and worker mobility has intensified in recent years due in part to the impact of economic change on the labor market legacy of the 1980s is the impression of firms restructuring their internal operations in order to become more competitive in faster paced global marketplace corporate restructuring has sometimes involved downsizing in which hundreds of thousands of employees have been laid off annually and total workforce size has been reduced 12 it also has sometimes meant assigning functions once performed by traditional workers ie persons hired with the understanding that their attachment to the firm is not timelimited barring poor individual or company performance to contingent workers eg temporary workers or independent contractors companies that use contingent workers typically do not develop longlasting relationships with them and do not offer them pension or other benefits13 consequently contingent employment arrangements are viewed by some observers as less secure and desirable than traditional jobs because of the arguably increased churning of workers through firms some members of the business and labor communities want to work along with policymakers to reduce the costs of worker dislocation and mobility by encouraging the portability of health care and pension benefits 14 10 generally in the 1990s less than 55 of fulltime employees

e5 crs7 the nation has enjoyed over 9 years of economic growth with an unemployment rate that is at its lowest level in 3 decades nonetheless the continuing use of corporate layoffs and of contingent employment arrangements has perpetuated the notion that firms have become less interested in maintaining stable workforce and in turn that worker loyalty to given employer has diminished this situation has heightened interest in further adjusting pension policy to better match the needs of seemingly more mobile labor force15 the remainder of this report will examine from variety of perspectives whether labor mobility actually has increased in recent years job stability if employees have been holding many more jobs over their work lives then the length of time spent with the same employer ie job tenure should have diminished overall the data do not appear to support this conclusion during the 1980s and 1990s the median job tenure16 of wage and salary workers age 16 or older has fluctuated between 34 years in 1987 and 38 years in 1996 most recently in 2000 the typical worker had been with the same firm for 35 years17 this stability is partly related to the aging of the babyboom generation ie persons born between 1946 and 1964 whose oldest members started turning 40 in the mid1980s jobhopping is more common during individuals initial years in the labor force while they search for better job matches which then have greater chance of lasting voluntary ie employeeinitiated job changes typically become less common once workers accumulate experience and settle on career path18 according to data from the national longitudinal survey of youth the average person has 92 different jobs between the ages of 18 and 34 with more than half of the separations occurring before the workers are 25 years old19 in contrast to the near constancy of median tenure across all wage and salary workers trends by gender diverge the different directions of mens and womens median job tenure hint at economic changes eg cutbacks in manufacturing industries and thinning of management ranks that seemingly have had more adverse effect on men in general and on middleaged to older men in particular between 1983 and 2000 median job tenure modestly decreased among men from 41 years 15 for information on pension proposals currently under consideration see crs issue brief 10028 pension plans offered by private employers legislative issues in the 106th congress by james r storey 16 median tenure means that half of employees held their jobs for shorter period and half for

years to 102 years and for 4554 year old males who reported 33year drop from 128 years to 95 years in contrast median job tenure modestly increased among women from 31 years in 1983 to 33 years in 2000 the increase reflects the aging of many babyboom women beyond the usual childbearing years and the greater attachment of women over time to the paid labor force in particular among women those between 45 and 54 years of age experienced the largest gain in job stability their median job tenure lengthened from 63 years to 73 years during the 19832000 period looked at another way if individuals have been changing jobs much more often than in the past the fraction of shorttenured workers should have increased and the fraction of longtenured workers should have decreased as shown in table 1 however just the opposite occurred among workers with less than 3 years and with 10 or more years of tenure thus permanent or lifetime employment relationships continue to characterize the us labor market for about onefourth of employed wage and salary workers but the composition of longtime jobholders has shifted men represented 64 of all employees who were at their firms for at least 10 years in 1983 by 2000 mens presence among longtenured workers had fallen to 5521 although the magnitude has not been large enough to affect overall job stability mens tenure distribution has changed in the manner reported by the mass media as shown in table 1 the fraction of men with less than 3 years of service increased 103 percentage points while the fraction of men with 10 or more years of seniority decreased 188 percentage points as shown in table 2 the falloff in the proportion of longtenured males has been especially steep for those in the middle to latter part of their work lives the share of 3544 year old men who were with their current employers for at least 10 years dropped sharply by 831 percentage points among men age 4554 the fraction with at least 10 years of tenure plummeted 98 percentage points and among men age 5564 the proportion fell 1269 percentage points 20 bls employee tenure in 2000 21 bls unpublished data from the current population survey crs9

have tried to adjust for various shortcomings of the abovedescribed data from the current population surveys tenure supplement22 some researchers have used other surveys in their examination of trends in job stability but they too have drawbacks23 22 the wording of questions in the current population survey cps tenure supplement changed such that pre1983 responses might lead to understatement of tenure ie before 1983 respondents were asked about time spent in their job while since then they were asked about time spent with their current employer individuals responses are clustered around certain tenure intervals eg reporting durations of job tenure ending in 0 or 5 which suggests recall problems or rounding errors the nonresponse rate to tenure questions sometimes varies from one survey year to another and this can bias estimated retention rates 23 one alternative is the panel study of income dynamics psid unlike the cps from which researchers must derive synthetic age cohorts

estimating sizable decreases24 and others finding little change25 in the trend of aggregate job stability through the 1980s the disparate outcomes for job stability estimated in these studies and those covering the 1990s discussed below largely result from the unique characteristics of the databases the varying methods researchers used to overcome the databases shortcomings the diverse measures of job stability developed by analysts26 and the different time periods covered27 one set of economists who extended their analysis from the 1980s through 1995 reported modest decrease in overall job stability28 neumark polsky and hansen noted that the decline might have been steeper were the labor force not aging toward the years of generally fewer job changes in contrast stewart found that job stability increased as the rate of job separations across all workers had fallen slightly between 1975 and 199529 and in third study farber concluded that aggregate job duration was unchanged over the 19731993 period30 thus consensus exists in the economic literature that overall job stability has changed over time the empirical research does confirm that groups within the labor force have exhibited divergent trends in job tenure studies consistently agree that womens job stability has increased in recent decades as they have become more committed to 24 swinnerton kenneth and

for men is clouded with some analysts estimating more job changes32 and others near constancy33 through the first part of the 1990s despite these disparate findings for men on average the research does suggest that the job stability of less educated men ie those with less than 12 years of schooling and of older longtenured men ie about 10 or more years of tenure or work experience has decreased through the first half of the 1990s34 perhaps rather than workers moving from one job to another more often today than in the past the composition of shorttenured and longtenured workers is changing job security job tenure reflects both voluntary eg quits and retirements and involuntary eg layoffs and plant closings labor mobility while tenure is good measure of job stability it is not as good an indicator of job security job security concerns only involuntary ie employerinitiated separations the incidence of which could have increased even as overall job duration has held steady for example many workers who thought they held secure jobs might be permanently laid off and others observing their plight might decide to stay put rather than quit to seek opportunities elsewhere as result the dampened quit rate might fully offset the elevated dismissal rate thereby creating stable job durations despite workers heightened vulnerability to job loss35 there is widespread impression that more workers today are unable to keep their jobs for as long as they like despite their continued good performance not only could this come about because firms are permanently laying off greater numbers of employees than in the past but also because firms are hiring less and contracting more with business services companies eg for janitorial or photocopying personnel staffing companies eg for temporary workers or independent contractors eg for computer systems expertise the trend in job security as measured by involuntary job loss and contingent employment arrangements is analyzed below 31 schmidt

1980s to develop comprehensive information on workers allegedly greater risk of job loss according to data from the dws the trend in the displacement rate ie the number of job losers as proportion of persons employed has generally reflected the trend in the unemployment rate increasing in recessionary periods eg 19811982 and 1990 1991 and decreasing as economic recoveries lengthened see table 3 as shown by declining displacement rates since the last recession job security has increased in the last several years table 3 displacement rates for workers age 20 or older by job tenure 19811998

displaced worker survey when roughly the same points in the business cycle are compared however job security appears to have slightly diminished in the 1980s compared to the 1990s as shown in table 3 the risk of job loss across all workers rose 02 percentage points from 32 in 19871988 to 34 in 19971998 schultze also concluded that the cyclicallyadjusted displacement rate rose somewhat between the 19811982 and 19931994 periods before falling to almost its original level in the 19951996 period although the increase in the cyclicallyadjusted displacement rate before the mid 1990s was not trivial its absolute magnitude was good bit less than one would infer from the media treatment of the downsizing problem36 36 schultze charles l has job security eroded for american workers p 4143 in blair margaret m and thomas kochan eds the new relationship human capital in the continued crs14 this small change might be related to the twofold increase since the late 1980s in the fraction of workers who lost jobs because their position or shift was abolished in contrast the share of workers who lost jobs because their positions or shifts were eliminated remained fairly constant during the 1980s37 this reason for displacement ie abolition of positionshift38 comes closest to capturing corporate restructuring phenomenon whose advent appears coincident with the 1990s recession and which has continued during the remainder of the decade39 corporate downsizing appears to have focused on one type of employee in particular 39 of whitecollar workers displaced in the 19951996 period offered positionshift abolishment as the reason for job loss compared to 17 of displaced bluecollar workers40 farber also found evidence to support the notion that corporate restructuring has had an adverse impact on job security generally and on the job security of managers within the whitecollar ranks especially after adjusting the dws data for changes in question wording and recall period among other things he estimated that among all 2064 year old workers the rate of job loss due to positionshift abolished was higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s41 this was especially true for older workers ie 4564 year olds and more educated workers ie workers with at least postsecondary schooling in addition all of the increase in the displacement rate of managers between 19871989 and 19911993 was related to their positions being eliminated there is potentially important message in this finding regarding managers at least two interpretations of corporate restructuring have implications for job security the first is that corporations are moving toward mode of organization that relies less on longterm relationships with workers and hence less investment in workplacespecific skills this trend would imply permanent increase in rates of job loss the second interpretation is that corporations are adjusting their mix of workers to reflect new production arrangements this trend would imply onetime adjustment in the number of managers resulting in temporary increase 36 continued american corporation washington dc brookings institution press 2000 hereafter cited as schultze has job security

table 3 the us bureau of labor statistics defined longtenured workers as those employed at least 3 years by the firms that terminated them nonetheless valletta calculated that the displacement rate for employees with at least 15 years of job tenure was higher in the 19911995 period than in the 19891991 period while at the same time rates for less senior workers fell substantially this finding along with atypically high displacement rates for some other members of the labor force during the ongoing economic expansion eg whitecollar workers led valletta to suggest that the key source of these displacements position or shift abolition was aimed at specific groups of employees rather than firms entire workforce as is the case with the plant closing or slack work categories43 limiting their analysis of the dws data to highseniority workers whom they defined as having at least 5 years of job tenure aaronson and sullivan also concluded that despite improvement in aggregate job security between 1990 and 1995 the risk of job loss from the abolition of shiftspositions rose sharply although the chance of losing job for this reason decreased somewhat in 1997 it continued to be twice as high as during the 1980s44 the researchers much like farber valletta and schultze45 found that displacement has become more democratic over the years in other words groups that previously were fairly immune to layoffs became less so during the 1990s recession ie men workers with college degrees those in whitecollar occupations or in the service sector while groups with high displacement rates during the 1980s recession fared much better in the 19901991 recession ie women workers lacking college degree those in bluecollar occupations or in the goodsproducing sector in an attempt to reconcile the falling displacement rates since the mid1990s with workers continuing anxiety about job security aaronson and sullivan speculated that 42 ibid p 77 43 valletta job loss during

economist calculates that in the early 1980s permanent layoffs among whitecollar workers were onethird as large as layoffs among bluecollar workers since then the whitecollar rate has risen substantially while the bluecollar rate has irregularly edged downward until in the early 1990s the whitecollar rate reached and then remained at fourfifths of the bluecollar rate while relatively high frequency of layoffs among blue collar workers has most probably always existed layoffs of this magnitude are new thing for whitecollar workers which may help explain the vivid public perceptions and media publicity about layoffs in recent years crs16 the increased democratization of displacement may be prompting many more workers to now consider themselves at risk for job loss46 in contrast an analysis based on the psid concluded that the risk of job loss increased between the 19681979 period and the 19801992 period for small sample of male household heads age 2559 who had been with their firms for at least 12 months and who had worked at least 1000 hours during the previous year47 reasons why this estimate differs from those in other studies that overall job security has not undergone longterm decline include the following 1 the psid asked about job changes that occurred over 12month period during most years between 1968 and 1992 but from 19841987 the reporting period was closer to 18 months which raises the possibility of more job separations having occurred during the 1980s due to the longer reporting period 2 the analysis ended in 1992 before the economic recovery was well underway and 3 by focusing solely on men the results tend to overstate the aggregate decline in job security during the 1980s compared to the 1970s because womens risk of job loss rose less than that of men48 in another study that also covered multiple decades mid1970s to mid1990s stewart based his finding of stable job security on estimates of constant employment tounemployment eu transition rates49 he provided two possible explanations for the publics perception of decreased job security in the 1990s the first being the unusually long recovery time from the mild 19901991 recession the atypically weak rebound on the employment front was dubbed the jobless recovery until about 1995 for example because it took 34 years for the eu transition rate of men with at least high school education to return to its prerecession level people might have come to believe the situation was permanent rather than transitory in addition eu transition rates were higher during the mild 1990s recession than the deep 1980s recession for male college graduates who historically have been comparatively insulated from cyclical shocks to the economy this also was the case for older men ie those with 21 or more years of work experience stewart therefore hypothesized that the high eu rates for these fairly immune groups during weak economic downturn might have prompted people to think that something other than shortrun decline in job security was taking place50 46 aaronson daniel and daniel g sullivan the decline of job security in the 1990s displacement anxiety and their effect on

transitions were considered to have occurred when an individual worked during the previous year and was unemployed during the current population surveys reference week in march in the current year the researcher determined the that the eu transition rate tracked job losers well and therefore was good proxy for job security 50 stewart did job security decline in the 1990s crs17 it could be argued that the publics perception is correct and instead that the empirical research is missing something perhaps the disconnect is that the media accounts that have shaped public opinion have focused on downsizing at the nations largest corporations while most workers are employed by firms with less than 1000 employees and the databases that analysts use question all individuals regardless of firm size51 allen clark and schieber looked specifically at what has happened during the 1990s to job stability at 51 large corporations to determine whether their experiences were accurately reflected in the popular press they further divided their small unrepresentative sample between large companies whose employment had grown 19 or shrunk 32 as would be expected the likelihood of employees remaining at their current firms was higher at expanding versus downsizing firms however the probability of midcareer employees ie 1019 years of service staying with their current employers was virtually the same regardless of the firms job growth trend contrary to media accounts this finding implies that downsizing has not been aimed at midcareer workers in addition the researchers estimated that the retention rate of junior employees ie 04 years service fell but that of senior employees ie 20 or more years of service was unaffected among the large corporations that downsized their operations in other words as has traditionally been the case they found that shorttenured workers bore the brunt of layoffs in the 1990s lastly in study that analyzed both job stability and job security over the 1979 1996 period farber similarly concluded that employers have not been focusing their layoffs on senior employees ie those with more than 10 years or more than 20 years of service after adjusting for changes in personal and job characteristics over time he estimated that the share of men in longterm jobs fell but that corporate downsizing does not appear to have been the culprit because the rate of job loss among long tenured men did not rise between 1979 and 1996 farber suggested two reasons why job stability has diminished for longtenured men 1 womens longrun increase in labor force attachment may have prompted employers to regard them as viable substitutes for men in longterm employment relationships or 2 the basic employment relationship may have been changed toward model with less longterm job security52 possibility that is discussed in the following section of this report 51 allen steven g robert l clark and sylvester j schieber has job security vanished in large

princeton nj industrial relations section princeton university july 1997 p 25 crs18 contingent work arrangements the label commonly applied to jobs that are less secure than traditional positions ie jobs presumed to be permanent barring poor individual or company performance is contingent work arrangements systematic comprehensive statistics on these shortduration employment relationships did not become available until bls conducted its first survey on the subject in 199553 before then analysts cobbled together statistics on contingent workers from variety of sources which resulted in doublecounting that inflated the estimate of the group and that affected its composition based on bls broadest definition of contingent work arrangements they numbered more than 56 million in 1999 or less than 5 of employed persons see footnotes to table 4 for the bls three alternative definitions of contingent workers table 4 selected data on contingent workers 1995 1997 and 1999 contingency

1999 the generic definition of contingent workers is persons who do not regard themselves as having an understanding either explicit or implicit with their employers that their positions are permanent bls developed three operational definitions of contingent workers the narrowest definition is wage and salary workers who worked for their current employer for 1 year or less and who expect to continue with the same firm for 1 year or less temporary help industry workers and employees of 53 some researchers do not agree with bls definitions of contingent workers for more information see levine temporary workers as members of the contingent labor force crs19 business services contractors are asked to respond to the job duration requirements with reference to the firms that issue their paychecks wage and salary workers who report that they could stay with their firms but expect to leave within the year for personal reasons are excluded as are the self employed and independent contractors the intermediate definition adds to the narrowest definition of contingent workers those selfemployed persons and independent contractors who expect to be and have already been in these work arrangements for 1 year or less temporary help industry workers and employees of business services contractors are asked to respond to the job duration requirements with reference to the customers to whom they were assigned the broadest definition removes the requirements about current and expected job tenure for wage and salary workers thus most persons who do not expect their employment to last except for personal reasons are included the job duration requirements are not relaxed for selfemployed persons or independent contractors b the contingency rate is the share of the employed population in timelimited jobs with all three data points in the current decade it is not possible to determine longterm trend in job security as measured by the incidence of contingent employment arrangements as the proportion of workers with contingent jobs has decreased since 1995 it suggests that job security has increased as the 1990s economic expansion has lengthened the inference of enhanced job security in the last few years is reinforced by other data in the contingent worker survey almost onefourth of contingent workers in 1995 said they were in these short duration jobs because it was the only type of work they could find two years later under one fifth gave the same response in contrast the fraction of workers who chose contingent jobs for personal reasons eg family obligations scheduling flexibility and attending school increased between 1995 and 199754 concluding remarks longrun decline in overall job stability does not appear to have occurred to date in part because womens increased job tenure has offset any decrease in some mens job duration eg males with long years of service at their employers job security also does not seem to have diminished the spread of unusually high displacement rates during the mild 19901991 recession to groups that traditionally were insulated from economic downturns and with whom many individuals compare themselves eg middleaged and older males may have misled the public into believing that the average workers risk of job loss or necessity of accepting contingent jobs was permanently rather than temporarily elevated the labor markets comparatively slow rebound from the mild 1990s recession also may have contributed to the publics impression that longrun rather than shortrun cyclical phenomenon was taking place apparently then one argument for enacting pension reform that the typical worker today is more often moving from job to job is not supported by the available empirical evidence nonetheless policymakers may think that jobchangers are at risk of accumulating insufficient pension funds for use in retirement even at the current level of labor mobility and that this circumstance justifies considering further modification of the nations private pension system for example many workers 54 devens richard m at issue gains in job security monthly labor review march 1998 crs20 are not assured of obtaining pension benefits when they change jobs often leave jobs before completing the typical 5year vesting period or do not preserve the value of vested balances from their former jobs because pension portability is not widespread or because they cashout accrued funds for immediate use for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30263
