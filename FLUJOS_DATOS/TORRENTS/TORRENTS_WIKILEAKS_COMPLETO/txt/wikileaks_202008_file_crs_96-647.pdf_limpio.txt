for drinking water treatment projects in fy1997 this repor t summarizes in chronological order congressional activity to fund ite ms in this account since 1987 prior to the 1987 amendments wastewater treatment assistance was provided in the form of grants made to municipalities the federal share of project costs was generally 55 state and local governments were responsible for the remaining 45 the 1987 amendments altered this arrangem ent by replacing the traditional grant program with one that provides federal grants to capitalize state clean water loan programs or state revolving funds srfs as general matter states and cities support the program changes and the shift to loan program that was intended to provide longterm funding for water quality and wastew ater construction activities however the change means that local communities now are responsible for 100 of projects costs rather than 45 because they are required to repay loans to states the greater financial burden of the acts loan program on some cities has caused some to seek continued grant funding this has been particularly evident in the appropriations process where in recent years congress has reserved as much as 30 of funds in the stag account for special purpose grants directed to specified communities since fy2000 appropriators have awarded earmarks to larger total number of projects resulting in more communities receiving such grants but at the same time receiving smaller amounts of funds on average most of the funded projects are not authorized in the clean water act or the safe drinking water act state water quality officials state infrastructure financing officials and epa have objected to this practice since it reduces the amount of funding for stat srf programs since fy1997 the stag

authorized in the clean water act cwa congress established this program essentially in its current form in the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 pl 92500 although pr ior versions of the act had authorized less ambitious grants assistance since 1956 title ii of pl 92500 authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant c onstruction under pr ogram administered by the environmental protection agency pa federal funds are provided through annual appropriations under st atebystate allocation fo rmula contained in the act itself states used their allotments to make grants to cities to build or upgrade wastewater treatment plants and thus to achieve the overall objectives of the act restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters the federal share of project costs or iginally 75 under pl 92500 was reduced to 55 in 1981 by the mid1980s there was considerable policy debate between congress and the administration over the future of the acts construction grants program and in particular the appropr iate federal role through fy1984 congress d appropriated nearly 41 billion under this program representing the largest nonmilitary public works programs since the interstate highway system the grants program was target of the reagan administration s budget cutters who sought to redirect budgetary priorities in part to sort out the ppropriate roles of fede ral state and local governments in number of domestic polic areas including water pollution control the administrations rationa included several points the original intent of the program to address the backlog of sewage treatment needs had been virtua lly eliminated by the mid1980s most remaining projects such as sm all rural systems were believed to pose little environmental threat and were not appropriate federal responsibilities state and local governments in the administrations view werefully capable of running construc tion programs and have clear responsibility to construc t treatment capacity to meet environmental objectives that were primar ily established by states thus the reagan administration sought phaseout of the acts construction grants program by 1990 many states and localitie s supported the idea of phasing out the grants program since many were critical of what they viewed as burdensome rules and regulations that accompanied the federal grant money however they sought ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96647crs2 1 us environmental protection agency office of wastewater management clean watersheds needs survey 2000

to set up longterm financing to promote state and local selfsufficiency congress response to this debate was contained in 1987 amendments to the act pl 1004 the water quality act of 1987 it authorized 18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction through combin ation of the title ii grants program and new state water pollution control revolving funds srf program under the new program in title vi of the act federal grants would be provided as seed money for stateadministered loans to build sewage treatment plants and eventually other water quality projects cities in turn would repay loans to the state enabling phaseout of federal invol vement while the state builds up source of capital for future investments u nder the amendments the srf program was phased in beginning in fy1989 in fy 1989 and fy1990 appropria tions were split equally between title ii and title vi gran ts and entirely replaced the previous title ii program in fy1991 the intention was that states would have flexibility to set priorities and administer funding while federal aid would end after fy1994 the authorizations provided in th 1987 amendments expired in fy1994 but pressure to extend federal funding has continued in pa rt because although congress has appropriated over 77 b illion in assistance since 1972 funding needs remain high an additional 181 billion nationwide is needed for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act according to the most recent formal estimate by epa and states1 thus congress has continued to appr opriate funds and th anticipated shift to full state funding responsibility has been delayed in contrast to the 40plus years of federal support for financing municipal wastewater treatment fac ilities congress establishe d program under the safe drinking water act sdwa to help communities with financing of projects needed to comply with federal drinking wa ter regulations more recently in 19962 funding support for drinking water only occurred mo re recently for several reasons first until the 1980s the number of drinking water regulations was fair ly small and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations second and relatedly good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively low cost by comparison essentially all communities have had to c onstruct or upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the cwa over time drinking water circumstances have changed as communities have grown and commercial industrial agricu ltural and residen tial landuses have become more concentrated thus resulting in more contaminants reaching drinking water sources moreover as the number of federal drinking water standards has increased many communities ve found that their water may not be as good as once thought and that additional treatment technologies are required to

below in sections providing th appropriations chronologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96647crs5 5 for additional information see crs report rl32201 water infrastructure project earmarks in epa appropriations trends and policy implications by claudia copelandtrends in water infrastructure funding three changes are especially evident in the recent history of water infrastructure funding as reflected in the appropriati ons account wher these funds are detailed one is inclusion in the account of noninfrast ructure grants to states this began in fy1993 with addition of clean water act s ection 319 grants for state programs to manage nonpoint source pollution and was ex panded in fy1996 to include all state grants for management of nvironmental programs in single consolidated grants appropriation second trend discussed below has been an increasing number and amount of specially earmarked grants for needy cities and other special purpose projects third trend also discussed below is expansion of the account to include srf capitalization grants for drinking water proj ects under authority of the safe drinking water act amendments of 1996 pl 104134 srf grants vs special purpose project grants the practice of earmarking portion of the construction gr antssrf account for specific wastewater treatment and other water quality projects began in the fy1989 legislation since then it has increased to the point of repr esenting significant portion of appropriated funds 31 of the total water infrastru cture appropriation in fy1994 for example 28 in fy1995 but somewhat less in r ecent years 16 in fy2005 and fy2006 the number of projects recei ving these earmarked funds also has increased from four in fy1989 to eight in fy1994 669 in fy2005 but fewer in fy2006 259 total since fy2000 the larger total num ber of earmarked pr ojects has resulted in more communities receiving such grants but at the same time r eceiving smaller amounts of funds thus while few communities have received individual earmarked awards of 3 million or more in recent years the average size of earmarked grants has shrunk 181 million in fy1995 49 million in fy1999 600 427 in fy2005 and 108 million in fy2006 conference reports on the individual appropriations bills noted in the later discussion in this report provide limited detail on projects funded in this manner the effective result of earmarking has been to reduce the amount of funds provide d to states to capitalize their srf programs of the 513 billion appropria ted to epa for water infrastructure programs since 1986 687 billion has gone to earmarked project grants5 interest groups representing state water quality progra m managers and administrators of infrastructure financing programs have criticized this practice of appropriators they contend that earmark ing undermines the intended purpose of the state funds to promote water quality improve ments nationwide many state officials would prefer that funds be allocated more equitably not based on what they view largely as political considerations and they would prefer that state environmental and financing officials retain responsibility to t actual spending priorities further they say because directed funding of special projects diminishe s the level of seed funding to srfs it delays the time when states will be financially selfsufficient and may actually prolong the time when stat seek continued federal supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96647crs6 6 in the 104th congress the house passed comprehensive cwa reauthorization bill that included provisions concerning water infrast ructure hr 961 but provisions in it that addressed regulatory relief and similar issues were controversial and further action occurred in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses house and senate committees considered legislation to reauthorize water infrastructure financing programs but bill was enacted in the 110th congress the house has passed reauthorization bill hr 720 but action has occurred in the senatethe practice of earmarking has been critic ized because designated projects are receiving more favorable trea tment than other communities projects they generally are eligible for 55 federal grants and will not be required to repay 100 of the funded project cost as is the case with loan through an srf and the practice sidesteps the standard cwa process of st ates determining the priority by which projects will receive funding it also mean s that the projects have generally not been reviewed by the cwa author izing committees this is especially true since fy1992 when special purpose grant funding has been designated for projects not authorized in the clean water act or amendments to it or in the safe drinking water act members of congress may intervene for specific community for number of reasons in some cases the communities may have been unsuccessful in seeking state approval to fund the project under an sr f loan or other program for some the cost of project financed through state loan which the community must fully repay is deemed unacceptably high because repaying the loan can result in such increased user fees that ra tepayers feel are unduly burde nsome the community then seeks grant to avoid this costly financial scenario this is often the case with wastewater projects in small and rural communities number of the special purpose grants have been made to projects characterized as needy cities based on local economic conditions in the early years of this congressiona l practice special purpose grant funding originated in the house version of the epa appropriations bill while the senate for the most part resisted earmarking by rejecting or reducing amounts and projects included in housepassed legisl ation with this differen ce in legislative approach special purpose grant funding on several ccasions were an issue during the house senate conference on the ppropriations bill since fy1999 however both the house and senate have propos ed earmarked projects in th eir respective versions of the epa appropriations bill with the fi nal total number of projects and dollar amounts being determined by conferees in addition as it has now been 19 years since the last major amendments to the clean water act the desire by some members to address special needs pr oblems that might be debated during reauthorization has increased thus leadin g to greater pressure on house and senate members to use the appropriations process to handle such concerns6 technically the clean water act title ii grants program ended when authorizations for it expired after fy1990 one result of earmarking special purpose grants in appropriations bills has been to perpetuate grants as method of funding wastewater treatment constr uction long after fy1990 at the same time it also has resulted in congress providing epa grants fo r drinking water system projects which had not previously been availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96647crs7 7 hrept 104715

share were specified in the 1987 clean water ac t amendments for number of other projects for which appropriations were provided in fy1992 and fy1993 the appropriations acts specified that funds were provided as grants under title ii resulting in requirement for local communities to provide 45 share of project costs after fy1993 the appropriations acts th emselves are the authority for the special purpose projects grants in the fy1995 appropriation bill which also directed allocation of funds appropriated in fy1994 to veral needy cities congress addressed the issue of federal and local co st shares in report language accompanying the bill but not in the appropriation act itself7 the conferees are in agreement that the agency should work with the grant recipients on appropriate costshare arrangements it is the conferees expectation that the agency will appl the 45 local cost share requirement under title ii of the clean water act in most cases in the fy1996 appropriations both the act and accompanying reports were silent on federallocal cost share and app licability of title ii requirements because of that epa officials pla nned to require only 5 local match for most of the special purpose grants in that bill which is the standard matching requirement for other epa noninfrastructure grants under th agencys rules the local match could include inkind services as well as funding toward the project in the fy1997 appropriations congress in cluded report language as it had in fy1995 concerning federal and cal cost share requirements8 the conferees are in agreement that the agency should work with the grant recipients on appropriate costshare ag reements and to that end the conferees direct the agency to develop standard costshare consistent with fiscal year 1995 the

requirement is not possible similar report language cerning local costshare requirements accompanied the conference reports on the appropriations bills from fy2001 through fy2005 since fy2004 congress has included legislative language in the appropriations act specifying the local requirement to provide 45 of projects cost since the fy2003 appropriations legislati on congress also has specified that except for those limited instances in which an applicant meets the criteria for waiver of the costshare requirement the earmarked grant shall provide more than 55 of an individual projects cost
