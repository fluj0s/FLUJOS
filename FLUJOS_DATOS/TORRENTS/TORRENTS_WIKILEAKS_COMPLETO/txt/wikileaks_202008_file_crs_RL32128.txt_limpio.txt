challenge the new government faces crs11 rwanda figure 3 rwanda rwanda landlocked nation of slightly smaller size than maryland is one of the poorest in subsaharan africa the population is largely comprised of two ethnic groups the tutsis about 14 who had been the dominant political and economic force until 1961 and the majority hutu about 85 who took power at independence for decades rwanda suffered from periodic ethnic clashes in which hundreds of thousands died in 1990 the tutsiled rwandan patriotic front rpf launched military offensive from uganda against government troops inside rwanda government forces were able to repel the rpf and forced it to retreat into the mountains after several failed efforts the rpf and the government of rwanda reached an agreement in tanzania referred to as the arusha peace accords in early april 1994 the presidents of rwanda and burundi along with several senior government officials were killed when their plane was shot down as it approached the capital of rwanda kigali shortly after the rwandan military and hutu militia began to systematically massacre tutsis and moderate hutu opposition members in the first ten weeks of the rwandan genocide an estimated 500000 1000000 people mostly tutsis were slaughtered by government forces and the interhamwe militia millions of hutu refugees fled to neighboring democratic republic of the congo then zaire after rpf troops took control in kigali and ousted the hutu government in july 1994 in 1996 most of the refugees returned home after rpf troops attacked militias and former rwandan government troops inside democratic republic of the congo the rwandan intervention in democratic republic of the congo led to the ouster of the mobutu regime president laurent crs12 kabila became president of democratic republic of the congo with the help of the rpfled government of rwanda and uganda however violence related to the rwanda upheaval continued in democratic republic of the congo for much of the late 1990s rwanda is still very divided along ethnic lines and the 1994 genocide is fresh in the minds of many survivors and perpetrators however resentment among the majority hutu population toward the tutsi appears to have decreased in part due to reconciliation efforts by the government in 2000 the hutu president and leading figure of the ruling rpf president pasteur bizimungu resigned in protest of tutsi domination in government but bizimungu has not been able to garner support for his cause in april 2000 one month after president bizimungu resigned general

was widespread and cut across ethnic lines10 analysts note that the rpf was well organized and financed and none of the opposition candidates had political party base or clear slogan opposition candidates had access to governmentcontrolled media but some of them did not utilize the access president kagame also benefitted from key endorsements including all the hutudominated political parties and one of the presidential candidates who withdrew several days before the elections longtime rwanda observers had little doubt about kagames victory in the presidential elections the poor showing by the leading opposition candidate however was not fully expected twagiramungu was not even able to receive the endorsement of rpf critics and reportedly did not spend much time campaigning another problem that faced twagiramungu was that he did not understand according to some rwandan commentators the concerns of his hutu constituency in part because of his long absence from rwanda rpf officials used his absence from the country against twagiramungu suggesting that he abandoned them during the dark days in rwandan history despite the poor showing by the opposition president 10

to oust former dictator mobutu sese seko kabila became president in may 1997 after the ouster of the mobutu regime but tensions between kabila and his allies rwanda and uganda soon began to mount in august 1998 uganda joined rwanda and congolese rebels in joint effort to oust the government of laurent kabila of the democratic republic of the congo drc by early 1999 the congolese rebels and their rwandan and ugandan allies were in control of eastern democratic republic of the congo in northwest democratic republic of the congo prouganda congolese rebel group the movement for the liberation of the congo mlc appeared in late 1998 however the emergence of the mlc led to serious tensions between the prorwanda rebel group the congolese democratic rally rcd and mlc as well as between rwanda and uganda ugandans sought to influence events in drc independent of rwanda and its congolese allies president museveni was sidelined in the first democratic republic of the congo conflict by rwanda and its allies because museveni sought negotiated settlement with former dictator mobutu kigali considered the creation of mlc as direct challenge and as undermining its rcd allies efforts to merge the two congolese groups failed in part because senior ugandan officials were opposed to merger rwanda ugandan tensions began to mount in 1999 when rwandese officials demanded code of conduct for their respective armies in drc in august 1999 ugandan and rwandan troops clashed in kisangani in eastern democratic republic 14 usaid situation report july 3 2003 15 interview with senior ugandan government

in democratic republic of the congo in 2000 and later agreed to peace package although tensions remained because ugandan forces were defeated in all three engagements in kisangani ugandan officials have long maintained that the problem with rwanda can be resolved peacefully and that they will work to improve relations indeed number of meetings have taken place over the past two years between the two sides but relations between president museveni and president kagame continue to be strained president kagame and most of the senior political and military leaders of rwanda lived in uganda for decades until their return to rwanda in 1994 president kagame and many rwandese fought alongside president museveni during the ugandan civil war and kagame later served as chief of military intelligence when museveni assumed power in 1986 current senior rwandese government officials also served in senior positions in the ugandan government and military president museveni considered his role as that of mentor and senior statesman the rwandese leadership while grateful to ugandans and museveni contend that the relationship between the two sides must now be one of equal partnership ugandan officials assert that in order to establish good relations rwanda must halt its alleged support for ugandan dissidents rwandan officials deny that they are supporting ugandan dissidents and instead accuse ugandan officials of collaborating with the interhamwe the group responsible for the 1994 genocide the british government has been mediating between the two sides over the past several years in march 2003 uganda sent an estimated 8000 troops back into the ituri region of democratic republic of the congo reportedly to provide protection to the civilian population and to assist the ituri pacification commission ipc the ituri region has been devastated by ethnic clashes since rwandan and ugandan troops withdrew in early 2003 the redeployment of ugandan troops threatened to destabilize the region once again as rwanda accused uganda of violating the terms of agreement concluded by the parties to the conflict under international pressure uganda withdrew its troops in late april 2003 creating power vacuum in the ituri region16 shortly after the withdrawal of ugandan troops armed tribal factions in ituri began to terrorize the civilian population killing several hundred people in late may 2003 the united nations security council approved an intervention force to be deployed in the ituri region to protect civilians as noted above an estimated 1400 troops led by france were deployed in june 2003 and were replaced in september by monuc forces in recent months relations between rwanda and uganda have improved in large part due to ongoing highlevel bilateral talks in 2003 on several occasions the leaders of the two countries met to discuss issues relating to alleged support for their respective opposition groups17 one particular meeting between presidents museveni and kagame in may 2003 where the intelligence chiefs and other senior officials 16 last batch of ugandan troops withdrawing from eastern congo the new vision june 03 2003 17 interview by author dagne
