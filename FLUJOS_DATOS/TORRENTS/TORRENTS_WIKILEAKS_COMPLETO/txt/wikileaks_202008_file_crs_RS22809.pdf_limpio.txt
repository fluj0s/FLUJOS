candidate notwithstanding his two earlier losses as ndc flag bearer 18 npp candidates fiercely vied for the npp nomination in the runup to the npp party congress in late 2007 akufoaddo won the nomination in the first round of voting surprising some observers given that president kufuor had reportedly favored another candidate the npp nomination process drew some criticism because the 25000
