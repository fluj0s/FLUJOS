candidate notwithstanding his two earlier losses as ndc flag bearer 18 npp candidates fiercely vied for the npp nomination in the runup to the npp party congress in late 2007 akufoaddo won the nomination in the first round of voting surprising some observers given that president kufuor had reportedly favored another candidate the npp nomination process drew some criticism because the 25000 party nomination fee in country with an average income of about 520 was seen as barring contenders who lacked wealth or could not raise large amounts of cash to rally support 2 ghana generally enjoys

constituency tain district in the central br ong ahafo region potentially disenfranchising voters8 this discrepancy prompted the electoral commission to order repeat of runoff balloting in tain an
