the presidents national strategy for homeland security which proposed the creation of new department of homeland security dhs established as one of the departments core missions the protection of americas infrastructure1the proposal had the new department responsib for comprehensively evaluating the vulnerabilities of americas critical infrastructure including food and water systems agriculture health systems and emergency services information and telecommunications banking and finance energy electrical nuclear gas and oil dams transportation air road rail ports waterways the chemical and defense industries postal and shipping entities an d national monuments and icons working closely with state and local officials other federal agencies and the private sector the proposal had the department helping t ensure that proper steps are taken to protect highrisk targets information sharing between public and private entities about threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructures was central component of the presidents proposal which was s ubsequently introduced by request as hr 5005 armey the homeland security act of 2002 section 204 of hr 5005 exempted infrastructure vulnerabilitie s information from disclosure under the freedom of information act 5 usc 552 and stated that information provided voluntarily by nonfederal entities or individuals that relates to infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vul nerabilities to terrorism and is or has been in the possession of the department of homeland security shall not be subject to section 552 of title 5 united states code debate ensued regarding the exemption of critical infrastructure information from the freedom of information act foia the debate essen tially focused on the reconciliation of two public goods that come into conflict on the one hand the need to encourage voluntary information shari ng and on the other the demands of open government new foia exemption for critical infrastructure information was opposed by civil libertarians and advocat of open government on several grounds they testified that new exemption would jeopardize the ability to obtain information about abusive government prac tices would cast shroud of secrecyover one of the department of homeland secu ritys critical functions and was unnecessary because foia exemption 4 protects private companies against disclosures of trade secrets and confid ential business information and can be extended to critical infrastructure mater ial that properly should be withheld from disclosurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31762crs2 congressional research service the library of congressproponents of new foia exemption for cr itical infrastructure information testified that private i ndustry would be unwilling to voluntarily share critical infrastructure information with the fede ral government without assurances that its confidential business information woul d not be released by the government companies worried that if information sharing with the government becomes reality foia requests for information could prove embarrassing and costly in addition companies expressed concern t hat agency decisions about disclosure of business confidential data were fraught with ambiguity and discretion there were also concerns expressed by private indus try about antitrust and civil liability issues with respect to the willingness of some of those entities to provide information voluntarily to the federal government s pecifically in congressional hearings industry representatives expressed c oncern about disclosure under the freedom of information act thirdparty liability eg sharing suspected problems about piece of equipment before its being thoroughly t ested and verified the lack of defined antitrust exemption for appropriate information sharing concerning infrastructure vulnerabilities possible disclosure of inf ormation under state open records laws and

exemption was modified and new limitations on the use and disclosure of critical infrastructure information were included in separate subtitle title vii subtitle c sections 721 724 the select committee on homeland security significantly expanded upon the presidents proposal for an exemption from foia for information on infrastructure vulnerabilities sec tion 204 of hr 5005 was longer limited to the exemption from disclosure under foia of information on infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to terrorism its protections now extended to broad and newly defined category of information critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the dhs with an express statement of expectation of protection from disclosure the reported bill included some of the protections sought byindustryrepresentativ it provided exemption from disclosure under foia it provided that c overed information would not be used directly in civil actions it provided that critical infrast ructure information would not be used or disclosed by any federal employee except to further criminal investigation or prosecution or to disclose the information to congress or the

the criti cal infrastructure information act of 2002 ciia to be codified at 6 usc 131 et seq is found in subtitle b of title ii of the homeland security act s ections 211 215 ciia consists of group of provisions that address the circum stances under which the department of homeland security may obtain use and disclose critical infrastructure information as part of critical infrastructure protection program ciia establishes several limitations on the disclosure of critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to dhs the ciia was enacted in part to respond to the need for the federal government and owners and operators of the nations critical infrastructures to share information on vulnerabilities and threats and to promote information sharing between the private and public sectors in order to protect critical assets the homeland security act of 2002 adopted sections 721 725 of hr 5005 on critical infrastructure information verbatim congress enactment of the critical infrastructure information act of 2002 was and continues to be somewhat controversial the narrower senate ver sion s 2452 was not considered by the full senate or the house of rep resentatives when congress enacted the homeland security act on an accelerated schedule the homeland security act was approved by the house and the senate expeditiously with relatively little focus on its foia related provisions following is summary of the new law definitions the ciia includes 4 key definitions covered federal agency critical infrastructure information voluntary and xpress statement another keydefinition critical infrastructure is defined elsewhere in the homeland security act the most important definition in ciia is that of critical infrastructure information because the ciia protections are triggered only for such information critical infrastructures are defined elsewhere in the homeland security act section 24 of the homeland security act states that critical

1016e of the usa patriot act defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security nati onal economic security national public health or safety or any combination of these matters3this definition is viewed as broad catchall provision likely to cover wide array of activities critical infrastructure information is defined as information not customarily in the public domain and related to the security of critical infrastructure or protected systems actual potential or threatened interference with attack on compromise of or incapacitation of critical infrastructure or protected systems by either physical or computerbased attack or other similar conduct including misuse of or unauthorized access to all types of communications and data transmission sy stems that violates federal state or local law harms interstate commerce of

compromise or incapacitation4 this definition covers wide range of information and is further expanded by reference to the statutorydefinition of critical infrastructure from the usa patriot act5 covered federal agency is defined by the ciia as the department of homeland security on the house floor an amendment to this definition was offered and failed6amendment 25 would have amended the definition of covered agency to include not just the department of homeland security but any other agency designated by the department of homeland security or with which the department shares critical infrastructure information7 another important definition is of voluntary section 214 of the ciia protects critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the dhs

statement of expectation of protection from disclosure the term voluntary with respect to the submittal of critical infrastructure information to covered federal agency means the submittal thereof in the absence of such agencys exercise of legal authority to compel access or submission of such information and may be accomplished by single entity or an information sharing and analysis organization on behalf of itself or its members8the ciia defines information sharing and analysis organizations as any formal or informal entity or collaboration created or employed by public or private sector

filings that were also made with the securities and exchange commission or federal banking regulators statements made pursuant to the sale of securities or information or stateme nts submitted or relied upon as basis for making licensing or permitting determinati ons or during regulatory proceedings consequently information falling within the exclusion would not be protected from disclosure the last critical definition is of an express statement 10in order to obtain the protections of the ciia the submission must be accompanied by an express statement in the case of written information or records this means written marking on the information or records similar to this information is voluntarily submitted to the federal government in expectation of protection from disclosure as

sections of the homeland security act congress clearly directed that regulations be promulgated presumably it would have done the same here if that is what it sought judicial review of agencies interpretations of statutes entails significant element of deference as the supreme court emphasized in chevron usa inc v nrdc 40inchevron the court prescribed two inquiries that reviewing court should conduct when reviewing an agencys c onstruction of statute the first was whether congress has direc tly addressed the precise question at issue if so the court would have to give effect to the mbiguouslyexpressed intent of congress however if the statute were to prove silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue the remaining question was whether the agencys answer was permissible or as the court phras ed it reasonable interpretation chevron in effect creates presumption applicable to regulatory schemes in which congress has delegated power to an agency to whateve r extent the statute remains ambiguous the reviewing court should presume that c ongress has delegated to the agency the task of filling in the gap in some reasonable way criminal penalties section 214f contains

discloses information to the congress49 hypothetically if covered federal employee discloses protected critical infrastructure information without legal uthorization she would be in violation of ciia and for example could be fined imprisoned and removed from office or employment that is since ciia genera lly prohibits the disclosure of protected critical infrastructure information except for the purpose of criminal investigation or prosecution or to disclose protected information to congress or the general accounting office such disclosure would s ubject the covered federal employee to criminal sanctions under the ciia more over the protections of the ciia apply notwithstanding any other provision of law50under the wpa if covered federal employee disclosed protected criti cal infrastructure information without legal authorization she would not be protected by wpa if the disclosure was prohibited by law however the covered federa l employee would appear to be protected by wpa on the condition that such employee made any disclosure to the special counsel or to the inspector general of an agency which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences violation of any law rule or regulation or evidences gross mismanagement gross waste of funds an abuse of authority or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety51furthermore she would appear to be protected from the taking of any personnel action against an employee who discloses information to congress52 in addition it should be noted that section 883 of the homeland security act pl 107296 to be codified at 6 usc 463 expressly provides that nothing in this act shall be construed as exempting the department of homeland security from requirements applicable with respect to executive agencies

raised with respect to the criminal penalties provision in section 214f of the ciia wh ich applies to an officer or employee of the united states is whether members of congress and their staff could be criminally liable for the release of protected critical infrastructure information the ciia does not include definition of officer or employee of the united states section 214c of ciia prohibits

congress or to gao pr esumably for purposes of oversight the report of the select committee on homeland security on hr 5005 the homeland security act states that unauthorized disclosures of critical infrastructure information by anyus employee maybe punished by fines imprisonment up to one year and removal from employment54 in light of the fact that the underlying purpose of the ciia is to promote voluntary information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure through the establishment of statutor scheme designed to protect against unauthorized disclosures of confidential business information it is arguable that the criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of protected information were intended to apply to congress however if congress had thought it was including itself then disclosure from an officer or employee of the united states to congress might arguably not be disclosure at all just information shared between one officer of the united states and another officer of the united states and one could argue that the exception permitting disclosure to congress wouldnt have been necessary another consideration that supports the c onclusion that congress is not subject to the criminal penalty provision is the fact that one of the penalties is removal from employment this argues against the provision applying to congress since member of congress cannot be removed by statutory fiat but only by the constitutional process set out in article i section 5 of the constitution that is expulsion even though the plain meaning f an officer or employee of the united states could reasonably be interpret ed to include members of congress the supreme court had interpreted 18 usc 1001 prohibiting false statements in any matter before any agency or department of the united states as not applying to congress or the courts after more than 40 years of applying it to statements before some congressional entities55congress had to amend it to expressly include congress56in light of the hubbard precedent it would appear unlikely that the term officer or employee of the united states would be construed by court as applying to congress without more definitions or legislative history moreover the speech or debate clau of the us constitution prevents criminal prosecution of member of congress for what she says on the floor or during committee proceedings members of congress have immunity for their legislative acts under article i 6 cl 1 of the constitution which provides in part that for any speech or debate in either house senators and representatives shall not be questioned in any other place even if the actions of senator or representative are within the scope of the speech or debate clause or some other legal
