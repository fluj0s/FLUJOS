1974 erisa to protect the pensions of pa rticipants covered by most pr ivate sector defined benefit pension plans the pbgc receives appr opriated funds the agencys costs are offset by the assets of the plans that th pbgc takes over and pr emiums paid by the sponsors of covered pension plans the pr emiums are established by congress the pbgcs singleemployer program posted an alltime high defi cit of 23 billion in 2004 as of september 30 2006 the deficit was 18 billion the pbgc discloses an additional offbalance sheet liability for reasonably possible terminations as of september 30 2006 it was 73 billion although the pbgcs net position meas ured as assets minus liabilities improved 52 billion since 2004 it fell 310 b illion from 2001 to 2004 many factors have contributed to the pbgcs worsening financia l condition primary among them was the termination of seve ral large underfunded pension plans between 2002 and 2005 in the steel and airline industr ies plan terminations by airlines continue to threaten the pbgcs finances poor stock market returns in 2001 and 2002 and falling interest ra tes also contributed to the pbgcs recent problems as the pbgcs condition worsened congress and the bush administration considered reforms to addr ess the salient issues on august 17 2006 the president signed the pension protection act as p l 109280 it has been called the most comprehensive reform of the nations pens ion laws since the enactment of erisa the law establishes new rules that streng then funding requirements for most plans however it provides funding relief for plans sponsored by commercial airlines it also includes reforms that affect cash bala nce plans defined c ontribution plans and other forms of deferred compensation although the pbgc currently receives appropriations many expect that because it insures the pensions of 44 million americans its failure could require taxpayer funded bailout the governme nt accountability office gao added the pbgcs singleemployer insurance program to its list of highrisk areas in july of 2003 as of january 2007 it remains on gaos list because of its high deficit and because the ultimate impact of recent refo rms on the pbgcs finances is unclear this report focuses on the fi nancial condition of the pbgc and the effects of the pension protection act it will be updated upon major developm ents

singleemployer programthe financial health of the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc background1 the pension benefit guaranty corpora tion pbgc is federal government agency created by the employee retiremen t income security act erisa of 1974 to protect the pensions of pa rticipants covered by most pr ivate sector defined benefit pension plans the pbgc receives appr opriated funds the agencys costs are offset by the assets of the plans that th pbgc takes over and pr emiums paid by the sponsors of covered pension plans pbgc premiums are established by congress from 2002 to 2005 the termination of veral large underfunded pension plans sponsored by steel companies and airlin contributed to steadily worsening financial position for the pbgc although low interest rates and low stock market returns also contributed to the recent losses the primary threat to the pbgcs financial condition is underfunding in pens ion plans of financially weak sponsors in some cases plan terminations were preceded by years of low contributions or contributions which significantly increased underfunding the pension protection act of 2006 ppa addressed these issues by establishing new pension funding rules2 funded status of the pbgc single employer program3 the pbgcs singleemployer program posted deficit of 233 billion as of september 30 2004 the largest ficit in its history table 1

for the terms used in table 1 are provided in appendix pbgcs asset sources include premium income assets obtained from the trusts of terminated plans asse ts recovered from plan spons ors and investment earnings the pbgc asset holdings include cash equities stocks and fixed income securities bonds large losses in the stock market in 2001 and 2002 led the pbgc to change its allocation between stocks and bonds star ting in 2004 the following press release from january 2004 describes the policy change the pbgcs liabilities the fixed annuities the agency must pay to participants in trusteed pension plans are bondlike in nature pbgcs liabilities move in the opposite direction of interest rates increasing as interest rates fall and decreasing as interest rates rise under the new investment policy the pbgc will increase its investment in duration matched fixedincome securities over the next two years as result the portion of invested assets allocated to equities is expected to d ecline to between 15 percent and 25 percent of total invested assets from 37 percent as of the end of fiscal year 20034 the liabilities shown in table 1 include claims for plans that have already terminated as well as claims for terminations that the pbgc deemed probable ie that the pbgc expected to occur within the next twelve months in general these terminations are associated with plans whose sponsors are in bankruptcy and are unlikely to emerge from bankruptcy as go ing concerns without terminating their pension plans other probable claims in clude plans whose s ponsors have indicated that they intend to file for distress plan termination these liabilities appear on the balance sheet of the pbgcs financial statement5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs3 5 continued assets ie

10 pbgc annual management report 2006 p 3the net position equals the difference between assets and liabilities at given point in time when assets exceed liabilities the pbgc is in surplus position when liabilities exceed assets the pbgc is in deficit the change in net position from one year to the next is called the net gain or loss if negative for the year for example in fy2002 the pbgcs net pos ition decreased from 77 billion surplus to 36 billion deficit resulting in net loss of 114 billion for that year from 2001 to 2005 the pbgcs net position declined 305 billion which can be largely attributed to recordsetting claims eigh t of the pbgcs 10 largest claims since 1975 occurred during this period they accounted fo r more than 18 billion in claims to the pbgc6 the last row of table 1 shows reasonably possible exposure rpe which is risk measure that appears in the footnot and not on the balance sheet of the pbgcs financial statement rpe cannot be derived from the other values in the table in general it represents underfundi ng in plans sponsored by companies that are experiencing financial difficulty and whose plans are not expected to terminate in the near future ie not within the next 12 months7 some of the plans included in the expos ure for reasonably possible terminations can be expected to end up under pbgc trust eeship in the next few years the pbgc once used this measure as an estimate of expected future claims over 10year period see appendix b from 2001 to 2005 rpe increased nearly tenfold it declined 32 from 2005 to 2006 which the pbgc attri butes to net reduction in sponsors unfunded vested be nefit liabilities8 according to the pbgc the current level of rpe suggests that large claims against the singleemployer pension insurance program may continue9 as result of the airline relief provisi ons of the ppa some large plans that were previously classified as probable terminations have been changed from the probable classification to the reasona bly possible classification in fy200610 this effectively removed portion of the pbgcs liabilities from the balance sheet and placed them in the footnotes of the financial

15 pbgc maximum monthly guarantee tables available at httpwwwpbgcgov workersretireesfindyourpensionplanconten tpage789html this particular maximum applies to those who choose to retire at age 65 other maximums apply to those who retire at different ages on january 5 2007 the pb gc announced the takeover of delta airlines inc pilots retirement plan which terminated with 17 billion in assets to cover 47 billion in liabilities ie 3 billion in unfunded liabilities the net claim against the pbgc was significantly less 920 million due to w guaranteed maximum 30979 per employee per year in 2006 that applies in this case because pilots normal retirement age is 60 vs 65 in most plans98 billion in underfunding13 us airways cancelled one plan with 42 billion in liabilities and 17 b illion in assets14 in all these plans were more than 123 billion underfunded the net claim on the pbgc was somewhat less 89 billion because the pbgc imposes maximum guarant eed benefit limit 45614 per employee per year in 2005 on the plans it insures15 the magnitude of these claims can be traced to the airlines eroded profit margins after september 11 2001 and to the p erfect storm of fa lling interest rates combined with an underperforming stock ma rket but there was another contributing factor the funding rules in place prior to the passage of the ppa enabled sponsors of underfunded plans to make contributions to their plans if certain conditions applied practice that exacerbated plan underfunding and increased the level of claims made on the pbgc cursory desc ription of pension funding rules before and after the ppa followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs6 pension funding rules basic concepts according to erisa defined benefit pension plans must be funded during participants working careers accordingly each participant earns ie accrues some portion of his projected pension benefit with each year of employment ie year of service to the company the amount of pr ojected benefits earned in given year is called the normal cos t for that year the total ie cumulative amount of benefits earned by an employee for all past servi ce as of given date is called the accrued actuarial liability also referred to as accrued liability actuarial liability or liability normal costs and actuarial liabilities represent the value in presentday dollars of benefit payments that will be made many years in the future converting stream of future benefit payments into si ngle value is done by using an interest rate or discount rate to reflect the time value of money for example using 6 interest rate the present value of 1000 paym ent made 10 years in the future is 100010610 55839 if the payment is made 20 years in the future the present value is 100010620 31180 using higher intere st rate say 7 will produce lower present values 50835 for payment made in 10 years 25842 for payment in 20 years the comparison of accrued liabilities to the value of plan asse ts determines the plans funded status if the plans asse ts equal or exceed accrued liabilities the plan can be referred to as fully funded if accr ued liabilities exceed plan assets then the plan can be described as being underfunded having funde d ratio of less than 100 or having unfunded liabilities the amount of unfunded liab ilities ul is the difference between accrued liabilitie s and plan assets v that is ul v unfunded liabilities can arise from variet of sources experience losses eg when actual interest rates are different than assumed interest rates changes in assumptions eg when the assumed interest rate changes from one year to the next plan amendments eg plan design changes that increase the future benefits promised by the plan and unfunded past service lia bilities eg plan change that grants increased benefits attributable to past service in or der to pay off unfunded liabilities an amortization installment payment is cal culated for each category described above the sum over all categories of installment payments is the plans amortization payment for the year the sum of the normal cost contribution and the amortization payment as described above constitute plans minimum required contribution amount under erisa the basic concepts described above provide framework for understanding pension funding concepts however act ual pension funding rules are much more complex this is due in part to an adhoc approach to pension reform that prevailed from 1975 until the passage of the pe nsion protection act ppa of 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs7 16 the pension protection act of 2006 law explanation and analysis cch editorial staff publications p 91 as excerpted from erisa sec 302 and code sec 412 17 pension protection act of 2006 law explanation and analysis cch publications p 91pension funding rules prior to the ppa16 an employer maintaining singleemplo yer defined benefit pension plan must make an annual minimum funding contribution to ensure that the plan has sufficient assets with which to pay promised post retirement benefits the amount of the contribution must be sufficient to fund th plans normal cost and to amortize the plans unfunded liabilities over period not to exceed 30 years as indicated above unfunded liabilities arise for several reasons and fall into severa l categories old funding rules required different amortization periods for diffe rent types of losses for example experience losses were amortized over five years whereas losses due to plan amendments were amortized over 30 years funding rules require plans with unfunde d liabilities to be f unded more rapidly than fully funded plans however prior f unding rules deemed plan to be fully funded if its funding ratio exceeded 90 that is plans only needed to fund up to 90 of their plans liabilities for the pbgc this meant higher risk exposure if plan terminated while it was less than 100 funded the result was loss for the pbgc if plan contributes more than the minimum amount the excess is referred to as credit balance credit balances are notiona l accounts that grow at the plans assumed interest rate and can be used to offset s ubsequent required contributions to the plan as interest rates began to fall in the early 2000s liabilities gr ew which resulted in increased levels of minimum required contri butions some plans with sufficient credit balances chose to use up thei r credit balances rather than make cash contributions to their plans which resulted in rapidly declining funding ratios for those plans prior funding rules imposed maximum limit on plan contributions called the full funding limit the maximum was intended to prevent companies from using tax deductible excess pension contributions as means of tax avoidance but it had unintended results the effect of the fu ll funding limit is to prevent employers from making additional contributions to fully funded plan even if the accrued liability of the plan is greater than plan assets17 pension funding rules under the ppa funding rules the ppa implements target funding leve l that is 100 of plan liabilities this requirement is phased in as follows 92 in 2008 94 in 2009 96 in 2010 and 100 in 2011 and later years compared with the prior funding target of 90 this willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs8 18 pbgc annual management report 2006 p 10require larger contributions for many plan sponsors it will directly address the pbgcs exposure to risk due to plan underf unding this is perhaps the most visible funding rule change made by the ppa in addition the ppa require s all unfunded liab ilities to be amor tized over seven years prior rules used amortization periods ranging from 5 to 30 years depending on the type of liability being amortized this change simplifies some of the amortization rules and is expected to re move plans unfunded lia bilities more quickly the new law requires all plans that are less than 100 funded to pay variablerate premiums vrp equal to 9 per 1000 of underfunding vrps existed under prior law but some plans were exempt from paying them which resulted in lost premium income to the pbgc and lower contributi ons by sponsors of underfunded plans the pbgc collected 550 million in 2006 in vrp18 with fewer exemptions due to the ppa the pbgcs revenue from vrps is expected to increase starting in 2008 the ppa establishes an at risk category for plans that are less than 80 funded on standard basis or less th an 70 funded on an adjusted basis where the adjusted basis assumes that employees eligible to retire will do so as early as possible the 80 test will be phased in from 65 in 2008 to 80 in 2011 th plans will be subject to higher funding target and hi gher target normal cost and consequently will need to make larger funding contributions credit balances as previously stated under prior rules plans that contributed more than the minimum required amount built up credit balan ces that could be used to offset subsequent contributions the new law does not eliminate credit balances but it changes their use in two important ways 1 plans that are less than 80 funded may not use credit balances and 2 as of 2008 credit balances must be adjusted for subsequent investment gains and losses previously verely underfunded plans could forego contributions if they had sufficient credit balances the changes made by the ppa attempt to curtail this behavior in hopes of reduc ing both plan underfunding and the magnitude of future claims on the pbgc in addition to establishing minimum re quired contributions erisa also imposes maximum on contributions plans may contribute more than the maximum but they will not get tax deduction for doing so maximums were imposed to prevent companies from using large contributions as means of reducing taxes however the limits were defined in such way that cer tain underfunded plans were prevented from making contributions starting in 2008 th maximum deductible contributions will increase to 1 the plans normal cost plus 2 150 of the funding target plus 3 an allowance for future pay or benefit increases minus 4 the value of the plans assets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs9 19 in the absence of newly issued 30year bonds interest rates were extrapolated from the interest rates or yields on existing bonds eg 30year bonds issued in the prior year that were due to mature in 29 years with new issues the supply of the 30year bonds decreased which caused their prices to increa and their yields to decrease treasury resumed issuing 30year bonds in feb 2006contributions in excess of this limit are subject to 10 excise tax this replaces the full funding limit described above which is based on 90 of the plans current liability the change s hould increase the maximum deductible contribution amount and enable plans to make larger c ontributions without hitting the maximum benefit limitations on underfunded plans the ppa places benefit limits and other re strictions on plans that fail to meet certain funding thresholds shutdown be nefits unfunded paym ents made when factory shuts down and benefit accruals are prohibited by the ppa for plans that are less than 60 funded plan changes that increase benefits are not allowed for plans that are less than 80 funded lump sum pa yments are not allowed for plans that are less than 60 funded and fo r any underfunded plan whose sponsor is in bankruptcy these restrictions prevent sponsors from various forms of raiding pension funds prior to termination which would leave th pbgc with less mone to pay benefits smoothing one of the components of the perfect storm that contributed to the pbgcs financial problems was poor performance in the stock market for funding purposes plans were allowed to use asset values that were averaged over several years process called smoothing since plan sponsors generally prefer plan contribution amounts that are stable and predictable they are proponents of smoothing it dampens fluctuations in asset values and therefore in plan contributions from year to year when financial markets underperformed for seve ral consecutive years however smoothing had different effect smoothed asset valu exceeded market asset values for number of years as result plan underf unding was understated and contributions calculated using these values were inadequate which further exacerbated underfunding the administration proposed th complete removal of smoothing from funding rules congress chose to retain smoothing but reduced the duration from four years to two years the shortened smoothi ng period also applies to the practice of setting discount rates interest rates interest rates are used to determine the value of plans liabilities ie the present value of future benefits promised by the plan historically the rate used was based on 30year treasury bond rates but in 2001 the treasury departme nt stopped issuing these bonds which caused the rates on exis ting bonds to drop and plan liabilities to increase19 the pension funding equity act p l 108218 allowed the use of long term corporate bond rates which are gene rally higher than treasury bond rates but only for the plan years 2004 and 2005 without revision of pl 108218 interest rates would have reverted to treasury bond ra tes in 2006 which would have increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs10 20 flat premiums are indexed to average national wage growth accordingly the rate for 2007 is 31 per participant per year the term partic ipants refers to plan members who are active employees retirees and deceased persons with surviving beneficiaries 21 pbgc annual management report 2006 p 15liabilities once again the ppa makes perm anent the use of corporate bond rates to determine plan liabilities in addition the ppa replaces the traditional us of single rate with several rates taken from yield curve the administrati on proposed the use of many different rates in the end congress adopted three rate versi on of the yield curve one rate will apply to payments due in 05 years second rate will apply to payments due in 619 years and third rate will apply to payments due in 20 years or more the rates will be based on the yields of highrated cor porate bonds with similar maturities pbgc premiums the pbgc collects flatrate pre miums 30 per participant in 200620 from all plan sponsors and variablera premiums vrps from sponsors of underfunded plans 9 per 1000 of underfunding the pbgc collected 550 million in vrps in 200621 with the ppa allowing fewer exemptions however vrp collections are expected toincrease starting in 2008 the ppa makes permanent surcharge premium for certain distress terminations which was added by the ficit reduction act of 2005 p l 109171 and was set to expire in 2010 surcharge of 1250 per par ticipant will be assessed for three years against any firm that terminates an unde rfunded pension plan during bankruptcy and later emerges from bankruptcy while some advocate wholesale premium increases to address the pbgcs financial condition significan t premium increases are probl ematic major cause of premium inadequacy is large claims from past terminations but terminated plans do not make premium payments through pr emium increases the underfunding of past terminations is borne by ongoing plans ma ny of which keep their plans fully funded more broadly pbgc premiums are seen as one of the many burdens that sponsors of defined benefit pension plans face significant premium increases could dissuade employers from sponsoring defi ned benefit plans and perh aps lead some sponsors to terminate existing plans relief for airlines under the ppa although the ppa generally requires plan sponsors to make larger contributions than required under previous law it estab lishes an optional set of rules for plans sponsored by commercial airlines and by catering businesses that principally serve commercial passenger airlines concerne d that the standard requirements would consume cash that the airlines need to keep their businesses in operation congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs11 22 airlines also have the option of choosin g to amortize their current unfunded liabilities over ten year period instead of 17 years however in all other respects the standard funding rules would apply ie future gains and losses would be amortized over seven yearscreated alternative requirements in hope s of avoiding bankruptcies and plan terminations in the airline industry the alternative rules allow airlines more time 17 years instead of 7 years to amortize their unfunded liabilities and let them value their lia bilities at an interest rate of 885 instead of at marketbased ra tes which are currently lower see table 3 sponsors who avail themselves of these ru must freeze benefit accruals in their plans which means their employees will not earn additional retirement benefits during the freeze furthermore if those spons ors declare bankruptcy and terminate their pension plans within five years and then later emerge from bankruptcy they will be subject to higher termination rcharges 2500 instead of 1250 payable per participant for three years22 table 2 shows plan information taken from the most recently available sec filings for

delta and american values are for plan year 2007 northwest values are for plan year 2006 while combining asset and liability values from different plan years is problematic the point being made is illustrative the primary use of these values is not meant to accurately represent the level of unfunded liabilities for these airlines or for the pbgc the point is to demonstrate the impact of using an interest rate of 885 on reported unfunded liabilities these values can be used to illustrate the impact of the alternative ppa funding rules on reported unf unded liab ilities combined these airlines report 8 billion in unfunded liabilities base d on 19 billion in assets 27 billion in liabilities and weighted average interest rate of roug hly 587 rate that is tied to existing corporate bond rates under the alternative rules however the interest rate used to value liabilities would be 885 this could reduce the reported liabilities by as much as 8 billion ie from 27 billion to 19 billion and the reported unfunded liabilities from 8 billion to 0 however in the event that these plans terminate the losses to the pbgc would not be similarly reduced although the pbgc s loss is not identical to that planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs12 23 pbgc annual report 2005 p 11reported unfunded lia bilities under standard rules the two values are related both values are based on actual inte rest rates found in the market place allowing airlines to use an interest rate of 885 when act ual market rates are significantly lower effectively masks the threat that these plans pose to the pbgc over the long term airline relief could result in improved funding for plans sponsored by airlines but it does not preclude the possibility that these plans will terminate and leave the pbgc with significant losses prognosis for the pbgc projecting the pbgcs financial future is difficult task the pbgcs annual reports include 10year projection from their pension insurance modeling system pims

deficit could be as high as 55 billion and 6 chance that the pbgc will be in surplus position23 these results do not reflect the effects of the ppa they will be included in the 2006 annual reports pims projections critical assumption used in projecting the pbgcs financial condition is the level of net claims expected in the future review of the claims assumptions used in past financial projecti

express the future expected net position of the pbgc in terms of distribution similarly pims ssumptions express expected future claim levels in terms of distribution fr om that distribution the pbgc reports the mean the median and the 90th percentile claims levels the values in table 3 represent the mean of the assumed claims distribution for 2005 the 90th percentile claims were 3100 million ie the distribution assumed that there was 10 chance that claims from 2006 to 2015 would be as high as 31 billion more detailed desc ription of assumed clai ms distributions can be found in appendix b 25

pension plans take healthy turn wall street journal jan 23 2007 p a4in table 3 the actual fiscal year claims represent historical claims on the pbgc for that fiscal year the annual average expected claims represent the pbgcs average expected claims for the ensu ing decade for example th expected average claims of 1700 million for 2005 indicates that pims projects total claims of 17 billion annually from 2006 to 2015 ie 17 billion for the 10 year period24 given that claims in 2005 alone were more than 10 b illion some feel that the pims assumed claims levels and its projected results ar optimistic in its september 2005 projection the congressional budget office cbo ssumed average claims of 487 billion from 2004 to 2013 which is much higher than what pims assumed25 the government accountability offi ce gao placed the pbgcs single employer program on its list of government programs and operations that it identifies as high risk in july of 2003 gao cited the pbgcs premium structure weak pension funding rules and large potential sses as threats to the pbgcs financial health as of january 2007 the pbgc remains on the highrisk list gao recognizes that the ppa addresses many of its concerns but contends that the ultimate impact of the new law is unclear many of these reforms will be phased in gradually postponing their potentially positive effect on plan funding while other changes could have the effect of increasin g pbgcs financial exposure26 conclusion recently the pbgcs financial results have shown improvement in 2005 the pbgcs net position improved by 529 million see table 1 even though it experienced more than 10 billion in claims that year offsetting those claims were rising interest rates which lowered liabilities and positive investment gains the private sector has seen similar improvement in the funding status of its pensions due to improving financial conditions fortune 100 companies ended 2006 with an aggregate funded status of 102 up from 82 in 200227 this highlights the degree to which pension finances can fluctuate over time and helps explain why they are difficult to predicthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33937crs14 the pbgcs financial risk is directly related to underfunding in pension plans sponsored by financially weak entities the record losses from 2002 to 2005 were attributable to falling inte rest rates an underperfor ming stock market financially weakened industries as well as pension funding rules that enabled and exacerbated plan underfunding interest ra tes and the stock market ve rebounded of late and the pbgcs net gains from 2004 to 2006 reflect th is in addition the pension protection act ppa has reformed funding rules by increasing the primary funding threshold from 90 to 100 requiring plans to am ortize their unfunded liabilities over seven years and overhauling rules that enabled pl an sponsors to forego plan contributions while their liabilities increased because th new funding rules apply to plan years starting after 2007 with some rules phasing in over number of years starting in 2008 their full impact on the pbgcs fina ncial condition will unfold over the next few years for plans maintained by commercial airlines the ppa creates special rules that provide funding relief to elig ible plans these plan sponsors may elect to amortize their unfunded liabilities over long period of time 17 years in stead of 7 and to value their liabilities at an interest rate 885 that is nearly 3 higher than some airlines are currently using see table 3 congress created these rules out of concern that funding requirements would consume cash th at these sponsors need to keep their businesses in operation the hope is that ba nkruptcies and plan terminations might be avoided although these rules have already enabled the pbgc to remove some airlines liabilities from their balance sheet by reclassifying them as reasonably possible the pension plans of commercial ai rlines continue

assumptions provided in table 3 for projections performed prior to 1998 three projection resu lts were reported based on three distinct assumptions regardin g the level of claims over 10year period 1 lowlevel claims average annual net claims over pbgcs entire history 2 midlevel claims average annua l net claims over shorter period 3 pessimistic claims reasonably possible exposure divided by ten in 1998 the pims became the pbgcs modeling system it substituted distributions for the threepart nature of the prior model that is both the assumed claims levels and the projection results were expressed in terms of distributions for the expected claims level the pbgc reporte d the distributions 1 mean 2 median and 3 90th percentile claims levels comparison of these assumptions to actual historical
