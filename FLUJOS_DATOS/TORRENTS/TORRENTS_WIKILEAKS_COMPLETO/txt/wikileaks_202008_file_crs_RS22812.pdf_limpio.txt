policymakers at all levels of government in recent years hate crime is defined as criminal offense against person or property motivated in whole or in part by the offenders bias against race religion di sability ethnicnational origin or sexual orientation2 congress has recognized the special c oncerns and effects of hate crimes by enacting several laws such as the civil rights act of 19683 the hate crimes statistics act of 19904 and the hate crimes senten cing enhancement act of 19945 current federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22812crs2 5 continued provide sentencing enhancement of not less

federally protected activity6 legislation is pending that would expand the scope of hate crime victims to include gender sexual orientation genderiden tity and di sability in addition pending legislation would broaden the circumstances under which the federal government would ssert jurisdiction to prosecute such crimes 7 in light of the united states supreme court decision in united states v morrison 8 there are questions as to what underlying authority congress may utilize to expand the scope of hate crimes to c over violence based on gender sexual orientation gender identity andor disability the commerce clause section 5 of the fourteenth amendment and section 2 of the thirteenth and fifteenth amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing congresss authority to proscribe hate crimes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation commerce clause article i section 8 clause 4 of the united states constitution authorizes congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states there are three categories of activities subject to congressional regulation under the commerce clause congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce9 or persons or things in intersta commerce although the threat may come only from intrastate activities10 finally congress may regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce11 the court narrowed the affects interstate commerce category with its decision in morrison by rejecting the argument that cong ress may regulate noneconomic violent criminal conduct based solely on that conducts aggr egate effect on interstate commerce12 in this case the court

amendments are the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the us constitution the 13th amendment abolishes slavery the 14th amendment prohibits the states from denying equal protection of the law due process or the privileges and immunities of us citizenship the 15th amendment forbids either the fede ral government or the states from denying or abridging the right to vote on the ba sis of an individuals r ace color or previous condition of servitude 17 the 13th amendment states that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted sh all exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction 18 section 1 of the 15th amendment states that the right of citizens of the united states to vo shall

continuedvirginia polytechnic institute who alleged that two university football players raped her the defendants and the university argued th at the violence against women act which allowed victims of gendermotivated violence to bring federal civil suits for damages exceeded congresss authority under the comme rce clause the court agreed with the defendants despite the cong ressional findings that genderm otivated violence deterred interstate travel diminis hed national productivity and increased medical costs13 the court concluded that upholding the viol ence against women act would open the door to federalization of virtually all serious crime as well as family law and other areas of traditional state regulation14 the court said that congress must distinguish between what is truly national and what is truly local and that its power under the commerce clause reaches only the former15 as such it would appear that any attempts to broaden the scope of hate crime legislation tied to findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crime s under the commerce clause are constitutionally suspect however it would appear that hate crimes that involve inters tate travel continue to be within the commerce clauses reach reconstruction amendments16 while the expansion of hate crime legislation may be suspect under the commerce clause it may be within the scope of other legislative powers such as the legislative clauses of the 13th17 14th and 15th18 amendments19 the legislative clauses of the aforementioned amendments give congress the power to enforce the amendments by appr opriate legislation morrison addresses the breadth of congresss legislative power under section 5 of the 14th amendment20 under section 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22812crs4 20 continued state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws 21 id at 621 22 griffin v breckenridge 403 us 88 105 1971 quoting jones v alfred h mayer co 392 us 409 1968 23 civil rights cases 109 us 311 1883 see also jones v alfred h mayer co 392 us 409 441 1968 stating that the thirteenth amendm ent authorizes congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of society half slave and half free by securing to all citizens of every race and color the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizensthe congress is vested with power to enforce by appropria legislation the amendments provisions however in morrison the court pointed out that state action not private is covered as such s ection 5 does not authorize legislation directed exclusively against the action of private persons without refere nce to the laws of the state or their administration by her officers21 therefore hatedriven denials by state officers or those acting under the color of law of equa l protection or due pro cess or the right to vote fall within the scope of the legislative sections of the 14th and 15th amendments conversely it would appear that hate crime s committed by private individuals not acting under the color of law are bey ond the scope of amendments however section 2 of the 13th amendment may be more viable option of broadening hate crime gislation unlike the 14th amendment the 13th amendment proscribes slavery and involuntar servitude without reference to federal state or private action the court has observed that the va rieties of private conduct that congress may make criminally punishable extend far beyond the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude congre ss has the power under the 13th amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery and the authority to translate that determination into ffective legislation22 section 2 of the 13th amendment envisions legislati on for the benefit of those who bore the burdens of slavery and their descenda nts race andor color but it is unclear as to whether it is an appropriate authority for congress to expand the range of victims of hate crimes eg re ligion national origin etc two questions come to mind first does violence based on bigotry constitute bad ge andor incident of slavery second if so must the remedial legislation be limited to the descendants of those for whose principal benefit the am endments were adopted in series of cases the court has obser ved that section 2 clothes congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the united states23 one could argue that due to the courts decision in morrison demonstrating reluctance to expand congresss use of the commerce clause to address gendermotivated violence it is unc lear as to whether the court would consider the same violence as badge or incident of slavery under the 13th amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22812crs5 24 saint francis college v alkhazraji 481 us 604 61011 1987 25 for more extensive discussion of 1st amendment considerations refer to crs report rl34200 burning crosses hangmans nooses and the li ke state statutes that proscribe the use of symbols of fear and violence with the

see wisconsin v mitchell 508 us 476 1993 finding that state statute which enhanced the punishment for an offense whenever the defenda nt selected the victim because of the race religion color disability sexual orientation nati onal origin or ancestry of the victim did not violate the 1st amendment because the statute was aimed at conduct unprotected by the 1st amendment 29 rav v city of st paul 505 us 377 1992 declaring local ordinance criminalizing the display on public or private property of an ite m known to arouse anger alarm or resentment unconstitutional as it was content based only proscribing activities which conveyed messages concerning particular topics 30 idhowever the court has not yet addressed the issue of how broad this congressional authority is in construing the civil rights statutes enacted contemporaneously with the 13th 14th and 15th amendments the court held that arabs and jews would have been considered distinct races at the time the statutes were passed and the amendments drafted debate d and ratified24 as this case addressed the issue of race the question of whether religion can be used as race indicator remains unanswered in other words would romancatholic met hodist or episcopalian be c onsidered distinct race in the 19th century as such it is unclear as to whether this would be considered sufficient to embrace all religi ous discrimination other constituti onal limitations there are other c onstitutional limits upon the manner in which congress andor states ma enact hate crime legislation the court has considered constitutional ch allenges regarding state hate crime statutes under both the 1st and 6th amendments25 the 1st amendment declares that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech the 14th amendments due process clause imposes the same restriction upon the states26 many of whose constitutions have comparable limitation on state legislative action27 under the 1st amendment the cour t has decided several cases which provide the framework in which states must act to protect the constitutionality of hate crime legislation generally the constitutional distinction boils down to the difference between conduct and speech if the statutes aim is to punish conduct then it will generally be upheld28 however if the intent behind the st atute is to punish speech thought or expression then courts are more apt to strike down the statute29 for example in rav v city of st paul30 the court struck down local or dinance as being overbroad and because the regulation was c ontentbased proscribing only activities which conveyedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22812crs6 31 508 us 476 1993 32 538 us 343 2003 33 id at 363 34 the 6th amendment states that in all criminal prosecutions the accused sh all enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state nd district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense 35 530 us 466 2000 36 id at 490messages concerning particul ar topics however in wisconsin v mitchell 31 the court found that wisconsin statute providing sent ence enhancement for biasmotivated crimes did not violate defendants 1st amendment right as the statute was directed towards the defendants conduct and not ex pression most recently in virginia v black 32 the court found that the 1st amendment permits state to ou tlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because burning cr oss is particularly virulent form of intimidation33 however in separate ruling the court found that the virginia statute banning all cross burnings is f acially invalid as it impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to demonstrate that he or she did not intend the cross burning as intimidation the 6th amendment 34 also provides constitutional limits on hate crime statutes the 6th amendment provides defendants right to jury trial in apprendi v new jersey 35 the court struck down new jerseys hate crime law which allowed judge to increase sentence to double the statutory maximum if he or she found by preponderance of the evidence that the defendant acted with purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race in reversing the lower courts decision the court declared that the jury trial and notification clauses of the 6th amendment and the due process clauses of the 5th and 14th amendments embody principle th at insists that except in the case of recidivists judge could not on his own findings sentence criminal defendant to term of imprisonment greater than the statutory maximum assigned for which he had been convicted by the jury in other words other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt36
