congress reauthorized the sugar price support program with some changes in the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill the sugar program is designed to guarantee the price received by sugar crop growers and processors and intended to operate at cost to the us treasury to accomplish this the us department of agriculture usda limits the amount of sugar that processors can sell domestically under marketing allotments and restricts imports at the same time usda seeks to sure that supplies of sugar are adequate to meet domestic demand cost is ach ieved if usda applies these tools in way that maintains market prices above minimum pri ce support levels as of january 1 2008 sugar imports from mexico longer are restricted under the rules of the north american free trade agreement other imports are allowed entry under other free trade agreements f tas the congressional budget office and usda projected that if the sugar prog ram continued without change additional imports would bring prices down below s upport levels make it more attractive for processors to default on price support loans and result in program costs to address the potential for us suga r surplus caused by additional imports the 2008 farm bill mandates sugarforetha nol program usda is now required to purchase as much usproduced sugar as n ecessary to maintain market prices above support levels to be sold to bioenergy producers for processing into ethanol funding is openended for this program other provisions increase the minimum guaranteed prices for raw gar and refined beet sugar by 4 to 5 mandate an 85 market share for the us sugar production sector and remove certain discretionary authority that usda exercises to administer import quotas the enacted final sugar pr ovisions reflect the proposal s presented to the house and senate agriculture committees by produ cers of sugar beets and sugarcane and the processors of these crops they favor ed continuing the structure of the current sugar price support program but sought chan ges to enhance their position in the us marketplace their sugarforethanol provisions ensure that the prospect of imports adding to us sugar supplies under any fu ture trade agreements will not undermine the programs price guarantee and the gar industrys market share food and beverage manufacturers that use suga r opposed the new programs provisions arguing that costs to consumers will increase and that new requirements will restrict the flow of sugar for food use in the dom estic market the bush administration opposed these provisions with the presiden t identifying them as one reason why he vetoed the farm bill usda estimates tight domestic sugar supply in fy2009 due to reduced production current import pr ojections based on import quot decisions made to date and on the amounts estimated to enter from mexico and other fta partners do not point to sugar surplus in the near term accordingly attention will

the us departme nt of agriculture usda announced key provisions for the fy2009 sugar program to reflect the changes made by the 2008 farm bill usda set the fy2009 ove rall allotment quantity oaq the amount that sugar processors can sell domestically and announced the fy2009 raw sugar and refined sugar import quotas usdas statement acknowledged that it expects the domestic market will requi re additional supplie s of sugar during fy2009 and indicated that appropriate adju stments will be made to these two key parameters to ensure the availability of adequate s upplies of sugar see implementation under controlling sugar s upply to protect sugar prices below for details on both decisions overview of sugar program the sugar program is designed to guarantee the minimum price received by growers of sugarcane and sugar beets and by the firms raw sugar mills and beet refiners that process these crops into sugar to accomplish this the usda limits the amount of sugar that processors can sell domestically under marketing allotments and restricts imports usda is required to operate the sugar program on nocost basis this means usda must regulate the us sugar supply using allotments import quotas and related authorities so that domestic market prices do not fall below guaranteed minimum price levels these are set out in law as specified loan rates which serve as the basis from which usda derives effective support levels if the market price is below th support level when sugar price support loan comes due its nonrecourse feature means processor can exercise the legal right to forfeit or hand over sugar offered to usda as collateral for the loan in fulfillment of its repayment obligation this report fo cuses on the issues raised by the sugar program provisions in the house and senate farm bills see appendix for sidebyside comparison of the sugar provisions in the enacted 2008 farm b ill with previous law and the house and senate farm bill provisions for background information see crs report rl33541 background on sugar policy issues issues in 2008 farm bill debate consideration of future us sugar polic revolved primarily around four issues these were where to set the level of minimum price guarantees to be made availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34103crs2 1 for sugar the loan rate is the price pe r pound at which the commodity credit corporation ccc usdas financing arm extends nonrecourse loans to processors this short term financing at below market interest rate s enables processors to hold their commodities for later sale 2 the loan rates alone do not serve as the intende d price guarantee or floor price for sugar in practice usda sets marketing allotments and import quota levels in order to support raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar at slightly hi gher price levels each price level takes into account the loan rate interest paid on pr ice support loan transportation costs for raw sugar certain marketing costs for beet sugar and discounts these are frequently referred to as loan forfeiture levels or the level of effective price support 3 the loan rate for refined beet sugar reflects the requirement that it be set each year equal to 1285 of that years raw cane sugars loan rate beginning in fy2010to processors how to use two tools to ma nage us sugar supply authorizing any sugar surplus to be used as feedst ock for ethanol and accounting for projected program costs though i ndustrial users of sugar in food and beverage products initially explored converting the sugar prog ram to operate similar to the programs in place for the major grains oilseeds and cotton this policy option did not receive further attention level of sugar price support usda is required to extend price support loans to sugar processors that meet certain conditions on passing program benefits to the fa rmers that supply them with sugar beets or sugarcane these loans are made at statutorily set loan rates1 and account for most of the effective support level made available to producers and processors usda is required to use its ot her tools to protect this price guarantee2 loan rates for raw cane sugar have not ch anged since 1985 for refined beet sugar since 1992 these minimum prices have guar anteed producers of sugar crops and the processors that convert these crops into gar us price that since the early 1980s has ranged from two to four times the price of sugar traded in the world marketplace the farm bill conference agreement will increase sugar loan rates by 4 to 5 by fy2012 conferees split the difference between the house and senateproposed rate increases and adopted the senate pproach that proposed to increase rates in stages each year the loan rate for raw cane sugar would rise in quartercent increments from the current 180 per pound to 1875lb beginning with the 2009 sugarcane crop the refined beet sugar an rate beginning with the 2009 sugar beet crop would similarly increase in stages from the current 229 per pound to 241lb in fy20123 appendix provides loan rates for each of the fiscal years covered by 2008 farm bill authority growers and processors had initially sought one cent increase in the raw cane sugar loan rate with corresponding increase in the refined beet sugar rate and had acknowledged their satisfaction with receivi ng half of their request in the house passed farm bill they argued that the increase in the loan rate is needed to cover increased production costs particularly energy inputs sugar users countered that the houseproposed higher loan rates would incr ease costs to taxpayers by an additional 100 million annually they also noted that while the bills ethanol provisions seehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34103crs3 4 letter to members of congress from food and beverage companies and trade associations and public interest groups july 13 2007sugar for ethanol below are supposedly designed to deal with surpluses the loan rate increase can only encourage higher surplus production4 t h b u s h administration in its statement of admin istration policy on the house and senate farm bills opposed the increase in the loan rates for sugar controlling sugar supply to protect sugar prices the sugar program uses two tools import quotas and ma rketing allotments to ensure that producers and proce ssors receive price support benefits by regulating the amount of foreign sugar allowe d to enter and the quantity of sugar that processors can sell usda can for the most part keep market prices above effective support levels meet the nocost objective and ensure that domestic sugar demand is met if these tools are implement ed as intended the likelihood that usda acquires sugar due to loan forfeitures is remote import quotas the united states must import sugar to cover demand that the us sugar production sector cannot supply however usda restricts the quantity of foreign sugar allowed to enter for refining andor sale to manufacturers for domestic food and beverage use quotas are used to ensure that the quantity that enters does not depress the domestic market price to be low support levels quota amounts are laid out in us market access commitments made under world trade organization wto rules and under bila teral free trade agreements ftas the sugar program authorized by the 2002 farm bill accommodated or made room for imports of up to 1532 million tons each year this import level is one of the four factors that usda used to estab lish the national sugar allotment called the overall allotment qua ntity and reflected us trade commitments under two trade agreements in effect when the 2002 program was authorized table 1 table 1 annual us sugar import commitments when the 2002 farm bill was enacted short tons world trade organization quota minimuma1256000 north american free trade agreement nafta mexico quota maximumb 276000 total 1532000 covers both raw sugar and refined sugar b applied only through

exported to the us market with this opening though importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34103crs4 5 however the recent increase in us hfcs prices due to the higher cost of corn its main input may reduce its competitiveness against mexicanpriced sugar to the extent this price difference narrows the incentive for mexican bottlers of soft drinks to shift to hfcs is lowered 6 us sugar processors also are now free to xport sugar to mexico to take advantage of the occasional higher prices there 7 most of the sugar access provisions in the dominican republiccentral american fta drcafta already are in effect congress has yet to consider the ftas with panama and colombia which would grant additional acce ss for their sugar to the us marketcould fluctuate from year to year for vari ous reasons first the amount of mexican sugar exported to the us market will depend largely upon the extent that us exports of historically cheaper highfructose corn syrup hfcs displace mexican consumption of mexicanproduced sugar surplus mexican sugar in turn would then likely move north to the united states5 second mexicos sugar output though trending upward does vary from year to year depending upon weather and growing conditions mexican government policy also is to hold three months worth of sugar stocks in reserve and to allow sugar impor ts when needed to meet demand and lower prices6 third mexican sugar prices in recent years have for the most part been higher than us sugar prices to the ex tent that this occurs the incentive for mexican sugar mill to export sugar north in search of better price is reduced fourth us buyers concerns about the quality of mexican sugar may limit the amount that actually flows north in the next few years also the united states has committed under other existing and pending bilateral ftas to allow for additional sugar imports7 such imports in 2013 the fifth year of the sugar program authorized by the 2008 farm bill could total from about 420000 tons to 1215 million tons above existing wto and fta trade commitments and the amount of unrestricted sugar imports that could enter from mexico the wide range reflects two varying assumptions made to estimate by how much hfcs use in mexico might displace sugar consumption in mexico and create surplus available for export to the us market legislation the sugar program provisions in the farm bill conference report did not directly address the issue of additional sugar imports instead new sugar forethanol program is authorized to handle the pricerelated impact of such imports section 9001 in the energy title see sug ar for ethanol and program costs below however other provisions pr escribe how usda must now administer import quotas to cover shortfalls because of hurricanes or othe r disastrous events in what domestic sugar processors can sell under allotments usda is directed to ensure that most imports enter in the fo rm of raw cane sugar rather than refined sugar while historically most permitted imports have entered in raw form usda allowed large quantitie s of refined sugar to enter after the late 2005 hurricanes significantly affected the ability of cane refineries in louisiana and florida to process raw sugar unlike 20012002 when the congre ss considered the last farm bill most cane refineries are now key part of ver tically integrated ope rations owned by raw sugar processors andor sugarcane producer s the 2008 farm bills policy change is intended to ensure that these cane refineri which process raw sugar into refined sugar can more fully use

provisions found only in the house passed bill that would have directed usda to regu late when and how much raw cane sugar imports are allowed to be shipped to us cane refineries while usda announced shipping patterns in fy2003fy2005 the impact of the hurricanes led to decision not to follow this longstanding practice in fy2006fy2008 usda justified removing these restrictions because of changes occurring over time in the domestic marketing of cane sugar the house passed provisions could be viewed as intending to increase the transaction costs for countries that export larger amounts of sugar to the us market and giving slight competitive edge to domestic processors with respect to buyers food and beve rage firms opposed micromanaging the timing of imports noting that the applica tion of such rules will limit the ability of cane refiners to efficiently use their processing capacity and could lead to serious shortfalls at times in the amount of sugar supplied to the market8 in commenting on the house bill the bush administration expressed concern over requiring shipping patterns for quota sugar imports also several countries eligible to ship sugar to the us market expressed concern that the proposed regulation of the flow of imports would run counter to us trade commitments because of the concern expressed that prescribing how sugar import shipping pa tterns should be admin istered would open up the united states to challenges by sugar exporting countries in the wto these provisions were dropped in conference9 implementation in line with the changes made by the 2008 farm bill usda on september 9 2008 announced that the fy2009 raw sugar tariffrate quota trq10 will be set at 1231497 million strv the us minimum access commitment for raw sugar imports under wt

highlighted the significance of one change that will s oon take effect on august 6 2008 usda announced 300000 strv increase in the fy2008 refined sugar trq this decision was based on its assessment that the united states is experiencing tight market for refined sugar due to the cap acity lost after the explosion of cane refinery in february 2008 and reducti on in estimated 2008 sugar beet production refined sugar imported against this trq in crease is allowed to enter until december 31 20 08 the american sugar alliance pr oducers of sugar crops and firms that process them responded that this action was premature stating that usda has made marketmoving announcement base d on unknowns in the us sugar market more than 14 months from now the international sugar trade coalition istc representing the sugar industries in 17 of th 39 countries that are eligible to export raw sugar under the trq to the united stat expressed concern that the increase is inconsistent with congress intent on how usda is to implement the new trq administration provisions the coalitions concern is that because the period for delivery of refined sugar extends past october 1 2008 when the 2008 farm bill provisions take effect this decision discriminates against its members legitimate access to the us sugar market it pointed to the new requirement that any increase in the sugar trqs before april 1 in marketing year must first be made in the raw sugar trq which its members can supply and only then if needed by an increase in the refined sugar trq the sweetener users association domestic manufacturers of food and beverage products that us sugar praised usdas actions and strongly disagreed with the coalitions claim that usda violated the new farm bill its spokesman stated that usda acted consistently with the law and on the conservative side acknowledgin g that there is need for additional sugar supplies in the near term usda commented that the coalitions complaint was irrelevant because the new provision does not take effect until october 1 200812 marketing allotments in the 2002 farm bill the domestic production sector accepted mandatory limits on the amount of gar that processors can sell known as marketing allotments in return for th assurance of price protection it viewed allotments as way to try to capture any growth in us sugar demand and assumed that the thenus sugar import quota co mmitments would continue without changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34103crs7 see import quotas above the statute however sti pulated that if 1 usda estimates imports will be bove 1532 million short tons and 2 that such imports would lead usda to reduce th amount of domestic sugar that us processors can sell then usda must suspend marketing allotments suspending allotments because of additional imports raises the prospect of downward pressure on market prices if most us sugar demand is already met if the additional imports were to cause the price to fall below support levels fo rfeitures would occur and usda would be unable to meet the nocost requirement including the allotment suspension provision in the 2002 farm bill was designed to ensure that usda not lose control over managing us sugar supplies for f ear of the consequences that could be unleashed ie demonstrate its inability to implement congressional policy legislation implementation of the 2002 fa rm bills marketing allotment authority resulted in the us sugar pr oduction sectors share of domestic food consumption ranging from low of 73 in fy2006 to high of 89 in fy2004 concerned that their market share woul d decline as sugar imports increase under various trade agreements see import quotas above sugar producers and processors decided to pursue different pproach in formulating their proposals for the 2008 farm bill adopted by farm b ill conferees an important new provision guarantees that the domestic production s ector always benefits from minimum 85 share of the us sugarforfood market usda is now required to nnounce an overall allotment quantity oaq th amount of sugar that all processors combined can sell that represents at least 85 of estimated domestic sugar consumption this is intended to addre ss the sectors objective that imports not displace the ability of us sugar processo rs to sell more of their output in each successive year to the extent that us demand for sugar grows implementation on september 9 2008 usda announced that the fy2009 oaq will be 8925 million strv this complie s with the new statutory requirement that usda establish the

parameters to ensure the market is adequately supplied13 though the 2008 farm bill limits usdas ability to allow additional sugar im ports under the trqs established to meet us wto trade commitments usda could exercise some flexibility usda could interpret the laws discretionary language to determine that an emergency sugar shortage exists and allow additional imports to the extent it determines that market prices will not fall below s upport levels to result in loan forfeitures the sugar production sector likely will argue that there is need for add itional imports pointing out that there is

agricultural crops and waste separately hawa ii mandated effective april 2006 that 85 of the gasoline sold must contain 10 ethanol this requirement assumes that over time the sugarcane produced on the islands will be used as the prime feedstock for ethanol if the cost of feedstock is exclude d producing ethanol from sugar cane can be less costly than producing it from corn this is because the starch in corn must first be broken down into sugar before it can be fermented this extra step adds to the cost of processing corn into ethanol when contrasted to using sugarcane or processed sugar further sugar cane waste bagasse also can be burned to provide energy for an ethanol plant reduce associated energy costs and improve sugar ethanols energy balance relative to corn ethanol brazils success at integrating sugar ethanol into its passenger vehicle fuel supply has stimulated interest in exploring prospects for sugarbased ethanol in the united states however wide differen ces in sugar production costs and market prices in the two c ountries cause the economics of sugarbased ethanol to differ significantly in investigating the economics of ethanol from sugar usda concluded that producing sugar cane ethanol in the united states would be more than twice as costly as us corn ethanol and nearly three times as costly as brazilian sugar ethanol16 feedstock costs accounted for mo st of this price differential17 the usda study showed that while sugar ethanol may be positive energy strategy in such countries as brazil it may not be economical in the united states18

to main tain prices above support vels and the sugar acquired as result of loan forfeitures to bioenerg producers for processing into fuel grade ethanol and other biofuel competitive bids would be used by usda to purchase sugar from processors at price not less than sugar program support levels which it would then sell to ethanol firms usda would implement this program only in those years where purchases are required to operate the sugar program at cost usdas ccc would provide openended funding because it would cost much more to produce ethanol from uspriced sugar than from corn this new program will require considerable subsidy to operate as intended the prime market for such gar likely would be existing and planned cornbased ethanol facilities close to suga r beet and sugarcane producing areas eg the upper midwest and hawaii producers of ethanol from corn in the continental united states though would likely need to adjust their fermentation process andor invest in new equipment to handle sugar as result they may not be as interested in purchasing sugar as feedstock unless th price is significantly discounted further eg requiring even more of subsidy to reflect the additional costs of processing sugar instead of corn however the availability of this subsidy could facilitate the development of the ethanol sector in hawaii and partially reduce the islands dependence on importing gasoline for its vehicle transportation needs cbo estimated that this feedstock program would increase demand for sugar and slightly reduce the cost of the sugar program itself as designed this progra m will rely on usproduced rather than foreign sugar the amount that usda decides to purchase would appr oximate its estimate of the extent that imports under trade agr eements reduce the us sugar price below support levels producers suppor ted this provision viewing it as an insurance policy for receiving the benefits of guaranteed minimum price for sugar marketed for food use sugar users opposed this program to ostensibly manage surplus supplies in their july 13 2007 letter to members of cong ress they argued that this authority will likely be used to short domestic markets further restricting the availability of sugar for food use in the us market they characterized this approach as wasteful of taxpayer resources because gar is not price competitive with corn as feedstock and will require large subsidie s to ethanol producers to induce them to accept the sugar the bush administration opposed this sugarforethanol component commenting that it would not allow usda to dispose of surplus sugar to end uses other than ethanol production even if those uses would yield much higher return for taxpayers19 outlook the current us sugar market outlook ie demand considerably above current supply implying market pri ces above loan forfeiture levels suggests that at present usda will be able to m eet the programs nocost directive without having to activate the new sugarforethanol program in fy2009 the status of this program in subsequent ears will depend on whether u s sugar production returns to more normal levels and on how sugar users particul arly in

fy2008 fy2012 fiveyear period projected outlays reflected estimates of the budgetar impact of additional sugar imports from mexico and from other countries that have additional access to the us market for their sugar under bilateral ftas each co st projection assumed that the additional supplies depress the domestic sugar pri ce below price support levels and lead processors to forfeit on portion of their loans21 the policy changes proposed during 2008 fa rm bill debate to address these potential costs were intended to ensure that usda can operate the program at cost however in estimating the budgetar impact of the modified sugar program against its early 2007 budget forecast or base line cbo projected that the net cost of the conference agreements sugarrelate d provisions would be 643 million over five years and over 12 billion over 10 years cbo did note that the sugarforethanol program would increase sugar demand and in rn partly reduce the cost of the sugar price support program however its bo ttomline cost estimate appears to assume that usda incurs losses when it sells surplus sugar acquired earlier as result of loan forfeitures for ethanol processing at price much lower than the sugar programs minimum price guarantee outlook estimating future budgetary impacts is difficult considering that market conditions can change quickly and dramatically and can differ significantly from historical experience current ma rket conditions and usda program decisions to date imply that prices will likely re main above loan forfeiture levels during fy2009 if so the sugar program likely will not record any budget outlays in the near term for this reason it appears that the new sugar programs budgetary exposure could end up being lower than initially estimated by
