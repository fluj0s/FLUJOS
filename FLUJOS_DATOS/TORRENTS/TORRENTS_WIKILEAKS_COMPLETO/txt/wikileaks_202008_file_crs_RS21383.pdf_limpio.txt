introduction on february 2 2004 the deadly toxin ricin was detected in senator frists mailroom in the dirksen senate office building it remains unclear how the toxin arrived there all mail sent to government offices on capitol hill is ster ilized by irradiation however this procedure was designed to kill bacteria such as the causative agent of anthrax bacillus anthracis not to inactivate preformed toxins such as ricin ricin is often mentioned as potential bioterror wea pon this report describes what ricin is how it is made its effects examples of its use its potential for use as

potent plant toxin found in the seeds of the castor plant ricinus communis it works by blocking cell protein sy nthesis which results in cell death this cell death can lead to organ failure and death1 how is ricin obtained ricin can be isolated from castor beans by several well known processes during the industrial production of castor oil bean mash with approxima tely 5 percent ricin content is produced several recipes for extracting ricin from castor beans are widely available on the internet and from commercial bookstores th quality of these directions ranges some directions would produce onl crude preparations while others would produce nearly pure ricin2 even the crude preparations have been considered deadly3 effects of ricin persons exposed to ricin exhibit differe nt symptoms depending on the route of exposure ingestion of ricin causes nausea vomiting diarrhea gastric hemorrhaging and shock with sufficient dose death occurs w ithin 3 to five days injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death which can result in the collapse of major organ systems death often follows such collapse inhalation of ricin irritates the lung linings and airways leading to weakness and fever lesions may occur in the lungs causing tissue swelling and further damage4 the lethal dosage of ricin depends on the route of exposure inhaled or injected doses as low as 3 to 5 micrograms per kilogram body weight may be lethal5 this dose equals 240 to 400 micrograms for 175 pound individual6 because ricin is less well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract the lethal dosage for ingestion is higher ricin is not active upon contact with intact skinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21383crs3 7 david r franz and nancy k jaax op cit 8 jennifer audi et op cit 9 jennifer audi et

general public the department of defense has investigated vaccines in animal studies and submitted an investigational new drug ind application to the food and drug administration for human safety testing research continues in the academic and private sectors to develop new vaccines additi onally animal studies suggest that passive prophylaxis ie injecting animals with antibodies obtained from other immunized animals is effective against injected and ingested ricin for inhaled ricin the most effective prophylaxis appears to be through vaccination7 postexposure medicine has been approved specifically to treat ricin exposure the progressive nature of the toxins effects requires hospitalization and continual supportive care in cases of inge stion treatment with activated charcoal is recommended to limit the ricin exposure stomach pumping may be considered if it can be performed within an hour of ingestion8 exposure detection several methods are currently available to detect the release of ricin potential field detectors include automated air samplers that could detect the release of aerosolized ricin and swabtype tests that could signal the presence of ricin on surfaces highly sensitive laboratorybased tests can be performed on samples gathered on site9 since these detectors are generally not widely implemented in civilian settings health care workers diagnosing ri cin poisoning may be the firs t to detect covert ricin attack both military and civilian sectors are developing faster more sensitive detectors examples of ricins use ricin has been investigated as w eapon since the 1940s when military programs investigated the feasability of using bombs to disseminate aerosolized ricin such weapon was reportedly developed by the united states and the united kingdom but never used10 iraq reportedly attempted to weaponize ricin in the 1980s11 in 1978 ricin was used to assassinate bu lgarian dissident ge orgi markov in london novel umbrellabased weapon was

of terror rather than mass destruction many experts believe that ricin would be difficult to use as weapon of mass destruction ricin needs to be injected in gested or inhaled by the victim to injure24 biological weapons experts estimate that 8 tric tons would be required to cover 100 km2 area with enough toxin to kill 50 of the people thus deploying ricin to cause mass casualties becomes logistically impr actical even for wellfunded terrorist organization25 furthermore some experts have stated that the required preparatory steps to use ricin as mass casualty weapon pose significant technical barriers that may preclude such use by nonstate actors26 although causing mass casualties would be di fficult most expert s agree that ricin could be formidable weapon if used in smallscale
