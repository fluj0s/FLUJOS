divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33901followon biologics intellectual property and innovation issues summary biologics which are sometimes termed biopharmaceutials or biotechnology drugs have begun to play an increasingly important role in us health care not only are sales of biologics growing rapidly some experts estimate that in coming years half of all ne wly approved drugs will result from biotechnology number of patents pertaini ng to certain biological products will expire in the near future some congressional concern has been voiced over the possibility that these patent expirations may not be acco mpanied by the introduction of competing lowercost biologics in the marketplace with respect to traditional pharmaceuticals the drug price competition and patent term restoration ac t of 1984 statute commonly known as the hatchwaxman act is widely believed to have encouraged the availability of generic substitutes for brandname pharmaceuticals upon patent expiration the act in part permitted the food and drug administration to expedite its marketing approval proceedings with respect to generic drugs some observers believe that the hatchwaxman acts accelerated marketing approval provisions do not comf ortably apply to biologics however biologics differ significantly from traditional smallmolecule pharmaceuticals in their size structural complexity and method of ma nufacture competitors who wish to develop follow on biologics may face difficult and even insurmountable difficulties in demonstrating that their produc t is equivalent to partic ular brandname biologic other commentators assert that different kinds of biologics vary considerably in their size and structure and believe that existing hatchwaxman mechanisms are appropriately applied to many biologics the patent system also plays role in regulating competition in the biologics market patent protection is available for biologics in many circumstances although the scope of protection may be limited by legal principles that restrict the availability of proprietary rights in na turally occurring substances several bills introduced in the first session of the110th congress including hr 1038 s 623 hr 1956 s 1505 s 1695 ordered to be reported with amendments in the nature of substitute and h r 5629 would have created an expedited marketing approval pathway for followon biologics within the public health service act the bills vary in important details such as the need for the fda to have promulgated regulatory guidance with resp ect to particular product classifications prior to receiving followon applications certain of these bills would establish specialized patent dispute resolution proceedings with respect to followon biologics number also created varying periods of da ta

tent expirations may not be accompanied by the introduction of co mpeting lowercost biologics in the marketplace9 in the traditional pharmaceutical market generic substitutes commonly become available to consumers as patents on brand name drugs expire due to the provisions of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 statute commonly known as the hatchwaxman act10 this legislation introduced several significant changes to both the patent law and the food and drug law among them were expedited marketing approval pathways that eliminated in whole or in part the need for firms to conduct expensive and timeconsuming clinical trials when they bring generic equiva lents of brandname drugs to market11 the hatchwaxman amendments were designed to facilitate the rapid introduction of lowercost generic drugs while at same time promotin g innovation in the pharmaceutical industry12 technical factors may limit the effectiveness of the hatchwaxman amendments to biologics however biol ogics differ significantly from traditional pharmaceuticals in their complexity and method of manufacture typical pharmaceutical products consist of small molecules on the order of dozens of atoms that may be readily characterized and reproduced through wellunderstood chemical processes in contrast biologics are often made up of millions of atoms feature more complex

product th at may be viewed as equivalent to particular brandname biol ogic product may be consid erable and in some cases perhaps even insurmountable14 for this reason many experts do not describe competing biologic products as generic s as is the case for smallmolecule pharmaceuticals the terms followon biol ogic or biosimilar are commonly used instead15 some commentators assert that these technical challenges may also mean that the expedited approval pathways ava ilable under the hatchwaxman act do not comfortably apply to biologics because th complexity of biologics is an order of magnitude greater than that associated with pharmaceuticals they say an expedited marketing approval prot ocol would not ensure patient safety to the degree possible with respect to traditional drugs16 others observe that di fferent kinds of biologics vary considerably in their size and structure and believe that existing hatchwaxman mechanisms provide appropria regulatory oversight for less complex biologics these observers further explain that as scien tific knowledge progresses understanding of biologics will increase thereby allowing expanded use of current procedures17 legislation

marketing approval is not the only gatekeeper to competition in the biologics market the patent system so has role to play although patent protection may be available for biologics in many circ

manufacturer most often had to file its own nda in order to market its drug27 some generic manufacturers were forced to prove independently that the drugs were safe and effective even though their products were chemically identical to those of previously approved drugs some comme ntators believed that the approval of generic drug was needlessly costly duplicative and timeconsuming process prior to the hatchwaxman act28 these observers noted that although patents on important drugs had expire d manufacturers were not moving to introduce generic equivalents for these products due to th level of resource ex penditure required to obtain fda marketing approval29 in response to this concern the hatc hwaxman act created two new types of applications for marketing approval of generic pharmaceutical one is termed an abbreviated new drug application anda30 an anda may be filed generally speaking if the active ingredient route of administration the dosage form and the strength of the new drug are the same as those of the approved drug an anda allows generic drug manufacturer to rely upon the safety and efficacy data of the original manufacturer the availability of an anda

applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference or use from the person by or for whom th investigations were conducted32 505b2 application differs from an anda in that it includes full reports of investigations concerning the safety nd effectiveness of the proposed product however 505b2 application is dis tinct from an nda in that the 505b2 application relies upon da ta that the applicant did not develop33 according to the fda 505b2 applicant can rely upon two sources of studies not conducted by or for the app licant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference34 the first source consists of safety and efficacy analysis based upon data that the applicant did not originate itself and does not enjoy an express permission to access this categ ory of information typically consists of published scientific lite rature as result 505b 2 applications are sometimes referred to as paper ndas with respect to the second source of appropriate information the fda has declared that 505b2 applicant ma rely upon that agencys own finding of safety and effectivene ss for an approved drug35 the fdas conclusion allows applicants that wish to market modification of an approved drug to file 505b2 application rather than full nda for example suppos that an approved drug employed an active ingredient with particular salt formulation generic firm seeks to market generic version of the approved drug with the same active moiety but using different salt formulation36 under these circumstances the generic firm may be unable to file an anda because its proposed active ingredient is not identical to that of the approved product37 due to the fdas view however the generic firm could file 505b2 app lication that relied upon the fdas previous

appreciated the availability of 505b2 application likely leads to s ubstantial reduction in the costs of the generic firm in this case in comparison w ith the resources required to file full nda the fda interpretation of 505b2 regarding this second source of information has been criticiz ed some observers believe that under plain reading of the hatchwaxman act generi c applicant may rely upon an innovators proprietary data only when filing an anda application not 505b2 application under this view the f da position inappropriately expands the circumstances to which 505b2 application applies39 despite this critique the fda has taken the position that its appro ach is intended to encourage innovation in drug development without requiring dupli cative studies to demonstrate what is already known about drug while protecting th patent and exclusivity rights for the approved drug40 application to biologics the hatchwaxman act including its expedited approval pathways may potentially apply to biologics this result follows because the hatchwaxman act in part amended the fdc act which in turn applies to drugs41 t h h t c h waxman act did not amend distinct statute the public health service act phs act42 which applies specifically to biolog ical products and contains provisions allowing expedited marketing approval for followon biologics because the definition of drugs under the fdc act is broad however the fda states that biological products subject to the phs ac t also meet the definition of drugs under the federal food drug and cosmetic act43 under this interpretation both expedited marketing pproval pathways the anda and the 505b2 application could potentially be available for pharmaceuticals and biologics alike44 many observers believe that the possibility of employing an anda for biologic is currently more theoretical th an real however due to differences between this class of drugs and c onventional pharmaceuticals tw of the more significant differences

nourishment and support of living host cells transfected with genetically engineered dna to code for the desired biological protein that is expressed by the host cell master cell bank must be

patents in pharmaceutical rd the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived by pharmaceutical co mpanies as critical to the drug industry that may reflect the nature of rd performed in this sector where the resulting patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend104 in contrast one study found that in the aircraft and

industries patents have much smaller impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and may be considered less successful in protecting resource investments116 the significant costs of pharmaceutical rd coupled with the uncertainty of the clinical trial process lend consequence to patents in this area because the disparity between the investme nts of innovators and those of imitators is particularly large in pharmaceuticals almost as large as when software pirates simply copy the diskettes of an innovator117 while the capitalized cost of developing new drug to the point of market approval is estima ted at over 800 million it takes only between 1 million and 2 million to obtain approval for generic version of the chemically synthesized pharmaceutical118 this difference is result of the costs associated with clinical trials needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new drug data that could be utilized by generic companies if not protected by patent119 manufacturing considerations as discussed above biotechnology dr ugs are characterized by their manufacturing process such that the manufacturing process for each biologic defines to significant extent the product because biologics are based on living cells or organisms whose metabolisms are inherently variable moreover apparently small differences between manufacturing processes can cause significant differences in the clinical properties of the resulting products120 this insures that the manufacture of biologics will tend to be significantly more expensive than traditional ch emically synthesized drugs121 the fda is required to inspect the manufacturing facilities and pro cesses involved in the production of biologics unlike smallmolecule manuf acturing biomanufacturers get approval for both the drug and the process used to make it and that approval can take years122 therefore these facilities must be built and operational prior to the fda

administration124 in addition the cost of materials to manufacture bi ologics may be 20 to 100 times more than chemical drugs125 the production process for biologics ty pically takes longer than traditional drugs and may take ei ght to nine months126 altering the manufacturing process in any way tends to require that validation be repeated127 one commentator stated its hard to predict how process variations will change products safe ty or effectiveness128 this is result of the incidence of impurities arising from changes in th method of production and the increased opportunity of advers immune reactions129 it is difficult to find and identify impurities in biologics as to date simple tests do not exist thus there are often additional costs associated with preventing impurities from entering into the production process130 some experts argue that there is also need for additional clinical human trials to insure that any changes to the production process do not result in

that regulatory and deve lopmental requirement s for followon products will need to reflect each individual situation134 innovator and generic manufacturers appear to agree that unlike smallmolecule copycats for biogenerics the nature and extent of the data needed will also depend very much on the product involved regulatory guidelines must be defined produc t by product135 generic biotechnology manufact urers assert that extens ive new clinical trials would not be necessary in an expedited approval process but should be considered on casebycase basis as discussed prev iously innovator companies dispute this the nature of biologics has resulted in longer mean clinical development time for these products when compared with traditional drugs136 if additional clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate sameness effectiveness and safety estimates are that it may take twice the time to develop followon biopha rmaceutical than chemical generic with cost that some expect to be 8100 times higher than that associated with traditional generic product137 phase iii trials are the most expensive of the required trials and any add itional requirements for follo won biologics likely would increase the cost to the public138 marketing concerns several commentators have suggested that marketing costs associated with followon biologics will be higher than with traditional generics because of the need to convince doctors that these products generate similar results139 if the followon biopharmaceutical cannot be term ed equivalent to the bra nd name drug doctors and pharmacists may not be able to readily substitute marketing and patient support are more important for biosimilars favouring companies with significant financial re sources and who have had experience in marketing branded products the generics market has historically used prices to secure market share so it is important for biosimilar developers to understandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33901crs25 140

ccess in the biosimilars market however is more dependent on the speed to market and successful marketing strategies140 the greater the number of generic alternatives the less the cost however biologics may not generate multiple followon products for the same brand name biopharmaceutical because of th higher costs associated with bringing these drugs to the marketplace price differentials associated w ith followon products may not be as great as with other generics b ecause of the large initial costs related to establishing manufacturing facilities and performing any additional clinical studies necessary for fda approval therefore the makers of followon products would be expected to charge higher prices and generate more profits than the typical generic firm141 in addition financial and scientif ic barriers might prevent the cutthroat price wars fought in the traditional generic market142 study by kalorama information the market for generic biologi cs issues trends and

biologics are legislated many experts argue that the cost savings will not be as substantial as those generated by typical generic drugs high manufacturing costs the need for additional safety and efficacy trials to test these products and augmented marketing efforts directed at doctors and patients to encourage the use of similar but not identical drugs are expected to add to the prices

discovery development manufacturing and distribution for drug s and biologics consequently this could lead to different economic outcome s in terms of average prices number of competitors returns on spending for research and development rd and other market measures146 some commentators are concerned that an expedited generic approval process similar to that established in the hatchwaxman act may raise issues associated with the affect of patent challenges on biot echnology companies many of which do not make profit how might this impact upon innovation in this sector it has been argued that ninety percent of biotech companies are surviving on venture capital do not yet have single product on the market and are working hard to move products through preclinical discovery and chemistry to clinical investigation and then through fda approval147 often firms intellectual property is its primary asset particularly through the drug development stage and typically is utilized to raise funds for additional rd thus several experts main tain that defending patents may divert support from ongoing innovation especially in small companies that make up significant porti on of the biotechnology sector other experts argue that opening up bi otech drugs to the prospect of generic competition after emphasis added patents expi re may even spark innovation forcing biotech companies to come up with improved versions of existing drugs that perhaps require lessfrequent dosing have fewer side ffects or hang around the body longer making them more effective148 however the ability of brand name companies to bring out improved versions of their initial biologic may dampen development of followon products149 because biotechnol ogy is advancing so quickly improvements in existing products may dissuade generic firms from making followon products that require large in vestments in manufacturing plants and clinical trials150 patients may just switch to the next generation br and name drug question remains whether or not multiple companies will invest the time and money necessary to deve lop followon biologics the scope of the requirements means that in organizational terms the development of biogenerics demands culture and mentality closer to that of proprietary pharmaceutical developers than to that of conventional generics firms if regulatory demands for biogenerics prove exacting then established pharmaceutical companies are probably better off developing entirely novel biotech products instead the regulatory requirements for these products arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33901crs27 151 biogenerics part i set to make real inroads or not 152 idusually much clearer and in most cases companies will stand to make far better commercial returns by taking this road151 on the other hand one reason generics companies are dropping out of the race is the sheer scope of demands these projects require generic companies also tend to be much less tolerant of delays and setbacks given these circumstances most generics companies will have hard time coming to grips with the demands of biogenerics152 if fewer companies chose to make followon products there would be less competition in the marketpl ace resulting in reduced cost savings this raises the issue of whether there are other or additional mechanisms to encourage firms to produce lower cost followon biologics in accessing any potential legislative activity in this area it might be important to consider how to facilitate follow on products after pate nt expiration while continuing to encourage innovation in the brand name biopharmaceutical sector the hatchwaxman act attempted to build just such balance between the introduction of widely available generic drugs with ad equate incentives for investment in the development of new pharmaceuticals many policy and industry experts agree that the hatchwaxman act has had significant effect on the availability of generic substitutes for brand name drugs while investment in the development of new pharmaceuticals has continued at issue is whether or not it is desirable to pursue and possible to achieve similar balan ce of interests in the biopharmaceutical industry
