from pjonesueaacuk to rick piltz piltzcomcastnet subject re your comments on the latest ceimichaels gambit date sun 11 oct 2009 180313 0100 bst cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk ben santer santer1llnlgov rick what youve put together seems fine from quick read im in lecce in the heal of italy till tuesday i should be back in the uk by wednesday the original raw data are not lost either i could reconstruct what we had from some doe reports we published in the mid1980s i would start with the ghcn data i know that the effort would be complete wate of time though i may get around to it some time as youve said the documentation of what weve done is all in the literature i think if it hadnt been this issue the cei would have dreamt up something else cheers phil phil and ben thanks for writing i appreciate very much what youre saying im going to be posting some entries on this matter on the climate science watch web site im sure others will weigh in on it in various venues steve schneider has supplied with an ontherecord quote and i suppose that more formal response by the relevant scientists is likely eventually to become part of the epa docket as part of their rejection of the cei petition but that will drag on and meanwhile cei and michaels will demagogue their allegations as they do with everything way to prevent that but i would like to expedite documenting some immediate pushback helping to set the record straight and put what cei and michaels are up to in perspective i have taken the liberty of editing what you wrote just bit and adding some possible url links and writingout of acronyms in the hope that with your permission and with any revisions or additions you might care to make we could post your comments this requires clearance other than you and i would draft appropriate text to provide context please take look at this and rsvp bens comment as i see it there are two key issues here first the competitive enterprise institute cei and pat michaels are arguing that phil jones and colleagues at the cru climatic research unit at the university of east anglia uk willfully intentionally and suspiciously destroyed some of the raw surface temperature data used in the construction of the gridded surface temperature datasets second the cei and pat michaels contend that the cru surface temperature datasets provided the sole basis for ipcc discernible human influence conclusions both of these arguments are incorrect first there was intentional destruction of the primary source data i am sure that over 20 years ago the cru could not have foreseen that the raw station data might be the subject of legal proceedings by the cei and pat michaels raw data were not secretly destroyed to avoid efforts by other scientists to replicate the cru and hadley centrebased estimates of globalscale changes in nearsurface temperature in fact key point here is that other groups primarily at the ncdc noaa national climatic data center and at giss nasa goddard institute for space studies but also in russia were able to replicate the major findings of the cru and uk hadley centre groups the ncdc and giss groups performed this replication completely independently they made different choices in the complex process of choosing input data adjusting raw station data for known inhomogeneities such as urbanization effects changes in instrumentation site location and observation time and gridding procedures ncdc and gissbased estimates of global surface temperature changes are in good accord with the hadcrut data results the second argument that discernible human influence findings are like house of cards resting solely on one observational dataset is also invalid the ipcc third assessment report tar considers multiple observational estimates of globalscale nearsurface temperature changes it does not rely on hadcrut data alone as is immediately obvious from figure 21b of the tar which shows cru ncdc and giss globalmean temperature changes as pointed out in numerous scientific assessments eg the ipcc tar and fourth assessment reports the us climate change science program synthesis and assessment report 11 temperature trends in the lower atmosphere steps for understanding and reconciling differences and the state of knowledge report global climate change impacts on the united states rigorous statistical fingerprint studies have now been performed with whole range of climate variables and not with surface temperature only examples include variables like ocean heat content atmospheric water vapor surface specific humidity continental river runoff sealevel pressure patterns stratospheric and tropospheric temperature tropopause height zonalmean precipitation over land and arctic seaice extent the bottomline message from this body of work is that natural causes alone cannot plausibly explain the climate changes we have actually observed the climate system is telling us an internally and physicallyconsistent story the integrity and reliability of this story does not rest on single observational dataset as michaels and the cei incorrectly claim i have known phil for most of my scientific career he is the antithesis of the secretive data destroying character the cei and michaels are trying to portray to the outside world phil and tom wigley have devoted significant portions of their scientific careers to the construction of the land surface temperature component of the hadcrut dataset they have conducted this research in very open and transparent manner examining sensitivities to different gridding algorithms different ways of adjusting for urbanization effects use of various subsets of data different ways of dealing with changes in spatial coverage over time etc they have thoroughly and comprehensively documented all of their dataset construction choices they have done tremendous service to the scientific community and to the planet by making gridded surface temperature datasets available for scientific research they deserve medals not the kind of deliberately misleading treatment they are receiving from pat michaels and the cei phils comment one it seems cares to read what we put up on the cru web page these people just make up motives for what we might or might not have done httpwwwcruueaacukcrudatatemperaturehttpwwwcruueaacukcrudatatemperature almost all the data we have in the cru archive is exactly the same as in the ghcn archive global historical climatology network used by the noaa national climate data center httpwwwncdcnoaagovoaclimateghcnmonthlyindexphp httpwwwncdcnoaagovoaclimateresearchghcnghcngridhtml if we have lost any data it is the following 1 station series for sites that in the 1980s we deemed then to be affected by either urban biases or by numerous site moves that were either not correctable or not worth doing as there were other series in the region 2 the original data for sites that we adjusted the temperature data phil for known inhomogeneities or what in the 1980s we still have our adjusted data of course and these along with all other sites that didnt need adjusting 3 since the 1980s as colleagues and nmss national meteorological services have produced adjusted series for regions and or countries then we replaced the data we had with the better series httpwwwwmointpagesmembersindex_enhtml in the papers ive always said that homogeneity adjustments are best produced by nmss good example of this is the work by lucie vincent in canada here we just replaced what data we had for the 200 sites she sorted out the crutem3 data for land look much like the ghcn and giss nasa goddard institute for space studies data for the same domains httpdatagissnasagovgistemp apart from figure in the ipcc ar4 fourth assessment report 2007 showing this there is also this paper from geophysical research letters in 2005 by russ vose et figure 2 is similar to the ar4 plot vose et paper all best rick rick piltz
