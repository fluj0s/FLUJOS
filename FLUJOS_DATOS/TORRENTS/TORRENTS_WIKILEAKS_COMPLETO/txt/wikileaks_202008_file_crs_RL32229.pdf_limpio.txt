fy2003 appropriations were provided under sole source or limited competition procedures that ultimately benefitted us firms the national security interest was key justification for excluding competition domestic as well as foreign however as most contracts we re then provided by usaid and treated as foreign assistance they b ecame subject to buy ameri ca provisions of law under the foreign assistance act of 1961 and exem pt from international procurement agreements6 foreign countries could however pa rticipate as subcontractors to the selected american firms and are estimated to compose half or more of the total cost of these contracts most fy2004 appropriations managed by the cpa are being treated somewhat differently under pr eviously mentioned december 5 2003 determination and findings report issued by deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz prime contracts are subject to full and open competition only among us firms and those of 62 other eligible countri including iraq coalition partners and force contributing nations the rationale fo r barring other countri firms is that it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states countries ineligible to compet for prime contracts may still participate as subcontractors some excluded countries such as germ any and france have protested the decision on the grounds that it may violat the wtos government procurement agreement gpa some us officials suggest that the contracting organization cpa is not covered by the gpa and need not allow open competition others point out that gpa rules and existing practice exempt much foreign assistance from their requirements the strength of these argu ments has been questioned on january 13 2004 president bush announced that canada

halliburtonkbr oil fuel purchases from kuwait and turkey halliburtonkbr on behalf of the cpa has purchased oil fuels for consumption by the iraqi population gasoline has been purchased from kuwait and turkey and deliver ed into iraq by truck while roughly 75 of the gasoline has come from turkey both the commodity cost of the fuel and the cost of transport from kuwait are each more than twice as high as the corresponding charges associated with turk ish supplies what can explain the cost differential in each element of this transac tion in most cases fuels for iraq were purchased in two geographically separate markets supplies came from both turkish suppliers and international spot markets in the mediterranean oil trading area offshore purchases were imported into th mediterranean ports of iskenderum and mersin and shipped overland by turkish truckers to iraq in other cases fuels were purchased from kuwaiti supplier not direc tly in the oil business who also made transport arrangements between may and october 2003 lliburton imported about 179 million gallons from turkey and 61 million gallons from kuwait turkish supplies averaged 124 per gallon delivered those from kuwait averaged 264 including 121 for the fuel and the remainder transport and kbr fees28 this is the most recent price data available despite purchases c ontinuing through the end of march 2004

halliburton fuel procurement ma nagement the cheaper turkish purchases which comprised about 75 of total of 464 billion gallons acquired29 may well have comprised all the av ailable supply in that tradin g area hence perhaps the need for the higher priced supplies from nearby kuwait however certain factors might have contributed to higher kuwaiti prices dealing with dangerous transportation over 60 vehicles have been destroyed or damaged at least 3 people killed and several more injured using shortterm supply contracts the 30day supply contract specified in the supply arrangemen t with kuwait may have been too short to lineup additional trucks which are apparently in short supply the nature of the existing kuwaiti supply contract according to platts oilgram news the kuwait petroleum corp refused to grant kbr permission to deal with any other supplier than the altanmia commercial marketing company to procure and deliver petroleum products from kuwait to iraq altanmias main shareholder is najeeb alhumaizi part of prominent kuwait family closely linked to the kuwaiti government altanmia refuses to provide cost information contending it is pr ohibited from doing so by kuwaiti law reacting to the fuel price controversy the pentagon decided on december 30 2003 to give the iraqi fuel procurement job to the defense energy support center desc desc solicited bids for 66

halliburtonkbr fuel purchases had an undue impact on the spot market price of gasoline in the persian gulf area between october and december 2003 the spot market price of gasoline in the persian gulf area as quoted in platts oilgram price report increased from 71 cents per gallon to over 100 per gallon31 has this thinly traded spot market been unduly affected by halliburtonkbr fuel purchases spot market gasoline prices in the persian gulf trading area have risen from about 30 per barrel at the beginning of october 2003 to about 44 per barrel in midjanuary 2004 that 14 increase the equivalent of 33 cents per gallon represents substantial hike well exceeding that which might be attributable to crude oil increases higher gasoline prices beyond increases in crude oil costs were likely caused
