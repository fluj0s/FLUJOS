of wise she has supported the source dissemination project to get massive quantities of lrh materials distributed both locally and across the world and is one of our top level supporters patricias dissemination endeavors are many fold one of her major actions was to put the very first all black mission into existence right in the heart of inglewood california this mission is now rapidly becoming full blown class v ideal org she held one of the first dianetics seminars ever delivered for that community and made it possible for african americans to receive the fruits of lrhs brilliance patricias ability to embrace the purpose of these campaigns and do all that she can to bring lrhs wisdom to far flung lands such as trinidad ghana and belize is inspiring to others when two kings from ghana arrived to america with their full entourage patricia pitched right in to act as their lead host their purpose was to help their impoverished nation but what they discovered in america was much much more the king of cape coast and the king of axim arrived at the hubbard college of administration with their entourage for tour this was their first introduction to l ron hubbard and his administrative solutions at the end of the tour ot v patricia harris presented the two kings and their assemblage with government industry packages containing how to live though an executive and the extension course ron the profile which shows lrh as an administrator and ron education literacy and civilization the kings quickly grasped the huge possibilities and farreaching effects that lrhs technology could have for their country with this management and education technology they could train their own people to create unlimited productivity and prosperity right there in ghana since this time both kings have advanced in their studies of the admin tech and in their support of scientology the king of axim completed several courses at the hubbard college of administration to bring this tech home to his people while the king of the cape coast presented lrhs materials to every one of the colleges and high schools in his region this shows how patricias commitment is relentless when it
