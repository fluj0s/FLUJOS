of labor and capital income and thus bears resemblance to national income as measured by economists there are however number of exclusions in addition certain income transfers are subject to tax wage income of employees is taxed although mo st contributions to employee pension and health insurance plans and certain other employee benefits are not included in wages subject to income tax employer contributions to social security are also excluded from wages when pensions are received they are included in income to the exte nt that they represent contributions originally excluded if the taxpayer has the same tax rate when contributions are made and when pensions are received this treatment is equivalent to eliminating tax on the earnings of pension plans some social security benefits are also subject to tax passive capital income in the form of interest dividends and capital gains on financial instruments is also taxed although the tax base excludes gains that are unrealized and interest on taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments income from operating business through proprietorship partnership or small business corporation that elects to be treated similarly to partnership subchapter s corporation or through rental property which reflects returns to both investment and effort is also subject to tax although it is always difficult to measure such income precisely this income is the net of gross receipts reduced by costs such as payments to labor depreciation costs of goods acquired for resale and other inputs interest and taxes some investment income of small businesses is subject to favorable treatment through provisions that allow costs of capital equipment to be expensed when incurred other income such as miscellaneous income gambling winnings and royalties is also included in the tax base transfers are sometimes included in income of the recipient and sometimes not among those subject to tax are pension earnings portion of social security benefits for higherincome individuals unemployment compensation alimony and the portion of scholarships and fellowships not used for tuition and books there are several adjustments to this income base to yield adjusted gross income probably the most well known of these are deductions for individual retirement accounts and selfemployed pension plans interest on student loans alimony

exemptions are phased out for taxpayers with high levels of amt income twotiered rate structure of 26 and 28 is then assessed against amt taxable income the taxpayer compares his amt tax liability to his regular tax liability and pays the greater of the two even though taxpayer may not actually pay any amt it can affect his regular tax liability because nonrefundable tax credits under the regular

thus taxpayer who has net 4000 regular income tax liability 5000 tax liability less 1000 in nonrefundable tax credits but has an amt liability of 4300 will effectively see his regular income tax credits reduced by 300 temporary provisions first enacted in 1998 that allow individuals to use all personal tax credits against both their regular and amt tax liabilities this change is effective through december 31 2006 although the amt was originally designed to prevent highincome taxpayers from escaping what was perceived to be their fair share of the income tax burden there will be significant increase in the number of middle to upper middle income taxpayers affected by the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals by steven maguire for further

rates applying to firms with lower ta xable incomes since smaller firms tend to have smaller profits small firms benefit more often from the 15 and 25 rates and since the bulk of corporate income is earned by large firms most corporate income is subject to either the 34 or 35 rate the benefits of the lower rates are phased out and during the phase out range marginal tax rates are actually higher because an additional dollar of income not only has direct tax rate but also reduces the benefit of lower rates the base of the corporate income tax is net income or profits as defined by the tax code in general this is gross revenue minus costs deductible costs include materials interest and wage payments another important deductible cost is depreciationan allowance for declines in the value of firms tangible assets such as machines equipment and structures in broad economic terms the base of the corporate income tax is the return to equity capital as follows wages are taxdeductible so labors contribution to corporate revenue is excluded from the corporate tax base income produced by corporate capital investment includes that produced by corporate investment of borrowed funds and th at produced by investment of equity or funds provided by stockholders profits from debtfinance d investment are paid out as interest which is deductible thus the return to debt capital is excluded from the corporate tax base equity investments are financed by retained earnings and the sale of stock the income equity investment generates is paid out as dividends and the capital gains that accrue as stock increases in value neither form of income is generally deductible thus the base of the corporate income tax is the return to equity capital because of the nature of its base the corporate income tax has several broad effects on the allocation of capital investment first it favors noncorporate investmentfor example unincorporated business and owneroccupied housingover corporate investment second it favors corporate debt over corporate equity investment since the former is not subject to the tax however while the base of the tax is equity income the flow of capital out of the corporate sector and other economic adjustments probably cause the burden of the tax to spread to all owners of capital owners of unincorporated business bondholders and homeowners the tax can also shift from capital income to labor income or even benefit labor income with capital bearing more than 100 of the tax the government agencies that provide distributional analysis allocate the corporate tax to capital in general httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32808g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g22g138g161g561 g21 g162g156g157g142g150g561 g561

corporate profits at all corporate equity profits are taxed twice once at the corporate level and once under the individual income tax when they are received by stockholders as dividends or capital gains as consequence taxes tend to steer investment away from the corporate sector further corporations are not persons who can bear the burden of taxes but merely legal entities through which individuals earn income from this point of view it is misleading to compare the tax burden of corporation with that of an individual the corporate tax some ar gue should be combined integrated with the individual income tax in some manner some of the reasons that have been put forward for having separate corporate tax are it discourages the use of corporations as shelters from the individual income tax it probably adds to the tax systems progressivity integration of the individual and corporate taxes would present administrative difficulties and the corporate tax has degree of public support it also raises significant revenue in 2003 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra took step in the direction of relieving the doubletaxation of corporate income by reducing the tax rate individuals pay on corporatesource dividends and capital gains to 15 for 2003 to 2008 in 2006 the tax increase prevention reconciliation act tipra extended the reduced rates through 2010

in 2010 although along with other provisions of egtrra the repeal is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 the federal gift tax operates alongside the estate tax to prevent individuals from avoiding the estate tax by transferring property to heirs before dying note that the first 12000 of gifts from one individual to another is excluded from taxation thus married couple could each give child 12000 each for total gift of 24000 the gift and estate taxes are unified because the same rates and unified credit amount apply to the cumulative taxable transfers over an individuals lifetime and at death for example gift tax credit of 25000 claimed during persons lifetime reduces the credit that can be claimed at death under the estate tax by 25000 the rate bracket that applies to transfer at death is based on cumulative gifts over the decedents lifetime as well as the size of the estate egtrra gradually reduces the top rate of the gift tax parallel to the estate tax reductions the gift tax will remain in place after 2010 its top rate will be the top individual income tax rate applicable under egtrra the estate and gift tax occupies minor role in the federal fiscal structure accounting for only 10 of gross federal tax collections in fy2007 1 further because of the exemption the unified credit and deductions few estates pay the tax in 2004 only 13 of deaths resulted in estate tax liability2 aside from raising revenue the estate tax has been defended as means of increasing the overall progressivity of the tax system the tax falls on those with the greatest wealth and wealth is widely regarded as good measure of an individuals ability to pay some have argued however that the tax impairs operation of the economy by discouraging lifetime saving and capital formation whether the estate tax does so however is unclear the possible impact of the estate tax on small business and farms has often been the subject of debate some have argued for example that the tax inhibits the transfer of farms and small businesses to heirs and prevents them from staying in the decedents family as result of such concerns the estate tax currently has number of special rules designed to ease its burden on farms and small businesses however tax return data show that the farm and business estates most likely to dispose of assets to pay the estate tax tend to be larger

excise tax revenues are small compared to other federal taxes in fy2007 651 billion in excise taxes were collected amounting to 25 of total federal receipts and 05 of gross domestic product3 federal excise taxes are levied on variety of products their collection point varies ranging from the production level to retail sales in terms of receipts the single largest tax is the excise tax on gasoline which made up 335 of all excise tax receipts in fy20064 other prominent excise taxes are those on diesel fuel domestic air passengers distilled spirits beer cigarettes and telephone services most federal excise taxes are paid into trust funds devoted to various federal activities rather than remaining in the federal budgets general fund in fy2007 83 of excise tax receipts went into trust funds5 the largest amount went into the highway trust fund and consisted of highway motor fuels taxes including the gasoline tax retail sales taxes on tractors and heavy trucks and trailers and an annual heavy vehicle use tax excise taxes serve variety of fiscal purposes some were enacted simply to raise revenue for example the telephone tax and fuel taxes enacted for deficit reduction the taxes linked with trust funds serve to fund expenditure programs by taxing their beneficiaries or by taxing those responsible for certain problems addressed by expenditure programs some excise taxes adjust for the effects of negative externalitiesthat is they seek to ensure that the price of products that produce sideeffects like pollution reflects their true cost to society other purposes of excise taxes include adjusting the price of imports to reflect domestic taxes regulation of certain activities and regulation of activities thought to be undesirable the burden of excise taxes is thought to fall on consumption and more heavily on individuals with lower incomes the tax is believed to be usually passed on by producers to consumers in the form of higher prices and because consumption is higher proportion of income for lower income persons than upperincome individuals excise taxes are usually considered regressive however the incidence of excise taxes in particular cases depends on the market conditions and how consumers and producers respond to price changes further some economists have argued that consideration of the incidence of excise taxes over an individuals lifetime reduces their apparent regressivity the effects of excise taxes on economic efficiency vary depending on the particular tax for example taxes that counter negative externalities probably enhance economic efficiency others may hamper efficiency and reduce economic welfare by distorting prices and consumption choices for further materials on excise taxes see crs report rl33382

answer as to how the tax burden should be distributed among people with unequal incomes while few would argue that the tax system should be regressive the degree to which it should be progressive involves subjective value judgements consensus seems to have evolved that the federal tax system should be progressive goal that over time has been achieved studies by the congressional budget office cbo show that while there have been some fluctuations in the distribution of the tax burden over the last 20 years the largest fluctuations have been concentrated at the ends of the income spectrum families in the middle of the income spectrum have experienced stable level of federal taxes over the period tax law changes in the early 1980s tended to increase federal taxes on lowincome families while reducing taxes on upperincome families these trends were reversed in the early 1990s when tax law changes raised federal taxes on upperincome families and reduced taxes for families at the lower end of the income spectrum changes in 2001 and 2003 provided significant tax reductions for middle to upperincome families filing joint returns the following table shows average federal tax rates for

exchange of capital asset if the asset is sold for higher price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital gain if the asset is sold for lower price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital loss capital gains taxes were reduced in 1997 and the holding period to qualify for longterm capital gain tax treatment was reduced in 1998 under current law capital assets held longer than 12 months are considered longterm assets while assets held 12 months or less are considered shortterm assets capital gains on shortterm assets are taxed at regular income tax rates in 2003 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra reduced the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains income to 5 0 for 2008 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 marginal income tax brackets jgtrra reduced the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15 for taxpayers in marginal income tax brackets exceeding 15 these changes were initially effective for assets sold or exchanged on or after may 6 2003 and before january 1 2009 but the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2006 pl 109222 extended the applicability of reduced rates through 2010 8 office of management and budget

significantly reduce lockin effects and make resource allocation more efficient taxes on increased capital gains realizations would offset some of the initial cost of cutting capital gains taxes however there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of this unlocking effect alternatively lockin could be reduced by taxing capital gains on an accrual basis or by taxing capital gains passed on at death these alternative solutions however face variety of technical problems and the idea of taxing gains at death has been unpopular arguments have also been made that cutting capital gains taxes would increase savings and stimulate economic growth while evidence on the effect of tax cuts on savings rates and thus economic growth is difficult to obtain most evidence does not indicate large response of savings to an increase in the aftertax rate of return case might be made for cutting capital gains taxes on corporate stock since corporate equity capital is subject to taxation both under the corporate and individual income taxes this double taxation encourages corporations to take on too much debt and directs too much capital to the noncorporate sector on the other hand reducing the capital gains tax would increase the relative penalty that applies to dividends and introduce tax distortions into the decisions of firms to retain earnings major complaint made by some is that cutting capital gains taxes would primarily benefit very highincome individuals capital gains are concen trated among higher income individuals both because these individuals tend to own capital and because they are especially likely to own capital that generates capital gains income some argue that taxes on capital gains income should be reduced as means of simplifying the tax code part of the problem with taxing capital gains income has always been the tradeoff between taxing capital gains more efficiently and equitably and the added complexity in the tax code that this would entail finally many economists argue that capital gains tax appears unlikely to provide much stimulus to the economy in the short run for more information see crs report rs20250 capital gains tax

differences give rise to structural marriage tax bonuses and penalties generally the more evenly divided the earned income of the two spouses the more likely they are to have structural marriage tax penalty hence married couples in which each spouse earns 50 of the total earned income have the largest marriage tax penalties on the other hand married couples where one spouse earns all the earned income have the largest marriage tax bonuses the actual determination of whether any given married couple has marriage tax penalty or bonus depends on how their income deductions and personal dependent exemptions are split between the two spouses for calculation purposes it also depends on the filing status under which each spouses tax liability is computedsingle or head of household cbo uses assumptions that some economists believe may overstate marriage tax penalties however even under these assumptions cbo estimated that in 1999 only 43 of married couples incurred tax penalty while 52 experienced marriage tax bonus it is widely accepted goal that the individual income tax should not influence the choice of individuals with regard to their marital status marriage neutrality however conflicts with two other widely accepted concepts of equity progressivity and the equal income taxation of couples with equal incomes regardless of how these three concepts of equity are juggled under current definitions an income tax can achieve only two of the goals it cannot simultaneously achieve all three the current income tax has chosen progressivity and equal taxation of couples with equal incomes at the expense of marriage neutrality critical point in this debate is that there are unambiguous right or wrong answers to the question of which of these three competing goals of equity is the most important legislation in 2001 2003 and 2004 addressed marriage tax penalties by increasing the standard deduction for couples to twice that of singles and broadening the 15 tax bracket to twice the width of singles bracket 9 these changes also increase the marriage tax bonuses experienced by many married couples because of procedural rules in the senate however these changes are scheduled to sunset after 2010 for further information see crs report rl30800 the federal income tax and the treatment of married couples background and analysis by gregg esenwein and crs

issue of tax deferral ideally tax levied on income should be assessed when the income accrues to the taxpayer however as result of many factors some income is taxed when it is realized rather than when it accrues there can be mismatch between income and the expense of earning it or the tax code 9 the acts were the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 the jobs and

since money has time value dollar today is more valuable than dollar in the future tax deferral effectively lowers the tax rate on the income in question illustrating the benefits of tax deferral is the case of income from capital gains in which the tax is assessed when the gain is realized rather than as it accrues if capital asset is acquired for 100 and appreciates at rate of 10 per annum by the end of the first year it has appreciated in value to 110 and by the end of the second year it is worth 121 assuming marginal tax rate of 15 the top marginal tax rate on longterm capital gains if the gain were realized at the end of the second year then tax of 315 21 times 15 would be levied on the realized appreciation the aftertax return would be 1785 in contrast is the case of 100 investment in an interestbearing account earning 10 rate of return at the end of the first year the account would yield 10 in interest tax on the interest assuming 15 marginal income tax rate would be 150 leaving 10850 in the account by the end of the second year the account would yield 1085 in interest tax on the second years interest would be 163 leaving 11772 in the account for an aftertax return over the twoyear period of 1772 it is apparent from the examples above that the investment in the asset yielding capital gains income earns higher aftertax return than th comparable investment in an interestbearing account in essence the reason for this result is simply that for the asset producing capital gain the tax on the appreciation in the first year was deferred with the deferred tax remaining in the account and earning interest the benefits of tax deferral increase the longer an asset is held and tax can be deferred it should also be noted that the top marginal tax rate on longterm capital gains income is currently capped at 15 while the top marginal tax rate on interest income can reach 35 tax deferral not only affects the taxation of assets producing capital gains income but also is of concern in other areas of tax policy such as the taxation of contributions to retirement accounts and depreciation allowances g6g142g153g155g142g140g146g138g157g146g152g151g561 when business purchases tangible asset such as machine or structure it is not incurring cost it is simply exchanging one assetfor example cashfor another the full purchase price of an asset is therefore usually not tax deductible in the year the asset is bought assets do however decline in value as they age or become outmoded this decline in value depreciation is cost and because assets gradually depreciate until they are worthless the tax code permits firms gradually to deduct the full acquisition cost of an asset over number of years the tax code contains set of rules that govern the rate at which depreciation deductions can be claimed the rules determine the tax depreciation rate by specifying recovery period and depreciation method for different types of assets an assets recovery period is the number of years over which deductions for the assets full cost must be spread the applicable depreciation method determines how depreciation deductions ar distributed among the different years of the recovery period the slowest method is straightline in which equal deductions are taken each year declining balance methods in which fixed fraction of the cost less prior depreciation is deducted cause larger shares to be taken in earlier years

business the sooner it can be claimed the sooner tax deduction can be claimed the sooner the tax savings it generates can be invested and earn return it follows that the tax rules governing when depreciation deductions can be claimed are quite important to businesses if depreciation deductions can be claimed faster than an asset actually declines in value tax benefit exists depreciation is said to be accelerated if on the other hand depreciation deductions can be claimed more slowly than the corresponding asset actually depreciates tax penalty occurs only if depreciation deductions are claimed at the rate an asset actually depreciates do taxes confer neither tax benefit nor tax penalty according to some estimates current tax deprecia tion for some types of equipment is somewhat accelerated compared to economic depreciation bonus depreciation allowances that recent tax acts have provided for temporary periods may have further accelerated depreciation for certain equipment see for example the depreciation provisions of the jobs and growth tax relief and reconciliation act of 2003 pl 10827 depreciation for most structures is probably not accelerated thus firms have tax incentive to use more equipment and fewer of other types of assets in their production process than they ot herwise would this influence of taxes in the allocation of capital probably reduces economic efficiency g8g152g155g150g156g561g152g143g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 the internal revenue code recognizes several different forms of business organization their tax treatment varies the principal forms are c corporations s corporations partnerships and sole proprietorships apart from taxes corporations are legally defined form of business organization with ownership stakes represented by shares that may or may not be publicly traded shareholders liabilities are limited to their stake in the corporation the internal revenue code normally subjects corporate profits to the corporate income tax under its subchapter c corporations subject to income tax are thus often referred to as c corporations as explained more fully above in the reports section on the corporate income tax the part of c corporation income generated by equity investment is subject to two layers of tax the corporate income tax and the individual income tax in contrast corporations that qualify as s corporations are not subject to the corporate income tax instead their net profits are passed on pro rata basis through to the individual shareholders who are taxed on the profits under the individual income tax to qualify s corporations may have more than 100 shareholders taxes aside partnerships are like corporations in that they have multiple owners in contrast to corporations some partnerships convey liability for debts that is not limited to partners contributions to the enterprise partnerships are also less likely than corporations to be publicly traded although some forms of partnerships master limited partnerships are like s corporations partnerships are not subject to the co rporate income tax partners are subject to their share of partnership earnings under the individual income tax limited liability companies llcs have some of the characteristics of both partnerships and corporations under irs check the box regulati ons llcs can elect to be taxed either as corporations or as partnerships other specially defined business entities include real estate investment trusts reits which are required to

meaning at all at least at the national level but regardless of how competitiveness is defined standard economic analysis suggests that most tax measures can do little to enhance it indeed some observers argue that many of the tax provisions designed to improve us performance in the world economy actually reduce us economic welfare world economic welfare or both an individual firm or its employees might defend competitiveness as its ability to withstand the threat of foreign competition if asked they might recommend some manner of tax benefit targeted at their industry perhaps favorable depreciation rules or tax credits for consumers who buy their product economic analysis predicts that such measures might well improve the position of the targeted industry its costs would fall because its taxes have fallen introducing the possibility of reduced prices larger market shares and more jobs but economic theory also predicts that the effects of targeted tax benefit will ripple through the economy and ultimately confound the policys competitiveness goals for the economy as whole because the nations resources are limited the theory holds narrowly targeted tax benefit will simply reshuffle the way resources are employed drawing them into the favored industry and away from alternative uses and while exports in th favored sector may rise or imports fall the theory predicts that the performance of other sectors will decline further economics predicts that the effect of taxes on how the economys resources are deployed diminishes the nations economic vitality market forces not tax rules this theory holds are usually the best way to guarantee that resources are used efficiently policymakers or others at the national level may take broader view of competitiveness and define it as the ability of the country as whole to sell its exportsnot just the performance of one sector such view might recommend for example tax incentive for exporting regardless of the product but in this case economic theory suggests that exchange rate adjustments will stymie any effect the export subsidy may have in improving the trade balance although implementation of an export subsidy may initially increase exports the increase in exports raises the price of the dollar in currency markets which in turn makes us exports more expensive and imports cheaper as result exports are predicted to fall and imports increase until any initial improvement in the balance of trade that may have occurred disappears further to the extent that part of the export tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers as lower prices this analysis indicates that the measure transfers economic welfare from us taxpayers to foreign persons many economists would argue that taxes can alter the balance of trade in the short and medium term but not in the way that is perhaps commonly thought if country runs trade deficit it is

from abroad importing the foreign investment that finances the deficit th trade balance thus mirrors the balance on capital account and it follows that taxes alter the trade balance not by their direct application to exports or imports but by altering capital flows for exam ple cut in taxes on business investment in the united states increases the us appetite for investment foreign capital inflows accordingly increase and net us exports imports minus exports fall or tax cut that increases the federal budget deficit can be expected to exert upward pressure on real interest rates thereby attracting additional foreign capital and expanding the trade deficit conversely tax increase that reduces the budget deficit can also reduce the trade deficit what of taxation of capital flows rather than trade for example can taxes improve the economy by making us firms that operate abroad more competitive cutting their costs and helping them compete more effectively against foreign firms again
