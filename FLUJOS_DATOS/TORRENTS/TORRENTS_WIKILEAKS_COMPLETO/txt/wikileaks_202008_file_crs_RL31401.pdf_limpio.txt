of the ada created private cause of action for damages agai nst the states for conduct that actually violated the fourteenth amendment however the court did not reach the issue of whether the eleventh amendment permits prisoner to secure money damages from state for state actions th at violate the ada but not th constitution in the same term the supreme court decided arbaugh v h corp 3 case under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 which has implications for the adas prohibition of discrimination where employers employ 15 or more employees on december 7 2007 the supreme court granted certiorari in huber v wal mart stores4 to determine whether an individual with disability who cannot perform her current job must be reassign ed to vacant equivalent position without competing with other workers however the court dismissed the petition since the case was settled prior to oral argument the eighth circuit court of appeals in huber held that walmart was not required to automatically reassign her to the vacant position she wanted but could place nother better qualifie d candidate in the position noting that walmart did place the plaintiff in less lucrative position

circuits on this accomm odation issue and in light of the courts dismissal of the case there will continue to be divergent views6 definition of disability statutory language the threshold issue in any ada case is whether the individual alleging discrimination is an individual with disability the adas definition has been controversial and is the subject of several supreme court cases including sutton v united air lines inc 7 and toyota motor manufacturing v williams 8 the ada amendments act of 2008 pl 110325 rejected the supreme courts limited interpretations of the definition of disability in these cases9 the ada as amended defines the term di sability with respect to an individual as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impai rment as described in paragraph 310 although this is essentially the same statutory language as was in the original ada pl 110325 contains new rule s of construction regarding the definition of disability which provide that the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act the term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently withthe findings and purposes of the ada amendments act an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity neednot limit other major life activities to be considered disability an impairment that is episodic or in remission is disability if itwould have substantially limited major life activity when active the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits amajor life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures except that the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs3 12 title i of the ada covers employment t

have narrowed and limited the ada from what was intended by congress pl 110325 specifically states that the current eeoc regulations defining the term substantially limits as significantly restricted are inconsistent with congressional intent by expressing too high standard the c odified findings in the original ada are also amended to delete the finding that 43000000 americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities this finding was used in sutton to support limiting the reach of the definition of disability the ada amendments act states that th purposes of the legislation are to carry out the adas objectives of the elimin ation of discrimina tion and the provision of clear strong consistent enforceable standards addressing discrimination by reinstating broad scope of protec tion available under the ada pl 110325 rejected the supreme courts holdings that mitigating measures are to be used in making determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity as well as holdings defining the substantially limits requirements the substantially limits requirements of toyota as well as the eeoc regulations defining substantially limits as significantly restricted are specifically rejected in the new law the third prong of the finition of disab ility covers individuals who are regarded as having such an impairment s described in paragraph 3 paragraph 3 states that an individual meets the requi rement of being regarded as having such an impairment if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this ac t because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit major life activity however impairments that are transitory and minor are specifically excluded from the regarded prong transitory impairment is one with an actual or expected duration of six months or less the ada amendments act also provides in rule of cons truction in title v of the ada that covered entity under title i12 public entity under title ii or person who operates place of public accommodation under title iii need not provide reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification to po licies practices or proce dures to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the regarded as prong of the definition13 the supreme court in sutton questioned the authority of regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations for the definition of disability in the ada the definition of disability is contained in section 3 of the ada and the ada does not specifically give any agency the authority to interpret the definitions in section 3 including thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs4 14 524 us 624 1998 for more

considering the mitigating measures he employs 18 527 us 555 1999 19 534 us 184 2002definition of disability the supreme court d eclined to address this issue since as both parties to sutton accepted the regulation as valid we have occasion to consider what deference they are due if any the ada amendments act specifically grants regulatory authority and states that the authority to issue regulations granted to the equal employ ment opportunity co mmission the attorney general and the secretary of transporta tion under this act includes the authority to issue regulations implementing the defi nitions contained in sections 3 and 4 supreme cour t decisions the first ada case to address the interp retation of the defi nition of disability was bragdon v abbott case involving dentist who refused to treat an hiv infected individual outside of hospital14 in bragdon the court found that the plaintiffs asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment impacting on the major life activity of reproduc tion thus rendering hiv infection disability under the ada two other cases the court has decide d on the definitional issue involved whether the effects of medication or assistive devices should be taken into consideration in determining whether or not an individual has disability the court in sutton v united air lines15 and in murphy v united parcel service inc16 held the determination of whether an indivi dual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that mitig ate the individuals impairment17 in albertsons inc v kirkingburg18 the court held unanimously that the ada requires proof that the limitation on major life activity by the impairment is substantial the court held in toyota motor manufacturing v williams19 that to be an individual with disability under the act an individual must have substantial limitations that are central to daily life not just limited to particular job the holdings of all these decisions have been changed by the actment of the ada amendments act pl 110325httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs5 20 42 usc 12112a 21 42 usc 121115 22 arbaugh v h corp 546 us500 2006 23 42 usc 2000eb 24 538 us 440 2003employment coverage of employers title i of the ada provides that cove red entity shall discriminate against qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures the hiring advancement or discharge of employees employee compensation job training and other terms conditi ons and privileges of employment20 the term employer is defined as person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees21 therefore the employment section of the ada unlike the section on public accommodations which does not have this limit is limited in scope to employers with 15 or more employees th is parallels the cove rage provided in the civil rights act of 1964 title vii like the ada prohibits employment discrimination only where employers employ 15 or more employees in an unanimous decision in arbaugh v h corp 22 the court held that the 15 employee limitation in title vii of the civil rights act23 was not jurisdictional but rather was related to the substantive adequacy of claim thus if the defense that the employer employs fewer than 15 employees is not raised in timely manner court is not obligated to dismiss the case since the adas 15 employee limitation language parallels that of t itle vii it is likely that court would interpret the adas requirement in the same manner the supreme court examined the defi nition of the term employee under the ada in clackamas gastroenterology associates pc v wells24 in clackamas the court held in 72 decision written by ju stice stevens that the eeocs guidelines concerning whether shareholderdirector is an employee were the correct standard to use since the evidence was not clear the case was remanded for further proceedings clackamas gastroenterology associates is medical clinic in oregon that employed ms wells as bookkeeper fro m 19861997 after her termination from employment ms wells brought an action alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of disability under title i of the ada the clinic nied that it was covered by the ada since it argued that it did not have 15 or more employees for the 20 weeks per year required by the statute the termination of covera ge was dependent on whether the four physician shareholders who owned th professional corporation were counted as employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs6 25 42 usc 121114 26 eeoc compliance manual 6050009 27 42 usc 1211212113the court first looked to the definiti on of employee in the ada which states that an employee is an indivi dual employed by an employer25 this definition was described as one which is completely circ ular and explains nothing the majority then looked to common law specifically th common law element of control this was the position advocated by the eeoc the eeoc has issued guidelines which list six factors to be considered in determining whether the individual acts independently and pa rticipates in managing the organization or whether the individual is subject to the organizations control and therefore an employee these six factors are whether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individuals work whether and if so to what extent the organization supervises the individuals work whether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization whether and if so to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization whet her the parties intende d that the individual be an employee as expressed in written agreements or contracts and whether the individual shares in the profits losse s and liabilities of the organization26 justice stevens writing for the majority found that some of the district courts findings of fact when considered in light of the eeocs standa rd appeared to favor the conclusion that the four physicians were not employees of the clinic however since there was some evidence that might support the opposite conclusion the court remanded the case for further proceedings justice ginsburg joined by justice breyer dissented from the majoritys opinion the dissenters argued that th courts opinion used only one of the commonlaw aspects of mast erservant relationship in addition justice ginsburg noted that the physicianshareholders argued they were employees for the purposes of other statutes notably the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and stated i see reason to allow the doctors to escape from their choice of corporate form when the question beco mes whether they are employees for the purposes of federal antidiscrimination statutes direct threat once an ada employment case has advan ced past the threshold questions of whether the plaintiff is an individual with disability and whether the employer in question employs 15 or more employees the next set of issues involve whether the individual can perform the esse ntial functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodation the qualifications standards used may also include requirement that an individual shall not pose direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace 27 title iii contains s imilar provision

in or benefit from the services of public accommodation where such an individual poses direct threat to the health or safety of others29 the court determined that there is duty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective scientific information available and that belief that significant risk existed even if maintain ed in good faith would not relieve him from liability the court remanded the case for consideration of the weight to be given to various pieces of evidence relating to the direct threat issue and on remand the court of appeals for the first circuit c oncluded that the defendant had produced legitimate scientific evidence to show th at providing routine dental care would subject him to significant risk of contacting hiv30 the supreme court denied certiorari on may 24 199931 although the court in albertsons inc v kirkingburg did not specifically address the direct threat nguage it dealt with relate d concept concerning federal safety regulations in albertsons the court held that an employer who requires an employee as part of job qualification to meet applicable federal safety regulations does not have to justify enforcing those regulations even if there is an experimental waiver program the supreme court again dealt with the direct threat concept but in the context of title i of the ada regarding employment in chevron usa inc v echazabal 32 the court held unanimously in echazabal that the ada does not require an employer to hire an individual with disability if the job in question would endanger the individuals health the court upheld regulation by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc that allows an employer to asse rt direct threat defense to an allegation of employment discrimination where the threat is posed only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation33 the adas statutory language provides for defense to an allegation of discrimination that qualification standard is job rela ted and consistent w ith business necessity34 the act also allows an employer to impose as qualification st andard that the individual shall not pose direct threat to the health or safe ty of other individuals in the workplace35 but does not discuss threat to the individuals health or safety the ninth circuit inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs8 36 226 f3d 1063 9th cir 2000 37 499 us 187 1991echazabal had determined that an employer vi olated the ada by refusing to hire an applicant with serious liver condition whose illness would be aggravated through exposure to the chemicals in the workplace36 after review of the factual background the courts decision in echazabal analyzed the statutory and regulatory lang uage finding that the statutory provisions discussed above were spaci ous defensive categories whic h seem to give an agency or in the absence of agency action cour t good deal of discretion in setting the limits of permissible qualifi cation standards in suppor t of the eeoc regulations the court noted that congress used language identical to that in the rehabilitation act knowing full well that the eeoc had interpreted that language to recognize threats to self justice souter writin g for the court observed that the adas language was not intended to define all the defenses available to an employer when congress specified threats to othe rs in the workplacecould it possibly have meant that an employer could not defend refusal to hire when an workers disability would threaten others outside the workpl ace if typhoid mary had come under the ada would meat packer have been defe nseless if mary had sued after being turned away the court then turned to the issue of whether the eeoc had sufficient statutory basis for its regulatory inte rpretation finding that che vrons reasons for calling the regulation reasonable are unsurprising moral concerns aside it wishes to avoid time lost to sickness excessive turnover from medical retirement or death litigation under state tort law and the risk of violatin g the national occupational safety and health act of 1970 in addition justice souter found that the eeoc regulations were not the kind of workplace paternalism that th ada seeks to outlaw the eeoc was certainly acting within the reasonable zone when it saw difference between rejecting workplace paternalism and ignoring specific and documented risks to the employee himself even if the employee would take his chances for the sake of getting job the court emphasized that direct threat defense must be based on medical judgment that uses the most current medical knowledge the supreme court had examined an analogous issue in uaw v johnson controls inc 37 which held that under the civil rights act of 1964 employers could not enforce fetal protection policies that kept women whether pregnant or with the potential to become pregnant from jobs th at might endanger developing fetus although this case was raised by the plain tiff the supreme court distinguished the decision there from that in echazabal the johnson controls decision was described as concerned with paterna listic judgments based on th broad category of gender while the eeoc has required that judgment s based on the direct threat provision be made on the basis of indivi dualized risk assessments the supreme court reversed and re manded

with the issue of whether the ada confers preferentia l rehiring rights on employees who have been lawfully terminated for misconduct in this case illegal drug use however the court in an opinion by justice thomas did not reach this issue finding that the ninth circuit had improperly applied disparate impact analysis in disparate treatment case and remanding the case th court observed that it has consistently recognized distinction between claims of discrimination based on disparate treatment and claims of discrimination based on disparate impact disparate treatment was described as when an employer treats some people less favorably than others because of protected characteris tic such as race and liability depends on whether the protected trait actually motivat ed the employers decision disparate impact in contrast involves practices that are facially neutral but in fact impact protected group more harshly and cannot be justified by business necessity disparate impact cases do not required evidence of an employers subjective intent41 collective bargaining agreements in wright v universal maritime service corp 42 unanimous court held that the general arbitration clause in collective bargaining agreement does not require plaintiff to use the arbitration procedur for an alleged violation of the ada the courts decision was limited since it did not fi nd it necessary to reach the issue of the validity of unionnegotiated waiver in other words the court found that general arbitration agreement in collective bargaining agreement is not sufficient to waive rights under civil rights stat utes the court did not reach situations where collective bargaining agreements are very specific in requiring arbitration for alleged violations of civil rights statutes reasonable accommodations and seniority systems the supreme court in us airways v barnett43 held that an employers showing that requested accommodation by an employee with disability conflictshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs10 44 526 us 795 1999with the rules of seniority system is or dinarily sufficient to establish that the requested accommodation is not reasonable within the meaning of the ada the court in majority opinion by justice breyer observed that seniority system provides important employee benefits by creating and fulfilling employee expectations of fair uniform treatment and that to require typical employer to show more than the existence of seni ority system might undermine the employees expectations of consistent uniform treatme nt thus in most cases the existence of seniority system would entitle an employer to summary judgment in its favor the court found language in the ada which would change this presumption if the seniority system was imposed by ma nagement and not by collective bargaining however justice breyer found that there were some exceptions to this rule for special circumstances and gave as exam ples situations where 1 the employer fairly frequently changes the seniority system unilaterally and thereby diminishes employee expectations to the point where one more departure would not likely make difference or 2 the seniority system contains so many exceptions that one more exception is unlikely to matter although the majority in barnett garnered five votes the courts views were splintered there were strong dissent s and two concurring opinions in her concurrence justice oconnor stated that she would prefer to say that the effect of seniority system on the ada depends on wh ether the seniority system is legally enforceable but that since the result would be the same in most cases as under the majoritys reasoning she joined with the majority to prevent stalemate the dissents took vigorous exception to the ma joritys decision with justice scalia joined by justice thomas arguing that the ada does not permit any seniority system to be overridden the dissent by justice s outer joined by justice ginsberg argued that nothing in the ada insulated seni ority rules from reasonable accommodation requirement receipt of ssdi benefits in cleveland v policy management systems corp the supreme court unanimously held that pursuit and receipt of ssdi benefits does not automatically stop recipient from pursuing an ada claim or even create strong presumption against success under the ada44 observing that the social security act and the ada both help individuals with disabilities but in different ways the court found that despite the appearance of conflict that arises from the language of the two statutes the two claims do not inherently conflict to the point where courts should apply special negative presumption like th one applied by the court of appeals here the fact that the ada defines qualified individual as one who can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation was seen as key distinction between the ada nd the social security act in addition the court observed that ssdi benefits are sometimes granted to individuals who are working httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31401crs11 45 527 us 581 1999 46 524 us 206 1998however although these distinctions be tween the two statutes would rule out special legal presumption the court did note that in some cases an earlier ssdi claim may genuinely c onflict with an ada claim ther efore if an individual has asserted that he or she is unable to work in an application for ssdi benefits this may negate the ada requirement that the indivi dual with disability be able to perform the essential functions of the job for that reason the court held that an ada plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent c ontradiction that arises out of the earlier ssdi total disability claim rather she must proffer fficient explanation since the parties to the case in cleveland did not have the opportunity to examine the plaintiffs contentions in court the case was vacated and remanded for further proceedings community placement and individuals with mental disabilities in olmstead v georgia45 the supreme court held that title ii of the ada requires states to place individuals with mental disabilities in community settings rather than institutions when the states treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate community placement is not opposed by the individual with disability and the placement can be reasonably accommodated unjustified isolationis pr operly regarded as discr imination based on disability the olmstead case had been closely watched by both disability groups and state governments although disability groups have applauded the holding that undue institutionalization qualifies as discrimina tion by reason of disability the supreme court did place certain limitations on this right in addition to the agreement of the individual affected the court also dealt with the issue of what is reasonable modification of an existing program and stated sensibly construed the fundamentalalteration compone nt of the reasonablemodifications regulation would allow the state to show that in the allocation of available resources immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitabl given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the car and treatment of large nd diverse popula tion of persons with mental disabilities this examination of what constitutes reasonable modification may have implications for the interpretation of similar concepts in the employment and public accomm odations titles of the ada application of the ada to state prisons in pennsylvania department of prisons v yeskey46 the court found that state prisons were covered under t itle ii of the ada the state had argued that state prisoners were not covered since such coverage would alter the usual constitutional balance between the states and federal government the supreme court rejected this argument observing that the ada plainly covers state institutions without any

title ii of the ada in situations involving accommodations for prisoners with disabilities eleventh amendment issues the eleventh amendment states the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state the supreme court has found that the eleventh amendment applies to suits by citizens against their own states47 and cannot be abrogated by the use of article i power s but that section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used for abrogation in certain circumstances section 5 of the fourteenth amendment states the congre ss shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legisla tion the provisions of this article the circumstances where section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to abrogate the eleventh amendment have been discussed in various supreme court decisions which reiterated the principle that the congress may abrogate state immunity from suit under the fourteenth amendment and found that there were several conditions necessary for successful abrogation congressional power is limited to the enactment of appropriate legislation to enforce the substa ntive provisions of the fourteenth amendment the legislation must be remedial in nature there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted to that end48 in recent years the supreme court has examined numerous statutes to determine whether they properly abrogate d the eleventh amendment and in most cases found the statutes lacking49 however the courts federalism doctrine has been somewhat reined in by the recent decisions in tennessee v lane discussed below and nevada dept of human

of the ada regarding the eleventh amendment unclear the courts recent decision in united states v georgia52 raised the issue of whether congress had validly abrogated state immunity from damage suits under title ii of the ada in situations involving accommodations for prisoners with disabilities but the court decided the case on more narrow grounds holding only that title ii of the ada created private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violated the fourteenth amendment the supreme court addressed issu involving pr isoners under the ada in pennsylvania department of corrections v yeskey53 where the court held that state prisons are within the adas statutory defi nition of public entity but did not reach the constitutional issues united states v georgia involved the claims of georgia prisoner who is paraplegic and uses wheel chair the inmate claimed that he was confined for 2324 hours day to cell so small that he was ble to maneuver his wheelchair in addition he argued that he was deprived of access to toilet and shower and was forced to sit in his own bodily waste because prison officials refused to provide assistance these conditions he argued violated the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and the ada the eleventh circuit court of appeals did not address the suffi ciency of the claim under title ii of the ada but found that the title ii claims for m onetary damages against the state were barred by sovereign immunity the supreme court in an unanimous opinion written by justice scalia held that title ii of the ada created private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violates the fourteenth amendment in arriving at this holding the court noted that the plaintiffs claims for m oney damages under the ada were based in large part on violations of s ection 1 of the fourteenth amendment and observed that this differed from other cases regarding the eleventh amendment such as tennessee v lane justice scalia recognized that the supreme court has been split regarding the scope of congresss prophylactic enforcement powers under 5 of the fourteenth amendment but found common gr ound in the r ecognition of section 5 powers to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment by creating private remedies against actua l violations of these provi sions thus justice scalia concluded for the court insofar as title ii creates private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violated the fourteenth amendment title ii validly abrogates state sovereign immunity united states v georgia is limited decision which does not address the split in the supreme court regarding when there is abrogation of

from its recent approaches to the application of the eleventh amendment holding that title ii of the ada as it applies to the fundamental righ t of access to the cour ts constitutes valid exercise of congressional authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment lane was an action brought by george lane and beverly jones both paraplegics who use wheelchairs for mobility against tennessee mr lane alleged that he was compelled to appear in court to answer criminal charges and had to crawl up two flights of stairs to get to the court room ms jones certified court reporter alleged that she was unable to gain access to number of county courthouses thus losing employment opportunities in 54 d ecision with the opinion written by justice stevens the court noted that when an alyzing an eleventh amendment immunity issue two questions must be resolved 1 whether congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate and 2 if so whether it acted pursuant to valid grant of congressional authority the ada specifically provides for abrogation55 so the court then applied the test set out in city of boerne v flores56 which found that legislation enacted pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment is valid if it had congruence and proportionality between the inju ry to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end57 justice stevens opinion found that title ii of the ada like title i sought to prohibit irrational discrimination but noted that title ii also sought to enforce variety of basic constitutional guarantees in cluding the right of access to the courts noting the pattern of disab ility discrimination that led to the enactment of the ada and the sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of public services the court held that the in adequate provisions of public services and access to public facilities was an appropria subject for remedial prophylactic legislation the final issue was whether t itle ii was an appropria response to this history and pattern of discr imination although the court had been urged to consider the entire sweep of title ii justice steven s declined to broaden the ruling beyond the issue of the accessibility of j udicial services the court held that the remedies were congruent and proportional to the goal of enforcing the right of access to the courts and emphasized that the title ii of the ada requires only reasona ble modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the rvice provided and that do not impose an undue financial or administrative burden or thr eaten historic preservation interests thus the court concluded title ii as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts constitutes valid exercise of congress 5 authority to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment the lane decision was close 54 with two concurring opinions and dissenting opinion written by chief justice rehnquist it is also limited in its scope although the chief justice argued in his dissenting opinion that title ii of the ada

the accessibility of judicial services the majoritys emphasis on detailed fact finding in the legislative history and its statement in the adas findings and purposes58 indicates how crucial these facts are to proper abrogation of the eleventh amendment in addition the courts emphasis on the constitutional ri ghts involved in the access to courts indicates that cases which do not involve such rights may not pass constitutional muster in subsequent decisions in previous decision on title i of the ada the supreme court reached different conclusion regarding abrogation in garrett v university of alabama59 another 54 decision the court held that the eleventh amendment bars suits to recover monetary damages by state empl oyees under title i of the americans with disabilities act ada th majority opinion in garrett stated that congress is the final authority as to desirable public po licy but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the states there must be pattern of discrimination by the states which violates the fourteenth amendment and the remedy imposed by congress must be c ongruent and proportional to the targeted violation those

fundamentally lter the nature of petitioners tournaments justice scalia joined by justice thomas wrote scathing dissent arguing that the majority distorted the text of title iii the structure of the

of the ada does apply to foreign cruise ships and the fifth circuit in spector v norwegian cruise lines63 holding that the ada would not be applicable since applicability would impose us law on foreign nations the supreme courts decision specifically held that the statute is applicable to foreign ships in the united states waters to the same extent that it is applicable to american ships in those waters the majority concurred that cruise ships need not comply with the ada if modifications would conflict with international legal obligations since the ada only requires r eadily achievable accommodations the 54 decision however was fragmented with various justices joining for various aspects of the opinion it is difficult ther efore to determine exactly what type of accommodations would be required by the pplication of the ada since the case below had been dismissed without trial it was remanded to dete rmine the statutory requirements in this par ticular situation the stion of whether title iii requires any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with the international affairs of any cruise ship foreign flag or domestic was specifically left undecided justice scalia in his dissen ting opinion argued that the ada should not be interpreted to apply in the absence of clear statement from congress attorneys fees and damages the ada allows court in its discretion to award attorneys fees to prevailing party64 in buckhannon board and care home inc v west virginia department of human resources65 the supreme court addressed the catalyst theory of attorneys fees which posits that plaintiff is prevailing party if the lawsuit brings about voluntary change in the defendants conduct the court rejected this theory finding that attorneys fees are only available where there is judicially sanctioned change in th legal relationship of the parties the supreme court in barnes v gorman66 held in unanimous decision that punitive damages may

compensa tory damages and 12 million in punitive damages the eighth circuit court of appeals upheld the award of punitive damages but the supreme cour t reversed although the c ourt was unanimous in the result there were two concurring opinions and the concurring opinion by justice stevens joined by justices ginsburg and breyer disagreed with the reasoning used in justice scalias opi nion for the court justice scalia observed that the remedi for violations of both section 202 of the ada and section 504 of the reha bilitation act are coextensive with the remedies available in private cause of action brought under title vi of the civil rights act of 196469 neither section 504 nor t itle ii of the ada specifically mention punitive damages rather they reference the remedies of title vi of the civil rights act title vi is based on the c ongressional power under the spending clause70 to place conditions on grants justice scalia noted that spending clause legislation is much in the nature of contract nd in order to be legitimate use of this power the recipient must voluntarily and knowingly accept the terms of the contract if congress intends to im pose condition on the grant of federal moneys it must do so unambiguously71 this contract law analogy was also found to be applicable to determining the sc ope of the damages remedies and since punitive damages are generally not f ound to be available for breach of contract justice scalia found that they were not available under title vi section 504 or the ada the exact implications of gorman are not clear justice stevens argued that the reasoning used in justice scalias opinion has potentially farreaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed nd argued in this case although he also noted that justice scalia did cabin the potential reach of todays decision by stating that we do not imply for example that its under spending clau legislation are suits in contract or that contractlaw principles apply to all issues that they raise
