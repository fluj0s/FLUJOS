editors in question would act in good faith im not convinced of this i dont believe response in grl is warranted in any case the mm claims in question are debunked in other papers that are in press and in review elsewhere im not sure that grl can be seen as an honest broker in these debates anymore and it is probably best to do an end run around grl now where possible they have published far too many deeply flawed contrarian papers in the past year or so there is possible excuse for them publishing all 3 douglass papers and the soon et paper these were all pure crap there appears to be more fundamental problem w grl now unfortunately mike at 0847 pm 1202005 mhughesltrrarizonaedu wrote mike i found this sentence in the reply from the grl editorinchief to be interesting as this manuscript was not written as comment but rather as fullup scientific manuscript you would not in general be asked to look it over does it not then follow that if you were to challenge their work in full up scientific manuscript but not as comment it too should be reviewed without reference to mm maybe the editorinchief should be asked if this is the case or simply challenged by submission cheers malcolm quoting michael mann mannvirginiaedu thanks tom yeah basically this is just heads up to people that something might be up here what shame that would be its one thing to lose climate research we cant afford to lose grl i think it would be useful if people begin to record their experiences w both saiers and potentially mackwell i dont know himhe would seem to be complicit w what is going on here if there is clear body of evidence that something is amiss it could be taken through the proper channels i dont that the entire agu hierarchy has yet been compromised the grl article simply parrots the rejected nature commentlittle substantial difference that i can see at all will keep you all posted of any relevant developments mike at 0430 pm 1202005 tom wigley wrote mike this is truly awful grl has gone downhill rapidly in recent years i think the decline began before saiers i have had some unhelpful dealings with him recently with regard to paper sarah and i have on glaciers it was well received by the referees and so is in the publication pipeline however i got the impression that saiers was trying to keep it from being published proving bad behavior here is very difficult if you think that saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp then if we can find documentary evidence of this we could go through official agu channels to get him ousted even this would be difficult how different is the grl paper from the nature paper did the authors counter any of the criticisms my experience with douglass is that the identical bar format changes paper to one previously rejected was submitted to grl tom michael mann wrote dear all just heads up apparently the contrarians now have an in with grl this guy saiers has prior connection w the university of virginia dept of environmental sciences that causes some unease i think we now know how the various douglass et papers w michaels and singer the soon et paper and now this one have gotten published in grl mike subject

presume were the reason for your phone call to last week i have reviewed the manuscript by mcintyre as well as the reviews the editor in this case was prof james saiers he did note initially that the manuscript did challenge published work and so felt the need for an extensive and thorough review for that reason he requested reviews from 3 knowledgable scientists all three reviews recommended publication while i do agree that this manuscript does challenge somewhat aggresively some of your past work i do not feel that it takes particularly harsh tone on the other hand i can understand your reaction as this manuscript was not written as comment but rather as fullup scientific manuscript you would not in general be asked to look it over and i am satisfied by the credentials of the reviewers thus i do not feel that we have sufficient reason to interfere in the timely publication of this work however you are perfectly in your rights to write comment in which you challenge the authors arguments and assertions should you elect to do this your comment would be provided to them and they would be offered the chance to write reply both comment and reply would then be reviewed and published together if they survived the review process comments are limited to the equivalent of 2 journal pages regards steve mackwell editor in chief grl

shouldnt make that assumption if the issues are being dealt with elsewhere in the peerreviewed literature soon in time for ipcc to be aware of them then there would be reason for riposte in grl even so it might be worth putting the hypothetical case to the editorinchief to test his response cheers malcolm xflowed
