regional office mexico and central america ae200636603 executive summary in february 2006 oios conducted an audit of the ited nations office on drugs and crime regional office mexico and central america romex oios overall assessment is that ongoing projects were well managed and that adequat systems were in place to ensure that regulations and rules operational and administrati ve are complied with coordination efforts were substantial with partners appreciating the wo rk of romex although more was to be done the programme portfolio was increasing in an enviro nment of institutional problems that required considerable coordination efforts unodc accepted all the recommendations and has eith er fully implemented or started to implement them romexs strategies and coordination efforts it was evident that there were still institutional problems in countries within central america that constrain the work of romex they include wea k institutions inadequate legal frameworks limited resources and lack of regiona l coordination and cooperation between governments civil society and the private sector t combat organized crime in the region also the lack of data and information made it diff icult to determine the magnitude of crimes drug consumption and drug manufacturing therefore romexs efforts were firstly towards fortifying structures and establishing coor dination mechanisms in this regard and in mexico the attorney generals office ministry of health ministry of foreign affairs centre of juvenile integration and the narcotics af fairs section of the embassy of the united states of america in mexico expressed to ios their full support to and satisfaction with romexs work counterparts in co sta rica and honduras were equally satisfied programme the programme portfolio mainly concentrated on prev ention treatment and rehabilitation projects romex recognized that the project portfolio is to b increased further but it should be noted that there are numerous coordinatio n activities that are carried out that has little financial implication to romex oios noted romexs efforts but is of the opinion that strategy should be developed in consultatio n with the partnership and development branch to further increase the programme portfolio romex has drafted the strategic frameworks for 20062008 one for mexico and one f or central america ongoing projects projects camf17 programme on prevention rehabili tation and social reinsertion were well advanced in its implementation while project camh90 establishment of treatment

coordinating the efforts of co unterparts in this comprehensive project and according to the counterp arts at central level and the state of nuevo leon the project would receive substantial fu nding from coparmex the project was still at the early stages of implementation bu t it was evident that the counterparts viewed this project as project with big potentia l not only in the state of nuevo leon but also in other states with only one romex staff member dedicated to the i nstallation of the computerbased nds in latin america the achievements thus far in installing the system and training of operators were impressive project monitoring accountability and consultancie s project implementation was adequately monitored fi nancially and technically they were properly formulated and reported on with project c oordinators displaying accountability throughout implementation there were however tw areas for improvement firstly romex should regularly review the expenditures incu rred by implementing partners in cases where instalments are paid expenditure repo rts from cij fundasalva and icesi with reported expenditures totalling 159000 were still to be verified secondly romex should establish roster for consultants and ensur that at completion of consultancy the required evaluations are completed financial revisions of the expenditure reports were successfully concluded

for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 in spite of efforts of governments guatemala l salvador honduras nicaragua costa rica and panama within the region to combat drugs and crime more effectively much is still to be done to reduce organized crime and drug trafficking 3 the work of romex had been to encourage promote give technical support and implement initiatives that have assisted in coordin ating with authorities of the central american countries in strengthening structures inte nded to fight drug trafficking and organized crime specifically since the declarat ion of guatemala sponsored by unodc and signed unanimously by all the central ame rican countries in july 2000 the ccp committed itself to develop regional action p lan rap to establish shared solutions to those drugrelated problems common to the region the multilateral agreement was endorsed and went into force in june 2003 structures responsible for administering justice to empower governments to fac organized crime have been modernized nevertheless and despite the updating of constitutional and judicial frameworks the systems that administer justice sti ll work with limited budgets and are subject to attacks from other state authorities and society actors the little comparable information suggests that problems regarding access to justice persist almost all democracies of the region

and the evaluation of projects oios reviewed project documents and other records related to operational and financial management and assessed internal control systems in place the audit team also discussed project operations and results with project personn and counterparts furthermore the general administration at romex were also subjecte d to audit 3 iv audit findings and recommendations romex and its strategy 11 romex was established in december 1993 and conc luded memorandum of understanding with the governments of belize costa rica salvador guatemala honduras mexico nicaragua and panama in 1996 12 since 2000 central american countries became m ore involved in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime national ant idrugs commissions were strengthened national plans and strategies against drug trafficking were established and the multilateral system of regional coordination wa s reinforced by means of the permanent central american commission for the eradication of production traffic consumption and illegal uses of drugs and psychotropic substanc ccp romex provided technical support to strengthen the structures inte nded to fight drug trafficking and organized crime in particular and since the decl aration of guatemala that was sponsored by unodc the ccp committed itself to dev elop regional action plan rap to find solutions to drugrelated problems th at are common to the region 13 systems that administer justice still work with limited budgets it was evident that there were still institutional problems that constr ain the work of romex that include weak institutions inadequate legal frameworks lim ited resources and lack of regional coordination and cooperation between governments c ivil society and the private sector to combat organized crime in central america further more the lack of data and information makes it difficult to determine the mag nitude of crimes drug consumption and drug manufacturing therefore romexs efforts were firstly towards fortifying structures to combat crime and drug trafficking tablishing coordination mechanisms and ensuring commitment of the multilateral sphere to s upport efforts against crime drugs and corruption within the region it was within this c ontext that romexs coordination efforts actions aimed at gathering financial resou rces and ensuring private sectors commitment and technical assistance were reviewed also the legal framework in which romex operates within the host country mexico tha t defines the countrys support towards unodcs work in mexico b coordination in mexico 14 the attorney generals office ministry of heal th ministry of foreign affairs centre of juvenile integration cij and the narcotics aff airs section of the embassy of the united states of america in mexico expressed their full support to and satisfaction with romexs programme and projects 15 the attorney generals office viewed the relati onship to be very productive and close especially in regard to interinstitutional coopera tion mentioning that in the case of mexico it is not possible to fight against crime w ithout multidisciplinary focus and focus on the structural causes of crime in this r egard romex triggered unified positions on interinstitutional cooperation between the diff erent governmental and non governmental institutions however recognizing th at work must be done within the social ambit and not only in the political affair and that crime is global matter therefore they are motivated to work with unodc appreciating tha t unodc works in the field and not only behind the desk 16 according to the ministry of foreign affairs u nodc proved to be powerful tool to balance bilateral relationships in its work related areas the ministry interacts with all the 4 agencies represented in mexico according to the mandate of each yet the work and relationship with unodc is closer not only because of the kind of work but also because of the cooperative posture of romex furthermore the ministry argued that although memorandum of understanding already exists between the ministry and undp mexico there was need for more specific framework draft memorandum of understanding mou was submitted to romex at the time of the aud it for review it took quite some time to draft the mou and the completion should now be expedited recommendation head2right unodc regional office mexico and central america should expedite the review and completion of the memorandu m of understanding with the ministry of foreign affairs rec 01 unodc accepted the recommendation draft memorand um of understanding has been elaborated and is under revision by romex and the m inistry of foreign affairs oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of co py of the approved memorandum of understanding 17 romex also entered into collaboration agreeme nt with the federal commission for the protection from sanitary risks cofepris f the ministry of health that provided premises free of charge to romex the mee tings with the federal sanitary system control of psychotropic narcotics and cont rolled substances and cofepris focused more on the implementation of the national drug system nds and the new project xcai86 mesoamerican control group of nar cotics psychotropic and chemical precursors but it was evident that there was we ll established relationship with the ministry of health 18 cij had been involved in unodc projects for mor than 10 years main projects were camc89 camf17 honh88 mexf84 and camh90 their role was mainly to conduct workshops developing courses and method ologies and conducting evaluations therefore more practical than strategic and the r eview of the projects indicated that cij had proactive approaches that are fully supportive of unodcs work 19 the narcotics affairs section of the embassy of the united states of america in mexico were satisfied with unodcs events and proje cts and valued romexs coordination role however it mentioned the need for unodc to increase seed money for more projects within mexico c counterparts in costa rica and honduras 20 the auditors met number of romexs counterpar ts in costa rica and honduras including the costa rican institute on drugs icd and the national council against drug trafficking in honduras and the honduran institute to prevent alcoholism and drug dependence romex in particular its project coord inator in honduras coordinated activities well this was evident from the review of projects honh88 and camh90 in project honh88 alone romex had five counterpar ts the national antidrug council cncn municipality of tegucigalpa amdc honduran institute for professional training infop honduran institute t prevent alcoholism and drug dependence ihadfa and the nongovernmental organi zation compartir the engagement of project coordinator in honduras pro ved to be an efficient and effective arrangement not only to ensure good cooperation an d coordination but also to facilitate project implementation on daytoday basis 5 d romexs programme 21 priority problems remain drug trafficking and t he use of illegal drugs social violence human trafficking and smuggling corruption and mon ey laundering since inception and until 2003 romex incurred project expenditures tot aling 177 million of which 145 million was for procurement within the period 1989 and 1994 undertaken by unops in respect of projects mex590 mex591 and mex592 apart from procurement only 32 million was spent on other projects over the t enyear period 1994 to 2003 which is an average of 320000 per year 22 in 2004 the expenditures were 560000 an i ncrease of 75 per cent on the afore mentioned yearly average and in 2005 the expenditu re increased by 300000 53 per cent to 860000 the increase in expenditures was main ly because of project camh90 the establishment of treatment rehabilitation nd social reintegration network in central america that has an approved project budge t of 17 million apart from this project the main ongoing project was mexh32 pro gram of prevention of crime in the state of nuevo leon mexico with an approved budge t of 155000 but substantial increase was anticipated 23 the programme portfolio mainly concentrated on prevention treatment and rehabilitation projects the portfolio lacked law enforcement projects but project ideas were under development for anticorruption counter narcotics and antihuman trafficking romex was also in the process to arrange funding f or law enforcement activities and expertise romex recognized that the project portfolio is to b increased further and apart from the project ideas that are under develo pment it is in the process of starting new projects furthermore there are increasing ac tivities in project mexh32 it should be noted however that there are numerous coordina tion activities that are carried out that has little financial implication to romex oios noted romexs efforts but is of the opinion that strategy should be developed in consultation with the partnership and development branch to increase the programme portf olio recommendation head2right unodc regional office mexico and central america should in consultation with the partnership and velopment branch at headquarters develop strategy to incre ase its programme portfolio especially in areas in which t here are limited activities such as law enforcement rec 0 2 unodc accepted the recommendation in general the r ecommendation to increase activities in law enforcement cannot be accepted in general with regard to the recommendation to increase activities in law enforc ement the decline of donor interest in funding such activities does not allow unodc to develop such projects in the region at large several projects needed to be closed prematurely because of decline of donor interest in this thematic area romex elaborated draft strategic frameworks for 2006 2008 one for mexico and ne for central america oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of co py of the approved strategic frameworks 6 implementation ongoing projects 24 ongoing projects were camh90 honh88 camf17 and mexh32 also and within the framework of collaboration between oasc icad and unodc the central american countries belonging to ccp adopted the nds system in 2004 that is implemented by romex 25 projects honh88 and camf17 were well advanced in its implementation while camh90 progressed on its first phase with furthe r two phases remaining project mexh32 is comprehensive and complicated project that involves the central government the government of monterrey nuevo leon mexico and the private sector in particular the mexican employers confederation coparmex that required extensive preliminary work agreements between the counterparts had been reached but the project is still in its early stages 26 oios reviewed the implementation of the abovem entioned projects in mexico costa rica and honduras the status of implementation at the date of the audit and the results of the visits to the project sites are presented be low camh90 27 the project endeavors to create treatment re habilitation and social reinsertion network in central america and followed on the pilo t project mexf84 that created module for attention for drug abusers in chiapas m exico total amount of 17 million was pledged by the government of luxembourgs fund for the fight against drug trafficking the funding covers three phases each phase was planned for one year and half 28 the first phase includes the following goals stablishing technical regional committee conducting national studies to design strategy agreeing on calendar of activities with the antidrug commissions and healt h ministries of each country and setting up of liaison centres within each country nd an external evaluation 29 oios found the implementing methodology to be c lear and romex established coordination mechanisms at regional level and thro ugh the antidrug commissions at national levels health ministries set the minimum treatment standards and focal points were established to facilitate communication and co ordination within each country all counterparts were members of the regional technical committee that was established in september 2004 in april 2005 one year since the project commenced second regional workshop was held in honduras during which national directories and studies on the infrastructure of treatment rehabilitation and soc ial reinsertion were presented and the liaison centres were defined by each of the countri therefore the first three of the four goals were entirely met but some centers were still to be finished the completion should be expedited prior to the interim evaluation that was originally planned for april 2006 30 oios recommended that unodc regional office m exico and central america should expedite the completion of the liaison centr under project camh90 prior to conducting the interim evaluation originally planne d for april 2006 unodc accepted and implemented the recommendation and replied that except for nicaragua technically all were fully equipped and operating at the time f the evaluation of the first phase of project cam h90 which took place between march and april 2006 in the case of 7 nicaragua there were several difficulties outside of romexs scope given that the land that the government of nicaragua had initially dona ted for the establishment of the centre had legal problems therefore another space free f legal difficulties was assigned the construction of the centre was initiated in june 31 we visited icd in costa rica and the honduran i nstitute for the prevention of alcoholism and drug dependence in honduras the ce ntre in honduras was already completed and equipment was already procured where as costa rica the centre was almost completed the development of the centres w ere well supervised and romex had adequate internal control systems in place to d emonstrate overall accountability 32 other achievements in the project were that of collaboration agreements that were signed with each of the six countries and three col laboration agreements were signed with counterparts cij proyecto hombre and ccp to streng then training opportunities web page was established for the project and online cou rses implementing documents and presentations are available on the intranet work of the second phase that includes equipping the liaison centres was also in progress honh88 33 oios viewed this project to be best practice fo r vocational training projects in the case of honh88 labor market integration of youth at risk through training and subsequent employment the project provides mode l for training and employment programs for youths that are at risk of psychosocia l disintegration it also facilitates special programs of this nature in the policies of the local governments of central america the project process comprised of thorou gh selection process to identify beneficiaries an educational programme that is ducted by an established institute regular psychometric tests applied to beneficiaries supervision and scholarship fund management and the creation of jobs database for beneficiaries romex involved five counterparts to implement the project each of the counterparts had responsibilities that were aligned with their normal activities the dia gram below presents the process 34 the project commenced with global agreement d ocument that described the main responsibilities of each counterpart each counter part is member of the inter institutional council cti that coordinates the pr oject throughout the year and supervises pre selection of beneficiaries revision of profiles by the inter institutional council final selection by infop inscription and orientation process in infop psychological tests application by ihadfa and infop education at infop integration to the laboral system by the social and labor integration office graduation and certification by infop supervised laboral practice 8 and evaluates the activities continuously main achievement was the creation of the social and labor insertion office oisl in februar of 2005 oisl works within the structure of the municipality of tegucigalpa sinc its establishment contacts have been made with the private sector to identify the requir ed professional skills within the private sector that would enhance the possibility to find w ork for the beneficiaries after they complete their trainings the project has also mai ntained database with information regarding the beneficiaries and has assisted them i n finding employment opportunities 35 as costeffective measure and instead of est ablishing its own facilities the project identified an established institution infop that was equipped and that agreed to the integration of the youth beneficiaries in their tra ining workshops the following training courses that were similar to those noted in other unodc operations were offered air conditioning and refrigeration carpenter car pain ting cooking bar tendering and construction unodcs contributions were limited t the purchase of equipment for the training workshops that will be donated at the end of the project we found good internal controls in place during the procurement process an d the project coordinator regularly inspected the equipment at the workshops recommendation head2right unodc regional office mexico and central america should consider implementing methodology of project honh8 8 when formulating future vocational training projects bec ause it could be regarded as best practice especially in labou r market integration through training projects rec 03 unodc accepted the recommendation and expects its i mplementation by the fourth quarter of 2006 the idea of expanding the project to other countries has been discussed with lacs and included in the draft spf in line w ith existing management instructions and practices and considering that honh88 is pilo t project the project will first be evaluated before revision or expansion is underta ken the preparations of the evaluation have started and the report can be expec ted for the 4th quarter of 2006 oios will close the recommendation upon receipt of cop of the evaluation report of honh88 mexh32 36 from the discussions with romex and counterpart s it was evident that it was difficult to find funding for initiatives that prom ote the prevention of illegal drug use and crime including drug trafficking and there was lit tle coordination between governmental nongovernmental and private organisms to improve t he situation in mexico there are 32 states that further complicates coordination effort s 37 project mexh32 endeavors to overcome the afore mentioned weaknesses by coordinating the initiatives of the state of nuevo leon mexico to prevent crime in the state it is pilot project with an approved budg et of only 155000 for the initial period of oneyear but according to romex and counterpart s at central level and the state of nuevo leon the project would receive substantial f unding from the mexican employers confederation coparmex in the state other states also showed interest 38 romex did well in coordinating the efforts of c ounterparts that included the attorney generals office at central and state levels minis tries of foreign affairs public security and health and the main donor coparmex 9 camf17 39 project camf17s programme on prevention reha bilitation and social reinsertion had three components that of scholastic prevention the development of social communication programs and treatment more than 95 per cent of the approved budget of 770000 had already been spent it should be note d however that in addition to the approved budget of unodc governments inkind contr ibutions were some 500000 that equaled almost 70 per cent of the approved budget these inkind contributions were not reflected in project documents similar was the ca in project camh90 where the in kind contributions in the form of property were n ot reflected recommendation head2right unodc regional office mexico and central america in consultation with frms vienna should determine method to calculate inkind contributions from governments an d reflect it in project documents of future projects and in the project document revisions of existing projects rec 04 unodc accepted and implemented the recommendation in coordination with frms in march 2006 method to calculate inkind contributi ons was designed and included in the profi portal in kind contributions for 2004 and 2005 of projects h88 f17 and h90 were calculated as well as the romex in kind tributions as part of the methodology romex verifies contributions by govern ments in order to include them as inkind contributions oios will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the relevant project documents showing the amount of in kind contributions 40 an evaluation of the projects establishment of anonymous narcotic groups in the independent region of the south atlantic raas nic aragua had been carried out in 2005 and the results were positive further eval uation will be carried out by cij at the schools in costa rica at which the programme of pre vention on drugdependencies were piloted during the audit school was visited an d the responses from staff were positive 41 nevertheless the impact of the project in cost rica could only be assessed after thorough assessment by cij from an audit point of view the project was properly formulated and the project implementation well supe rvised by the costa rican institute on drugs that dedicated project coordinator for the project depending on the outcome of cijs evaluation and romexs decision to continue priority should be given to ensure further funding recommendation head2right unodc regional office mexico and central america should considering that 95 per cent of the approve d budget had been spent and depending on the outcome of the forthcoming interim evaluation give priority to th funding needs of project camf17 to allow the project to c ontinue until its planned objectives are met rec 05 unodc accepted the recommendation subject to the i nterimevaluation results which will be ready by the end of the year and consideri ng the positive response of project counterparts regarding school prevention unodc wi ll consider the implementation of the project in the rest of costa rica and in two ot her central american countries oios will close the recommendation upon receipt of infor mation on the implementation of the 10 rest of project camf17 nds 42 romex was responsible for the installation of t he computerbased system in

technically projects were properly formulated and project revis ions made as and when necessary financial reports were regularly prepared and submi tted with project coordinators displaying accountability throughout implementation there were however two areas for improvement 45 firstly romex should regularly review the expe nditures incurred by implementing partners in cases where installments are paid the contracts were properly entered into and financial reports were required from the implem enting partners for the amounts that they received expenditure reports were received f rom cij fundasalva and icesi with reported expenditures totaling 159000 but t hey had not been verified as yet by romex secondly romex should establish roster fo r consultants and ensure that at
