acai operated computerized accounting sy stem which meets unhcrs requirements with the exception that it does not generate an ade quate cashbook to compensate acai maintain separate cashbook on excel oios recomme nded that the representation request acai to modify its accounting system to generate cashbook the representation indicated that they have requested acai to reform its account ing system by endjuly 2005 3 14 acai operated an interest bearing bank acc ount and reported to unhcr the interest earned panel of bank signatories had been establ ished and two signatories were required to operate the account acai performed monthly bank r econciliation the bank reconciliation of october 2004 showed some long outstanding cheques which had been made payable to refugees they however were still in the acai off ice since they have not been claimed such situation may be the result of weaknesses in the needs assessments conducted oios recommended that the representation ensure acai per forms monthly review of outstanding cheques to determine the reasons for nonencashment of cheques or the unnecessary delays in cashing them the representation indicated that acai performs m onthly review of cheques that remain outstanding and voids those that remain outstanding after three months 15 for several years acai has used logo which inclu ded the unhcr logo this was explained by the close relationship and association acai had with unhcr as such practice is contrary to the rules oios recommended that the representation notify acai that they should discontinue using the unhcr symbol in its go the representation stated that acai had eliminated the inappropriate logo from document s generated by the computer and was in the process of redesigning new logo 16 acai is in charge of the promotion and mon itoring of microcredit projects oios obtained evidence that promotional activities were carried out on regular basis the acai social workers are involved in the assessment of pr oject proposals and they participate in feasibility study visits prior to financing proje ct however postfinancing visits were not performed and acai has not yet established the nece ssary tools to measure the achievement of programme objectives in response to oios recomme ndations the representation informed us that acai initiated postfinancing visits of all projects with at least six months of activities to gauge their advance and to better assess the soc ioeconomic impact of project activities consolidated report of the project was planned for end of april as from may 2005 these visits will be carried out jointly by unhcr and acai to better measure their socioeconomic impact acai is working on format to easily repor t on income generation obtained from the microcredit projects 17 various categories of assistance have been establis hed with criteria revised regularly they covered several situations including new arriv als elderly and vulnerable persons supplementary assistance after the first three mont hs if considered needed installation grants and education given that the budgeting and report ing of expenditure is consolidated for all types of financial assistance oios was of the view that the effectiveness of the budgetary control and financial monitoring could be compromis ed the representation created more detailed budget lines for 2005 to better differenti ate between funds allocated for different forms of assistance as of march 2005 acai modified its reporting format to further strengthen statistical reporting on beneficiaries of assistanc 18 there was insufficient information on exce ptional cases for instance the number of refugees who have received more than the three mont hs assistance this represented about 30 to 40 per cent of the beneficiaries although acai maintains monthly needs assessment sheets the justification for supplementary assistance was not always sufficient due to the fact that formal needs assessment was done only when the assi stance is required for more than six months the representation stated that acai would improve its differentiation of specialized need as well as additional justification for assist ance beyond the basic threemonth package 4 b other programme issues monitoring of acais activities 19 the project monitoring of acai activities was not performed effectively or adequately documented improvements were required to align fin ancial and operational monitoring the responsibility to monitor acais activities other than financial and administrative was delegated to the protection officer who is the foca l point for all protection related activities though the protection officer has regular contact w ith acai there were records or notes for the file supporting the monitoring activities d one therefore assurance could be taken that this work was being done effectively 20 following an oios recommendation made in 2 002 the unhcr finance assistant discontinued performing financial monitoring in ord er to avoid potential conflict of interest unhcr then contracted kpmg for this task kpmg reg ularly reviewed acais accounting records and reported its results to unhcr although these reports are useful the fact that the financial monitoring is done without comparing the operations with the financial records raise doubt about the effectiveness of the process oios recommended that the representation revised its strategy for monitoring acai activities the representation stated that the adminfinance assistant initiated monthly financi review exercise at acai premises the representation also indicated that because of the h eavy protectionrelated workload of the legal officer there continues to be insufficient s taffing to ensure adequate monitoring of programme aspects recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in costa rica should take appropriate action to ensure comprehensive monitori ng of programme activities rec 02 21 the representation accepted the recommendation and stated that efforts would be made to improve staff resources for operational and financial monitoring of programme activities oios will close the recommendation upon receipt f information how financial and operational monitoring has been aligned 22 the action taken by acai to solve potent ial conflict of interest identified in 2002 by oios resulted in acai replacing its director howe ver the new director of acai is close relative of the director of the organization managi ng the microcredit funds the asociación profesionales desarrollo aprode such relationship is not conducive to ensuring sound internal controls over microcredit activitie s given that the provision of funds is decided upon by these two organizations acai and aprode w ithout unhcrs involvement or close supervision the financial risks associated w ith this relationship need to be assessed by unhcr and measures taken to mitigate the risks the representation stated that acai has been requested to detail and document formal mechan isms for the approval of credits and the disbursements of funds from acai to aprode rsd activities and statistics on beneficiaries 23 the government of costa rica which is res ponsible for performing the rsd process has not submitted any data to unhcr on the number f asylum seekers and recognized refugees since june 2004 since unhcr is not involv ed in the rsd process and in the absence 5 of data provided by the government the representat ion relied on acai estimates which provided an indication of the trends related to new arrivals or current needs of refugees however acai has information on asylum seekers or refugees who are not in need of financial assistance in addition acai maintains its statistics on the basis of information provided to them by the asylum seekers who are not systematically and not immediately informed by the migration service of any rsd decisi on taken oios believes that reliable figures on the number of asylum seekers and recogni zed refugees are essential for planning and managing the programme c supply management 24 most of the procurement transactions are r elated to expenditures of the project abnlals405 implemented by the regional legal uni t rlu which exceeded us 300000 for 2003 and 2004 the expenditures relate d mainly to costs associated with the maintenance of the spanish website printing and tr anslation services oios reviewed the procurement records in particular the documents pporting the selection of the supplier which was awarded the contract 25 in march 2002 rlu entered into contract with the fundación galileo fg for the maintenance of the unhcr spanish website the cont ract was awarded without competitive bidding according to the representation bid wai ver had been obtained for the contract extensions in 2003 and 2004 oios observed some def iciencies in the procurement process the requests for quotation did not mention any dead line time for the submission of offers or the requirement for sealed bids tenders were recei ved by email in 2004 the decision to award the contract to fg which did not submit the lowest offer and amounted to us 87000 was not documented also only two offers were compared th representation also entered into frequent agreements for printing and translation rvices there was evidence that they had been submitted to the local committee on contract i n 2003 and 2004 or that price comparisons had been made 26 oios recommended that the representation s trengthen their procurement procedures in particular the bidding procedures and the docume ntation to support the decisions made the representation agreed and stated that the improveme nts consisted of written requests for offers deadline for submission of sealed bids opening of sealed bids in the presence of witnesses development and use of criteria for the assessment of technical expertise of the potential suppliers asset management 27 the recommendations made by oios in 2002 w ere gradually implemented despite the fact that some asset management related problems we re experienced until the end of 2003 they concerned in particular some decisions to be made by the representative to transfer the ownership of assets to implementing partners withou t the approval of the local asset management board the current representative has ma significant improvements and corrective actions on these issues 6 d security and safety 28 in september 2004 the local field secu rity assistant conducted an inspection of the unhcr premises recommendations aimed at the re inforcement of the security of the premises in general and in particular due to the fa ct that refugees were interviewed in unhcr premises were made and duly implemented measures taken recently consisted of the installation of cameras the placement of security guards and the installation of an information desk at the main entrance of the building the secu rity of the resettlement area still required strengthening also some measures still have to be implemented including the reinforcement of walls installation of panic buttons and emergen cy exit signs at the time of the audit the unhcr premises were about 70 per cent moss complian t the representation informed that additional steps had been taken to enhance security including another inspection of all of the commercial premises where unhcr office is located based on this study the bureau has agreed to relocate the office premises to more itable locale and to do as soon as possible this year other measures taken consisted in the i nstallation of panic buttons for the resettlement interview spaces and the main entrance purchase of satellite phone and mobile phones distributed to the staff involved in securit related issues administration 29 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation costa rica generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review delegation of financial signing authority 30 in 2004 the representative and the head f the regional legal unit reported to the regional representative mexico as from january 2 005 the representative reports to the director of the bureau for the americas and it is f oreseen that the head of the rlu will be reporting to the bureaus deputy director post r ecently approved the abod and loi of the project abcosls400 are addressed to the represen tative and the loi of the project abnlals405 subproject u and u are addresse d to the head of the rlu 31 both the current and the previous division of responsibilities between two heads do not contribute in establishing an appropriate internal control system nor allows for proper segregation of duties and supervision this emphas izes the need for quality controls to be made by monitoring office although the oios aud it in 2000 had recommended that regional office mexico perform supervisory and mon itoring missions to costa rica such missions have been undertaken communications 32 after strengthening the controls the comm unication costs were reduced by more than 50 per cent in 2004 compared to the previous year in 2003 they amounted to almost us 25000 compared to us 14000 as at november 2004 international calls are made from the reception record is maintained and the costs of private calls are deducted from the staff members salaries on monthly basis 7 office premises 33 with annual charges exceeding us 100000 the office rent represents the most significant administrative expenditure the repres entation has proposed to negotiate reduction per square meter oios believes that co mbination of both price negotiation and space reduction are required the representation indicated that the annual rent for office space has been negotiated down to us 70000 withou t sacrificing any space human resources management 34 at the time of the audit there were 19 pe rsons working in the unhcr office premises compared to the nine regular staff posts authorized on the staffing table as of january 2005 four new posts have been authorized and added to th staffing table for the temporary assistance staff working on resettlement the othe r personnel in the office were three employees of fg working on the maintenance of the s panish web site an intern consultant and cleaner 35 since january 2003 the representation rec ruited 32 interns who have signed an internship agreement with confidentiality compone nt contrary to the rules which state that interns need to leave the organization for minimu m period prior to being considered for recruitment two interns were recruited by unhcr du ring and immediately after the end of their contract one on temporary assistance contr act and the second as consultant the latter was recruited through undp for threemonth period 36 the fg employees maintaining the spanish web site were working in unhcr office premises and using unhcr equipment they perform th eir duties under the supervision of the head of rlu the necessity for them to work in unhc r premises could not be evidenced given that one of them works in unhcrs office in m exico city in addition to the financial implications there were confidentiality and securi ty issues the representation stated that because the web site is the main tool for the disse mination of internal refugee law in the americas it was recommended that the employees of the service provider work in close coordination and consultation with the responsible officers of the rlu in costa rica regarding confidentiality issues according to the head of rlu all spanish web site employees have signed the unhcr code of conduct and have proven to act with discretion and perform their functions in professional and s atisfactory way 37 oios still believes that the representatio n should take the necessary action to ensure that the web site service provider employees are t perceived by third party as being unhcr staff oios noted that an fg employee was us ing the unhcr logo on her business card such practice is unacceptable and should be discontinued these employees should sign waiver absolving unhcr of any responsibility for co st arising from accidents andor illnessdeath incurred in unhcr office the representation will ask the head of regional legal unit to ensure that all employees for the web page project are aware of the need to avoid any perception of being unhcr staff and obtain the appropriate waivers of responsibility not otherwise covered in the commercial contract for rvices 38 in addition to these 19 persons there wer four persons working with the ministry of labour 1 the immigration services 2 and the iversity of costa rica 1 given that the government cannot receive unhcr contributions and m ake use of the funds in the manner specified by unhcr an agreement was concluded in 2 003 with the fundación 8 cooperación estatal giving them responsibility of managing project sta ff as unhcr could not renew this agreement for 2004 the project staf f members are back under the legal responsibility of acai without the administrative nd supervisory authority an improvement observed in september 2004 is that acai signed emp loyment contracts containing clauses related to the responsibilities of the staff job d escriptions and working hours v acknowledgement 39 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of unhcr and implementing part ners in costa rica egbert c
