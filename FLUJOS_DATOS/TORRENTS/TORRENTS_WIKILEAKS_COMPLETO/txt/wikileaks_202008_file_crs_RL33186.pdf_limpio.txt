division december 3 2007 abstract americas current account ca deﬁcit the trade deﬁcit plus net income payments and net unilateral transfers has been rising as share of gross domestic product gdp since 1991 the ca deﬁcit reached record high of 61 of gdp in 2005 where it remained in 2006 the ca deﬁcit is ﬁnanced by foreign capital inﬂows many observers have questioned whether such large inﬂows are sustainable and expressed concern about the economic impact should foreign capital inﬂows decline rapidly some fear that rapid decline in the ca deﬁcit could cause recession because presumably decline in the ca deﬁcit would trigger sharp drop in the value of the dollar and rise in interest rates which could lower asset values however economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that the most likely scenario is slow decline in the ca deﬁcit which would not greatly disrupted economic activity because production in the trade sector would be stimulatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33186g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

trade deficit plus net income payments and net unilateral transfers rose as share of gross domestic product gdp from 1991 to record high of 61 of gdp in 2006 in 2007 it fell to 53 of gdp and is projected to continue to fall in 2008 the ca deficit is financed by foreign capital inflows many observers have questioned whether such large inflows are sustainable and expressed concern about the economic impact should foreign capital inflows decline rapidly further large share of the capital inflows have come from foreign central banks in recent years and some are concerned about the economic and political implications of this reliance some fe ar that rapid decline in capital inflows would trigger sharp drop in the value of the dollar and an increase in interest rates that could lower asset values and disrupt economic activity however economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that the most plausible scenario is slow decline in the ca deficit which would not greatly disrupt economic activity because production in the traded goods sector would be stimulated while comprehensive data will not be available for some time it appears that gross capital inflows have recently fallen as result of financial market turmoil while financial market turmoil has led to an economic slowdown it has t been via sudden decline in the dollar or sudden broad spike in us interest rates on the contrary the dollar has appreciated in value and demand for us treasury bonds has risen since the turmoil worsened in september 2008 one longterm consequence of large ca deficit has been the growing foreign ownership of us capital stock large ca deficit is not sustainable in the long run because it increases us net debt owed to foreigners which cannot rise without limit larger debt can be serviced only through more borrowing or higher net exports for net exports to rise all else equal the value of the dollar must fall this explains why many economists believe that both the dollar and the ca deficit will fall at some point in the future to date debt service has not been burdensome because us holdings of foreign assets have earned higher rate of return than us debt owed to foreigners us net investment income has remained positive even though the united states is net debtor nation since 1980 most episodes of declining ca deficit in industrialized countries have been associated with slow economic growth only two episodes were associated with severe disruption in economic activity because most of the episodes involved small countries these cases may differ in important ways from any corresponding episode in the united states historically few other countries have had higher net foreign debttogdp ratio than the united states has at present however if ca deficits continue at current levels the us net foreign debt could eventually be the highest ever recorded this report also reviews studies on the ca deficits sustainability some of the studies suggest that large dollar depreciation could eventually be required to restore sustainability after an inflationadjusted 21 depreciation of the dollar from 20022007 the ca deficit was still higher in 2007 than in 2002

current account ca deficit the trade deficit plus net income payments and net unilateral transfers rose as share of gross domestic product gdp from 1991 to record high of 61 of gdp in 2005 and 2006 in 2007 it fell to 53 of gdp but remained well above the historical average see figure 1 it is projected to continue to fall modestly in 2008 it is too early to tell if the decline in the past two years is caused by temporary cyclical factors or is part of longerterm trend the ca has been in defici t every year but one since 1982 by accounting identity the ca deficit is equal to net inflows of foreign capital to the united states and reflects the imbalance between domestic saving and investment figur 1 curr ent account deficit as shar of gdp 19872007 7 65 4 321 01 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995

full employmentthe united states has run large ca deficits for several years yet unemployment has remained w in most of those years the ca deficit has both positive and negative effects on the economy production of exports and importcompeting goods is arguably lower than it would be in the absence of ca deficit but interest rates are also lower than they would be in the absence of foreign capital inflows as result interestsensitive spending on capital investment residential investment and consumer durables eg automobiles and appliances is higher 1 those expressing concern about the ca deficit typically define unsustainability to mean that the united states would have difficulty financing the ca deficit at some point in the near future and the resulting adjustment process would harm the us economy basically the ca deficit is sustainable as long as foreigners are willing to continue buying american assets it is not enough for foreigners to reduce their demand for us assets since this would cause yields on us assets to automatically rise until the market once again cleared but if the desirability of us assets were to change rapidly due to loss in confid ence in the us economy for

at minimum foreigners would require significantly higher interest rates than they do at present for inflows to continue for the us to literally be unable to continue financing its current account deficit foreign demand would have to fall so much that asset yields could not rise enough for foreigners to be willing to hold us assets again2 but what would make foreign investors change their minds about us assets federal reserve chairman ben bernanke has argued that foreigners will continue to increase their holdings of us assets in the near term because of global savings glut that leaves them with few other desirable investment alternatives3 if both lender and borrower are rational many economists believe that the ca deficit can be mutually benefi cialit allows the lender to enjoy higher rate of return than could be enjoyed at home and allows the borrower to operate with larger capital stock than could be financed from domestic saving as long as those investments yield high enough rate of return to service the debt borrowing should not reduce future domestic income in absolute terms some economists however doubt this interpretation and are concerned that the large ca deficit 4 is symptomatic of wider economic imbalance5 they argue that country cannot persistently rely on foreign borrowing to finance its investment needs so the united states must eventually raise its low saving rate they maintain that by financing large budget deficit and housing boom until 2006 much of the foreign borrowing is being used in ways that do not expand the economys productive capacity and therefore such borrowing does not enhance our ability to service foreign debt because foreign borrowing is not sustainable they argue americans will eventually be forced to significantly increase their saving equivalently to reduce their consumption and reduce their investment rates and the us economy will slow as longterm solution these economists prescribe policy measures to raise saving and reduce overall spending as the appropriate response to an excessively large ca deficit this could be done through microeconomic policies such as policies to encourage higher private saving and macroeconomic policies such as tightening of monetary and fiscal policy although this response would risk inducing the same recession that they fear the ca deficit may eventually cause particularly if the economy were weak already the steady financing of the ca deficit has depended heavily on official capital inflows purchases of us assets by foreign central bankssince 2002 6 official capital inflows have averaged more than 300 billion per year from 2002 to 2007 had these central banks decided not to increase their dollardenominated foreign reserves the ca deficit and the value of the dollar might have fallen precipitously although the dollar did not experience sizable overall decline during this period it did fall significantly against certain currencies without disruption to the us 2 it is widely assumed that rapid change in the current account would be caused by changes in financial markets not goods markets although theoretically rapid decline in imports could also cause the ca deficit to shrink little empirical evidence exists that broad trade patterns change that quickly 3 ben bernanke the global saving glut and the us current account deficit the sandridge lecture

inflows could prove unreliable or provide foreign governments with leverage that would undermine us policy aims because official inflows are likely financed by considerations other than rate of return it is difficult to predict how they will evolve in the future but given the importance of the united states as foreign export market deliberately taking step that could potentially precipitate us economic crisis could be against foreign countrys economic selfinterest as consequence of large ca deficits growin g share of the us capital stock is owned by foreigners and rising fraction of us income will need to be diverted overseas in the form of interest and dividends to foreigners the process cannot continue indefinitely or else foreigners would eventually hold larger share of american assets in their portfolios than they desire but though economists may feel confident that the ca deficit will decline in the long run long run predictions do not offer much help in predicting shortterm trends foreigners may wish to increase their holdings of american assets in whic h case the ca deficit would persist in the near term one common assumption is that the ca deficit would at most continue until the share of american assets held in foreign portfolios equaled americas share of world output by this measure foreigners still hold too few american assets for example citizens of the euro area hold an estimated 53 of their wealth in euro denominated assets and 19 in us dollar denominated assets whereas the japanese hold an estimated 63 of their wealth in yendenominated assets and 4 in dollardenominated assets 7 this is referred to as home bias in saving because all countries hold more of their own assets and fewer foreign assets than optimal portfolio diversification would suggest this bias is considered unlikely to disappear entirely in which case ca deficits will ease before this benchmark is met in any case the reason why home bias would decline for foreigners but not americ ans as continuing ca deficits would imply remains unclear on the other hand if the us economy grows faster than the rest of the world in the future then small ca deficits would be needed for foreigners to maintain us asset holdings equal to the us share of world gdp8 one reason that us imports cannot exceed exports indefinitely and the dollar could eventually fall is that todays ca deficits have consequence for future trade balances the accumulation of net debt that americans owe to foreigners will need to be serviced in the future and debt service will take the form of capital outflow from the united states to offset the outflow the united states must export more or borrow more but all else equal foreigners will only be induced to buy more exports if the dollar depreciates 9 net investment income payments make up small fraction of the ca deficit today but economist edwin truman estimates that if ca deficits continued to equal 6 of gdp net income payments would eventually reach 45 of gdp leaving trade deficit of only 15 of gdp 10 in other words constant trade deficit would imply growing ca deficit because of growing net investment income payments 7 olivier blanchard francesco giavazzi filipa sa the us current account and the dollar massachusetts institute of technology working paper 0502 may 2005 8 engel and rogers argue that the ca deficit can be fully explained by investors anticipation that the us share of industrialized countries output will rise in the future their model omits developing countries however which have played large role in world ca deficits and growth recently charles engel and john rogers the us current account deficit and the expected share of world output national bureau of economic research working paper 11921 january 2006 9 another possibility for how the ca deficit could improve would be if the us terms of trade improved in the future there is consensus on any policy tools that can directly improve the terms of trade 10

received net investment income of 89 billion from the rest of the world what is surprising about these data is that the united states still consistently has positive net investment income despite its large net debt and shows longterm downward trend as the foreign bt grows that is because us holdings of foreign assets have earned higher rate of return than us debt owed to foreigners between 2002 and 2004 the united states earned an estimated rate of return of 96 on its foreign assets and paid rate of return of 09 on its foreign liabilities 11 these estimated rates of return have prevented foreign borrowing from becoming burdensome and suggest that the us net foreign debt could become significantly larger befo re debt payments would become burdensome kouparitsas estimates that if these rateofreturn differentials were to continue the united states could maintain current account deficit of 0913 of gdp indefinitely without any increase in its net foreign debt12 however this favorable rateofreturn differential may not continue in the future if foreigners believe that the dollar will depreciate and demand higher rate of return on us borrowing as compensation if us interest rates rose the debt could become burdensome quickly g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g143g561g138g561g6g142g140g149g146g151g146g151g144g561g561

not be sudden it should be emphasized that economic theory suggests that slow decline in the ca deficit and dollar would not be troublesome for the overall economy in fact slow decline could have an expansionary effect on the economy because the increase in net exports could have more stimulative effect on aggregate demand in the short run than the decrease in investment and other interestsensitive spending caused by lower capital inflows more realistically the trade deficit would not decline exogenously but in response to slowing of overall domestic demand therefore falling trade deficit may tend to coincide with slower economic growth in practice but that does not indicate that falling trade deficit has caused growth to slow historical experience seems to support the idea that slow decline in the trade deficit need not be harmful to the economythe dollar declined by about 40 in real terms and the ca deficit declined continually in the late 1980s from 28 of gdp in 1986 to nearly zero during the early 1990s yet economic growth was strong throughout the late 1980s of course the adjustment required to balance the current account today is about twice as large so historical experience may not be good guide beginning in 2007 the ca deficit began gradual and modest decline after long and gradual decline in the dollar potentially serious shortterm problem would emerge if foreigners suddenly decided to reduce the fraction of their saving that goes to the united states in the form of capital inflow or if they 11 philip lane and gian milesiferetti global

assets the initial effect could be sudden and large depreciation in the value of the dollar as the supply of dollars on the foreign exchange market increased and sudden and large increase in us interest rates as an important funding source for investment and the budget defi cit was withdrawn from the financial markets most likely the direct trade effects of these shifts in lending patterns by foreigners would not cause recession because the dollar depreciation would lead to trade surplus or smaller deficit which expands aggregate demand 13 empirical evidence suggests that the full effects of change in the exchange rate on traded goods takes time so the dollar may have to overshoot its eventual depreciation level in order to achieve significant adjustment in trade flows in the short run however the indirect interest rate effects which typically only partially offset the direct effects could cause recession if the change is sudden large increases in interest rates could cause problems for the us economy as these increases reduce the market value of debt securities cause prices on the stock market to fall and jeopardize the solvency of various debtors and creditors resources may not be able to shift quickly enough from interestsensitive sectors to export sectors to make this transition fluid 14 the federal reserve could mitigate the interest rate spike by reducing shortterm interest rates although this reduction would influence longterm rates only indirectly and could increase inflation is scenario where the dollar crashes likely one economic theory typically assumes that financial market participants act rationally if the rationality assumption is good one then the potential for sudden decline is slim after all foreigners would be demanding high rates of return to buy us assets today if they could foresee that the foreign currency value of these assets is likely to fall sharply in the near future ho wever sudden decline in capital inflows would be unlikely to occur in purely rational context in which case theory would have little predictive power given the traditional role the united states has played as an investment safe haven sudden capital outflows seem unlikely investment ght be attracted to us assets in liquidity crisis because the us offers more liquid financial markets eg us treasury bond markets than do most foreign counterparts us financial markets experienced exceptiona l turmoil beginning in august 2007 over the following year the dollar declined by almost 8 in inflationadjusted termsa decline that was not in itself disruptive but as the turmoil deepened and spread to the rest of the world the value of the dollar began rising interest rates on us treasuries fell close to zero implying excessive investor demand other interest rates also remained low although access to credit was limited for some although comprehensive data will not be available for some time sudden stop in capital inflows does not appear to have been feature of the downturn problems recently experienced in us financial markets have been widely viewed as once in lifetime events if these events failed to cause sudden flight from us assets and an unwinding of the ca deficit it is hard to imagine what would 13 sharp decline in the value of the dollar would also reduce living standards all else equal because it would raise the price of imports to households this effect which is referred to as decline in the terms of trade would not be recorded directly in gdp however 14 for more formal explanation see j bradford delong some simple analytics for hard landing working paper university of california at berkeley april 2005 interestingly one study found that countries with larger declines in the ca deficit experienced on

much larger than those of other countries as result an economic occurrence in the united states has ramifications for the world economy that could have feedback effects for the us economy whereas changes in the ca balance of most small countries will most likely not affect the world economy it also means that the amount of borrowing required to finance the us ca deficit is much larger share of world saving another difference is the role that the dollar plays as the worlds reserve currency because the dollar is the worlds preferred currency for store of value medium of exchange and unit of account holders may be less willing to abandon it than they would any other cu rrency if so the united states may be able to run higher sustainable ca deficits than other countries in the developing world large ca deficit has often been leading indicator of financial and currency crisis this was the case in many recent crises including mexico east asia turkey brazil and argentina the applicability of these experiences to the united states may be limited however because of three key differences between the united states and these countries first the united states has flexible exchange rate regime countries with fixed exchange rates can be forced into crisis when their foreign exchange reserves are exhausted by speculators betting against the currency similar bets are harder to ma ke against flexible exchange rates second the united states has traditionally been seen as safe haven for investment third unlike developing countries the united states is able to borrow in its own currency so that depreciation reduces rather than increases the burden of servicing its debt 15 therefore historical comparisons have tended to focus on the experience of other industrialized countries economist sebastian edwards found that since 1970 only two other industrialized countries ireland and new zealand had high ca deficits th at were longlasting seven and five years respectively he found that large countries that experienced sharp declines in their ca also saw per capita gdp growth decline by 36 to 5016 economists at goldman sachs financial firm analyzed all episodes in industrialized countries since 1980 where the ca improved by more th an 2 of gdp it found 31 cases where the adjustment occurred under circumstances of economic disruption and 13 where there was comparable disruption in the disruption episodes the economy typically started from position of overheating and the output gap the difference between actual and potential output worsened by an average of 36 of gdp whereas in the benign episodes the economy started from position of excess capacity and the output gap improved by 19 the fact that the economy was initially overheating in the disruption episodes suggests that causality may run in the opposite directionthe ca shift may be symptom rather than cause of economic slowdown in the disruption cases there was little real exchange rate depreciation in the benign cases it averaged 51 in most cases the adjustment took several years in all cases consumption growth was negative on average and surprisingly interest rates on average fell in only two cases portugal in the early 1980s and finland in the early 1990s was the ca decline associated with severe 15 in dollar terms depreciation would not affect the valu of dollardenominated liabilities however in foreign currency terms or in terms of the purchasing power that it conveys to foreign lenders depreciation reduces the value of us liabilities 16 sebastian

attributed to the collapse of the soviet union among other factors some of these cases may not be applicable to the us experience however because the sample includes countries that had small ca deficit or ca surplus only eight of these episodes involved larger ca deficit as share of gdp than the us deficit today and all eight episodes involved small countries17 the international monetary fund conducted similar study18 it found 42 cases where an advanced economy had an initial ca deficit of at least 25 of gdp and the ca deficit subsequently declined by at least 50 it found on average that the real exchange rate declined by cumulative 122 causing shift in the ca of 57 of gdp over the next 46 years moving the ca from deficit to surplus on average gdp growth fell by an annual average of 14 during the reversal causing the output gap to deteriorate by an average of 3 of gdp from peak to trough of the business cycle in 11 of these cases the slowdown in economic growth was large but unlike the united states 9 of these 11 did not have floating exchange rate in 10 other cases there was slowdown in growth following the ca reversal however not all cases of large ca deficits end in reversal besides the united states the imf identified five other advanced economies that have had large ca deficits that have persisted to date australia which has run ca deficit of more than 2 since 1980 greece since 1996 new zealand 1989 portugal 1996 and spain 1999 all except australia have had ca deficits that were considerably larger than the us in recent years in similar study economists debelle and galati found little evidence that ca adjustments historically lead to significant disruption in financial markets they found little change in the composition of capital flows before adjustment which they argue is evidence that current account adjustment is caused by rather than the cause of broader macroeconomic imbalances 19 economists hung and kim use statistical regressions to estimate the probability of an exchange rate crash based on several macroeconomic variables across many industrialized countries over time and estimate that the united states had 9 probability of dollar crash in 2006 they find that the current account balance and the regression overall has relatively little predictive power for currency crash20 the size of the ca deficit in any given year may be less important in determining sustainability than how persistent ca deficits increase countrys net foreign debt over time economists maurice obstfeld and kenneth rogoff found that in 2003 the net debt owed to foreigners was about 23 of gdp for the united states near an ltime high were ca deficits to continue at more than 5 of gdp per year us net debt to foreigners would reach 70 of gdp within

many countries that have experienced ca reversals in the postwar period had smaller net foreign debttogdp ratios between 20 and 80 of gdp obstfeld and rogoff identify only one country ireland with net foreign debttogdp ratio that has exceeded 80 thus the authors conclude that large us ca deficits cannot be sustained indefinitely21

estimate changes in the dollar and ca are not em pirically derived they are simulations based on theoretical assumptions meant to be consistent with reality 22 obstfeld and rogoff have estimated how much the dollar would need to depreciate in order to make the ca deficit disappear23 in their model shocks to aggregate demand or shifts in the demand or supply of tradeable goods could cause the ca deficit to decline their model does not allow for exogenous changes in the demand for us assets to affect the ca deficit they estimate that the real exchange rate would depreciate between 147 and 336 if ca deficit equal to 5 of gdp were eliminated by change in aggregate demand and between 98 and 255 if eliminated by change in the supply of tradeable goods they estimate that depreciation would be accompanied by 39 to 71 decline in the terms of trade the predicted dollar depreciation is so large because about threequarters of us output is nontradeable production cannot be quickly shifted into tradeable goods to take advantage of the depreciation and import and export prices change much more slowly than the exchange rate this model does not predict how much larger the ca deficit could get or how quickly it will eventually fall 24 economists blanchard giavazzi and sa explicitly allow asset demand to influence the exchange rate and they assume that assets from different countries are not perfect substitutes in their model ca deficit would eventually decline because demand for us assets is finite although an increase in the demand for us assets would initially cause the dollar to appreciate they argue it would later depreciate to finance debt service though it would remain above its pre appreciation value they estimate that 15 decline in the dollar would be associated with 21

decline in the ca deficit results from us debt being denominated in us dollars because depreciation reduces its value blanchard et estimate that stabilizing the netdebttogdp ratio at 2003 levels would require the dollar to immediately depreciate by 56 and the ca deficit to decline to 075 of gdp however assuming foreigners desire to maintain holdings of us assets at their current share their model predicts that the depreciation would be stretched over few decades depreciating by 27 year at most if foreigners decided to reduce their holding of us assets the model predicts larger but still gradual depreciation 25 edwards uses similar model to simulate how much the dollar would depreciate from its 2004 level depending on different assumptions about the foreign demand for us assets unlike blanchard et he projects fairly rapid declines in the ca deficit and dollar in the future under his optimistic scenario in which he assumes that the us net debt will rise to 60 of gdp by 2010 and then remain constant the ca deficit would peak at 73 of gdp in four years before eventually declining to 32 of gdp with most of the decline occurring in the first four years after the peak the real value of the dollar would appreciate while the deficit was increasing but it would decline 21 in the first three years after the deficit began falling if net debt were to decline to 50 of gdp after 2010 instead of remaining at 60 of gdp which would still be about double its current level the decline in the ca deficit and dollar would be greater edwards calculates that the deficit would fall by 53 of gdp and the dollar would depreciate by 28 after three years which would bring both measur close to their longterm projected levels 26 economists roubini and setser simulate what would happen to the net foreign debt over the next 10 years under three scenarios27 in the first scenario imports and exports continue to grow at historical rates the ca deficit would exceed 128 of gdp and the net foreign debt would exceed 80 of gdp by 2012 in this scenario the authors do not believe it is plausible to assume that foreigners would be willing to finance borrowing of this magnitude and use this scenario to argue that the current path is unsustainable in the second scenario the trade deficit stabilizes at 5 of gdp the ca deficit would still increase to 88 of gdp in 2012 because of higher net investment income payments at which point the net foreign debt would exceed 70 of gdp servicing debt of this size they estimate would cost 3 of gdp in 2012 to reduce the trade deficit to 5 of gdp they estimate that the dollar would need to depreciate by about 10 from its 2004 level this scenario and the first scenario is not sustainable in the long run because the net foreign debt would grow continuously in the third scenario the trade deficit declines by the end of the projection to the point where the net foreign debt stabilizes as share of gdp they estimate that the net foreign debt would stabilize with trade deficit of 08 and ca deficit of 13 of gdp if the ca deficit gradually declined to this level in 2012 the net foreign debt would stabilize at nearly 60 of gdp which would cost an estimated 175 of gdp to service in 2012 to achieve reduction in the ca deficit of this magnitude they estimate that the dollar would need to depreciate substantially and the federal budget would need to be balanced all of these scenarios assume that relative interest rates remain similar to past values as the net foreign debt 25 olivier blanchard francesco giavazzi filipa sa the us

would feed through to much larger ca deficit and debt path than simulated economist paul krugman estimates that the dollar would need to depreciate by at least 35 from its 2005 value in real terms in the long run for the trade deficit to be reduced to zero28 he looks for evidence of whether this depreciation will happen gradually or abruptly for the depreciation to be smooth krugman argues that it must be anticipated by rational investors in which case they would currently require rate of return premium to hold us assets to offset the loss suffered from the future dollar depreciation to determin how large the premium would have to be he considers two hypothetical paths for the dollar in one path the dollar declines by 175 annually and net foreign debt peaks at 118 of gdp or at least onethird of the total us capital stock if foreigners are unwilling to hold that much us debt the dollar would have to depreciate more rapidly in the other path the dollar declines by 35 annually and net foreign debt peaks at 58 of gdp yet he finds evidence of rate of return premium anywhere near the magnitude of either 175 or 35after adjusting for inflati on us interest rates are very close to foreign rates this implies that foreigners do not foresee any significant dollar depreciation in the future therefore he argues that when investors eventually realize how much the dollar will depreciate they will likely sharply reduce their demand for us assets causing the dollar to plummet recent experience suggests that the dollar depreciation required to put the ca deficit on sustainable path may indeed be large from 2002 to 2006 the dollar depreciated by 16 in inflationadjusted terms despite the depreciation the ca deficit continued to rise both in dollar terms and as share of gdp from 45 of gdp in 2002 to 61 of gdp in 2006 in response to the weaker dollar exports rose rapidly from 2004 onward but this did not lead to lower current account deficit because imports also continued to rise rapidly this experience points to the fact that external factors which can be held constant in the models discussed in this section also influence the ca and the dollar in reality in 2007 the dollar continued to depreciate and the ca deficit fell to 53 the wide dispersion of estimates on the dollar depreciation associated with decline in the ca deficit points to the complex and imperfectly understood factors that determine the dollars value the lack of consensus exchange rate model that performs well empirically and the sensitivity of theoretical models to changes in uncertain empirical parameters further complicating model based projections the path of ca adjustment is also subject to nonmarket forces such as the accumulation of foreign reserves by central banks so far the dollar and ca deficit has not closely matched many of the models predictions since the predictions were made furthermore model reliably answers the underlying question of how much and how quickly the ca deficit will potentially decline g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 in the long run running ca deficit at current trend levels ie growing faster than gdp would result in net foreign debt continually growing relative to gdp this is unsustainable if foreigners have limited appetite for us assets thus in the long r the ca deficit will most likely decline although it need not decline to zero to stabilize the net foreign debt relative to gdp relative to gdp the ca deficit declined in 2007 and is projected to continue to decline in 2008 28 paul krugman

temporary cyclical factors or represents the beginning of longterm adjustment process to date the net foreign debt has placed burden on the us economy because usowned foreign assets have earned more than foreignowned us assets whether policymakers should be concerned about future decline in the ca deficit depends on whether the decline were to happen in an orderly or disruptive way there is little reason to think that gradual decline would have deleterious effect on the overall economy but sudden decline brought on by sudden reduction in foreign capital inflows could be disruptive to us financial markets causing negative spillover effects for the broader economy while sudden reduction in foreign capital inflows cannot be ruled outit has happened to foreign countriesit seems highly unlikely the united states is different in number of ways from the countries that have experienced ca crisesit is much larger its financial markets and economy are highly developed it has floating exchange rate and it is seen as safe haven in times of financial turmoil nonetheless even if the risk of sudden ca reversal is small it is arguably worth policy consideration since it could be highly costly to the us economy the recent financial crisis in the united states bears resemblance to the sort of scenario envisioned by economists concerned about sudden destabilizing outflow of capital yet when the crisis worsened in september 2008 the dollar began appreciating and heightened demand for certain us assets such as us treasuries drove their prices up to unusually high levels
