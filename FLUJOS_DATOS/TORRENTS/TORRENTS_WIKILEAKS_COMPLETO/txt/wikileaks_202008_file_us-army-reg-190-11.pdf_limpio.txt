security equipment management policy is established in ar 19013 chapter 4 security criteria will be included in initial plans for research and development as well as all new or modified construction projects b to minimize the cost of ps inventory control and to reduce theft vulnerability the quantities of aae and the number of storage facilities for aae should be reduced storage should be consolidated to the maximum extent consistent with operational safety and training requirements 1 the aae should be removed from designated storage areas as briefly as possible the quantity to be removed should be as small as possible to support specific missions or projects storage areas should be as small as possible and be consistent with safety standards security and mission requirements 2 further reduction of costs for protection and inventory control can be effected by grouping the consolidation of aae into smaller storage areas by assigned risk category and providing the degree of ps protection needed for that category priority attention will be given to demilitarization or disposal of obsolete and unserviceable aae to avoid unnecessary storage security and inventoryrelated costs 3 the provisions of this regulation are intended to provide adequate storage security for aae at most da activities there may be few unusual activities such as large depots or remote storage areas without existing electrical service where not all criteria in this regulation can be directly applied in costeffective manner at these unusual or unique facilities local conditions must be carefully evaluated and the security system must be tailored to the local conditions 22 construction of facilities t h p r v i s i n s f t h i s r g u l t i n r m n d t r f r c n s t r u c t i n f n w p r m n n

the tearing down and rebuilding of facilities will not be undertaken unless the concerned command and imcom has determined that existing security measures cannot be supplemented to provide the required degree of protection when nonstandard structures or facilities provide equivalent or better protection modifications will not be undertaken exceptions to this policy will be granted under paragraph 24 c upgrading of existing storage structures must be consistent with approved plans for future development and new construction plans the type planned use modification costs and remaining economic life of storage structures must be considered additionally in determining upgrade requirements ammunition and explosives will be consolidated by risk category to the maximum extent consistent with operational safety and training requirements compensatory security measures will be established for aae storage structures that do not meet minimum construction standards definitive drawings and specifications for new construction upgrade or modification of aae storage structures will be coordinated with the engineer office safety office and lea pm des or security police office to ensure safety and ps requirements are met d qualified engineer personnel will verify the structure composition of aae storage facilities for example walls ceilings roofs floors and doors statements will be prepared on da form 4604 security construction statement statements will indicate the highest construction category met for storage of aae for example category i ii iii or iv aae items and date of applicable regulation see 24 for procedures when structural deficiencies exist the da form 4604 will be affixed to the interior wall of each aae storage facility blanket statement on da form 4604 may be issued at an installation for all facilities such as ammunition magazines constructed according to the same specifications under these circumstances copy of the da form 4604 need not be affixed to the interior wall of each individual storage structure but must specifically identify the facilities by number and location and be readily available for inspection security construction statements will be reviewed during ps surveys and inspections the statements will be revalidated by engineer personnel every 5 years physical security personnel will monitor construction of new facilities and renovation of existing facilities engineer personnel will coordinate new construction and renovation projects with the local pm or security officer in addition to meeting construction standards storage of aae will meet ps criteria such as intrusion detection system ids locks and hasps lighting and security patrols as necessary for the particular category of aae involved 4 ar 19011 15 november 200623 intrusion detection system priority lists priority of installation of the ids is as follows 1 facilities storing category i items when protection is inadequate those having the largest quantity will receive initial attention 2 facilities storing category ii items 3 facilities storing category iii items 4 facilities storing category iv items b deviations from these priorities will be permitted only when imcom has determined that local threat dictates these deviations 24 security criteria deviation program purpose the purpose of the aae security criteria deviation program is to 1 ensure that prescribed security requirements are properly observed and implemented at all aae facilities 2 provide management tool to monitor corrective actions 3 ensure that deviations from established security requirements are systematically and uniformly identified and approved at the proper level of command waivers and exceptions are deviations from specific security requirements prescribed in this regulation b waivers waiver may be approved for temporary relief from specific requirement prescribed in this regulation pending actions to conform to the requirement 1 waiver may be approved for period not to exceed 12 months and extended only after review of the circumstances that necessitate the extension 2 compensatory security measures are required in the interim compensatory security measures approved by the aae facility commanderdirector will remain in effect pending formal review and final approval by the approving authority 3 deficiencies correctable within 60 days do not require waiver however ensure compensatory security measures are taken during the interval in such cases the compensatory measure must be in writing approved by the aae facility commanderdirector and the next higher commander in the chain of command c exception an exception may be approved for permanent relief from specific requirement prescribed in this regulation 1 approve exceptions only when correction of the deviation is adjudged to be not feasible or costeffective and only after most careful and critical evaluation of the facts in the case 2 notify the approving authority through command channels when the exception is longer needed 3 review all exceptions during ps inspections or when major change in site configuration or mission offers the opportunity for corrective action to terminate the exception 4 the aae facility commanderdirector to whom the exception was granted will conduct the review forward all reviews through command channels to the approving authority granting the exception 5 compensatory security measures are required in the interim compensatory security measures approved by the aae facility commanderdirector will remain in effect pending formal review and final approval by the approving authority d exceptions and waivers exceptions and waivers will not be used to reduce or eliminate minimum security requirements in this regulation evaluate each waiver or exception on casebycase basis compensatory measures 1 institute compensatory measures for each deficiency 2 one compensatory measure may suffice for more than 1 deficiency 3 security measures will compensate for the specific vulnerability created by deficiency when minimum security requirement in this regulation cannot be met security requirement directed by this regulation cannot serve as compensatory measure for deficiency 4 compensatory measures may include additional security forces procedures andor ps devices such as additional locks alarms lighting and delay devices design the criteria for accepting compensatory measures to specifically enhance the security posture in light of the deficient situation 5 compensatory measures that consist primarily of instructions to the security force to increase their alertness do not provide comparable level of security 6 the aae sites lacking an installed ids will conduct thorough assessment to determine compensatory measures most reasonable to ensure nearreal time assessment of an attempted facility intrusion the assessment will include full explanation of the factors considered in formulating the compensatory measures f arms ammunition and explosives security considerations 1 the aae facility commanderdirector will ensure that prescribed compensatory measures are implemented as required 2 security forces will be advised of all standing deviations and compensatory measures in assigned duty areas 5 ar 19011 15 november 20063 prescribed compensatory measures for individual deficiencies must not when considered in total unrealistically task the security forces g approval procedures requests for waivers and exceptions are initiated by the aae facility commanderdirector and forwarded through appropriate command channels to hqda pmg dapmops 2800 army pentagon wash ington dc 203102800 h waiver and exception requests all waiver and exception requests will include the following 1 subject of request an example includes request for waiver at dugway proving grounds intrusion detection system 2 reasons for request state the problems andor deficiencies that constitute

of this regulation for waivers show what actions have been taken planned or scheduled to correct the deficiencies 4 detailed information provide detailed information on current compensatory measures 5 list of all waivers and exceptions currently in effect for the site explain why these deviations collectively will not establish an overall site vulnerability greater than the stated compensatory measures 6 coordination show coordinated efforts with the affected staff agencies pmsecurity officer supporting judge advocate of the installation or activity and supporting engineers 7 commanders evaluation of the requests commanders in the chain of command will review and endorse each waiver or exception request the imcom region commanders may delegate the review and endorsement to civilian division chief assigned to that headquarters and responsible for ps matters in the region the commanding general imcom may delegate the review and endorsement to civilian division chief assigned to that headquarters and responsible for ps matters the acom ascc and dru commanders may delegate this authority to division chief within the organization in the grade of colonel or the civilian equivalent each chain of commands endorsement will include comments assessing the adequacy of compensatory measures taking into consideration the required criteria for waivers and exceptions i exceptions previously granted exceptions previously granted under the criteria of the previous ar 19011 remain valid under the provisions of this regulation such exceptions need not be resubmitted for approval however such exceptions will be reviewed as indicated above 25 security of arms ammunition and explosives during training and aboard ships all aae deployed in the field for training or
