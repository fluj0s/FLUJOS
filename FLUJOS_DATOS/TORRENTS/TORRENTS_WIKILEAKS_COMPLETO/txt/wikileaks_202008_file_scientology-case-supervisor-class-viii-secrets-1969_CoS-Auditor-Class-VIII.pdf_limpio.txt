an introduction to standard tech lecture given on 24 september 1968 thank you very much thank you i wish to announce the opening of the class vi ii course now youre the lucky ones actually and im very happy to see you well turned out im sorry the stage isnt high enough bit higher so that i could see all of your faces i like to look through an audience and see the misunderstoods this is very this is very stellar day actually in scientology and all of these years have piled up and have made the thing called standard tech now to celebrate this we have certain congratulations here here is one from the all the staff at ww ron class viii students dear ron sir our congratulations and best wishes for the universes first class viii course your gift of tech and now most wonderful of all standard tech cannot be measured in terms of mans freedom and sanity the students you are training will bring back priceless commodity our thanks to all who made it possib and to the students but most of all thank you ron from roger and all staff of your office of lrh ww and this next one heres our very best wishes and congratulations on the first level viii course youve done it again much love from lrh comm london executive council london and all staff from london our love good wishes and abundances of class viii auditors for the world the commanding officer of the pubs org and all staff and heres one from relayed from cape town dear ron congratulations on first class viii course all the best love c cape town and lrh comm cape town now what is class viii why class viii well i wish to welcome you all here to series of revelations series of very very interesting revelations known as standard tech you are about to get wins and about to guide through wins that you have never heard of before technology was actually not summ ated until 1966 individuals follow what is called the hidden data line mostly um didnt get laugh you dont even know what it is but student on the saint sill briefing course is given all the research materials now of eighteen years so that hell have good background and good rounding out on which he can operate and then he goes into power and his lessons in simp licity begin to occur only an expert can be simp oneace trained individual uh ah ah where wheres the tone arm much less wheres the pc i i it looks awfully blank and uh i think that blankness and see i think blankness i dont remember calling anything id better develop some techn ology lets see ive got new process now whos blank yeah that ought to crack his case yeah whos blank they dont even know theres any technology there boy in other words it takes total expert to be totally simple and you just gonna be surprised studying this class viii course to find out how totally expert you have to be to be totally simple it is fantastic revolution its revolution its revelation and then theres this other thing called hidden data line this thing called hidden data line is one of the most fascinating things i ever heard of now captain joe von stodden captain of the flag ship has given some thought to this as an old old old time auditor as well as very good captain he sort of racked this around for while and he finally found out how hidden data line occurs or how hidden command line occurs and ill just read his dispatch in full here as i received it this morning its very very good regarding the subject of hidden data line i have observed the basis of the hidden data line and it is simply this the hidden command line this is the only way command intentions can get alterised apart from outright nonco mpliance which i feel if looked at closely is also due to hidden command line for example level 3 auditor does green form without an emeter level 6 asks him what the hell are you doing and the level 3 auditor says i have just come back from the ao and they do it like that and the level 3 auditor gives big explanation of why it goes that way and the level 6 auditor pursues the issue and finds other auditors from ao doing green form this way and therefore it must be ok so the level 6 auditor starts doing green form in this way this is an extreme example but the point is the level 6 started backing off when the ao was m entioned the higher up the command line the level 6 wouldnt have just taken it from the level 3 but the 3 being just having just had close contact with body higher on command line than the 6 starts off the level 6s doubt and the higher on command line the power is drawn from the wider area the alteris covers like it seems someone figured this out and just put god there you know somebody just heard from god so thats the right thing to do religion is pretty good example of hidden command line there is policy on if its not written its not true and the only standard tech is found in hcobs tapes and books yet tech gets alterised in orgs and the form of the org is difficult at times to keep i conclu from this that command lines are misused and not understood always the class viii course is handling the tech line and i really feel will get the data line in from source and kept in by sea org class viiis doing patrol of tech to handle the design wont it be good idea to run the org exec course base d on some principles the same principles as the class viii auditors course here to put in the comm and lines with thud then we will be able to turn out cracker jack auditors and cracker jack to back them up would be great help so it undoubtedly occurs organizationally as well as technically and those are very very important consi derations the laws of listing they were all on tape they were in bulletins and somebody has removed both tapes and bulletins from the training line of the class vi course now do you realize that the morale of an organization is proportional to the accuracy of the technology if they havent the accurate technology that works works works i will tell you what their morale goes to pieces b ecause they havent got anything left to work for now i dont mean to appear violent but when you have talked your lungs out hour after hour day after day to drive one point home and it doesnt drive and it evaporates it demonstrates that the subject can be wrecked by deleting from the subject line piece of key data as well as somebody who just came in saying the advanced thats the way theyre doing it at the advanced they run the pc standing on his head and the emeter plugged into the light socketdo you realize that scientology very remarkably well stays together in spite of the absence of standard tech its remarkable its the only hope mans got but when its done wrongly when that is done wrong man is being betrayed and hes being very very badly betrayed now there isnt in actual fact much of trick to auditing there isnt much of trick im not saying how bad it all is every place im just saying my gods if it hangs together on the crappy jobs of godjustauditing you see around what would it do if it went up to 100 and guess what its running on this ship right now at one zero zero per cent three provisional class viiis some of them are little resistive some of them more resistive than others but theyre all the same case and theyre just rolling along and the morale went up and everything went up and bongety bongety bongety bong but if tech was even slightly out on the flagship what do you think it is in the outer orgs pretty grim pretty grim now i dont want to give you the idea that im angry at anybody im not im not even arc broken about having talked so long and often on certain points and find them violated in fact im very calm about the whole thing and it will be completely dispassi onately that we hang from the yard arm any auditor who does other than standard tech well pat him on the back as we send him into the sky cause everything were fighting for is attainable on standard technical basis which doesnt alter hair line there is not one case in this whole stinking mest universe who is one millionth of millimeter sideways from standard tech and thats the first thing you have to know about standard tech there are variable cases none but let show you what people think is variable case pc comes into session his ta is high and the auditors trying to run the right thing theyve been trying to run some things on him lately and the ta is high and they havent gone anyplace and so they try to dream up something like what principles of psychoanalysis would apply to your case you know they go rushing in to the case supervisor or the d of t and say i cant get him on there uhuhuh hes still ahahah god damn him here get process your class supervisor goes through and he thinks of something and gives it to this fellow doesnt even look at the folder and the guy goes tearing back to session and runs some bunk and the ta goes little bit higher now this is actually this is actual fact i get hold of such folder and this case is so so standard it is pathetic except for the last three months anybody who did gf or rudiments on him got an r s on missed withholds as connected to suppressiv person laughing they r s they dont read they r s and auditor has resorted it to ethics has done anything about it has tried to pull the missed withhold or anything so of course we have very pecul iar case so case that isnt run by standard tech becomes very pecu liar case and thats just about the first law of standard tech all pecul iar cases were cases that werent run by standard tech and guess what still can be so that doesnt make pecu liar cases at all now the degree of precision which i have talked about on the saint hill course is so many miles wide of what we now call standard tech as to be completely fantastic therere literally miles of widths in 1965 which dont exist now the width of tolerance on standard tech probably couldnt be measured with an engineering micrometer it is absolutely exactly hair linenow what do you have to do what do you have to be in order to run tech that close you have to be the god damnedest most screaming expert youve ever heard of you have to know all of the width and body of the saint hill course the research line all the books because that enough was pathway that was roadway and then knowing all that you know the total boundaries you know the total boundaries the tech can reach now in through that data there is an absolutely hair line little tiny knife edge pass an d you have to know all of that to have grip on where the path is and exactl what you do honest to pete standard tech is so standard that its practically drop nickel in the auditor and he runs off the session but what does it take to make that kind of an auditor look at the grip hes got to have on it smokey joe sits down and he sits down in the auditing session and hes in really bad shap and he was audited out in keokuk and didnt do any good and his ta is at 9 and the needle is terribly stuck and what do we do we do ruds or green form to f n and next grade laughs and then theres this fellow comes in and hes been in new york and hes been down on harlex street in new york he says and hes member of the british government so hes pretty confused and most of their wives are in psych iatrists beds i mean care i didnt mean to malign them or anything anyway so he sits down and says his psychiatrist has just told him something or other and hes just had umpteen electric shocks and he actually has been boozlebozzle d and etcet era and hes been given an implant that scientology doesnt work and uh its its its all pretty pretty grim and what do you do with this guy what what do you do with this guy oh christ that is hell of god damned thing to figure out what will we do with this fellow oh dear lets run in to see the case supervisor without even showing him the folder and get the solution you know thats the way it is well in standard tech you dont even know whether or not hes resistive type case so you do the ruds or green form to f n and the next grade now youll have to be pretty pretty good you have to be pretty good because look at the bait thats thrown to you all the time now all you do is consi der these wildly different cases as just bait on hook trying to get you to bite everybody is so different and boy theyre just about as different as the sam spot of ink sitting on the same spot of ink now by george it is pretty pretty dog gone interesting the session control and the self control which an auditor requires to actually go down that highway all invitations refused yet arc isnt broken and so forth and yet he just runs him now there theres the way it is now if the case proves to be very resistive case and we dont seem to be able to do anything with him you will find out that we cant do anything with him only if he has already been subjected to the unusual so standard tech has to include cases which have been run very nonsta ndardly you know been audited in d c i wont malign d c all orgs are just as sour as all orgs and by the time this course is being taught they will all be snap ped up to battery again and they will be running fine i am embittered by the folder i just got in from that quarter thats all its pretty god damn grim the earliest folder the earliest session has about three page list in it as the first list made followed by second list which is about three page list and the first list hasnt been nulled and item was given the pc and the second one has several reading items on it what the hell were they trying to do but the last one the last auditing report is the real panic in that one folder it is real panic i mean its something to sit down and cry about or laugh uproariously about the ta is high so she was probably overrun on ot1 after doing two unnecessary s and ds which had each of them at least three items on the list reading ta was higher at the end of session see how the see how the rules are avoided now theres only one item reading on the list its just about the damnedest thing anybody ever heard of do you know do you know in actual sober sober sober sober fact that this can be interpreted that you have three items which read on the first nulling and then you nutted it again in such way to submerge two of them and leave only one reading and then that fulfills the requirement of one item reading on the list now whatever jackass figured that one out and whoever copied him ought to be sad because its comp letely bonkers its comp letely bonkers now thereve been people on the line who have put out rewritten bulletins and things like that and there is rewritten bulletin which shows just that happening but that is bonkers so we can assume that people who are bit inclined to malign knock apart and shoot the human race and have that as their only goal can get into scientology and can remove things from the technical line or pervert or alter things in the technical line which then makes scientology unworkable therefore we have entered in upon program and this program simply is that you called in from your various orgs are being taught rapidfire as hard and as clear and as b old as we can teach you standard tech the auditing of it and the case supervision of it and we will send you back as class vi ii provisionals do you know that absolutely standard tech comp lete proper hair line standard tech used in organizations throughout the world will at least triple the stats of each within 90 days couldnt help it and if it was really applied in business like fashion and nobody messed it up in any way shape or form one of our division 5 people said we might even be able to take the planet within year it is hot scientology is so much hotter than anybody thinks it is that it is fantastic you dont have to take my say so youll find it out as you go along the line youll find it out youre about to have as an auditor some very exciting adventures cases start falling apart in your hands without any unusual solutions at all its only when you goof it up that you have trouble now there are two actual sphe res of instruction in this one is auditing of it and two case supervision of it and the case supervision of auditors is more difficult subject because the auditors theyre not going to follow the case supervisors instruction i know on some folders in which we were teaching this i have seen one student auditor fail to follow for three consecut ive sessions the case supervisors instructions winding the case around seven assorted telegraph poles and driving the case supervisor straight up the wall so that the case supervisor then started to offer very unusual solutions trying to rescue this pc before it was too late and the pc came out right i think by just going back and doing the case supervisors instructions in the first placethere are various sins on this line but if you think the auditor has to have if you think the auditor has to have it grip on tech what does the case supervisor have to have hes the crystal ball boy hes got his job to pick em up after theyve fallen on their heads now of course all cases are case supervised there arent any cases that go through any there must not be any cases going through any there must not be any cases audited any place that are not case supervisedby class viii the next session may not be given until case supe rvision now the auditor if he is very well trained auditor can refuse to do the case supervisors instructions because its the auditor who is going to be hanged but he can only refuse to do them and not audit at all be may not ever vary or alter case supervisors instructions he opens up the folder and he sees case supervisors instructions and he himsel f perhaps trained to class viii disagrees with these comp letely now he must take it up with the case supervisor he has right not to audit them but he has right whatsoever to audit anything else you see how its sewn up you say yes but this pc could sit there for month without any auditing its god damn well better he did if therere two people who have entirely different opinions on what ought to be done with this case then either one or the other of those two different people do not know standard tech because if they knew standard tech they would not have any divergence of opinion now there are certain things that get wrong with cases there and so forth auditing him with dianetic audible commands dowt mmemblemm mmand wmm dsmtm thmmm wmmmbl mmmw m fwwm mm cmm amm jmmmm yea for chris sakes didnt you ever hear of telepathy we do it all telepathically jzzztl bump toot zee zzzzmm mmnl phew laughs and as far as 7 is concer ned and 8 all the materials of 7 and 8 are sitting there i havent written them up theres reason to write up 7 and 8 without standard tech in up to 6 and the other thing is im so far into 8 that 7 has gotten awfully dim im just being lazy and besides this people havent been nice to lately they havent been nice to they here and there here and there why there have been noncompliances with standard technology and although people say yes were doing just as you said and so forth the review folders dont follow so i i think i wont release 7 until auditing is standard through the world actually 7 is one of these little jolly old gocarts 3 goes zig and 7 goes zag and if guy cant audit at 7 he may as w ell quit and you can talk all you want to about uh the guys start getting into trouble do you understand they start getting into plenty plenty plenty of trouble if they cant audit well at 3 well if they cant audit well at 3 boy theyre going to go down for the third count if they cant audit well at 7 cause 7 is much tougher to audit than 3 merely because its just more or less straight auditing job but its got zig zags in it you have to know your business and as far as 8 is concer ned well 8 is very airyfairy and uh well ill give you some kind of notion of it the lower grades are dominant c communication theyre dominant c somewhere in the vicinity of power one passes into the band of r and r runs on up to pretty close i suppose i havent made graph of it but somewhere around 3 and then from 3 on up it is pure that is the dominant its affinity that runs on up from there and when you get up into 8 why the three start to harmonic one after the other you get r and you get and so on your dominant stress it is only because person is out of dominant communication or c that you can have solo auditing at r6ew he doesnt any longer need communication cycle but he needs r mainly and what he does is get heavy increases in r and these increases in r move up and if he has done all of his grades like good boy he will arrive at 3 with sufficient r to be able to flip over into and its uh at 3 where it starts going into heavy affinity affinity is the dominant you get into all sorts of conditions you when you get 3 you start finding yourself loving everybody and so forth so these these are just some of the consi derations as they go up along the line now its actually just interesting it doesnt change anything its where the person is progressing but if person has neglected his grades lower grades and neglected c and hasnt picked his c up as he comes up through the grades why when he gets into solo his reality is inadequate and it is not possib for him to in actual fact have any r on 3 reality on i well that means hes out somewhere along the line dont you see he hasnt made it in that wise and then if you find him hating everybody when he gets to when he gets to 5 or something like this well you know very well that he actually hasnt made it there either thesed just be tests of whether or not the guy is done you will find out oddly enough that the trouble with cases is failure to make the grade laughs not to make horrible pun out of it but if you were to hand clearing course materials to joe blow of hoboken if you were to hand the clearing course materials to joe blow of hoboken you would find out that he would be in completely unreal state he doesnt even restimulate most remarkable thing you ever heard in your life he doesnt even restimulate what wall now the emeter reads just above the level of the individual r pardon it reads just tiny bit deeper than his extant r so fellow could be there sick as pup his leg broke and everything else maybe he didnt have any reality on anything that was wrong with him at all and he doesnt think anything is wrong with him so you ask him is anything wrong with you and hell feel fine baffling youll say he has subjective reality well i dont know why youre using the word subjective he just doesnt have any reality period thats all laughs so anyway the emeter will read just little bit deeper than the guys r now that it happens to be basic law that happens to be basic law so you ask this bird for an arc break and hes just been knocked in the head some way or another and anybody would have an arc break anybody he doesnt have any arc break he doesnt know what happened so you as an auditor know what is wrong with the person usually far better than the person does and as result you know far better than the person what is wrong with the person but this little law gets in your road the meter reads just tiny bit deeper than the guys r level and the meter didnt read on it so it is either suppressed or it is below his r so if you try to do anything more about it at that moment than that youve had it so class viii takes what it sees on the meter and class viii auditor knows the meter has read or knows that it hasnt read he really doesnt even know what it has read on he can suppose that it read on the question he asked but it also might have read on fly that just bit the guy in the ankle so if he gets an unusual reaction in response to his question along with the read then he always checks for false read did it read or didnt it read see he doesnt go on the slavish acad emy level action that the meter read and therefore it was now he not only cleans up the false read he got but he feels that if this thing is falsely reading it must have falsely read for somebody else too so he cleans up the false reads on this subject ill give you little kind of of total loss of gain an individual had gotten off terrible second dynamic withhold and he had gotten this off in london to an auditor in the london hgc and he felt great he felt wonderful he got someplace else and some auditor was auditing him and got read on withhold and he immediately assumed that it hadnt blown so he went on for the next two or three years giving up this withhold to every auditor because it always read and he knew he couldnt blow it so therefore scientology had failed i myself was the review auditor in this particular instance so i of course immediately checked for false reads when he came up ah he says you know i could read it you know he said that again well its just like this and i said wait minute uh youve gotten this some withhold off before yeah he told all about how hed gotten it off before i just checked it for false reads traced it back to the first false read we could get cleaned it up the needle flew like bomb he had his gains back all in batch pongo about two minute operation so theres something to this now if auditing is working as it is as has been done prior to 24 september 1968 d 18 if auditing is working prior to this date when we are launching standard tech it is terrific testimony to the subject because the subject has been being applied in very sloppy knockely wackely fashion so its great testimony to the fact its great testimony to auditors now from this point on we have very narrow track and having an extremely narrow track that we can follow we have to have one confidence that it will give us the gain and that confidence is borne out of experience and it will give you the gains and we have to have an application of it in uniformity and we have to be able to patch up every nonstandard run case there is and that sounds like tall order but standard tech patches them up very easily its onlycertain laws certain rules and so forth in this subject you can only repair so many repairs and then youd better take the guy who has been fixing it up so that repairing repairs had to be done and youd better get him grooved up so that when he is put to repairing something with perfectly valid c s case supervision he actually does it and doesnt produce something else that has to be repaired do you follow so it is very bad thing to begin to repair repairs because you can start repairing the repairs of repairs and then repair the repairs of those repairs which fail to repair and the folder gets thicker and thicker and thicker right now quals through the world prior to this date of 24 september 68 are mainly engaged in maki ng up repairs to be repaired and the folders are very fat indeed now quals stat used to be volume of money paid but if person cant get out of qual if hes held prisoner until he does pay which i understand is being done here and there that if that is the case then then then the statistic itself doesnt tell anything you could actually just fix case up so that it had to be repaired and qual would make fortune you see now your good case supervisor thats runnin em along in the hgc and over in quad and hes runnin em alongthen qual folders are very thin and then hgc folders are damn thin too now the thing that is most neglected is just this is cases are set up to fly standard tech goes this way you take case take the bugs out of the case you know the missed withholds and the rudiments that have been out and the guy has been on gasoline for several years but you get this guy set up and you just take the bugs out of the case and then you set him up and you point and fire him and you dont give standard tech session unless your pc is flying thats who you see those huge letters fl k exclam ation point exclamation point in my c s folders it is real flunk to run any major action without the case already flying he says but what the hell what are you talking about the guys pts the guys pts his wifes in review his wifes in review that is why hes having review because hes all caved in hes all cave d in and hes and hes hes pts and hes all cave d in and thats why hes having review uh and what do you mean hes got to be set up and flying before you do major action and then you say an s ds major action oh what the hell what whats this well the s ds supposed to set him up and you say boy down dog down rover major listing action you set him up to run it well how do you set him up to run you get the ruds in yeah what if it ah ah you get the ruds in oh i see you just make sure they are uh yah you just pull an arc break and so on you get the ruds in to f n get the ruds in to f n yeah well of course course uh well what happens if he doesnt well you do green form till you get an f n yeah but wait minute wait minute if youre doing green form and so forth you cant do this s and d you wont do he wont do an s and d unless hes it says he needs it on green form anyhow oh i see what if the guy didnt need it oh yeah yeah undoubtedly the guy needed it but you might have gotten an f n on the green form before you got to pts and then you wouldnt do it well whats this you consi der it major action you say major action is an s and d thats right remedy b is major action s and d is major action you set up the case to f n now what what if we dont what are you what are you talking about you mean were not going to run any more s and ds were not going to were going to run s and ds when the guy needs some s and d why youll get him an f n before you run it oh well golly if we didnt have s and ds we just couldnt keep qual solvent at all hed say and youd say good go broke for all i care i like broke quals id just be as happy as clam with an that never ever had anybody ever walk through the door of qual and spider webs and cobw ebs accumulating around the desk thatd be just great because right now qual is being used for case gain but that isnt where you get case gain you dont get case gain in repair youve just got it backward you get case gain with grades and major actions you put the case up to fly you never audit the case unless hes flying so you always fly case b efore you audit it now you begin to understand what its all about you dont try to heal the case with grades you try to give him advances and gains big major gains with these grades and they get em boy they get em theyll flystandard tech isnt what i say it is its what works and what works has already been established so it isnt for to say its different and it isnt for anybody else to say its different either because we fought for it and we won it the hard way now lets consolidate it now lets get it practiced the history of standard tech is very long history it is very hard fought for history there is tremendous quantity of technology in scientology and dianetics it is one of the largest broadest bodies of information on the subject of human behavior that has ever appeared in the universe and now i can say without fear of challenge because i know whats appeared on the back track and it is so god damned stupidly feeble that it consis ts of more than cras s superstition now the triumph is that out of this large body of material which embraces everything known to man or beast theres hardly anything unexplored in that whole subject out of that whole mad wide ocea n of material theres this hair line that goes right straight through the middle of the material so you have to know where the ocea n is in order to get on the hair line now thats quite an achievement now ill tell you how the hair line was chose n and why it became that terribly narrow path which we now call standard tech it is composed of those things which if they are out inhibit and prohibit all case gain its negative assessment if the points of standard tech are present unresolved the case will not gain so obviously the resolution of these points in their proper sequence is standard tech if fellow has an arc break he cann ot be audited if he is audited without the arc break being handled he will go immediately into sad effect and months later will be found just sadder and sadder and sadder well its fact nothing you argue with its fact so obviously theres the arc break if the fellow has present time problem you try to audit the individual with present time problem youll get case change of any kind whatsoever it just parks itself right there it doesnt become sadd er but the case doesnt change if you try to audit person over missed withhold an individual will just plow in and plow in and plow in and hell natter and get mad and get mad at himself and on the various dynamics an d so forth hell have hell of time if you try to audit case that has committed some tremendous overt that he considers tremendous overt without ever touching on or letting him discus s or handle the overt hell just go into degradation now if the overt happens to be on dianetics and scientology i actually guarantee itll go straight into degradation theres horrible trick you can play on to somebody who has just been cutting scientology to ribbons if you were to audit one of these one of these nuts one of these screaming painted blue monkeytailed idiots that have been howling around about scientology and so forth standard tech would actually give him gain but every time he hits the overt line he would try to do himself in so because you improve his reality and the improvement of reality would bring him to recognition of the wickedness of his own acts and youve actually audited him successfully into degradation the more successful you were with your auditing the more he would beco degraded do you follow he would degrade himself you arent degrading him he has been now he realizes since man is basical ly good man he realizes that he had been attacking something he shouldnt have attacked and therefore he is just filthy pig and the more it works on him the more he gets to be filthy pig you could actually handle it by handling overts if you found the actual overts but youd probably have to couple it with motivators and overts and youd have to handle it very slippery indeed its buttons of this type buttons of this type now there are more esoteric lines of action thats various actions of power and those are all points on the ladder of course you dont have to go that far you get to this thing called service facsimile every one of these guys is using some kind of combination to make people wrong and himself right and you walk up into the various strata of power and you walk up into power plus which is reorientation step you go up to r6ew which blows whatever hes got hanging around from gpms you move into the ccs youve gone down to death and you move into what is now ot1 you put him back in the human race and then you get some more bank off the line and ot2 and you get rid of the body thetans at 3 and you review him all out straight and make him in beautiful shape put him in his own valence and fix him up so he can confront things at 4 and then you turn him into an extrovert at 5 and 6 and then in 7 you let him examine what horrible dog he has always been laughter he usually eventually comes to this conclusi on normally starts out on the basis that he is the only thetan in the universe who has never committed an overt laughter anyway if we go on up the line we get to the old one know thyself the first dynamic versus the physical universe the individual and life versus this universe 7 is actually life vis vis with life and 8 is of course life vis vis with the physical universe and the first three great philosophers that greece produced took as their opening saga the relationship of life to the physical universe they were starting in to the empire state building on the top floor you get to know yourself on 7 and 8 mostly on 8 and then begin to find your relationship your real relationship with the physical universe and the ancie nt greek philosopher didnt get any place because he didnt have any highway to get there highway at all so standard tech is the highway and it is built out of those points which if they are present advance can occur and there arent any more points awful adventurous statement but its true there arent any more points theres another trick or two perhaps something like that blaaaah couple of ways to do one or two of these things but the variability even on those is we ighted in favor of just one thing to do so as you come curving down the line with standard tech it goes right straight where were supposed to go and you can hold case in to that groove and it is groove boy it is very terrible now i can see you now trying to get an acade my auditor to see the light and youve just case supervised this case and archibald swangolen is the auditor and at the moment he goes in he finds the case supervision cann ot work because the pc actually as it says make sure that you get the arc break because the pc is very sad he goes in there and hes so sure its because the pc just sure its because the pc has missed withhold so that is why he ran grade 4 before he ran and you say wait minute boy what are you doing oh well you see its just and somebody came from the ao the other day and they said it was always best to get off the service facsimile as soon as possib because then you could get the overts you will be in the optimum position to be able to say we do not care who came from the ao the other day there is only one standard tech and there is only one way to do standard tech and there is only one way it is done and there is only one pc and that is standard pc and you aint got standard pc now lets go into this quietly and back into this folder and where the hell did you miss the arc break to begin with and do it the right way shall we you in case supe rvision must first know that standard tech will solve the case and that your direction of standard tech to be done will solve the case if the auditor will follow your c s and if he will keep his trs in and finish the cycle of action on the case as it rolls along and your confidence must be such that aloicious q squashbottom himsel f in person can emerge as the worlds most unstandard piece of balderdash he spends hours bragging to everybody how hes very different and you still go in against this case and you order and your enforce the running of standard tech and mr squashbottoms case will fall apart see the the attitude of an auditor handling standard tech is that of total confidence and that confidence is something that is gained that is won if by doing these actions you obtain an exactly predictable result confidence is borne and its very funny thing at this stage of the game to be talking about anything as positive as scientology as something in which you have to have confidence the funny part of it is people have run into many cases that have been misaudited that the cases appear different until you look back and find out that the guy has been talking to his first six auditors tried to tell him the ptp to those first six auditors and none of them ever handled it and then you realize that youd better handle the ptp so therefore its rather simple simple world that youre dealing with but you cannot adventure into this world of standard tech without total total grip on the techn ology itself you have to know technology so that well you just dont avoid these major points like the twelve laws of listing well hmf that you dont have to thinkety about these things they just are you see the pc sitting in front of you you know the auditors code to point where you see that pc sitting in front of you and he appears just little bit dirty as he sits down to session and youve got sense enough to ask have you had any sleep and his skin tone doesnt look good have you had any sleep have you had something to eat very good alright well have session you dont ask the classic i saw in folder yesterday i dont know i havent had any sleep for six nights the pc says and the auditor said shame sham the auditor said tell an earlier time when youve had sleep that will beco classic because its violation of the auditors code so you know the auditors code to point where you dont have to think about it and so the standardness of standard tech is knowing standard tech so well that you dont have to think about standard tech in order to do standard tech it simply is now one of the parts of standard tech is the tremendous wealth we have here of folders and information and the wealth consists of the fact that i have done five hundred sepa rate supe rvisions on cases in the last five weeks now thats quite few i do them in my part time while im attending to other things and of these lines the only cases that arent flying are the cases that havent had their auditing finished yetwe had one very very famous case this case was made unstandard by being very unstandardly approached the case staggered aboard terrible condition the case was audited oddly enough actually did achieve arc straightwire and then the person who was on that line at that time said its dead thetan needle so run him more and ran him two days as an overrun of arc straightwire and then i said to the next auditor rehab the arc straightwire and run secondaries the next auditor went into session the pc was running secondary just like that the pc was running the secondary the very next step to come up it was happening and the auditor was t rying to rehab during that whole session sad day time marched on and then we finally found out that his ta was so high and his case was so unapproachable that nobody could do anything with it and he got to be known sort of as the black dog of carnak the black dog of carnak was somebody who got on peoples back and never got off because it was sure assignment of doubt to even touch this case because he sort of got it fixed so that you did something wrong in other words he blew the auditors cool laughter in doing such an action the case was bad luck so this case then becam very nonstandard it was an unsolvable case and he was unsu perviseable and he was unauditable and nobody was willing to audit him and uh i looked back along the lines and i found out that the case had r sed on missed withholds and connected to suppressiv groups and later on had blowdowns on missed withholds and wronging scientologist and in all cases the auditor hadnt paid any attention to this so i just sent it back into session we pulled the missed withholds we got what he was really connected to and well all we did was rehab his former release on the track on drugs and the case flew straightened out marvelous bingo bango nothing to it i dont know how long really it took to straighten the case out i dont know how long the session was i dont imagine it was more than about 50 minutes all i had to find was where standard tech had been violated and where it had been violated it went to hell but anyway it doesnt mean that you wont run into totally unauditable cases there are totally unauditable cases theres callahans robinsons and by the time these tapes are released and heard they probably have been buried long since in infamy uh but uh they beco unauditable simp ly because they never come near an organization or present themselves to be audited and that is the only unauditable case t here is so youre here to learn this magic road and you think at the moment its very easy to grasp this thats all there is to it why did i come here you havent heard anything yet it took five weeks to make three class viii auditors five weeks they are cracker jacks they are marvelous youve got to do it in three weeks transc ript ends herewha t standard tech does lecture given on 25 september 1968 thank you thank you and here we are whats the date its the 25th of

and joberg staff and scientologists very good well now lets get down to business where does standard tech begin what is it it is the accumulation of those exact processes which make way between humanoid and ot the exact method of organizing them the exact method of delivering them and the exact repair of any errors made on that route now that is quite remarkable because in actual fact that gives you 100 percent its 100 percent action there are unauditable cases unless theyre not present if you cant get them present they are unauditable and that is one of the cases that is unsolvable and in actual fact the only case that is unsolvable now you can think at once what about the person who is being audited against his own determinism what about the unconsci ous person he is present what about the psychoanalyst you know the psych oanalyst he had lot of troubled cases and lets see mans never been able to do this sort of thing before and there are different cases and therere also suppressiv and weve got the so forth and question question question and thats what im trying to cure you monkeys of impolite now in the first place as far as the case who is present is concerned if you did an assessment list and you put down reading item isnt presen t there wouldnt be anybody to do the assessmen t on so that is missing on the resistive case list but the rest of them if you cant knock off hundred percent on it why you need your flywheel adjusted the uh thats fact thats fact there isnt much excuse for missin g let us take the fellow who doesnt want to be audited and he is somehow or another persuaded to be present in the auditing room now you say at once that we will overwhelm the mans determinism naturally by forcing auditing on him we dont overwhelm his determinism because basicall his own determinism would want to be audited so we have the oldest remedy of this there is and it hasnt changed for years and years and years and years and it does exist and all you do is engage in itsa on how he doesnt and why he doesnt want to be audited thats all thats the remedy if you can get the fellow to explain why he doesnt want to be audited why he hates to be audited why auditing so forth bopawop wop youve got it but if you let him stray out into the other dynamics you havent got it if he sits there and tells you how all scientologists are bad and how lesso n is so hard then pig face the big politician has said from the depths of his implantedness how its all bad if you let him go off into this line of country you are not following the main line and the main line is simply why doesnt he want to be audited do you follow now the other may start to blow off but you may repeat the question because hes departed from it now if you can get him to explain in the fullest extent this exact process it is an exact process it has discu ssion of scientology connected with it whatsoever it is simp ly his itsa on the subject of now he will come to point where basic begins to appear into view and you simply go on into session and run it do you follow theres nothing to it its just session approach so therefore he doesnt want to be audited and he is asked to explain why he doesnt want to be audited and he will there upon give as to the reasons why and then he will hit some basic reason why and youll find yourself running something on the order of secondary or an engram now you push him on through it you dont push him through covertly you never do any of this covertly i hear of some auditor covertly auditing ooooo if he hasnt got his hands on the cans youre liable to pass the f n and hell hold onto the cans he doesnt know what they are we dont even know he doesnt even know what hes talking about but he will guided in his itsa guide himsel f right down into the chan nel of his resistance it could wind up most anyplace it could wind up in prep check it could wind up in secon dary it could wind up dont you see and hell start answ ering these questions and the next thing you know hes in session and feels lot better for it and hell go away shaki ng you by the hand now there isnt anything covert about it you keep your trs in you do your auditing job you read your meter the same way and everything else hes explaining why he doesnt want to be audited do you follow and it is the most fundamental rudiment now i i look with horror at green form which winds up as one of its items very late on the green form that the pc di d not want to be audited in the first place it takes this form he didnt want review in the first place well an auditors pretty dim bulb if he hasnt been able to detect that fellow comes in and you say alright good have seat here now at that moment you pick up the first out rudiment see its actually not something you put in all rudiments because for the excellent reason it just wastes time this guy sits down and so on now you could say its missed withhold its this its that we dont care what it is its just the fact that he doesnt want to be audited so you think now were dealing with uh you think were dealing with mr swillengullet the famous politician or mr jogbog who is the famous psych oanalist and youre not youre not dealing with the stellar light youre dealing with scientologist who has walked up to the examiner having been summ oned because he hasnt been auditing for the last six months to find out what the hells wrong and the examiner has said go have review n and as the review auditor is sitting there this guy walks in and hes uncooperative and very soggy about the whole thing if you simply ask him to explain why he didnt want to be audited he would go promptly into session it is process alright now lets get how far this process goes fellow hasnt been auditing for seven months on his ot3 and it isnt flat so its the same process why doesnt he want to be audited you could ask it in the version of why isnt he auditing but it comes down to why he doesnt want to be audited while auditing and this situation you will run into every now and then now it flies off by accident on most of these lines you achieve this accidentally and you will see so on many case reviews and you understand standard tech isnt that process which is only used in review review is that area where standard tech is corrected back to standard tech if it hasnt been done in the first place i t winds up in review now this fellow hasnt been auditing as matter of fact i have just off hand i know of about three two of whom didnt want session and third who hasnt audited on her 3 just just brrrrt just this i think thereve theyve been on my desk in the last 24 hours so it is not an uncommon problem and you accidentally hit an arc break you hit some bypassed charge you hit some something that goes down the line and clears up why he hasnt been auditing and you yourself maybe if you had long run on some level hit some period where you really didnt want to sit down and audit you sort of wanted to leave the session and so forth well this is the this is the phenomenon now the common denominator of hitting the phenomenon to trained auditor would be why he doesnt why doesnt he want to be audited if some fellows doing ot sections something like that on himself anything from r6ew on up the line and he suddenly wants to leave session yeah hes sitting there and hes saying aaiii ugh well the rudiment thats out is horribly simple rudiment he doesnt want to be audited now hes just done something that fixed it up so he didnt want to be audited now at that moment if he is notco mpletely dead in his head he is aware of his own activity that is actually the fundamental difference between scientologist and humanoid scientologist can is aware of his activities his mental phenomena he is aware of his behavior he has an idea of what he is doing he hes standing there nya nya nya nya nying yang yap yap yap yap and hes all of sudden hey wait minute boy i must have missed withhold see i must have missed withhold i mean its as simp as that you know he says to himself yeah he is aware of his own behavior it is not that hes introvertedly critical and you will find characters around in scientology who are not aware of their own behavior and that is the difference between scientologist and one who isnt you will find somebody who apparently has had some of the grades run who still attributes his behavior to some sort of an act of god or something i i felt i felt i felt bad today i i feel bad today thats about far as the cognition goes see but this therefore is process youre sitting there doing your materials all of sudden you feel bad hell with it i think im gonna leave you know pack it up and get out of here well now being aware of what you re doing you all of sudden recognize this is symptom so somethings wrong well youd better find out whats wrong and whats wrong actually will show up on the basis of why he didnt want to be audited if you simply will explain to yourself thats just sort it out you know just say lets see the reason i dont want to be audited is so and so and so on now this can go so far as to make one item list that is list that is listed to one item reading you can actually make list of it if you know your phenomena youre well trained auditor i got an arc break i arc broke myself something i dont like thatll show up and go bingo bongo now you take somebody its very interesting watching somebody being audited on the grades who isnt trained even in the least they eventually come up to level of awareness that something is going on but they dont have the technology to explain what is going on and they couldnt isolate bypassed charge for the life of em they cant cant isolate they they know now wait something is wrong in auditing and something is wrong with and wmf wnf wmf wnf wmf wmf and lets see oh itd be an arc break ptp what if id gone and missed withholds ive done something here he doesnt know what to call it he hasnt got the he hasnt got the subject matter at his fingertips he doesnt know what to call it so of course he cant handle it you know theres wmwmm wmm wmwsm and you will see one of these guys then suddenly moving in the direction of getting trained he knows hes got deficiency he doesnt know what to call it but it still comes under the heading of explaining why he doesnt want to be audited and all of sudden why theres long blow down and there it is now ill tell you something very funny something that is very amusi ng as we used to hear occasionally where some sp had been operating very well that scientologists were far far harder to audit than people in off the street yes at the level of nonstandard tech i should smell em out that is certainly true not guy in off the street he isnt hard to audit at all hes so damn stupid that he lets the auditor do anything and scientologist is only hard to audit by very lousy auditor do you follow because hes sitting there and all of sudden the fellow says uh alright start of session good now yesterday we were taking up whether or not you had overts and so on and bla bla and this scientologist sitting in the chair says well what the hell are you talking about man where where the hell are your rudiments huh you havent got this set up whats going on the fellow off the street says yeah thats logical it it i dont feel very good about it but yeah well overt that we were taking up yesterday i wonder where gracie ann is i wonder uh she said shed telephone for it yeah wed taken up overts telephone at four i wonder if shes ut withbi ll um wawawa but thats just auditing its just life you know uhhh oh yeah very hard to audit scientologists are very hard to audit by lousy auditor thats very funny because as case supervisor you can sit there and read somebody being driven straight into propitiation just like falling piece of lead on nonstandard session and now and then you will see in case supervision my comment in folders saying well maybe we got away with it and thats because i found something nonstandard in the session and its interesting that in the last three days i have had back before for review as repeat after completed review only those cases where i read well maybe we got away with it i dont know from this folder it all seems to be r but i dont know and sure enough here week two weeks later the person in back for review hes sick at his stomach hes this hes that or hes the other thing so you can go through the actual auditing actions on an auditors report and at this point of the session he is supposed to do whatever hes supposed to do and he didnt do it and he did something else and he phrased the questions in some other odd way and then you see couple of q and as following this and then you see the ta rising and then you see indicating by passed charge of auditing over the last floating needle or something and you read down the line on this and your case supervisor report is the auditors summary shee t and so on is glowing the pc bright toned happy at the end wanted to loan his car the propitiation has entered in to it told what marvelous auditor i was and good shap you can expect in week or two to see this person in qual with headache or sick at his stomach or something else and so your well dones are only given to those where the session ran off like clock exactly on standard tech because you know that works and theres these little divergences and little zigs and little zags that you see in the session you dont ever call those well done not because you are being pedantic not because you are being snotty and mean but because simp ly you know this case will probably appear before the examiner in another week or two or before the master at arms he will be in one or two of those positions despite the glowing auditor report the summary it didnt go standard so the result wont be standard now its remarkable that anybody gets away with what they get away with at all it is better than man has ever heard before has ever seen and it is quite remarkable but he is much worse off than you ordinarily assume so the net result of all of this is that when it is not standard he will have had some gain its not all bad but hell also have not achieved his full gain and the difference between some gain and the difference between that and full gain is the difference between wobblybobbly tech and very standard precise tech now standard tech rolls off with clickety clickety clickety clickety click with total invariability now what you get away with sometimes we see that the rudiments are overrun so you will see in ease supervisory report if this looks poor and so on is bring the pc back to session and indicate the over listed list well that is funny thing to do the guy was perfectly happy hes going to loan the auditor his car right after the session uh and he got an f n on it and thats all set and thats all r but the proper case supervisor action is to have him brought back although is was apparently very successful and have the over listed list indicated i just did folder just few minutes before i came down here on little kid we have lot of little cadets in the sea org and theyre pretty much on the ball and this little kid i dont know how old he is uh oh i dont know seven eight something like that well an auditor actually doesnt respect the pc if hes little kid to the extent that he did and its absolutely fascin ating how the misapplication of technology just hair line knocks the kid around in the first place hes being audited from too high an altitude to easily protect himself so there was an over listed list on power process it went on and on and on i cant imagine what the hell the auditor was thinking about what in the name of god was going on he had his first blow down it went bong bong he even mentions it he marked it and everything and then he went on listing you know went on listing went on listing well the kid seem ed alright the proper action was to have him walk back into session and have the over listed list indicated and that did happen and the needle f nd promptly and at once very abundantly the little kid knew something was wrong and all of that was not much of review session i dont know how many minutes were consumed in doing this one action but of course to do that action why you have to fly the needle and then do the action so he also got little tiny lick and promise on rudiments and so on all of this maybe took 3 4 5 minutes something like that indicated the over listed list and got nice f n on the thing and the kid chee rfully went out of session again so you say god damn thats being picky wow the fellow had the item indicated it was alright it was the correct item just because we add eighty or ninety additional items is reason to believe or just because we added five or six additional items after the blow down on 5a is reason to be that picky oh yeah one item past the first b d on 5a is one too many items it blew down thats it now about all the lads gonna do after that is cognite and if you start askin g him for more listing items youve smothered his cognition so the needle wont fly now ive got question here its what is flying needle now i never punish people for asking questions they can ask all the questions they want to because in that way i get an idea of how much theyve got to learn an f n that is real f n and so forth takes off it flies you can see it disconnect from the bank and start to function so its just colloquialism fly needle float needle f n thats all and the explanation is that if you cant obtain an f n promptly and immediately on rudiments with pc in standard tech somethings goofy theres something wrong and it usually is wrong with the session doesnt even go back into the past theres something wrong right there right now so to give you the difference this little kids needle probably was doing one of these half inch floats or something like that and when the over list was indicated why it probably went to three inch float full dial float you get the difference now you can expand the floating needle but if you start expanding floating needle with too thoroughness you get the thing expanded to half an inch and then you collapse it to quarter of an inch and then you try to fly it further and it all of sudden packs up and goes stiff known as overrun the pc came out of it and the pc we nt back into it again now the essence of standard tech all of these things to the contrary and merely supplementary the essence of standard tech then is to get somebody in session and one of the best ways to get person in session who wont be audited at all is to ask him to explain why he doesnt want to be audited have you got thats processnow somebodys going to say whats the comm and its is if there was canned command for that then you would miss certain percentage of pcs you might have to ask him in bottentott you know now the person who has to have the exact words of the command is person who hasnt grasped the thing that happens when you ask the command now ill give you an example somebody who wonders at what happens with release or wonders something about how you handle an overrun or wonders and madly goes around in circles on this subject has not mastered hasnt mastered what the hell release is now if he knows what is this phenomenon of release then he can produce it he can unproduce it but supposing you were trying to fix radio but you didnt know what it did so lets give radio to the ancient egyptian physicia ns and say fix it now you could explain to them that you take this funny flat bladed thing and twiddlediddle it into the shiny buttons in the front of it and that comes down and you hook together the wire when it doesnt run now youve got to tell him 8000 more things you see like this wire goes to the that youre teaching him by rote he doesnt know what radio is so youve got to have all kinds of exact rote little actions do you see these rote actions by rote i mean the chinese school you know type actions youd have to have you take the flat bladed end instrument and you put it in to the vertical slot which is in that that bright steel thing there and you rotate it against the sun now youd also have to place the instrument to the south to rotate it to the sun ah boo you better tell him what radio is now if he cant dig what radio is christ almighty dont let him fix it now the mechanism of release is simp ly this the guy has obsessively been thinking mass he himsel f we know in the first place that his whole bank is mocked up by himse lf and nobody else at his bank but we know also that theres whole bunch of body thetans that are also mockin g up banks and these body thetans are copying each others banks and mocking up banks against banks and hes mockin g up banks which are copies of body thetans banks and body thetans are copying his bank and weve got the most marvelous array of counter disowned super copying that you ever heard of but this this would be very simp if there wasn t such thing as body thetan now this guy is thinking mass or hes thinking thought which keeps body thetan mass connected to him thats the exact mechanic of this and you have made him recognize thought about that thought which causes him to cease to think the thought that keeps him connecte d if you go on past the point where the needle floats you have now made him rethink the thought which reco nnects him or makes him mock up bank or makes the body thetans who are mocking up bank reconnect to him thats the mechanism of release let him finish his cognition and give him an thats it as far as that action is concerned now you can release him on other actions which are not immediately germane to that action as long as they are very different actions now this can go so far as if you get an f n on green form in spite of the fact that youre doing remedy bs s and ds or any other thing that the green form calls for and somewhere along that line doing the action called green form which the pc recognizes as repair if while doing that action you get an f n and then knuckle headedly continue on that green form you are going to make him think in terms of repair and he will rethink the thought which reconnects him and you might as well not have done it in the first place you get the idea so he does the green form to an f n and that is that it f ns he gives you his last cognition and so on now the bank will remedy will put out the bank will put out the electrical phenomenon of disconnect moment before the pc himse lf cognites on it the meter reads just small bit below the reality or recognition of the preclear so that you normally get this odd phenomenon of the bank releases and then the pc says it he finds out about it after you find out about it on the meter so you have to make the marvelous adjudication of when to cut his com m because ou do cut his comm you must cut his comm the trouble with the auditors that you see come in at level 0 at old saint hill courses and so on you watch them on tv its the most agonizing thing you ever heard of they ask this question and this fellow answe rs the question and he goes on and itsas and itsas and the auditors just not there and he sits there and the pc talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and runs his havingness down and pulls in mass hes talking to him and i get hold of those guys when im training them and i said control the session well control the session i dont quite know what to do thats all session consists of starting it running it and ending it and intermediately begins with beginning handling and completing process then people wont have learned this if they dont recognize they can control session they havent found out this marvelous marvelous fact that you can control anybodys bank better than they can below the level of clear anybody exterior to the bank can control bank far better than the guy who is inside you can run him up and down the track you can run him into things and out of things and do ahh and you get up around level 4 5 ot section and so forth you can make somebody scan himself all over the time track telepathically miles aw ay the auditor always has greater control of the pc bank than the pc does alwa ys what do you mean you cant control the session you can make the pc go wherever you want him to go what are you waiting for the auditors cause so the auditor tells him process to run and hes delivering self determinism into the hands of the pc so having started him in that fine line he lets the pc do the recognition neces sary to do the disconnect from the his bank or the other persons bank the moment it disconnects his auditor has got to recognize the end of that cycle of action which is usually by the additional cognition of the pc cognition turns up usually right on the heels of the f n it starts to f n and then you hear the cognition com out and youve got to get the exact instant where you say thats it you run pc just like you drive car the auditor is not an effect point the auditor is cause point which is bringing the pc up to cause point so thats the mecha nism thats the mecha nism of release well what the hells the mecha nism of clear well the mecha nism of clear is he doesnt mock it up more he doesnt mock anything up anymore well now what happens after clear why do you go into anything after clear then if the guy well that would be great if there was just one thetan there but there isnt just one thetan therenow youve got to get him on ot2 now to take enough charge off of the bank so he doesnt plow in when he hits 3 because he starts hitting these things on 3 all hes got to do is miss and the bank will go into wing ding the body thetans of the bank will go into complete spinning screaming mess all you have to do is trip the wrong incident run incident 2 before incident 1 get the pc wheeling and dealing and hell go into freewheel which could kill the pc could kill him nothing to monkey with therefore hes now handled his own state and his next action is to take enough charge with ot2 off the case so that when he starts running these body thetans the handiest most active body thetans have been discha rged down to point because ot2 is part of r6 theyre theyve been sneaked down they wont freewheel as long as you run up from up from incident 1 and incident 2 if you run north of that and all of ot2 is north of that its closer to pt see so you discha rge it and when you throw it into 3 he wont freewheel that is to say he doesnt automatically start going through the composite group incident of all of these body thetans do you follow there is nothing much to it it its very simp you you take the you take the jolt out of that portion of r6 with the materials of ot2 which would cause by overcharge its too charged up the composite mass of body thetans who all of sudden start freewheeling through r6 cause theyve all been in r6 on this planet the vast majority of them have and then you can do 3 and you can do 3 very safely but at the time youve done 3 remember that this character has now been plowing into body thetans and hes started to wonder whether or not he isnt mockin g something up because hes got bunch of automatic pictures and theres things mocking up against these things and things things womp womp and what he starts doing then is start copying their copies theyll make copies of the physical universe and then hell copy their copies and then hell have the masses of body thetans hell make the copies of body thetan masse s and hes so damned used to having there things that he feels weird without any mass in so he starts mockin g up some mass lot of wild things can happen but he blows these left right and center and then you rehab him and then it all goes back q uietly into place now as you move on up the lines you get to 7 you get to 8 and youre taking away any slightest faintest obsessive create that might exist and youre taking away ale obsessive postulatingness and lot of other odds and ends of little mecha nisms that you may not have looked too closely in the teeth that are the woof and warp and composite of the thetan now so what are your mecha nisms of release and what are the mecha nisms of clearing we know the individual is simply mocking it up himself well therefore its very simple all hed have to do is cognite hes mocking it up himself and hed go clear theres nothing to that yeah thats the trick man hes got to cognite on it himself you start telling him he is and thats why you dont see that cognition put out as an end product you start telling him that that is the end product and god damn ive seen several of them do it they come around and say well bla bla and bla everybody knows that im mockin g it up myself yeah i know im mockin g it up myself the guys mad you know blaaaa he looks like something psych iatrist put out yeah i know im mocking it up myself and you say thats good do you have any pictures and so on oh yeah lots of pictures are you mocking those up those are automatic pictures the cognition is being used as an evaluation and you could actually prep check the cognition if it goes off too badly that is if hes mocking it up himself and you prep check him anyway thatd be very very weird thing to do but it could be done you dont find very many cases in this state you find quite different theres different composite to this character he didnt find any on 3 and you break out your little violin and you say it may be so we do not know your story sounds so queer we hate like hell to doubt your word but it dont go here the truth of the matter is the person has this lifetime severe physical injury which has jammed several body thetans together so that they dont answ er up they dont answe r up and theyre impacted or pushed in or all one severe physical crash bang will cause an individual to find very few or none at all the remedy for it is run this lifetime engram well somebodys gonna say well why what do you tell him but if you let the guy go out of this lifetime why hes hes running engrams of his own someplace or another that hasnt anything to do with his existing situation his existing situation is very simp situation where simply lot of body thetans all think theyre one body thetan and thats the primary mistake body thetans m ake and the proper cure for that along with rehabs and getting in the lower grades very often you find the lower grades madly out on such cases as well as this its not always true but you very often find them very badly out and you move them up along the line you find this lifetime injuries this lifetime injuries or circumstances certainly which made engrams that pushed it all together and then then all of sudden you can run 3 run some of the phenomena of 3 you you find this quite common there is such thing as somebody with body thetans forget it it doesnt exist but you will find the lower grades are out now this kind of phenomenon can exist that doing the lower ot sections the guy blew lot of body thetans and then you can find that moment when he blew lot of body thetans actually they all took off but the common incident of body thetans is of course incident 1 the next common incident is incident 2 incident 1 is the basic but incident 2 is not neces sarily true of every thetan because incident 2 doesnt isnt in the bank of those thetans who were elsewhere who were elsewhere 75 million years ago and there are few of them also there were few who were here who didnt get it and so incident 2 is not that general but its sufficiently general that sometimes requires that now incident 1 is that comm on incident of occurrence which tends to knit together all body thetans into the kooky idea theyre all one there is also another incident on the track which implants them to believe theyre all one and body thetans are not all one life is not all one by long way life is composed of individuals it requires certain amount of effort to stay in the time stream at this period of time of this universe now therefore the mechanisms release have to do with these factors and at the lower grades the individual is so composited that he thinks he is one individual and he very often hears little voices and so on but he doesnt let this bother him too much thats just natural and as you come up the line as you bring him up the line why he of course gets close r and close r to this phenomenon very often on the clearing course and so on people will enco unter body thetans and body thetans will start to blow and you cant get into the ot sections without something happening about body thetans i dont wish to be invalidative of anybody around hearing this who didnt find any one of two things shouldve one of two things should be done in such case his earlier auditing ought to be explored for blowing lot of thetans he may have occlu ded this and the other one if he still isnt flying on it the other one is severe injury in this lifetime whereby the body thetans and he and the body are have in comm on savage physical experience of some kind or another which makes them all group and makes the group into one being those are the two actions which are taken in theory but these are the mecha nisms of release and these are the mecha nisms of clearing now those are the mechanisms youre handling ant those are the things youre handling and if you know those mecha nisms well you can do an awful lot you dont go squirreling around on the edges of it because the thing which handles them is standard tech and there isnt much else that handles them and it handles them case after case one person right after the other it completely removes the differences between c ss there are different cases there are cases different than any other cases there arent pecu liar cases but i can tell you this i can tell you this that person who does not come up through the grades does not hit the phenomenon he doesnt hit the release points of the upper grades if he hasnt been through the lower grades for instance if somebody didnt really go into 2 ot2 hes not likely to be able to come very close to 3 see if he didnt go clear on the clearing course why its very unlikely hell go anyplace else if he didnt do his r6ew correctly he isnt likely to go clear do you follow its tracking back tracking back quest ion here somebody asking somebody something or other very complex question on the subject of going clear or not going clear about rehab of power after person is clear now the law is you dont rehab power after person is clear you do not do it the reason you do not do it is the person all too often falls on his head but the operative word here is whats got this person puzzl ed is the word clear if the person went clear on the clearing course and you rehabbed or indicated anything that was out on power or anything of that sort whatsoever he would be in trouble at once but the operative word is clear person who didnt go clear on the clearing course and didnt go release on r6ew probably has something wrong with his power and if theres nothing wrong with his power he will go release on r6ew and clear on the clearing course if he didnt go release on r6ew if he gave bunch of false attests and so forth and didnt go clear on the clearing course why then there is something wrong with his power but if his power was alright he undoubtedly went release on r6ew and undoubtedly went clear on the clearing course i mean its not question that you wouldnt puzzle much about so that if person was on the clearing course and couldnt go clear you could of course go back and rehab the power because it isnt clear you know i mean simple all of these things are very simple theyre all straight think so when youre trying to audit case that doesnt want to be audited he is stuck into some protest or resistance and you make him as is it and if you havent at that moment put him on meter you wont see the moment when it releases and go on arguing with the guy because youre liable to be incense d so it is an auditing session he will go release on the subject and be auditable and then walk himse lf right back into it and plow himself in again unless ou see that he went f n on it so you dont ever go along on the preconceived notion this is another rule of standard tech dont continue to hold the same idea of the persons character c s must never continue to hold his concep t of the pc which was formed at some other level of the pcs case and you will find that pcs get reputations well everybody who was maintaining and keeping the pcs reputations up the line doesnt believe auditing works so this pc was complete dog when he was level 0 he just managed to get squeaked by it and he would have required 18 dozen reviews and he was just having an awful time and so on and then the case supervisor gets this pc when he gets up along the line to about grade iv and he right away he will make one horrible mistake if he does not realize the persons released from that state or he wouldnt have gotten to iv so either the person was run to iv or the person was not run to iv if the person is still this kind of case and is now grade iv then god damn it nobody ever ran him up to grade iv do you follow so you do that by confirm or rehab his grades up to iv now they will either rehab or theyve got to be run and if they wont rehab then theyve got to be run elementary sometimes you start to rehab some grade like iii or something like that and the ta starts up like mad well you have to make out what the hell that was probably iii was overrun at the time the moment of release was there and now ill give you piece of stuff out of 7 in actual fact it is not standard action but what happened was is he was audited on that with his ruds out piece out of 7 is you can get the ruds in on any situation anywhere in the past thats piece out of 7 thats not standard tech in repairs but you can get the ruds in on any action of the past anytime you can put all the sessions ruds in on it now its very remarkable to see this occur because the thing will blow suddenly some former instance will blow which was resistive in the past in other words the person was living with his ruds out now the weird part of it is is the reason for it wouldnt run let us say something like that at the time it was run its now giving you rising ta and going bad and so on you know that there are still some ruds out on this case and some auditor was kidding himse lf someplace so what you have to do is fly the needle and you make it your business to fly the needle now you go back and try to rehabilitate iv and oddly enough itll rehabilitate most mysterious thing you ever saw actually if you noticed your own auditors reports you put ruds in prior to the time iv was run iv was run let us say in 1965 if you were running down chain of arc breaks you found one in 1959 when you found the arc break in 1959 you took it out from underneath the running of iv in 1965 you actually put some ruds in in the 1965 session so it will now run or rehabilitate if it doesnt rehabilitate you can now run it most mysterious think you ever saw in your life but you have to know this operative principle you guys go around and start running some of the odd bits i tell you out of 7 and 8 and so on youll probably get your brains blown out not by but these are very very rough levels ah but ill just give you some of the data i know where the ceiling is now exactly you see at 8 and the retrospect of what goes together from that has to do with the repair of cases the operation of the mind and so forth so i can tell you that this fellow is still stuck in having lost the battle of waterloo he was not napoleon he was the cavalry comm ander who ran all of that cava lry into the sunken road so that infantry could march across the top of it or something bodies in there by the ton something like this and you just cant seem to run this damned incident he hes got all these bodies stacked up there just there and so on well one of the ways of freeing the whole thing up is put his rudiments in for that day hell blow he had missed withhold from napoleon this is not procedure not procedure that is advised im just telling you what can happen so that you just getting ruds in then always follow the only proced ure for getting ruds in and there is problems solutions counterproblems what are the postulates squirrel nonsense upset bleeglebloggle yik yik yik to get in ptp and missed withhold or any of those it is always continuously always forever only in standard tech that if it didnt clear you get the earlier similar one now if it didnt clear it was either an earlier similar one or there was false read you dont however ask for another earlier arc break that is real crocky thats askin g the case to whole case to run on arc breaks because you havent said similar so you invite him off to the side panels that youre not trying to clear up you got an earlier arc break well thats really clown thats really clown question really clown because of course hes got an earlier arc break he actually has by actual comp utation enough earlier arc breaks to make the moon astronomical laboratorys computer go crazy it couldnt write the number you can always find an earlier arc break and if you dont know this principle then you will never get the ruds in so what have you got here youve got an earlier similar incident or an earlier similar arc break or you have an earlier similar ptp is there an earlier similar missed withhold alwa ys always same chain same chain pc same chain please earlier please good thank you same chain same chain same chai n earlier please thank you now its either an earlier incident on the same chain or its false read somebody has said he had one when he didnt have and its continued to read so you check for false read or you check for an earlier similar one you dont always check for the false read because that would be damn bore and waste of time thats why standard tech doesnt consis t of rote procedures when you put nickel in the slot then the record arm comes over and goes down zzzzzt and and then the record turns around and plays met huselah comes again you got to know what youre doing so the pc you say do you have an arc break you know do you have an arc break somebodys asking for the exact question by which you ask for an arc break im going to have him write an assortment of questions by which you ask for an arc break as system not to punish him but to show him that the principle of asking for an arc break is what were talking about not the english language the principle the principle you ask some five year old kid for an arc break who never of the term arc break youre liable to get read on misunderstood and then youve had it right you have to know what is this question arc break you have to be able to say upset is there an upset with comm unication you know or an upse t with your affections for people or you got to know what youre doing so you can talk it that isnt driving you off the line of standard tech youre askin g do you have an arc break and it reads and the pc looks at that moment you say has anyone ever said you had an arc break when you didnt yes ah yeah of yeah oh one time one time this auditor still he always asked for an arc break and i couldnt clear this arc break and i used to think scientology didnt work because i could never clear up this arc break and id keep telling him about the arc break and he kept auditing and never and babbaababa wooom boom i just realized that i didnt have an arc break with joe and you say good thank you we will now run grade ii your actual action is your needle is floating thank you very much we will now run ii alright now the pc said ohhh you got read on ptp huh sigh well honest to god its damn near that exaggerated how the hell i have to tell an auditor that it must be false read someplace just testifies that the auditor whos reading this kind of thing doesnt know what the hell it is its an evaluation the question is an evaluation of some time in the past somebody has said you know now the reverse happens but only once in blue moon this is once in blue moon that the reverse can happen well do you have present time problem well thats clean thats funny why well i was sitting here worrying about my wife alright on that question has anything been suppressed oh yeah well ive always had to suppress this problem and so forth its always been terrific worry to ive been suppressin g it for years well good enough alright anything been suppressed thats clean alright do you have presen t time problem people have invalidated the fact that he had present time problem some auditor has actually gone so far as maybe to ball him out for having presen t time problem theres two sides of it and one is eval and one is inval so the eval inval always occurs but it has different workings you have to know eval inval well false read false read now you could actually have situation where have you never had have you ever had noread on this when you did have oh yeah lots of times you can get that reverse situation so the net result of this is is you run it back to an earlier similar similar situation you all of sudden get behind in time the zone or area where he was audited without ruds and the area will now rehab so thats why you always fly needle youve done it now after youve flown the needle on ruds what the hell are you doing trying to fly the needle on ruds if you fly kite youve flown kite if the needle is floating it is floating there isnt anything else you can do that gets it floating but youre on the subject line youre on subject line and you can float needle on any specific zone of action how is it you can fly needle on the three questions of 5a one right after the other getting it broader and broader and broader well theyre on three different primary points of thetan interest but theyre three different points of interest now lets get lets do five s and ds in row i dont care with what question and the pc collapses why its all on the same subject him being suppressed him being suppressed or suppressing somebody its on the subject of suppression and its just like askin g the question has anything been suppressed getting floating needle and then saying good has anything been suppressed now what happens the exact mechanism lets look at the exact mecha nism here has anything been suppressed floating needle now you say what has happened here now hes stopped thinking the thought which has kept him connected to or kept him making up certain mass now hes stopped thinking that thought for moment because hes got it gone or its in view or hes stated it and now you ask the question again you have now told him that he has not thought the thought which disco nnected him so he now goes and looks for thought to think that will disco nnect him and doing that he reconnects himself and the more you do this the higher the ta goes because the more mass he makes up trying to find something to find trying to make something to find something in you got it so this kind of sequence has begun so every time you overrun you put him back in to doing it again because youve invalidated that he has st opped doing it how long will person stay release personll stay release d until such time as he overruns it if you cut the pcs comm what the hell is he gonna do the needle floats hes about to tell you i just remembered i killed my motherinlaw you know something like that and you he said gee i needl floats you say thats it you havent got the end of process phenomena hooked up with the floating needle hooked up with the general thing see and you know what the pc does he says duh dih ok yeah and he goes onto the the next subject but it doesnt float so well and so on and then he goes out and every friend hes got he gets rid of this thought you know funny thing in this session session i just had in there funny thing i i just said id occluded it totally i killed my motherinlaw you know occluded it and hell tell joe and bill and pete and oscar and mazie and so on and so on how often how long do you think this thing is going to stand up its gonna overrun and very quickly because you didnt let him finish the corm cycle but how long is the comm cycle well the comm cycle is as long as its nece ssary to immediately get rid of that exact realization and that is the exact length of the comm cycle and it is not so many inches on an auditors report and how long is that well its just as long as it lists list is list as long as it has the item on it bow long is piece of string piece of string is as long as from the distance from one end to the other end and it is the middle part of the string and that is the length of the string got it well when i see as case supervisor one and one half columns of cognition after the f n i know the auditor has just about as much control over this session as he has of the evolutions of pluto see control control on the session he also has judgment with regard to finish of comm cycle also his meter reading is out also also also also so i i come down on it so the auditor who chops the comm is gonna get the f n overrun right away as soon as the session has ended and the auditor who overruns it has already overrun it and sort of invalidated it and youll see that an auditor can invite itsa one of the ways an auditor invites itsa is to be silent person says my gods i just remembered never remembered it before i never remembered it before i killed my motherinlaw what do you know god thats funny occluded the whole thing yeah i occluded the whole thing ah yeah the auditors sitting there the auditors sitting there now the pc for sure got to explain why this is important why this is cognition so the auditor didnt acknowledge it thats all and he didnt acknowledge it with his face or his voice or any other damn thing see he didnt acknowledge it and so hell get an overrun so when you see column and half after the f n explaining why it is all you know that the auditors trs are out and you look similarly you know when he cuts the pcs comm the pc has got an f n but theres statement well either the auditors admin is out or he laughter so you see the case supervisor knows all the sensitivity to the cycle of action the sensi tivity to the cycle of action now youve got problem then in the administration of the process over and beyond the actual asking of auditing questions youve got the administration and you see the administration before you in the folder and was it really delivered so the case supe rvisor is always operating against the question mark of the auditors trs were the auditors trs good did the auditor actually give good session presence because actually bad auditor session presence can make an apparent gain not be gain the out trs didnt actually end the cycle of action they overran it or under ran it and it may be that the auditor was just too lazy to write it down or the auditor wrote it down falsely or the auditor copied his report afterwards to make it look good or something like that so as case supervisor you always have an unlimited number of very low conditions for any falsification abbreviation or otherwise on an auditing report the falsification or misrepresen tation on an auditing report then beco mes deathly deadly because it denies the case supe rvisor the information neces sary to handle the case and you if you are out there case supervising and you have level grade class ii auditor something like this and this class ii auditor is busy auditing pcs in an hgc youre going to think right away that its absolutely vital that we train him up in the entirety of class viii before we let him audit anybody oh my god he ought to be strangled look how bad it is and you go over to the acade my and you try to get them to teach class viii course and so forth and the guy doesnt even know the name of the subject yet hes got body of information to correct or go through or anything else hes just ignorant so you are very careful about what pcs he audits and youll find out that its quite remarkable the gains he will get and you in your case supervision can guide him right straight back onto the straight and narrow you can you can train him up so he does it now you probably need your nickel in the slot the record reaches over the arm goes over and presses t his needle on and tune runs off but the best thing you do with case like this is yeah as fast as possible you get him on up through and you get him through the whole body of information on class vi course and you push him up through and you get yourself class viii but you cant in actual fact in fortnight make class viii auditors out of all these guys but you sure as hell can make it an awful deadly deadly deadly deadly deadly for him to make any false statement or any alteration on an auditors report and thats the thing which you have to teach him not the class vi ii course you say were very glad to have you auditing in the hgc theres only one thing you should know about auditing in the hgc this is the form of the session this is how session is written down any variation from this or any falsification of session data and so forth and youre hanged otherwise than that were friends this is the high crime this is the high crime around here because that is the one thing that case supe rvisor cant do too much about now he knows it has happened when his pc turns up in review and hes sic k and when he turns up in big ethics order so case supervisor always watches the review requests and the ethics orders then he can judge the quality of the auditing which is being delivered and he can go back and find out those sessions which have been falsely reported now the basis of auditing the basis of auditing is this basic mechanism about the mind the key out the key out he stops making it for now he disco nnects from the being who is maki ng it for now thats release he might think it again or something like that and then hes gonna do it again he wont do it as seriously the bulk of the charge on it has gone so it wont be as serious as before but he can key in so the mecha nism of key out and key in is everything youre handling up to r6ew then he has the cognition that hes maki ng it and then you only have to worry about other things maki ng things and then thats handled on 2 by taking charge off and then on 3 now when he finally gets around to what the think is and how come he does this in the first place and so forth youre in the zone of ot8 ot8 is the total explanation of why how come what s it all about and the beginning of the line is the beginning of the line is that they are not all built the same way some are two peanut whistle some are 44000 horsepower thetans are not all of the same strength and theyre not equal and theyre not all the same being and theres thetans who would really sweat at it to run one foot of grasshopper and other thetans that couldnt possibly scale themsel ves down to leaving the empire state building standing if they leaned on it different sizes for some pecu liar reason what would be more pecu liar is if they were all the sam horsepower and the same size but the net result of all of this is is theyre all pretty strong actually when you get them to straighten out and it begins at the lowest level with the same thing that it ends with at the highest level youre auditing the same being or collection of beings except at the highest level youre starting to audit the dynamics and then you audit it back so that an individual is an individual desp ite the dynamics and so forth the same guy from the bird who comes in to the session and he says to you i dont want to be processed he says it with look and otherwise now thats the thought and what youre trying to do is disconnect that thought so that he can be processed so you audit him very smoothly from there on out and he doesnt think the thought again i dont want to be processed so he goes right on up through the roof very nicely and very smoothly and hes just the same as every other thetan he might have different horsepower and he may have different companions in his skull but he operates the same way and he responds to the same laws and there is difference there is difference there is definitely difference in his reactions and that is the thing basical ly which youre handling the guy is thinking thought which mocks up or hes mocking up something hes mocking up something and thinking thought and when you clip the thing which makes him stop doing that without at the same time stopping him on his own volition that is to say in answ ering the question then at that moment you get floating needle its maki ng him think the right thought to disco nnect very simp thats standard tech and it runs all the way up now you think then there are millions of ways to do that surprise surprise surprise i dont think there are fifty techniques i dont think there are fifty processes fifty would be stating it very largely i havent counted them i havent counted them the processe s are the same all the way from rehab of former states of release to somebody who has never been audited straight on through to ot8 nowh ere along the line is there different technology employed and it doesnt amount to fifty processes it just has different targets the targets shift the processes are differently worded the action is uniform youre doing the same thing all the way you bring him up to point of where he knows he was mocking it up and doesnt mock it up until he mocks it up and says h mocking it up you begin at an unawareness he is totally unaware of the fact that he is mocking it up and you disco nnect him from mockin g it up at that moment and he isnt even aware of that he just knows he feels good and then its just up and up and up until he gets to the clearing course youve brought him up enough stair steps until he beco mes aware of the fact that he is or isnt mockin g it up and this time its the whole bank he says what the hell im mocking the whole thing up huh what do you know alright from that point on he is not really yet aware of the fact that there are other things around mocking it up and not being aware that other things are around mocking it up he can get into many puzzles he sometimes goes out of his head he thinks ill go pick up another body he thinks this he thinks that he thinks something else and hes liable to get into very severe trouble picking up another body because therere all kinds of things being mocked up in that body anywhere he looks somethings going to be mocked up so hes going to get into hell of puzzle unless he goes up through the remaining ot sections and then when he gets clear on up to the top and hes beautiful hes all straightened out boy is he straight wow he can steer it not too well but he can steer it and then he has to handle the the subject of think not mocking up but the subject of think what is he thinking what something happens and he thinks well thats you know its the reactive think that youre handling then but anyhow youll see that when you get to it anyway i just wanted to tell you this is the same band and it goes from the guy who doesnt even want to be audited up to the guy whos as free as bird and uses the empire state building to pick his teeth same set of processes same standard tech and we got it all and therefore i am inviting you kindly persuasively gently ferociously to use it and to understand it and not go off the edge of it into the nevernever land that connects him all up again thank youthe laws of case supervision lecture given on 26 september 1968 and this is the third lecture of the series of the class vi ii course now i give it an english accent because they will be played in england and they dont understand very much in england except english the rest of the lecture will be in ame rican it is the twenty six of september ad 18 and the class viii course marches on i am very very happy tonight very chee rful very chee rful indeed two of the other class viii course suddenly becam auditors suddenly and that is very very good news so apparently one becomes class viii auditor suddenly after great deal of hard struggle after reading very carefully star rating on the basic bulletins and the basic materials after going over this line after getting total total grip on tech so if somebody says the third law of listing you say brrrrp the fifth line of the auditors code brrrrzmp you dont even think you know its right there bong its not let see according to the laws of listing i i wonder if i put down this see i had blowdown what is blowdown i better look up in this bulletin over here and apparently after about three times through the lines and got the material cold and after terrific amount of study on properly done sessions now that is the thing which made the difference and just for the benefit of future students of the class viii course in england and in america the two points which make class viii auditor is total total grip on basic tech and good hard study of well done sessions and proper c s which led to the well done session ant proper grasp of how sessions arent well done and the study of the c s folders on that and the c s folders to which i refer are the c s folders which i did on flag on very long sprint of something on five weeks over 500 c ss now therefore class viii auditor has total grip on tech so that he does not fumble he does not have to think he doesnt have any unfamiliarity and none of the questions which i occasionally get you dont have any questions on the line theyve just got the tech pongo they apply the tech bango and they become class viii suddenly after theyve done all this its almost lousy sessions on tuesd ay fantastic on wednesda and then having become an expert class viii auditor one has the difficulty then of becoming an expert class viii case supervisor the marvelous invitations which the nonsta ndardly run pc offers to the case supervisor to squirrel are unlimited there is an infinity of ways to run case wrong there are less t han four score ways to run it right and any time some auditor misses the missed withhold we just had one guy ran guy had you got an arc break you know asked you got an arc break it didnt read but the fellow says well yes i have about three or four arc breaks and these well im having an awful time of them natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter natter paragraph paragraph paragraph natter natter natter well do you have another arc break read on the meter oh yes ive got lot of other arc breaks and so forth theyre really doing in and so forth aw for the awful way things are running theyre just terrible and the way youre auditing is awful and so on yes i got bunch of arc breaks and the ta goes up and up and up and up and the ta going up doesnt even alert this auditorone of the difficulties i had at saint hill was maki ng bunch of auditors learn that missed withhold is missed withhold and an arc break is an arc break and never the twain shall meet but the guy can pretend to have an arc break when he has missed withhold and if you try to pull an arc break that doesnt exist and fail to pull the missed withhold youre in trouble so theres reverse slip to meter reading not only does the meter falsely read but you dont take up things that the meter doesnt read on unless when you get in suppress it then reads you can always put suppress on rudiment but of course now this is wide open invitation to pianola put nickel in the slop of the juke box type auditing do you have an arc break that doesnt read alright has anything been suppressed good do you have an arc break oh uh it doesnt read do you have presen t time problem doesnt read has anything been suppressed dajata degetee to do gee gee gee boom bull my disgust somebody who asked how do you ask for an arc break i say well now listen the answ er to that question is star rate of every bulletin on the class vi ii course the zeros included why the guys asking questions like that because he hasnt got grasp on the tech do you follow now very often you get asked weird questions that have to do with the persons case hes askin g you do mice jump through hoops well he hasnt differentiated between the basics of life and the pecu liarities which have derived therefrom do you understand so you have to differentiate between what are the basics with which youre dealing and all of the god awful comp lex screaming infinity of balderdash and nonsense that can arise from misco mbination of these alright so we get an unsolvable preclear you go oh obviously completely unsolvable we asked for an arc break and the ta went up so obviously hes an unsolvable preclear if you get pianola auditing you drop nickel in the electric piano the guy cant think basic s so what he wants you to do is to put tape recorder in his head now if i gave you the proper answ er to everything pc ever said it would take you from now till the end of the universe to memorize it all and i wouldnt be bothered writing it but anything pc said is indicative of one of another basics of which there may only be two or three hundred anything good bad or indifferent do you get the difference if youve got your basic s when youve got your basics and youve got grip on these basic s so that and i wonder if its true about the second law of listing psst what are you going to get out of that youve going to get an infinity of doubt and questions and all kinds of complications and pcs are going to become very complicated and theyre going to beco very unsolvable you get the mystery of we asked for the arc break and we clean ed up the arc breaks but he didnt f n so there must be something wrong with standard tech because he didnt clea n up actually the situations completely bonkers what is the symptom of missed withhold missed withhold is the pc nattering bong bang dont think see you dont have to say well lets see i wonder what bulletin covers that and blablabla you know and this he did i remember that in lecture and blaaa did did da do you have missed withhold yes people have been very mean to good whats the missed withhold well people have been awfully mean to whats the missed withhold well i really dont have any missed withhold read read read how do you pull such missed withhold well you gotta know you gotta know that youve got to pull missed withhold dont go any place else and do anything else for gods sakes pull the missed withhold well how do you pull missed withhold well theres ways of exaggerating missed withholds theres i can tell you half dozen ways of pulling the missed withholds what youve gotta know is that you must pull missed withhold now it is either missed withhold or its false read if its false read you clean it up with false reads you follow i mean you have to know how to play this piano now what would you think of piano player who say down to the piano and had to have somebody put his finger on each key and then say press youve got just about as much chan ge of getting rachmaninoffs prelude hell never play it boys hell his musical sound pinks pink pink pink that was yankee doodle pretty good huh an auditing session is piano you play it boy and you play it now and you dont have any time to say i wonder where c is you hear plink in the pc and you go plunk just like that bang bang do you have an arc break read on the meter yeah i have lots of arc breaks theyre awfully mean to in the engine room theyve been shooting down lately and isnt it terrible the way they write up good what s the missed withhold oh hm well if you come down to that i the other day poured eight tons of diesel oil into the bunker fuel tank and havent told anybody good who nearly found out well actually the whole ship the people have been sort of looking at since good thank you very much thank you very much do you have missed withhold thats clean good do you have an arc break thats good thats fine now presen t time problem alright any overts well it reads oh i dont know i alright has anybody ever told you while they were auditing you that you had comm itted overts you hadnt committed oh yes as matter of fact i was doing this sec check and somebody said he turned on rock slam and then he found out the meter was disconnected and so forth and it was very upsetting but id keep getting this read on overts and so on good alright that was false read at that particular time good do you have an overt well thats clean your needle is floating thank you well now proceed to rehab and you think ive been short handing it but thats about how long it takes wi th these difficult cases there are difficult cases with standard tech there arent any well this pc was given reviews for two and half years in spokane and the ta three years ago went up to six and half and its been there ever since and at various places they mislisted the list and the number of errors found in the auditing sum mary are 119 auditing flubs well is the case h opeless case supervision do l4a to f n brrrrmp bong thump bang ta down bzzt bong thats it and the reason why they dont resolve is because the auditors sitting there gee i wonder what chart what hcob that was in lets see it was on tape i think it was on tape and something or other that the high ta shows an incidence of i think it was i think it shows medical background let see what does high ta show umm has place at class viii if you have to think in order to know basic fundamental data youre not viii and youre not going to get sessions they wont fly for you boy they wont fly the way you fly pc and the way you fly needles is you know it now now somebodyll write bunch of balderdash today i never insult students questions thats perfectly alright ask all the questions you please but i dont guarantee not to bring them up all the questions i get are simp ly divergences from standard tech the guy hasnt read the bulletins you know he hasnt read it he doesnt understand it if he did he wouldnt be asking questions like this its all there there arent any questions left to ask he asked whether or not you list service facsimile to the first blowdown or the second blowdown or to what you do oh brothers please any listing is covered by the laws of listings the laws of listing have variables there are variables in the laws of listing you always list that way there isnt any other way to list than the laws of listing there are other ways to list period full stop it just happens accidentally that in 5a you were hitting on the three primary points of thetans case and it just so happens that the first blowdown is invariably the item it happens on those three questions because they are questions which are dead on it so happens that those three questions are dead on they will inevitably be what you cant trust when youre case supervising is that the auditor caught the item that it did blow down on and when power goes wrong when 5a goes wrong it blew down on item one and he marked it as blowing down on item two so when power apparently goes wrong and the guy comes back and so on you get the list checked and now it follows the full laws of listing you may have to add to the list you may have to suppress it you may have to look for this and that and the other thing it just so happens that an expert who doesnt get blowing downs on the wrong item inevitably and invariably finds that the items the first item that blew down on the list because of the three key things about the list and that is why its called power plus those three listing questions 1b 1c and id are just dead center on case and he doesnt get several blowdowns hell only get that one i saw power 5a list on student the other day that about fried my hair he got blowdown and then went for whole column what was he doing why why why did he have to list he had blowdown he wrote it down himself with his own little pencil so would somebody please tell please tell my why anybody under the sun moon and stars would continue list beyond the first blowdown when it says in power plus in so many words that you it is the first blowdown period well who the hell thought there was whole bunch whole bunch of nonsense variables on this particular line the number of variables are zero in standard tech so the invariability of standard tech is an invariable variable and whenever you think you have variable on your hands you have done something or something has been done which departed from standard tech which now makes variable possib now let show you now the great invitation the great invitation pc who is different is complete invitation to the auditor and the case supervisor to do something screwy and the only mistakes the only only only mistakes you are going to make is accepting the invitation offered by the different case and then youre going to make mistakes there arent any different casesyou go back down the line and you look there over former reviews this very resistant pc oh very difficult and there you see the blowdown on missed withhold only it was never pulled and there you see it in another session missed withhold r s but nobody ever pulled it and eventually this keeps up just that long and you suddenly get different pc doesnt matter much what you run on him its always something he doesnt respond he isnt he isnt responding to standard tech oh oh and clever case supervisor goes back and finds out where standard tech was violated and picks the case up at that point the formula of case supe rvision is to go back to find where the case was running well and come forward of that looking for violation of standard tech and if they are too many to refuse to get in fire fight correcting the corrections repairing the repairs you can do this soyou can actually make up list of ive seen list of two solid type written pages single spaced of items wrong from the last time the case was running well and the case supervisor on this particular instance was advocating correcting every single one of those errors it would have been job that would have taken from now till halifax ive forgotten exactly what the instructions were i think it was something like do l4a to f n and do the next grade and they did l4a to an f n and the person made the next grade and is flying now it doesnt mean then that because case has been goofed upits quite tribute to scientology that it has gone forward to the degree of goof that it has been goofed the violations of standard tech its quite marvelous its just that you get about 200 times the result with standard tech yes go back over it so youve only got you got three sessions you got three review sessions something like that and each one has got mislisted list in it well correct it very easy to do three misl isted lists go back and find the right item on each list only takes about five minutes took something i mean per list took somebody else two or three hours or couple of intensives to make the list wrongly in the first place but go back correct them give him his right items give him his right items come up the line hes probably only stuck in one of these lists but youll catch that one but just little handful of lists well go ahead and correct them 5a if somebody falls on his head after 5a its usua lly its usually that something was very out and you had false auditors report in that he didnt give the pc the items that really blew down another item blew down or something of this sort or the pcs comm was violently cut you know something on the order of this trick somebody is so screamingly anxious about the f n that he doesnt let the pc finish his cognition like say oh seattle yeah he was going to say seattle yeah yeah yeah thats the place yeah yeah yeah christ what dumpy you know or what wonderful town something you know and the auditor saw that needle fly and he didnt realize there was comm lag between the needle which is just below the level of the pcs reality and the pcs cognition so the needle flew and he says thats it put down the cans good thank you thank thats woah you know wooh wooh were supposed to do all this very fast now then you dont see this as the case supervisor very often you can detect it to some degree but you dont see it really its not there in your view so the pc falls on his head after the session well something happened to his comm so you just correct that session very simple now you can correct the session by askin g for this or asking for that but theres only one thing that can be wrongtwo things i mean that can be wrong it is either cut comm or wrong item so your standard case supervisor on something action like this it comes to you as somebody who has just been run on 5a now has headach and hes going around the review as for headach or he gets himself an ethics record or something of that character and so he goes around case supervisor hes just had 5a now along with your accuracy along with your accuracy in the field of basic s must go confidence in the gains of tech and you cant go around saying well its not working out and it didnt work anyway and yeah yeb yee doo explain explain reasonable reasonable reasonable and probably 5a didnt work on this pc and 5a wouldve worked on the pc unless something happened so the pc by auditors report apparently ran ok but the pc few days couple of weeks later gets himself condition of liability from oprey and doprey or some other charge its the business of the case supervisor at that moment to pick up this pc something is wrong with power well the proper action is ruds or green form to f n if it didnt f n on the ruds you go ahead and run the green form to an f n and rehab power so the guy will check it chec k it and then when you get to the check of 5a you null the list you dont just say was that your item thats corny you null list this time because the probability is that the thing that blew down was n ot the thing he said so you null list meticulously and if the list now seems to be too short or something of that sort well you add to it and you repair it just the way you would repair an ordinary normal list because there is something wrong with the auditing report so the guy goes down and he repairs the list and so forth and its very unwise to get the auditor who ran the power to correct the power because you will get some kind of an action like this you know well i gave him the right item in the first place is mary jane your item yeah it was wasn t it yeah oh good thank you i thought it was there was just that little bit of criticism do you see thats why people when they fall on their heads go to qual not back to the hgc so the list is nulled and you normally will find out that it was his item but comm was cut or its marked as bd on the wrong item or for some pecu liar reason it didnt bd at all and the pc was thinking about the listing question or something and got latent bd and didnt get the thing even thought he said mam papa uncle george he wasn t thinking about that he was thinking about people ive known god you know wow you know wow you know people ive known and we had somebody the other day bless her who didnt like to put bad people on list and the list in actual fact apparently blew down on somebody she thought of but not the person she put down on the list she was editing the list as she listed tricky huh tricky in that case on this list has anything you know youre not get the question reading items dont read on the list on this list question budupupupow has anything been suppressed pow what does that pwoon and then you get something like well i dont like to put bad names on list you see your variabilitys of what the pcs response is you get this real straight the variability of what the pcs response is hasnt anything to do with the standardness of the tech my god they will give you eighteen billion variations for every single solid piece of standard tech never q and with this amount of variation do you follow they act to standard tech directly but they give you such v ariable answe rs ill give you an idea do you have present time problem that read yeah well i hm presen t time problem alright is that false read you know read there anybody insist you had problem you never had you know hm alright good have you had problem auditors didnt find well yes reads good i was just thinking here ive never been audited without problems ive never been audited without problem ill always have problem the business im in jiminygod f n thank you very much you dont ask the next rud question of course because it f ned on ruds now you get down to doing what youre supposed to be doing well thats variable answe r youre going to get look there can be an infinity of wrongnesses abso lute infinity there can be an infinity of sillinesses there can be an infinity of mistakes getting somebody to study mistakes only hes always gonna run into new mistake just think of the hottentot repairing the radio or the egyptian repairing the radio now how many mistakes cou ld he make its an infinity now lets take lets take bunch of green red and blue chips of various sizes nd shap and lets throw them down and just scramble them up and throw them down on black table and every time you do this youre going to get brand new pattern and some of them are going to be good and some are going to be bad and so you say look at the variation in which life is steeped the hell it is theres variation here youre taking bunch of chips and throwing them on black table and that bunch of random items thrown down randomly will give you random answ er thats the law back of that whats the variability crunch there is variability do you follow so there sits the auditor and hes got to have his tech solid proper question at all because hes sitting there talking to pc whos got 18765000 variables per square minute but theyre all varying on his exact basic principles what youve got to understand is youre sitting there with stable datum which hes running the locks of see youre just watching these locks now if you dont know your tech you think these locks are the stable data theres nothing more horrible to happen to an auditor than to run squirrel process and get win its fatal because hell now go down the street and get the next pc only the next pc didnt resolve on it and i have actually seen some guy try for years to get another win on the same process now the horrible part of it is is the guy in actual fact probably didnt get win on the process he continues to try he got win on something else pc all of sudden cognited hes saying hes saying how many motherin laws are there on the head of pin or something some wise process see and he says this how many motherinlaws are there on head of pin see and the pc says oh gee thats good question its truly i feel wonderful thank you f n now the auditor not knowing his basics he thinks christy thats quite process well that wasnt the process the pc went f n on it was somebody who was willing to talk to as degraded bum as that somebody was actually willing to sit down and ask him question as though he amounted to something and he cognited on this and went f n you get the idea the auditor goes around with this squirrel process thinking and so on there are five or six brands of processes immediately jumped up and leaped into view around elizabeth new jersey one or two of them became very very famous and so on they were in actual fact questions which i had asked particular pc to pursue his particular problem and were based on the standard datum that pc makes mental image picture which then pushes him pushes his anch or points in and all i was doing was askin g questions what would get the guy to look and these questions seem ed terribly variable and they seemed so wise that they becam processes one of them becam whole line of therapy well you think this over well the guy who was watching ask the questions of the pc certainly didnt understand what the hell i was doing if hed understood what i was doing why he was i was trying to get the guy to look at the picture he was stuck in any question i asked was simp ly to get the guy to do that do you follow so the standard action there was simp ly well lets get the guy to look at his pictures and and blow few locks that was all that was all but they appeared to be very wise and so forth you see they had variables guys could actually go out and say golly you ask the person this marvelous question this marvelous question and so forth like what time was it that would add to something but whoever applied the process thought that i was askin g about clock or something you know what time of the day was it at the time that this thing happened and so forth and you know get big variable on the line and then that could get all variabled up in some other way in other words these things squirrel up because the individual does not understand the basic from which the question stems do you understand that he hasnt got the principle from which the whole thing is advancing hes not running from basic data so not running from basic data of course he makes fantastic number of mistakes and then sooner of later if he squirrels and doesnt do standard tech he will sooner or later start getting loses on pcs and then he sort of considers it an overt and then he is apt to borrow some of their ideas of supervariability and if he didnt know standard tech in the first place he will for sure depart from what little standard tech he had so an auditor auditing standard tech owes himself hundred percent wins and hell get them hell get them theres monkey business bout it now the state of the pc is not what the auditor says its what the pcs state is what is wrong with the pc is what is wrong with the pc not what the auditor evaluates is wrong with the pc these are all little basic laws it isnt the auditors opinion that makes the pc sick so you read lot of amateur c ses they really are howl you you at this stage of the game youve got this ahead of you but youll start laughing at yourself after while at the tremendous opinion that you start forming of this that and the other thing and how complex these opinions are and how much figure you invest into the whole thing and you read my c ses along this line and they seem to dispose of the most complex things with the simp lest actions you ever heard of so that therefore because the pc is so comp lex and the solution so simp therefore there must be something you missed you get the idea so there must be something more in this folderbut what youre looking at is the fact that we have the basic data of life these are the rules and laws that life lives and thats all you apply em and of course any life responds to it if you could talk to spider hed go ot so this this is what this is whats required of class viii auditor he has grip on tech the like of which nobody ever heard of you ought to be able to rattle off the auditors code bbbrrrrrrr boom but not just rattle it off pc comes in to session feels little dopey you dont think twice you say have you had enough sleep see you dont have to think about this you know that pc comes in feels for the chair and sits down yawn and you think immediately of the auditors code you had enough sleep well good go get yourself some sleep and well audit you when youre good and rested thank you not let see let see this is the this is three quarters of the way through the session let see i wonder what could be wrong with this pc he doesnt seem to be able to stay awak in the session is this dopeoff boil off figure figure figure figure figure figure figure now the alertness to these things is terrific i noticed used to notice that i would catch when we were doing long intensives and that sort of thing i could catch an arc break by the actual clock an hour and forty five minutes before the hgc auditor that was the lag hour and forty five minutes before the auditor noticed the pc was arc broken because the pc would get more and more and more and more arc broke throughout that hour but i could pick up the original arc break see and id say alright theres one and actually have clocked it and at that time i had squawk box systems where i could listen to every session dont you see so i had lot of opportunity to do this the auditor would miss on his comm cycle and the pc would say or do something at that moment that was the beginning of an arc break that somew here up the line in the next hour or two was going to explode in the auditors face and what always amazed was is the auditor would sit there and wait for it to explode in his face certainly the pc must have looked strained certainly the pcs voice must have gotten tighter certainly the needle must have been not responding properly the ta vanished out of the session the skin tone of the pc went bad the auditor wasnt getting anyplace with the process do you get it it took him long time to add up all these figures see well if youre redhot you recognize them in the first split half second see now the way you do it it isnt that you have to be quick its that you have to know what youre doing violation of comm cycle is liable to end up in an arc break now rather than go to all the labor of having to recognize it just dont violate the comm cycle thats the best answ er to that just deliver flawless session and flawless session on communication is communication with the pc not communication with your instructor in trs do birds fly thank you the trs are just there to let you get up to point of where your grip on the trs are such that you simp ly apply the trs brrrrooooom boom boom boom boom you can talk that way you dont have to think about it it isnt wooden its very natural and when youve got the trs down pat why at that particular time bang bang bang they just run off pat thats all you can always tell brand new student hes trying to do his tr0 and his tr1 at the same time and it all shows up in his tone of voice and he hasnt got any more auditor presence than rabbit you just drill it up to point of where this comes natural thats all poomp pc originates handle the origination bong nothing to it so when it comes to adding and summating and looking up whats the difference between class viii auditor and lower class auditor class viii auditor knows his basics so well that he is never led into trap by pc he never comm lags as to what is going wrong he knows he doesnt have to correct his comm cycle errors they dont occur he doesnt have to patch up cases cause they werent misrun in the first place he doesnt have to repair the case supervision which he did on tuesd ay because it was correct and he has enough ethics presence when he is case supervising that an auditor who would do something else comes in with rather pale complexion if not bright green the auditor would be the first one to tell you he had goofed ethics presence is sufficient so he wouldnt try to hide goof boy so class viii does it right in the first place and can repair what other people have done wrong he himse lf in his auditing invariably does it right in the first place in his case supervisoring he does it right in the first place the cases he has to repair are the cases that have been done wrong by somebody else get the difference now i dont want to intimidate you or give you bad idea of what youve got to do but the only thing were demanding is 100 perfection 100 grip on the data 100 drill so that it just bong lead pipe cinch 100 result and that depends on 100 grasp of the data and 100 application of it and you get 100 results just like that bong you cant have 50 grasp on the data and get 100 results the percentages would be quite incorrect right now class viii is very fast it is fast fast fast fast i received note here from joe ship captain and it said during last nights lecture i got the first inclination of what standard tech is its the difference between cold war and blitzkrieg its not just better way of winning the cold war its calculated assault with calculated victory you dont go around when youre first studying and when youre first doing class viii type of auditing you may have some question about what the outcome of the session will be you might have some question but after youve been at it very short time theres question itd be matter of the wildest surprise if something weird happened in the session that made it go adrift or it didnt come out right at the end maybe one session in 75 or something like this might go adrift something outside your zone of control suddenly moves in on it in some fashion you might find yourself auditing some pc who has rather miserable auditing career and it may take you couple of sessions before you bring it up the line but your confidence is such that you know its going to come up the line through hell or high water its going to come right somehow to give you an idea my case supe rvision was running at about i suppose about 90 at first 90 little flubs of application and that sort of thing were pushing it astray and i myself in handling it was handling cases that had really been goofed boy theyd really been goofed and it moved up to about 95 and it moved up to about 99 its riding along quite handsomely now at 100 pocketa pocketa pocketa pocketa now the only place that it is comi ng adrift is that there are some student auditors on my lines and that doesnt make not handle the case what it makes is i have to case supervise it again not to chan ge it but to tell them what to do to correct it so they can finish my c s see thats the reason they goof and then i make them correct it so they can finish my original c s and that may happen time on the case once or twice or something and then the c s is done it all com out alright and bongo your neck is always out when you have an inexperience d auditor auditing for you in the first place he gives you false reports and he gives you false reports unknowingly and unwittingly he doesnt have clue whats going on so he doesnt tell you whats going on the case supervisor who believes an auditors summary is fool hes just fool thats all they have some use you continue to ask for them because it picks up the auditor observation and it can give you the auditors attitude toward the pc and what the auditor thought happened so they have value but you dont take it up as case supervisor theres action on your part for case supervisor got nothing to do with your case supervision beyond giving you the auditors attitude toward the pc and what the auditor thought happened in the session you find out what happened in the session by reading the auditors report and if theres any variation in that auditors report from what should have happened you know very well that the pc didnt come out alright in the end whether the summary report said that he did or didnt it had nothing to do with it and if theres goof on that line that you as case supervisor can catch as you go through the session as you read through the auditors report saying the pc came out alright has nothing to do with it the truth of the matter is youll find the pc is back in review goof in the session pc winds up in review or in ethics case supe rvisor you watch your ethics and review file comp ared to your cases which makes it very rat tat tat indeed theres nothing much to it in other words the auditor who ran standard tech produced the standard result or the case winds up in review or winds up in ethics thats the case supe rvisors point of view reversely the case that winds up in review again and the case that winds up in ethics was not standardly audited matter what the auditors report said something is wrong in that auditors report the auditor did not report something now youve got to do something to find out the data whether or not its to send it to the examiner or so on you you youre gonna find out more data case supervision consists of the comp lete folder turned in to you with the examiners note in it you dont ever talk to the auditor you dont ever talk to the pc you never talk to the auditor you never talk to the pc you never case supervise without the whole folder in front of you laws boy those are laws theyre in concr ete never talk to the auditor never talk to the pc never case supe rvise without the whole folder in front of you those are the basic laws of case supervision and the only mistakes ive ever made on it but boy im talking from history ive case supervised more damn cases than you can shake stick at and the only mistakes i have ever made is when i talked to the auditor or talked to the pc or case supervised without the folder in front of and those are the only times ive ever made mistake quite marvelous and so if you dont disobey those rules you will be bear cat as case supervisor providing you are class vi ii and know your data so the guy ran in to hell of mess in the session he was trying to do the case supervision and he ran in to hell of mess in the session his proper action is to close the session how ever gracefully he can not have the pc sitting there waiting close the session thats it and so on with continuation of the session mentioned he just gradually says is there anything you would care to say before were closing down this session and he ends the session he makes out his report he takes his folder in hands it on normal lines it winds up in the hands of the case supervisor who in moment of dispassi on reads the auditors report now the auditor was also expected when he handed in his folder to have included summ ary report and then it is administered and the whole folder is inspected to see what is going on here and then the action is taken that needs to be taken written down that needs to be taken with the case it is put in writing in separate shee t not scribbled across the corner of some green form its on separate shee t of paper of which the case supervisor keeps carbon copy and he writes down whats supposed to happen now if he doesnt know and he cant figure it out he sends the folder back with request that the pc appear before the examiner and when he gets the folder back then he has at least the comments and condition of the pc that the pc says not just the auditors side of it now he can do something about this and then what he does about this is so standard that it couldnt be knocked over with an abomb he accepts invitations to squirrel the auditors going to give him some because you will be supervising auditors who are level 0 or something hell have vast ideas of what he ought to do about this boy now you write something down and he doesnt think he can do this or something like that he doesnt change this as he goes in to session oh he just says that is it he doesnt go near the pc he has the pc informed that the session is suspe nded for the moment and he sends the folder back and says my reputation is at stake i either cant do or i dont understand or i dont agree with this c s cause after all im the guy thats going to be hanged if the pc comes out wrong im going to be hanged maybe youre going to be hanged but im for sure going to be hanged so therefore i cant do it doesnt com pare to the case now that would be big invitation for the auditor to have talk with the case supervisor to violates one of the first principles cause the auditors now gotta say why if he cant do these processe s then he had business auditing the case so you simply get another auditor if he says this isnt the right c s then hes gotta have some reason why it isnt the right c s and maybe he will disclose some new data that he before has not bothered to put down such as the reason he cant run the cchs is because the person is complete paralytic and is there lying on stretcher and that is case supe rvision how she is done and the end product of all of this is standard tech standard results and pocketa pocketa pocketa now the way to waste time is to try to save time by spee ding up the admin lines any time you supersp eed the case supervision auditor hgc admin lines any time you put crush on these lines it will add to the time spen t lets get it all done and crush through in the next hour because the pc has to catch place for hoboken and lets get it in and big invitation to go in and see the case supervisor to find out exactly what hes supposed to do about the whole thing i can assure you boy you are now going to waste about session time money mise ry failures pfft you save the time in an auditing session in an auditing session you save your time it is so damned fast it happens so quick the auditing is so swift when it is done right that you could poke around for weeks with admin time now the only time you would run in on fast administration would be an assist at an injury somebody just got through dropping the body and youre going to tell him to get back in his head and take over control of the body thats responsibility of any auditor rendering proper assist putting tourniquet on the guy something like that see an assist level action well thats not in the realm and remedy of of auditing unless it itself is done wrong because an assist can fail ill have to tell you about assists because i find out theres very little information on them but your admin time you dont save time by saving the admin time you waste time by saving the admin time one rapidly done session which is expert and right on the button is worth hundred hours of old time auditing any day of the week furthermore the case that is set up that its all correct and you fire him right now boy he is in session about twenty minutes zoooooml and if you didnt set him up properly he will be in session and then be in review and be back on your lines and then hell be back over there and then hell go to the examiner and then he goes to ethics and then theyve got the hearing and then theres auditors and so on and some condition has to be assigned to him and then he goes back and then he has to correct the correction now so therefore the correction has to be and that is long arduous proceeding and they have to do various things and you get it so the essence of this is its the responsibility of the case supervisor to set the case up and to set the auditor up so it goes brroooooom now if its only going to take half an hour an hour and half or something like that to handle this case what the hell are you trying to do to save twenty minutes on the administrative lines matter of fact if theres any crush on these administrative lines the pcs in an awful rush in order to get fixed up in order to get swafff aff aff aff i myself would say well you tell the pc ive sent note to the examiner who is also the case supervisors relay to the pc is always the examiner not the auditor you dont say to the auditor tell the pc auditors not relay terminal for the case supervisor in that way you write note to the examiner and you say dear examiner we know the pc has to make his plane at 4 00 tell him to postpone his flight until next week signed case supervisor got it and if anybody is in such hell of rush that hes he has more importance in living than in being correctly audited i can tell you he aint going to live long he who spendeth his time convincing people how important it is will spen d lot of his time in review just by the nature of things yes this fellow really has to be handled because hes entering college in fall and fall happens to be yesterday and he was due at the college and so forth and hes got to get it handled so that he can do his entrance examinations and so forth anybody saw anything like this on an examiner line the examiner should write all that down you understand anytime i saw an examiners report like that and hes got to be audited yesterday who dee dee dee do do do do eh well lets see what organization was this man last audited in lets see lets get that answ ered what organization there isnt very much folder here alright good the answ er comes back hudson bay post 62 had his power and 5a so you say good well you tell him you tell him to make deposit with the registrar and make an appointment because weve got to get his folder here and that comes in by dog team and the other day just to give you an example somebody got in hell of hurry while i was gone on trip here these little things happen somebody got in an awful hurry somebody got in great hurry and they had to repair this guys power had to repair his 5a and the folders were at saint hill and saint hill is considerable distance away and so they relisted 5a they didnt have the original list so it was relisted not on my say so god forbid and i picked this up in this short term when i was absen t and i said well and i think you may run across the case supervision of it well we dont know it says this is pretty adventurous to relist 5a or try to correct it in the abse nce of the folder and the list pretty adventurous some such thing and i didnt bother to file it because my certainty on standard tech knew the guy was going to fall on his head within the next week sure enough here comes in one from the examiner pc says he has bad headache naturally somebody doublelisted 5a christ how dumb can you get but you see they did this because it would take maybe couple of weeks to get his folder down here you see effort to save time on the admin line then winds up in an adventurous emergency action well auditing doesnt run like ambulance chasing true enough you can let case go and go and go and itll eventually fall apart now im at the same time not advocating that you just dont audit anybody for couple of weeks while you go fishing but any time you find yourself spee ding it all up and having to do it in two seconds and therefore having to do it not thoroughly or having to actually call for the auditor to ask him the thing because youve really got to get this thing case supervised because the fellow is big joe from someplace and hes got the be audited tomorrow and you dont have the data bahl youre setting it up to fall on its head the essence is you point him in the right direction and you fire him and he goes so fast when he is correctly aimed and fired and he goes so slow and it is so horrible when he isnt that any time you save by extraordinary actions on the administrative line is going to be lost by having the folder back and having it back and doing it some more and having it back again and doing it some more so the essence of the essence of standard tech is you know your data cold you know exactly what youre doing you make sure that the d of t has got that d of t trains those auditors so they just go boom boom boom you see youre going to have to do pianola training at this moment you say thin thun you know and youve got that d of p so arranged that that d of p he is just going to go over that case supervision with the auditor now its this an its this and its this now you go in and you get in the rudiments and mmmwma and thats what is says and then you so on and so on and this is very rough pc and he very often gives auditors bad time so you want to go in friendly everything get him set down tell him what you want to do and then give him this and tell him that and so forth now we got it all set and its something like setting up rocket dont you see and then the auditor goes in hes got it all set up he strikes the match on the seat of the pants and lights the fuse got it and the guy goes whhhhooooommmn see pc exits laughing now ill give you the other approach case supervisor he doesnt know uh this pc has long history of having been on the police force therefore he had great many overts uh lets see i think what we had better do is run joberg in order to handle this situation and uh then if we get joberg done um so on well just to make real sure we will run grade ii before we run arc straightwire and thatll thatll fix it up because then well also catch his overts yeah thats the way well do this case yes yes thats good alright and he sends it in pc comes into session the auditor hes got the case supervision but the d of p hasnt gone over it with him or anything like that and the auditor goes into session and goes wha t the hell is this joberg joberg lets see ok ok joberg i havent got form here where the hells the forms here joberg i think i dont know where the wheres the wheres the joberg what the hell is joberg oh i remember what it was i remember what it was uh yeah well i can i can do that i can do that right off the cuff see so he gets the pc in session he says alright tell about your sex life and pc comes into session already with his tone arm at 45 see tell about your sex life alright very good yeah youve had lot of sexual overts have you alright now lets check these things out and so forth you every stole anything robbed anybody and so on of course youve robbed somebody we know that now lets see alright sessi on comes back ta 5 oh well i must have goofed that one this pc must have some im pretty sure this pc must have robbed bank yeah thats what well do well put it down here see if the pc has robbed bank and then run the cchs except specialize in cchs because he says somebody was glad hander in the last session and he sends it back and the auditor says well i i cch1 to hell i dont remember what that thing is oh alright um ta at 5 and he says well how does auditing seem to you now good how does it seem to you now good thank you how does it seem to you now good how does it seem to you now alright good how does it seem to you now oh lets see what question was i on yes pcs ta at 65 ran cch1 without any results kidding ive actually case supervised almost under those conditions where it didnt matter much what the d of p said the auditor did something else anyhow but to be agreeable why he put it on the report form that he did it or hed tell the d of p and then usua lly the case supe rvision was tearing into the office and maki ng couple of sharp comments and then going off and not doing what the guy said anyhow now you wonder what the hell goes on well in that much confusion scientology still increased its stats still went up the line people still did recover from things and miraculous things occurred marvelous abso lutely marvelous attestation but those sessions could go on for week after week year after year and grind out one way or the other and get someplace and somehow which is alright even without bad supervision even with the auditor actually knowing what the processes were running the processes too long doing this and that and the other thing running pcs not set up session without ruds and that sort of thing people still got hell of lot of result now when we find out exactly what are the additives off the line and you pull those off the line and you get this new line of think case supervisor says brrrmmmnp and zzzzpdpp and zippp d of t takes it up with the auditor makes sure that he knows how to do it pc comes in to session the pc has had rest the pc has been fed the pc is ok all is alrightf and we got it and the auditor strikes match on the seat of his pants and lights the fuse and booms there was two years of old auditing just went by in those twelve minutes got it and man pcll hold onto those gains just as hard as they are accurately delivered so you got your hands full of handful of miracle it happens so fast people will very often say it looks too simple yawn say thats what lindberg said or something like that you know its too simple yes it is terribly simp and when you have done your dianetics course your academy course class vi and beco class vii and then had your class viii course couple of years from now and so forth you will be able to do it that simply too funny part of it is you can take an acad emy auditor and you can teach him to say i see cat sit down at the meter and say i see cat and dont say anything else to the pc and then when youve said i see cat then when the pc answe rs that question you watch this and youre watc hing for that needle to go woof if the needle didnt do that you close the session you make your auditors report and you send it back to and if you say another god damn word boy hm hm hm right now i want to stay in arc with you lets have this all on beautiful even plane of arc so i dont have to bust your teeth in to shut you up in session now i trust you completely thats why we have this squa wk box your auditing room is bugged your sessions are patrolled we have utter trust complete trust say anything you please in session as long as you say exactly what i tell you to say and not another damn thing and you will be able to do it actually with level 0s what you would do actually is clear one rudiment at time one rudiment per session it isnt worth while to do anything else now class viii you turn him loose with whole session see well put the rudiments in this morning and then if the needle is still flying this afternoon you can go to the body of the session but youll have to send the case sup ervisor folder first this pc could very often be in the org for two weeks having received three sessions or having received five sessions each one of which was only five minutes long and the funny part of it is he would fly like bird do you see now the length of the case supervision then is proportional to the class of the auditor who is doing the auditing so i can say to sea org class viii now do the usual rundown for ot section 4 lrh and he goes and does it hell of complex damn thing its fly the needle on ruds or go to green form and fly the needle on it when you got that done get earlier rehabs practices whatever you got to do get that cleaned up make sure that rehabs rehab arc straightwire secondaries engrams now zero one two three four rehab or run if they dont rehab you do something with them to set them up skip power you never rehab power in clear rehab r6ew rehab ot1 rehab clearing course and ot1 ot2 prepsheck 3 do valence shifter and run confront and that is section 4 ot complete done by class viii and the total lapse d time that it takes to do that is variable i havent been reading the section times i dont know hour or two at the absolute outside but if all of sudden he cant do one of these items or one of these actions doesnt work or so forth even so he would be expected to pack the session up at that moment pack it up close it off and send it back for additional c s he has hit bug he doesnt try to sit there and solve this bug hes running standard tech and theres something in the road of it now the guy tried to rehab arc straightwire and it wasnt about to rehab and he checked over to see if it had been run and it apparently has been run if its been run it wont rehab and the ta rose on it he could assume maybe it was too many times rehabbed or something or something but he for sure had better send it back to the case supe rvisor something went adrift and the case supervisorll look it over look over his session and find probably the bug that he didnt see or we may be dealing with spook and before this time we have had somebody who was an ot2 who hadnt ever been audited on arc straightwire that hadnt ever been audited on engrams secondaries engrams ot1 2 3 4 never had his service fac run hed been run on some version or another of power and somehow or another had fumble bumbled and false attested his way at r6ew and fumble bumbled and attested his way falsely at this and had told people that he was in actual fact class vi auditor when hed never seen the inside of an acade my how would you like that sitting in front of you as hell of withhold it isnt likely anything would either run or rehab but itd certainly measu re as withhold but something like that so we could do an assessme nt on the thing and wed see all of sudden the pc has never been clean on withholds there was read there of some kind or another but it wasnt picked up something must be suppressed so the case supervisor would recheck and itd all fall out in the wash where the case doesnt run standard where the case doesnt run standard theres lie because the totality of ot is the totality of truth and the number of lies which person has on the line is direct index of his case state so youll get the lower level cases they lie like hell all the time anyhow so something has got out of line and we have to find what it is anyway regardless of that im just giving you some of the limitations some of the actions and the exact precision with which you do case supervision and youre going to think that you figure figure figure lot on case supervision you dont figure figure figure lot on case supervision you just know your standard tech better than any auditor you have auditing for you even though theyre class viiis and you always know your tech perfectly and you never get invited into the culdesa c of running some unusual squirrel action because the auditors report seems to indicate that the case is different than all other cases there are different cases now when you can do it as case supervisor youre not even looking at the pc youre that remote and the invitations are terrific because the auditing is being done and recorded and reported to you out of your sight so there in all other places youve got to hold the grip on standard tech but to do it at all youve got to know your tech cold cold as ice this is standard tech this is viii viii in its auditing is one thing in its case supe rvision is another when youre good auditor you can case supervise when you cant audit you can t case pervise thats for sure ok i trust few of these succinct remarks will be of some value to you in future days thank you very much standard tech define d lecture given on 27 september 1968 and this the last time i looked was the twenty seventh thank you very much thank you very polite of youthe last time i looked this was the twenty seventh of september ad eighteen and this is lecture what number four what do you know lecture four the reason im numbering these is so that nobody can come along and cut them all out probably the expect it some years from now that somebody will have figured it all out it would be much better if we had the lectures on case supervision taken out because if auditors are allowed insufficient latitude for their own imagination it cramps self determinism ruins cases but it cram ps self determinism and you can expect sometime in the future that the thing is not well it actually isnt good thing the case supe rvisor he actually has to have latitude when were getting you see and the auditor should have tremendous latitude because itll give him too many case gains and stuff like that you know qual income is down ever since we started this standard tech qual income has gone out the bottom so the best thing to do is to subtract lecture three seven and nine dont you see from the lectures you know many ways of subtracting them such as simp ly tearing them up but somebody would at least know something was missin g now we have something of that order coming up on your bulletins the truth of the matter is is im going over bulletins at this particular time so that all bulletins as you see then as of this moment are in actual fact being edited down into standard tech package but that doesnt change anything and if anything is in any way chan ged it will be to the basis of bringing it to an earlier standardization and it will simply be correction of some out line we apparently have forty or fifty bulletins in the line up which have been written by other people than myse lf and these occasionally contain errors the bulletins which youve got are not in this category i am sure but to give you some sort of an idea of it we in actual fact had there have been two changes in the standard processes both chan ges to the original i didnt theyd been chan ged one of those are the commands of arc straightwire which are being issued to you directly and immediately and the original commands of arc straightwire are those commands which crack neurotic cases and somebody with some enthusiasm along the line someplace cut off the last half of the command in each case but thats real case cracker the way it is originally recall something that is really real to you is the proper command and its never been otherwise but people with enthusiasms edit this material and every time it has been edited the material and workability has to marked degree been lost all of the listing tapes although there were lots of tapes called listing tapes on the saint hill course all of the key listing tapes and the key listing bulletins were removed from the saint hill course during the last two or three years and thats why you guys dont know nothing about listing you come to here i wouldnt give you penny for what you know about listing thats fact if you cant ratta tat tat ratta tat tat off the laws of listing popety popety pop and know that those are the laws those are the laws there arent any other laws there are exception to these laws these are the laws of listing those are the laws of listing that is how it is done it isnt done any other way there are exceptions of any kind whatsoever any list is listed that way do i make my point so dont ask any more questions about listing or ill bite your heads off anyhow asking whether or not the lists of four are done in this way now there is thing which isnt list which is actually repetitive process its whats been overrun it doesnt go to an item youre askin g in actual fact the pc what has been overrun and you rehab each read you get its repetitive process you write it down so you know what youre rehabbing but as far as listing and nulling is concerned its nonnulled item as far as listing and nulling is concerned there are variables and its the one thing that the bulk of you who are studying this course dont know you dont know that youre dealing with an invariable science it has variabilities it is absolutely clank you have to begin by finding this out if you dont find this out you will never mak class viii auditor its marvelous discovery you are in the process of discovering scientology thats right now lets take it up from the beginning what does the word scientology mean if there seems to be little bitterness in that scio is the word for truth and scio turns in to scien in that form which means truth and ology is the study of truth study of now if youre studying truth how the hell can there be variable truth by definition is what is there is direct relationship to the amount of variable in persons life and complications which are untruths and his state of case wag lies by the words and music lying is way of life how are you today i feel fine you look great mabel what pretty hat you have ive always liked it you listen to some of these birds theyre so bad off because theyve just been done in but they arent havent been done in they have been doing something in dont you see that is level of truth so that an ot comes up the line toward truth and the more truths there is in him the higher his case level by direct proportion so fellow comes in hes lying in his teeth lie lie lie alters alter alter vary vary vary quibble quibble quibble nya nya nya booboo dee dee boo boo you have direct immediate index of his case level hes nuts and this goes down and expresses itself as delusion the delusion of insanity the delusion of hop head the delusion of callagan or robinson oh my god the scientologists are all after pffft my co ntempt these characters we werent after them they practically had to take taxi cabs airbuses helicopters walk through mud struggle through storm anything else to get on our track we didnt even hear of them we didnt even know anything about them we couldnt have cared less if we had we arent in any line of country they have anything to do with the guy who is stuck on the track someplace the martians are after him fighting shad ows fighting things that havent anything to do with him wars world wars whereby the germans says the english are horrible and the english say the germans are horrible and the germans say the english are trying to conquer the world and the english say the germans are trying to conquer the world and germans say the english are slaughtering babies and the english say the germans are slaughtering babies the amount of truth there is in connection with any war man has ever fought is undiscoverable with the worlds most powerful microscope so in the gravest insanities you get the greatest untruth so the road is road of truth at seven there was step known as the incredibles as you go up the line you disco ver the incredibles things that happened to the individual which are true but not believable the incredibles that is one of the points of auditing stripping out the incredibles off the time track now you know how much youd be believed if you walked into the barber shop and says well i put ten cents down on sky rover in the third race and he paid off two million to one and i made couple of hundred thousand dollars and my wife thought of the idea in dream and so thats why i did it you know only it happens to be true but you cant believe it because the odds are too great against it see i had trouble with this when i was kid i was everyplace and anyplace and into anything and all over the planet at the time when people were not traveling all over the planet and i eventually got to point where i couldnt talk about my adventures i actually hit level of untruth of minimizing what i had done and been thats the reduction of incredibles there are various ways by which something can be or seem untrue various ways so anyway scientology is well named it is the road to truth it is study of the truth and total truth is total power and when the guy hasnt got any lies left in him hes ot and all the mechanics of ot work out too so the subject is very very well named and thats what scientology means its the study of truth to which could be added the technology of achieving truth and i have list here whereby several students dont know what standard tech is dont know what the word standard means havent any idea now if somebody doesnt know that there is subject called scientology which is main line subject which has certain number of hair line processes which make up direct route he needs an acad emy course he shouldnt be here those are brutal words science is body of truths technology is body of truths now somebody who cant confront action or something like that thinks truth would be datum of some kind or another well truth can also be an action and the road through all of the untruths of person from all the way south to all the way north has been mapped it exists it has been on chart for years there have been bulletins which announced its processes the doingness of those processes are exact precise there arent two ways to do them there is one way to do them and that is what you are here learning and if you can t learn that basic fundamental you might as well quit now you are not learning this wide subject of philosophy youre not learning every students got chance to think his own opinion right now youre not learning that right now youre learning the technical application of exactly how it is done exactly to whom it is done exactl and precisel the steps and actions taken to an exact precise results and thats what youre learning and you havent anything to do with how many needles sit on the head of an angel now case supervision you were given some folders to case supervise then doing case supervision of them you decided what was wrong with the pc which is direct violation of the auditors code evaluative case supervision will be your downfall it comes to this he couldnt or didnt make this grade your job is to make sure he made the grade now whats wrong with the pc is he hasn t made that grade the major gains of the pc are always the next grade you wont ever get any gains on pc compared to making the grade all your job is is to start the pc in at the beginning of the assembly line and make sure that hes correctly run to the end of the assembly line and thats your whole job and when you do case supervision dont ever let hear you say again to the end of your career an evaluative statement about pc because ou dont know you do certain basic standard actions basic action standard action and the case falls apart you have to know your stable data boy you have to know your stable data so you can mutter it in your sleep you look into one of these folders if you know your business you instantly will look at list the list was complete the pc was given his item the question read to begin with didnt dead horse you have to know data like this dead horse question didnt read to begin with dont list question unless it reads ques tion didnt read dont list it quest ion read item found on the list pfff its either incomplete or it needs to be extended it needs to be extended or the items been suppressed you find theres little list four things which you do with list very standard elementary elementary now lets go into the definition of the word standard i want to put you in good frame of mind now im not mad at you at all theres animosity standard the word standard as taken from rodells synonym finder the word standard and it says here it is universal accepted comm on normal of recognized excellence or authority final definitive authoritative conclusi ve reliable preferred classic timeless accepted orthodox staple official cathedral doctrinal ultimate canonical and authentic thats the word the synonyms of the word standard and now we have the oxford illustrated dictionary and we will read here the definition of the word standard i want to call to your attention that my messen ger looked these up for the word standard standard its distinctive flag its banner with royal arms its flag of cavalry regiment its rallying principle one of the meanings of standard is carrying banner forward now its weight or measure to which others conform or by which the accuracy of others is judged its legal proportion of weight as in fine metal and alloy in gold and silver coin its degree of excellence which is the meaning which we have required for particular purpose its thing recognized as model for imitation recognized as posses sing the merit of authority degrees of proficiency class st udying to reach this lets take another dictionary and this is the universal english dictionary were getting up in weight here my messen ger had hard time lifting these off to look them up for you actually our sea org messen gers are very proud of themsel ves theyre moving up toward ten thousand word vocab ulary which is exactly twenty times that of the average college student do you know the average college student knows five hundred words its true once more its banner standard banner hearing royal or national arms flown only by the sovereign flag of the cava lry regiment etcetera etcet era of gold style mode type accepted recognized by convention within community at given time as criterion of what is best in speech behavior conduct action face morality to which we add techn ology what is the best and now we will pick up bigger dictionary this is websters third international dictionary it is couple of volumes because they couldnt get all the words into one and its in india paper in microscopic print and my messen ger has very good eyesight to find it at all standard its rallying place flag to mark rallying place pole or spea r bearing some conspicuous object man we havent even gotten down to anything else definite level or degree of quality that is proper and adequate for speci fic purpose the word standard the word standard it means definite level or degree of quality that is proper and adequate for specific purposes and that one you can star rate got it and now we will look up the word technology i dont want anybody with any misunderstoods here i havent looked these up my messen ger looked these up for technology is scientific study of practical arts its practical arts collectively terminology of particular art or subject technique is manner of execution or performance man ner of execution or performance im gonna get this big dictionary up here and it says here techn ique is syste matic and specia l method employed in carrying out some particular operation skill in practical acqu aintance with the methods of some particular art special ized procedure operation and the like thats technique now technology science of the mechanical industrial arts contrasted with the fine arts technologist as student is one who is versed in technology and lets get this big one back here i dont know whether i can find it on this page or not its so microscopic there is technique techno technology is the terminology of particular subject its the technical language its the science of application of knowledge to practical purpose applied science the science of the application of knowledge to practical purpose applied science have you got it now theres animosity connected with this at all this is perfectly friendly but scientology has very definite body of technical application which is the only body of technical application in all of the data of scientology there are not two ways to do anything in scientology in 1966 this was totally summated and it is time that auditors ceased to be airyfairy about it going up the line right now we have the fact that scientology applied as you are being trained to apply it produces 100 result and applied with the airyfairy i dont know what were doing duh duh duh duh i have lots of opinions on this subject i think id better case supervise i think this guy must have missed withholds after they got five items reading on the list and it was four pages long he threw the cans at the auditor obviously he has missed withholds scientology misa pplied applied contrary to standard tech produces back fires that are not the pcs fault standard tech is entirely under the control of the case supervisor and the auditor the preclear the preot is entirely under the control of the case supervisor and the auditor just so you know that well the preclear doesnt have missed withholds which is why the session failed bes entirely under the control of the case supervisor and the auditor and if he didnt make it it is the fault of the case supervisor and the fault of the auditor nobody elses there is escape safety valve if he went out and got drunk and fell on his head between sessions why the hell didnt you audit him fast enough so he didnt have chance its time we took responsibility for the guy in the chai r because properly case supervised you get one zero zero per centium one hundred cases out of one hundred cases if you dont get it youre flubbing the old timer he got pretty good dianetic auditing and so forth they got about 50 they got about 50 improvement as technology advanced and as it was expertly applied the percentage advanced 22 1 2 of all cases will get well if you pat them on the head if you show them green door if you put an ice cream cone in their hand if you give them sugar pills if you simp ly give them advice 22 1 2 of all the people that come in the line up will get well so the zero percentage is 22 1 2 you gonna get 22 1 2 anyhow right wrong upside down or backwa rds youre gonna get twenty two and half so you get one of these 22 1 2 you run squirrel process and he says he got well so you think that squirrel process mus t have been bah nonsense now you can push this up the line and you want to know where the psych iatrist is and so forth he doesnt even get one percent hes doing 22 1 2 percent damage thats how you measu re it and auditors very bad auditor you get less t han 22 1 2 percent he expect that in any event now the skill and the excellence of the technology and excellence of its application the standardness of it will push the percentage up and through the years it went to higher percentages and higher percentages and higher percentages and you as class viii are looking at the per centium of one zero zero per centium any thing that falls below 100 percent is because somebody goofed boy the case supervisor or the auditor somebody goofed now it may take you two or three sessions it may take you repair before you can execute the final action you may have been fed bum datum by the auditor and then as case supervisor called for wrong action and then youll find this out fast enough because the guy didnt com out of it so then youve got to go back and find out what it is you send the preclear to the examiner you get him run on seven button assessment the seven different types of things you can get him run on general assessme nt form green form an l4a various things for various purposes you find out you put it to rights and then you get your 100 it isnt 100 percent one session but if you go for two or three goofed up sessions followed by four or five repairs which are goofed up repairs of goofed up sessions and then you repair the repair of the repair and so forth youre not going to get your 100 percent but out of the cases which pass beneath your nose you had better you had better better better get one zero zero because the technology is there with which to achieve it and if you dont know its there well put you in an academy someplace to learn some of your basics because the road is very simp road and the most difficulty you are having right at this moment is asking these marvelously comp licated questions of yourselves you see table sitting in the middle of the room i am telling you it is table it is sitting in the middle of the room and you say lets see should it go to the antique side how far is it how long has it been sitting there what are the ramifications and complications in the material of the table is the table really substantial if an elephant sat down on the table would it stand up im just trying to tell you for god sakes theres table sitting in the middle of the room there is table sitting in the middle of the room and that is the total isness f it i tell you that you do the ruds to f n therefore you start in with an arc break you got present time problem you check for missed withhold and so somewhere along there shes gonna f n if you know anything about your trs at all you really cant miss so it f ns your rudiments are now done so the pc is set up to be audited now you audit what the main body of the session was supposed to be which is some major action you complete the major action to f n and maybe one two three major actions you complete them all and you end off the session on an f n and if your trs are very good hell come back into the next session still with an f n if you cannot get an f n on your rudiments you of course do g f green form and you get an f n on that and that is setting the case up and looking at your folders youve been trying to get case gains out of green forms well sure somebody feels better on green form youre trying to get case gains trying to solve cases what the hell are you trying to solve cases for theyre problem theyre problem to c s theyre not problem to an auditor you do the usual and the case solves itself its too easy it is too simp and your complex figurefigurefigurefigurefigure oh my god figure figurefigurefigurefigure is just all over your god damned plate and youre sitting there saying i wonder what the pcs thinking next and so forth and waffwaffwaff and doo doo doo thhthhhthh relax you start in with oh i wonder whats this look at this christ look whats happened oh my god id better do something about this youve got c s right in front of you perhaps your c s and it says pcpow pcpow pc powpowpowpowpow you do it and if your c s knows his business or if youre the c s you already knew the ta was at six and half and you simp ly took it down thats all now what why would the ta be at six and half you go back to the folder youll find out fast enough the guy went through five blow downs on listing one of the 5a processe s and the auditor gave him the last blowing down item powers supposed to be listed to the first blow down if you list it to more than one blow down youre gonna be in trouble there and the pc after the session might feel great for an hour he might feel great for two hours but sometime between then and the next two or three days he is going to feel like hell you violate the rules of standard tech and the pc feels like hell you follow the rules of standard tech and the pc feels good and thats all there is to it some day if you get through this course alive someday you will look back on your beginning think as comp letely ridiculous you will be sitting there knocking cases off left and right pongety pongety pongety pongety bung bang hundred percent hundred percent plongetybing plongetybing plongetybing god damn that auditor he slipped in that session ill write your c s repair this wong wong bong bong and there she goes hundred percent hundred percent pocketa pocketa pocketa and you look back at your earlier auditing career i draw curtain over your thoughts but did you ever see somebody walk on stage and play pianer some fellow walks on stage and he plays the piano mario fenninger walks in shoots his cuffs sits down boww ow you know that piano really goes boy that piano really goes now you can say it looks very simp to mario fenninger thats right he knows hes supposed to strike certain keys and he gets certain results there isnt any other airyfairy think about it only he knows where the keys are bettern any body else and thats class viii auditor same piano and you see some academy auditor he comes in and wonder where c is and where where wheres the lid to this thing you know lid well i got the lid open now lets see what are these black and white things ill look it up in the instruction book over here black and white things keys those are keys very good now you expect him to play moonlight sonata huhits piano but it isnt any where near as difficult as piano to learn how to play the biggest hump is learning that its very simp action its not careless action terribly simp you go out and you see an expert marksma n and he throws the rifle up to his shoulder booms bulls eye bulls eye you say gee thats easy and you go out and you look for where the trigger is and you look where the bolt is where the magazine is and you look down there to see if its loaded and you take it up and this damn straps getting in your road somehow or another my god youre so damned introverted looking at the weapon you never get chance to look at the target and the reason most auditors never see whats going on in the pc is the auditor doesnt really even know how to handle an em eter be sits down i wonder if ive got the sensitivity right ive got to ive got to write this down never mastered the art of handling the tone arm of the meter with his theme while hes writing down the auditors report and lets see what do i say next same thing he just doesnt know his tools well enough you take somebody walks in with came ra got camera bes ruddy amateur if hes ruddy amateur if he looks at this came ra and he takes good look at it and he says wheres the lens where do i put the film in what is this whats this glass in front oh thats the lens yes and i wonder what all these rings are well ill look it up in the instruction book here oh that is the lens now lets see how do i get this camera open to get some film in it and so on finally opens it up finally gets some film in it loaded some how or another then hes going around whe res the trigger wheres the trigger lets see wheres the trigger now im going to take picture and god damn hes so involved in trying to handle this piece of stuff that he is completely unfamiliar with that honest to pete the pictures he takes are complete stinking disgrace he thinks hes doing good to be able to point it horizontal now we take some guy hes got piece of camera hes familiar with cameras he can take this thing and he flips the back of it open he throws the film in while talking to you about something or other sets it up and so forth now he looks around and theres the picture he hasnt got any attention on that camera boy theres the picture so so here powie he can see over there because his attention isnt introverted here standard tech then requires that one know his tools know the laws of the game know the correct action so instinctively and so instantaneously that he never has to think thing to do it his attentions on the pc pc gives indicator sixteen the auditor does what hes supposed to do just think well what do you know pcs talking about an arc break but it isnt reading now he knows his technology sufficiently well and he knows the pc talking about an arc break that isnt reading its missed withhold arc breaks that dont read are missed withhold standard datum you dont say i think you know actually ron said something about when the thing didnt read nuts see its bonkers what whats all this think and cross think and wonder and so forth if you hold up your hand and turn your hand over palm up and then turn your hand over palm down do you know what youd had to do as thetan if you could think of the number of chan nels and muscles and nerve centers and things and this and so on which it took to turn your hand right side up and upside down you would go practically bonkers and i assure you you wouldnt be able to do it you ask somebody who is ballerina you can actually throw off ballerina who is not quite on the ball not quite she puts good show on and so on but shes not quite there if you say how do you balance on your toe how do you balance on your toe now if shes on the ball shed look at you and say why you balance on your toe of course you idiot the great dancer is totally simple you ask some artist how should you paint this picture what should you do well if hes sort of only painting reactively and he doesnt know his business hes knocked into cocked hat instantly hets knocked right off of it but if he really knows his business he just says ho hum and goes on with his work why why do you put green like that why do you put stripe of green like that and so forth and hed look at you and say what looks be tter now you ask some flooky mug maybe an art teache r some place and you say now why do you put green across the picture well this gives the collateral effect to extensive distance and balances the color combination because in actual fact the color wheel if you see it over here has complimentary color you see its green and if you dont put green there then youll get concav ity of the lumbosis the maddest thing i ever saw in my life i gave lecture to short story class one time been giving lot of lectures to writers classes and things like this in universities and places and i walked up on the rostrum and there were all the assembled students and lying on the rostrum was one of my current magazine stories lying open to my story which was the lead story of the magazine and the instructor had taken every single one of the sentences of the opening of the story and deep into the body of the story and had marked each one of them for shad owing suspe nse element you know and all according to technology which i knew but i hadnt thought of for years and i was fascinated i looked at this and just for moment wondered how it would be to be all thumbs so youd have to while you were writing story say we had better foreshadow some action now if scientologys definition is the road to truth then what are the progressive grade processes they are those barriers in that order which keep person from going forward to an ultimate truth so if you looked at normal pc you might see something on the order of where he is parked in diddywa diddy you ever hear of diddywa diddy thats actually ten miles on the other side of hell and thats where the people in hell go on their night out but anyway hes over here in diddywa diddy now hes going to walk all the way the whole route see now these grades are the gates across the road one nobody knew the road they didnt know he was down there they didnt know any of the gates across the road and standard tech simp ly takes this fellow and it walks him right straight up the lines through these exact gates and if you walk him through any other gates youre just detouring there arent any other barriers on the track these are the shut gates on his road up the line and they are the grade proces ses and it isnt just an illusion it is the fact and because it is fact if you know your job expertly you simply go along and open these gates for him shove him through go to the next gate open it and shove him through and open the next gate and shove him throughnow theres eight thousand seven hundred and fifty billion other things you could do with the case none of which would put him any further along the road hes supposed to travel but boy would they be interesting and any time else in mans history all theyve done is they did find out there might be somebody in diddywa diddy and they just sent him little close r to hell didnt even have the dream that there might be road out so how far up the line do you have to come to grasp this thing called standard tech there is guy theres dream of road out there is road theres complete ocea n of wrongnesses but what has been isolated are the exact barriers to the exact road that takes him out and he goes right up the line brrrrrrrmm now along with that is the communication of the technology and the training technology of the person to teach him to do that these are fantastic wins they are so airyfairy and so starryeyed and so far beyond anything man ever envisioned there all by itself its little bit hard to grasp but you just accept it its road out theres dream to get out theres road out therere just exactly so many gates across the road standard tech one right after the other opens the gate and standard tech when the guy has gone over in the left field right field off the road into the telegraph pole something like that also gives you the technology of taking him out and putting him back on the road and there arent eight ways to do it and it doesnt require any opinions lets say weve got concrete path that goes from to b and we start walking down this concrete path and all of sudden somebody rushes up and says actually youre supposed to walk over there in the gravel along the side of the edge of the mole you know and you swim for little bit and thats really how you get up to b what kind of jackass is it that would walk over to the mole and jump in well hed have to be somebody who didnt have any idea there was any any concrete walk there well the first thing you learn about standard tech is one there is walk there now one of the ways you learn this is subjectively now i dont want to invalidate anybodys case i dont want to invalidate anybodys reviews but this pile of crap ive got sitting here is how not to do it now also theres an infinity of ways not to do its you can always have an infinity of wrongnesses around one rightness and the rightnesses are very few so if you learn the rightnesses well then the wrongnesses to hell with it do you follow you can get an infinity of ways to do something wrong well work it out for yourself start counting up the number of ways to sink rowboat those are all wrongnesses now the ways to row rowboat if it is rowboat not sculling boat you can stand up and row it you can sit down and row it you can row it with two men you can row it with one man but the right way to row rowboat is to put the oars into the water and apply some energy to the handles pick the oars out of the water and replace them into the position where they can be reinserted into the water to apply some energy now somebody comes along and he says to you yes well how do you row rowboat well theres several ways you can row rowboat thats for sure you can stand up and face the bow you can sit down and face the stern you can stand up and face the stern you can put man on the right oar and man on the left oar you can have two sets of oars sounds like lot of variables but let point out that the oars on the right side and the oars on the left side of the boat are doing exactly the same thing matter what arrangement is made if youve got trireme bireme it doesnt matter if youve got life boat if youve got little fishing dory youre doing the same thing in each particular case now if you lose sight of the fact that the oar is supposed to go into the water and push the water back if you lose sight of that you may have great deal of theory and great many questions but the boat wont go anywhere thats normally what happens to science somebody finds out about rowing boat and then for years and years and years guys add to it and eventually the rowing of the boat longer functions and the boats dont row any more and they have to invent an entirely new technology of getting through water you think im kidding the movies the movies show us in biremes old men owar with double oar banks of greek times shows us shows us all of these oars going while somebody is going bong bong on drums or something at the back of the boat in order to keep all the oars in turn if you take life boat out and every rower on the starboard side fails to exactly follow the motions of the aftermost starboard rower whos called the stroke oar and if the port aftermost rower who is the port stroke does not follow exactly the motions of the other stroke the boat looks like centipede with busted legs man has actually pretty well forgotten how to row boats mass rowing of boats big boats because they let the coxswa in count and you hear all your demonstration when your coxswa in count the stroke the coxswa in cant count the stroke strokes are counted by the stroke oar there wouldnt be any reason to hammer drum because nobodys following drum theyre following stroke oar so why why would anybody pound the drum just for one oarsman you could sit down along side of this oarsman and say ok stroke stroke theres reason to waste your lungs as matter of fact the entire rowing of the boat is going to be comp letely ruined it looks like some wildly galloping centipede going along now i know very well that they did it properly in greek and roman times because they speak of the white wings out of the galleys the white wings of the galleys now youd immediately in sail period and so on youd think they meant think they meant canvas or sails or something they didnt they meant those double banks of oars because it looks just like it just looks like big bird flying at you the oars are flapping see on both sides you see them go up and down looks like flying bird that is sitting down in the water they never rowed that evenly by calling stroke or with drums and the other day i was looking through book as to how you rowed life boat and it said the coxswain called the stroke he doesnt if he does nobody can row the boat so look if this fundamental piece of technology can be wrecked by the simp action of making the wrong person count cade nce or rhythm do you see t hat workable piece of technology is very easily unsettled and upset sot the thing that keeps standard tech standard is following standard tech not anybody elses advice so somebody comes along and he says we got brand new process which is riddlediddledepoggledings and so on and weve got this brand new meter which we attach to the toes of the pc and it makes him wiggle his ears well ill probably still be around youd better send it to for check up to make sure this case ill tell you something absolutely ghastly in eighteen solid years of research i kept the door wide open to any research suggestion of any kind whatsoever and from the moment i wrote the last sentence of dianetics the modern science of mental health right on up the line i would have been only too glad to have accepted workable action but every time i did it got us in trouble it might have stayed with it short period of time it might have appeared workable short period of time but in the final analysis i t got us in trouble i know how little things can change and what you havent watched is that scientology and dianetics were developed grade by grade 1950 running of engrams running of engrams fascinating just before the running of engrams there was straightwire then engram running developed heavily seco ndaries secondaries were developed in their proper position and place the whole subject evolved along this particular line and do you know why and what was the clue and why these becam the grades and why these are run in that sequ ence its because theyre the collection of those things which if violated prevent any advance of the case if one of those things are out then the case never goes ot simple and its in that sequ ence and the width of the road is about one onethousandth of one micrometer the variability is zero the wins are one zero zero theres brand new approach youre looking at new world now somewhere up the line you get to start auditing this and when you start auditing this youre gonna get so damned dizzy and powerhappy somebodyll probably have to shoot you down with shot gun because guy just goes completely wild normally speaking he goes wild on this he he does exactly right he does exactly what hes supposed to do the pc all of sudden goes zzzooooooommmm just like hes supposed to do and he all of sudden realizes he can do it and you cant speak to him for days and then the mistake he makes is he now thinks he can case supervise also this is another field its based on the same principles but you have to know if you have to know it well to audit it you have to know it ten times as well to case pervise it now i i know i caug ht that that thered been one or two people in this class who were case supervisors at saint hill and so forth and you can put it down to my charity that you havent been ground up for hamburger because what i see here wow i taught you better than this there was thing called standard tech there has been thing called standard tech since 1966 but nobodys caught the brass ring so im putting that brass ring firmly in your paw im not trying to make you guilty im merely trying to give you one hundred percent win one hundred percent if you get less than hundred percent you goofed if you get less than one hundred percent as case supervisor you goofed less than hundred percent as an auditor you goofed some of the goofs are beyond your control and sometimes you hit real goof that you cant do anything about at all and those are the goofs which you shouldnt goof on you told the auditor to do so and so and so and so and the auditor did something else he just got letter from yongo bongo and yongobongo he said when i was studying yogi i found out that if the preclear sat in an ibis position he really decided hed try that see and he didnt follow your c s exactly and youve got loused up case and then because its going to be day or two between sessions he goes and walks under street car and that cuts your percentage doesnt it case s that are well audited dont go to ethics cases that are badly audited wind up in ethics l too often now when youre dealing purity when youre dealing with purity of technology the weapon in your hands has such velocity that it isnt the airy fairy days where you couldnt cut below the reality of the pc and louse him up there were years past where the technology as it went along did not plow under and overthrow the reality level of the pc well youre not dealing with it now youre dealing with the pure dynamite now an explosives expert has often been known to carry nitro glycerin in flask in his hip pocket all he had to do was back up suddenly into something and he would have fragmented all over the landscape ive seen dynamite men sit on boxes of fuses smok ing and yet heres this guy who is the nitro glycerin soup expert the soup expert and somebody else even looks like hes going to touch bottle of soup and he practically throttles him you walk in toward the dynamite powder house with cigarette in your hands and the guy who is smok ing his pipe on the box gets up and kicks you the hell out of the yard in other words he knows enough about it so he can ride it close to the edge and hes also smart enough to know youd better not let anybody else do you see youre dealing actually with terrifically powerful technology used right it just shoots guy to the moon goofed up pooey and goofed up cases are too many now it takes supervisor who knows his business you can run engrams on somebody you can do this with somebody you can do that with somebody you can run various processes you can run if you can get an idea of of highway running through the middle of lot of blackness and lot of little pathways and all that sort of thing you can run any of those little pathways you can run any of those open fields you can do anything out there that you want to you can goof around and flubbledubble and bobblefobble and and so forth pc isnt getting anyplace you cant do him any damage to amount to anything but you get on the main highway it is such straight highway the actions in opening the gates are so positive that when you goof that up the pc will goof up do you follow now if theres big question in your mind as to whether or not scientology works you shouldnt be studying class viii because one is expected to be sufficiently expert auditor to produce some result such as touch assist he should be able to do that and achieve some result but if one has got big questions about this and that please recognize them for what they are theyre just confusion blowing off there is just about as much question in running rehab or the mechanisms of rehab there isnt any questions concer ning it there are questions with regard to listing there arent any you list and you list it as long as it contains an item on it and two on the list you extend the list and give the pc the item and what the hell i mean this is something like saying box of matches on the table is either full of matches or its not full of matches if it is not full of matches and the matches are dumped along side of it and if the object is to restore it you pick up the matches put them in the box and put the box together again and you have box of matches i mean its open and shut data like that i mean it isnt any wibblewobblew ooble it its just truth see so you start watching for these simplicities but what does it take to be totally simp it takes total knowledge of the lot save such familiarity that you never even have to think to do it now how often would you have to field strip rifle so that you could pick it up put the cartridge into it and fire it without even thinking well theres rifle clank boom poom how often would you have had to have field stripped that rifle probably dozens of times back in the days when medicine was medicine and not parke and davis and other drug companies pushing their stock up medical doctor used to have to identify all of the bones of the human skeleton blindfolded by touch alone interesting exercise well what would be the point of such an exercise well its kind of pointless you very seldom operate in the dark but it sure as the devil gives you familiarity you know what bone is where when youve done something like that now therere various actions and exercises which you can do and you can action them and exercise them but if you have any comm lag if there is any comm lag between your think and the datum youre trying to get you dont know standard tech well enough to do it if there s any comm lag in you instantly thinking of the law of listing that you need to apply at that instant if you had to think of it as law of listing as something that came off of bulletin you havent got it yet you understand you have to its atotal its total you own it you do it and so forth you look at the list and it isnt i wonder where all of it you look at this list you say that list isnt correct you just look at it as i would with any of these oh i could do this at random list just incorrect yes good yes yes didnt find any correct list well anyhow imagine case supervisor now who would have to have his whole bulletin file along side of him to have reference to go over and find any of the errors which had been made in the session in order to order them corrected in case the trouble i have in case supervision is trying to read the auditors writing its that degree of simplicity i know my data but you say well of course you know the data you wrote the data naturally you know the data you developed the data well listen god damn it ive developed more data than you ever heard of you know ive just developed data by the wow the total notes of dianetics and scientology the total tapes of dianetics and scientology are an ocean of data tremendous fantastic scope how is it that i know these central data so well when i started doing cchs when i started doing model session i set myself up just like you and i drilled it till i knew it cold i could write down the laws of listing again after lapse of several years even though the bulletin that recorded them originally had been removed from the lines and i wrote them from memory and i think it took something on the order of about fifteen twenty minutes the slowdown was ale x sabriskys ab ility to keep up with my writing now i know more phenomena than you can count which are contrary to those laws of listing which seem to be this which off woff phenomena than that or is it the other way and so forth how is it that i would know those laws of listing well i had to keep check on things that didnt have variables i eventually isolated those things and theyre the things with variables so i had to write all those things down i had to know those i had to read them back i had to remember these things i had to know em you think youre studying this subject why hell ive studied ninety five times the subject you ever studied alright then how is it that out of this whole body of stuff i can pick so neatly this and that and so as to do case supervision about as fast as i can read it it is knowing my data knowing which datum is the datum which applies at this particular point and what datum has been violated and otherwise and youve got the same data ive got in your study packs simple as thati dont do these folders from crystal balls boy i do these just these folders against the most concise series of data you ever heard of srrrrrpboom we cracked case today down the middle down the middle crosswise and diagonally it was just about hed given us bad time we keep cracking em knowing the data knowing the exact basic rules and laws now theres something funny about all this i know lot of other subjects in which such data occurs i can give you the datum of freudian analysis im very good swam i i can read minds so as to tear your skull off good at it dont ever do these things still know the data in connection with it why then out of this tremendous body of information are we stressing just these data ive got us the widest possible selecti on its the evaluation of importance knowing which point is valuable and what is trash it is knowing where the main line lies and where it doesnt i wouldnt give you spit for any datum in freudian analysis i wouldnt give you dog spit for it in fact freud and broyer probably should have been stood up against the nearest brick wall and shot unpleasan tly with dull bullets youve always heard be polite on that subject im taking down my hair im talking to class viii student what lot of crap you know who they really were they were some guys who had found out how you could take the work of charcot and mesmer and persuade people to do things against their will under paindrug hypnotism and there isnt an analyst on the planet who ever does anything else in the its method of shaki ng people down and bending their will brayer and freud in 1891 were agents raiser wilhelm hogensoloven and they were dedicated to making politically minded changes for him bunch of crap complete swindle just hypnotist so he invents the libidodibido theory and he goes poogly poods and ids and greek mythology and bah therere certain principles involved in any savage and primitive think that you can use certain principles involved theres certain magical principles theres opening up somebodys memory making him forcing him or persuading him to remember something painful and so forth these are known to every medicine man every swami there is how is it they knew it and never used it huh right now right now the beautiful techn ology heh of these characters is turned against scientology because the politicians you hear crying out against them have wives who have been violated by psych oanalysis they are under the influence there are thousands of zones where data could lie therere billions of zones where that you could consi der truth theres whole universe out here full of crap and bucks and i show you one little narrow line that goes straight through it like shock and few gates which if you open them exactly correctly somebody goes out like he is on rocket ride so if you ever mention to again question about something over in left field ill have you spanked this is lousiest thingw hat the hell is anybody doing wandering around over here in left field heres the main road lets get on it lets find out what the principles on it are i didnt mean to curse you that mildly heres the main highway now knock off the muckin g about and get on it there arent any questions about it it just is and its certain series of actions that you do and they wind up at the other end in total result so do it boom thats all there is to it and as far as case supervision your main trouble will be trying to convince the auditors auditing for you that theyd better damn well do what you say on case supervision folder and not some other crappy thing and then you will have to convince them because of your ferocity on this whole subject you will have to convince them that theyd better damn well speak the truth by making false report far worse than just goof these problems are ahead of you the first thing you must learn is that there is road you can learn it subjectively easy enough or i could turn lose division five on you left right and center clean up all the flubs and bubs and so forth and send you flying with the greatest of ease if anything wrong with your case or bogged down youd wonder where the hell you what what you ever thought was gain before this well im not going to do that im going to let you get win on each other in the org student course we could make make your cases zongobingo so fast itd make your head swim but then weve got all the wins we want you can have it too and you can also be the effect end of the goofs so anyway that is everything i have to say to you this evening and i hope something i have said will assist you on your road to truth thank youthe standard green form and rudiments lecture given on 28 september 1968 and this is what date the twenty eighth of september 1968 lecture number what five glad you can still count thank you very much lecture number five of the standard tech class viii auditors course the situation with regard to standard tech at this time is we have had few mice and i imagine down through the years there will be few other mice bulletin gets altered tape gets pulled off the line some vital action is shifted somebody comes tearing in with brand new idea that seems to be absolutely vitally essential and the first thing you know why we have trouble of one kind or another and tech fails and it suddenly ceases to give the results which it should attain at that time morale goes down scientology doesnt work these are the danger points of the past and of the future it is not unbeknownst to to get proposals such as this through the mail line its proposed hco bulletin there are forty or fifty of these things which have been written and issued and it does seem that person before he is permitted to have grade should go to the examiner to find out if it was an arc broken needle or if it was actually release on the grade he was supposed to be released on and not an f n on something else now ill tell you what does this stem from why why why would such proposal come up standard tech is already out its already out with enthusiasm whats out the trs are would have to be so bonkers that the auditor was not able to attract the attention of the pc for the next grade or action and the pc chortling merrily merrily to himself would be getting an f n from former action you see w hat could happen here alright weve just release d this fellow on zero and he says ooh gosh you know boy that was really some cognition you know needles swinging uh its really going great and the auditor sits there and says aw yaya uh number one it went awaw and it went by and ububuzub and the pc thinking to himself boy thats really great that comm unicat ion process really great and the auditor says uh why thats release uwuuwuwuw and the pcsaying boy that really i can communicate you know and the auditor says kenya you know nyee canned command trs command impingement on the pc cant operate his emeter anyhow doesnt even notice the pc isnt looking at him uh well its raring too and so forth and the needles going on swing and the pcs saying gee well what do you know about that i really can talk to people you know n the only other condition this could occur on is if it was busted emeter now in the first place if its an arc broke needle youre getting the pc sitting here like this duh and the auditor says says catfish gollawong and the pc says awawang yeah oogh nya oog log and the auditor says well im glad thats floating needle and so forth the pc never would answe r on any of his questions it could also occur on one of these kooky stage four needles it goes up and does little hitch and goes down you ever heard of stage four needle i saw somebody just go uh whats stage four needle stage four needle is stage beyond three which is dead laughs you can get meter you can get meter on pc and he sits down in session and goes up and hitches and falls and its doing about two inch swee p and it goes up and it goes it hiccups at the top and it goes down and you say have you ever been shot and it does the same thing and whats your name and itll do the same thing and you kick him in the shins and itll do the same thing and theres absolutely meter chan ge of any kind whatsoever it isnt hardly connected to anybody which is really the truth it isnt connecte d to anybody and it goes on and it does this weird dance well if person doesnt know what one of those needles is as far as an arc broke needle is you can get swinging needle it isnt connected to anybody either and the questions which you ask dont chan ge it in ordinary auditing an f n broadensnarrows responds just to that degree you start overrunning it youll see your f n is going narrower and narrower and narrower and narrower and it packs up pc you get an f n and then the pc has the cognition he actually states the cognition on which he gets an f n and you see the f n widen up in other words an auditord have to be complete dolt to need such an arbitrary on his lines now this is base d on the fact that somebody has trained some auditor in an academy on the trs something on this basis what is tr0 its the tr in the book you and i think i heard about it good fine you passed now whats tr1 thats the number of the other tr good what are the rest of the trs oh i know all them and that would all he could possib ly know about trs to require such regulation one of the conditions of auditing is that you have the pc in session he has to be aware of the auditor and in communication and answ er up and so forth well if he wasn t doing any of these things naturally you would have to send him to the examiner to find out if it was real f n but the situation would be so pecu liar but to stop everybody everywhere from ever progressing in session just because some supervisor hasnt been able to teach an auditor to audit and just because theres been one pc last may who went all the way through the lines with stage four needle and nobody ever noticed that he didnt know he had ever been audited and didnt know hed ever been in session just to introduce that sort of an arbitrary would of course be completely nuts inspection before the fact is the standard line if youre not having trouble on some line dont do anything about it if you are having trouble on some line do something about it and it follows in auditing too youre having trouble with the pc well you do something about it now when i berate and start tearing you apart for wanting nickel in the slot type approach to auditing it is because you are asking for something which will make you rotten auditor if you dont know what youre doing and if you dont know what the standard action would be for that you ought to go back and study your trs and few other things it wouldnt be an occasion then to put regulation in after the fact of not having trained somebody do you see now there are rote commands which are the standard processes bu t you receive an order something like rehab former lifetime releases now what the hell do you wants what now how could anybody under gods green earth write down all the words that would have to fit in the ensuing action they couldnt it couldnt be done because it wouldnt fit all the cases because there are many different types of former lifetime releases or this lifetime releases and you see what youre doing is rehabbing former releases so you say rehab former releases well how would you go about finding these things auditorthat is your problem and if you cant solve that with the pc sitting in front of you you ought to quit do you see what youre doing you have to know what youre doings and then do it with great economy and then if the session is running like an express train whatre you going to do inspect after the fact every couple seconds now ill give you an idea you know do you have an arc break that reads uh oh yeah uh yeah i was feeling pretty bad yesterday i got letter very bad ok was it break in r c u u that reads yeah i couldnt understand any part of it good c d i using the words to somebody who isnt educat ed curious curious about what it was curious about the understanding of it yeah thats right hey yeah thats you know what i thought it was the stuff in the letter it wasnt in the letter i never could dig it i i didnt dig it wow skin tone looks good good indicators everything is fine and the needle goes whumwhum f n now youre going to say do you have an arc break did that floating needle float on the arc break cognition which you had mmm m youre not going to say anything about it at all youre going to say youre needles floated thats it thank you now your f n is now in on the rudiments which are simp ly setting the pc up then you simply swing into the session now because therere this many variables you would now have to say it didnt clean see so do you have an earlier arc break of similar nature or do you have an earlier similar arc break did you have one like that before man were talking about communication were not talking about words you have to know what youre after youre after the arc break similar to this which occurred before now it doesnt matter what language you say it in as long as it communicates to the pc and you know what you want otherwise youre liable to get something kooky you want similar earlier arc break you got it now supposing youre auditing some guy supposing youre busy auditing some guy and he doesnt know what the word arc break is or suppose hes got complete definition of the thing he thinks an arc break is an overt or something he busted when he was kid youre going to have to know what you are askin g for so that you can communicate it as an auditor as an auditor you are trying to comm unicate thought or sense now why should anybody try to escape his responsibility on the whole subject to the degree of wanting canned word by which to ask perfectly ordinary routine question if you know your business ou dont have to have those now on the grade processes yes you had better know those words exact exact exact because theyre very carefully worked out but again you cant administer grade process if you dont know what youre askin g for its your job as an auditor to to to deliver it to the pc to receive the answe r and know what the hell to do with it and there isnt anybody under gods green earth can give you whole bunch of cann ed balderdash that does your job for you now ill point something out to you i have already done quite enough without also writing all the words you use now that is not wide open invitation that every time you get yourself into corner you suddenly shift processes now recognize the difference between process and question theres fantastic width between process an d question im going to give you kooky one i read in folder you can have an infinity of wrongnesses but some of them are funnier than others you say that this auditor said to the preclea r do you have present time problem and the preclear said oh yes good what postulate created that problem good now what counter postulate met that problem good now what postulate created that problem and the funny part of it is that the ta sort of went up and the session all went to pieces because i think the problem was that his chair was tippy and it didnt have anything whatsoever to do with any problem it had to do with the auditor didnt clear the environment in the first place see hes actually asking the he had some canned idea he got this from someplace i dont know where that you clear up problems by what postulate did you make what counter postulate did you make now he of course is taking the definition of problem is postulate counter postulate he tried to audit this by definition but note that is was also in the wrong part of the session he didnt notice that the pc was sitting there almost falling out of his chair because one leg was busted now this is one hell of an awful lousy level of awareness if you want to even dignify it by calling it level of awareness so the auditors supposed to be there hes supposed to be on the ball and hes supposed to do what hes supposed to do in order to come down on certain exact line and keep the pc herded on to that line so we know that it would be the most fatal to audit over an arc break you audit over an arc break its an absolute law its nobodys opinion i assure you you audit pc over an arc break hell go eventually into the sad effect yet at saint hill one time i saw pc who had been walking around for three months with an arc break that people had audited in every session over the top of she was in grief she was in complete sad effect she was an absolute text book case of sad effect and there wasn t one single person there ever asked her if she had an arc break of long duration until i noticed this character walking around and i got an auditor by the scruff of the neck and i said pull the arc break of long duration would you please and he did so and the case cheered up and everything was g reat you see therere certain things that are meaningful like an arc break audited over the top of puts the pc into sad effect and there arent any exceptions and it is rule and it is law and any time the law is disobeyed you cut your throat as an auditor and the pcs throat so you always pick up your arc break as the first thing in the session caus its completely fatal to audit somebody over the top of now the person who has the arc break who says he doesnt have an arc break has had somebody tell him he did have an arc break when he didnt he protested and since that time arc broke has read and an educat ed auditor asks him immediately for did anybody ever tell you you had an arc break when you didnt cleans up the false read or this reverse thing can happen more rarely more rarely but it can happen he said do you have an m c break doesnt read the auditor says thats clean and the pc says the hell it is so the auditor says on arc breaks has anything been suppressed and you get the suppress off now you say do you have an arc break and the pc says yeah that was my arc break people never taking up my arc breaks so it now doesnt read but the pc is chee rful about it so it can be positive or negative but your educated auditor your educated auditor takes this up this is something he takes up he doesnt sit there like damn bump on the log waiting for the next piece of telex tape to pass through his skull auditing is something that is understood you only get into fire fights over pcs if you dont know what youre doing so we dont ever audit over an arc break and we never leave false read on and we never leave false noread on we handle it now the next thing we take up is present time problem and present time problem means present time problem the problem the pc has now problem which he does have you never get into any trouble about this or definition it comes up or it doesnt come up and the reason we take up present time problem is very elementary indeed as you will not ever chan ge case that is audited over the top of present time problem you wont do him any harm but youre never going to get any chan ge he doesnt chan ge and that is proved by graph after graph after graph after graph after graph dozens dozens dozens dozens dozens hundred of pcs i finally traced it back and isolated exactly what is was that gave an unch anging graph the presence of present time problem work was done in 55 56 washington chan ge so you going to audit this guy over present time problem well then youre going to audit him to chan ge where you going to get an f n youre not wherere you going to get the ta doing anything youre not what you trying to do cut your throat alright similarly you asked him if he has present time problem and he says you say that reads and he says oh not againl god damn every time i get into session and i try to get auditing done why that reads and so on i suppose i have got presen t time problem and you say alright has anybody ever said that you had presen t time problem when you didnt have one oh my god yesl bda bdadadababbdabdada dabab bdeed ee bdeedee bdada and so on and so on and so on and i never can get into the body of the session because they all say theres present time problem with the ruds and so forth and all dbababapow pow pow powpowpowpow pow f n you say the needle floated were going to take up whatever were going to take up now the reverse can be true more rarely that you say do you have present time problem that doesnt read funny you see him look little puzzl ed just but very often wont say puzzle d it didnt read look little bit baffled and you could say well should it have read oh yeah gee you know i just have been served with writ for federal income tax from the eskim and so on and boy its problem because i dont know any eskim anyway you say alright on the present time problem has anything been suppressed yeah yeah i have to suppress it if i dont suppress it ill never get anything done it doesnt clean up is there an earlier time you suppressed problem anything you care to say at this particular time do you want to tell more about the eskim or any damn thing you care to say its itsa or earlier green form rule is invariable it is itsa or earlier or listing process thats all you ever do on green form itsa earlier or listing process and therere certain things on the green form which you list says environment alright if theres something wrong with the environment do remedy b if hes connected to suppressive person or suppressive group anything in that department that comes up on the green form you do an s and d continuous present time overts comes up you do the prevent process you say wha t about all black doesnt that require some special process not neces sarily i dont care if the pc goes on being all black if he wants to be all black t hats alright with do you follow but the pc is you didnt follow the pc is worrying about his grades hes worrying about his field hes worried about this or hes worried about that so itll clean up on itsa and earlier yeah yeah everything i see is black i dont ever see anything i close my eyes and its all black and so on did you ever notice this earlier yes yeah alright when was that oh i dont know spokane what was going on then oh thats right we ran this engram and everything went black huh what do you know needle goes voomp f n what the hell are you doing something complicated for its itsa or earlier that is the law of the green form on certain points of the green form you do list so itsa or earlier if it doesnt clean on itsa it clea ns on earlier now i can see you putting together beautiful rote process knock it off what you have to know is itsa or earlier now how do you ask for itsa knock it off do you have present time problem oh yeah my god im about to lose my job and oh wow and so on and then how will i meet my alimony payments because oh my god you know woo wow or do you have present time problem read is there an earlier similar problem didnt clean on itsa so you gotta go earlier and you can run it back back back back and all of sudden youve got it you got it back to basic then you have to know your mecha nics dont you you have to know the composition of the mind you have to know that you have to reach the basic point where the chain started in order to get total freedom on the total chain you have to know that you dont just know itsa or earlier you have to know why how come you run it earlier well if it doesnt free late on the chain you theres an earlier on the chain to make it free if it does free late on the chain it hasnt got any basic under it or its simp ly tripped off and released at that particular point youve made him think the right thought that moved him off the mass simple too simp it is so simple that it is the most easily misunderstood thing anybody can think of in the first place youre trying to teach somebody something about something they very well may have reactive bank now when you say present time problem there are so many people that say oh yes ive got present time problem and they miss t he rest of the sentence and youre trying to teach them this you restimulate em problem i brought up one here in yesterdays lectu re and i said the incredible can hang up track and two students only learned this about it that it applied to them and i didnt tell them because it applied to them and i couldnt care less that it applied to them do you understand i taught them that because it applies to other cases and i am talking to an auditor not case there is rule about this very broad rule about this that in later years has been violated auditors and students do not have cases when we first found out they had cases and thought they had cases was about thirteen years ago and it became illegal while being student and while being an auditor it is very violently illegal to have case you dont have one at that time thats it do you understand those are the facts of life we had gag here happen the other day somebody says youre late why did you arrive and the person said i need review because ive got an arc break how can anybody get up to class vi and not know that student doesnt have case students dont have casesso when im trying to communicate to you im not talking about your bank to hell with your bank i am not talking out of my bank as philosophers and experts in this line have only done for the last four or five quadrillion years so you can pay the compliment of not listening through yours its very remarkable to have principles which came up way the hell and gone back on the track f dianetics an d scie ntology principles of the early years they still hold good they hold so good that they function at ot8 fantastic the stuff which is being taught to the lowest grade auditor is valid all the way through to ot8 fantastic so when youre learning simplicity of this character you are learning simplicity of this character nobodys trying to solve your case nobodys even trying to give you cognition im just telling you what the hot dope is those three things those three things that are absolutely completely impossible to audit over the top of include the withhold so youve got arc break ptp and withhold you will never get away with it and neither will the pc nothing how many ways can you pull withhold you can pull them the easy way you can pull them the hard way i have pulled withholds by moving my chair over in front of the door and said its perfectly or i can sit here the rest of the night i am going to hear it but that was after i checked it over to make sure that it was real withhold that it wasn t false read that the symptoms and manifestations of the withhold were very very present and the pc wasn t going to tell his withhold well i knew damn well there was reason to procee d beyond that point i would just be wasting my time so i would just simply say well i can sit here the rest of the night until you tell theres another system which is highly workable alright good we will sort this out on the meter youre not going to give the withhold well sort this out on the meter have you murdered somebody good where did you bury the body rave you robbed bank do you strangle children are you rapist by prof oh god nothing like that alright what is it like oh well i just so and so and so and so huh im short twenty five dollars today in my cashie rs till and cant find it and i didnt want to tell anybody in other words you exaggerate the withhold but thats after youve made sure that it is withhold theres false read in connection of it connection with it it is withhold it does read now there is slight danger about rock slams which turn on on withholds occasionaly is you can get them off with invalidate while theyre still hot now you can turn off rock slam by putting in the button invalidate on it it doesnt mean the persons innocent youve just cooled off the rock slam now the person may be innocen t but when you put in invalidate then you also have to put in suppress you cant just put in invalidate and have it cool off without then also putting in suppress to find out was it just smush out rock slam is basical ly an invalidation therefore if you invalidate somebody hard enough on some subject he can turn on rock slam an invalidative question asked with sufficient ferocity can itself turn on rock slam it can be done but that isnt all the rock slams there are we had criminal i use the word advisedly because it wasnt very big criminal but nevertheless criminal just the other day that had rock slam we cooled it off with invalidate and then it didnt read and she was supposed to have stolen hundred dracma it didnt read it exhonerated her she even had two hundred dracma on her and then few weeks later thousand dracma disappeared and she had it too many coinci dences the rock slam actually was perfectly accurate the person was thief but it did cool off with invalidate so remember if you cool rock slam off with invalidate youve also got to put suppress and not is and few other things in and make sure that you dont turn it back on again your job as an auditor is not to turn off rock slams or turn them on it is to discover the truth theres any gods quantity of ways you can approach the whole subject of withhold there have been many bulletins concer ning it an auditor if he understands what withhold is all about is all about he can handle withholds now missed withhold is what is in the rudiments so you have to not only detect that it exists but you have to find where and when it was missed and i see folder after folder where it says do you have missed withhold the auditor says yeah yep i stole pin from hasi good that cleans the question we will now go to the body of the session pc doesnt think anything natters bleblopbloopjep doesnt even repeat the question doesnt ask who nearly found out nothing just missin g do you follow so this is is kooky kookyruds see now you wonder why you havent if you havent flown the needle by the time youve got to missed withhold and you wonder why it doesnt fly on missed withhold its just that the where and when by whom it was missed has been omitted you have to know the theory of rudiment it is not enough to know rote now we go down into other matters but frankly from there on youre on safe ground youre on safe ground nobodys gonna do anything very weird now the only violations of this is taking up the obvious arc break the guy was given wrong item hes arc broken about it in the last session pc is arc broken after the session the session consis ted of listing for an item he obviously has wrong item the longer you spen d askin g if he has an arc break the more of fool you are obviously hes got an arc break because that is what wrong item causes an arc break you look in the folder there are eighteen items reading on the list and hes given an item that he didnt list and the auditor gave him the item do you know that was the first trouble on lists we always have trouble on lists first trouble on lists was the auditor suggesting items to the pc w eve come further than that now weve only come as far as it doesnt matter whether hes given wrong item or not but this is important the lads got an obvious arc break because youre repairing the last session which had wrong item youre repairing 5a and you find the third bd item was the one he was given if you get hold of this guy wrrrr now youre going to put in ruds to correct the item aw dont be an ass see if you know your business and you know you know your business you know that wrong item off list is going to have produced an arc broken pc and if you ask for the arc break he is seldom sufficiently technically oriented to know that that is the source of the arc break so of course you cant pull it so you can box around for an hour and half auditing across the known arc break just busting him to pieces so of course you handle the known arc break if it wasnt an arc break alright so the pc comes into session alright in the last session we see we had list here it runs 118 pages oh yeah yes we have this list and howd you feel about that oh god almighty oooh well i wish to indicate to you the list was over listed alright were going to check this list now was it the first item bong alright thats good that was the first item on the list your item is free fall thank you very much ok good indicat ors come in you now say rudiments do you follows i saw session there is session in the case folders there that is in complete howl the pc was sent in by c s to have wrong item corrected and the auditor asked for an arc break and it goes on for column after column because the pc is insufficiently educated to know hes arc broken because hes got wrong item it goes on and on well they pull more arc breaks without getting anywhere because pulling arc breaks over the existence of the arc break can also be painful it goes on for pages wound the pc right up in the rag bag so the rudiments now that doesnt in any way violate the rudiments the guy walks into session saying oh my god what am i going to do oh my god what am i going to do he sits down in the chair oh my god what am i going to do picks up the cans my god what am i going to do you would be very very foolish auditor if you didnt say do you have present time problem elementary you dont q and on other things then the rudiments however pc comes into session and says well i suppose you think youre going to do something with heheheh myanyayaya you think youre an auditor do you and so forth my response to that is there you go there are the cans do you have missed withhold pongl booml something wrong oh im sweetness and light as matter of fact i did have little withhold i stole pin once from hasi good thank you very much do you have withhold yeah i ate your lunch you know something like that well itll be obvious and having handled that one naturally then you go back through your actions now this is an auditor who knows his business t here is folder that runs like this do you have an arc break yeah theyre doing us all in everybodys caving us in lately were sure getting shot down in flames and so on im really arc broken about it boy what theyre doing to us and the auditor like god damned fool sat there for the next i dont know how long continuing to ask for arc breaks and finally finished up the session asking for arc breaks because he couldnt clean arc breaks well it was very remarkable he couldnt clean up arc breaks because the pc didnt have one the pc had missed withhold and was calling it an arc break and hell notice in the old bulletins and so forth says very often it occurs that when you have an arc break it is really missed withhold the one thing i had hard time teach ing class vi students way back when was that they dont accept everything the pc says i n violation of tech he says oh theyre doing in and all that last auditor he cut my throat from ear to ear and that is all bad yes i have terrible arc break because everything theyre doing in you see and theyre really pretty nasty to and thats off pmfodf fddouf gobbldy gobbldy gobbldy gob critical missed withhold pcs inevitably because its more socially acceptable will call missed withhold an arc break so if the arc break doesnt clean hes got missed withhold very simp but it isnt something you wreck the pc with all of this is were traveling now in auditing and couple of thousand miles an hour at least were not traveling with that old fan job piper cub fan job anymore dont you see if you know your business its nya nya nya now good do you have missed withhold zoom thank you very much now do you have thats clean do you have missed withhold thats clean good do you have an arc break thats good ptp thats fine alright didnt f n green form now youve just asked these four questions so are you live being or fool are you now going to ask those same questions again on the green form all youre going to ask about is environment you having trouble in your environment and then youre going to bring it down to overts and motivators because you just got through covering them do you understand and you get down the line and you suddenly find out that this pc has had an overrun and you straighten up the overrun and the needle flies good now you can get on with what you were supposed to do in the first place thats the way it goes with speed it isnt any fumblebumble stumblebumble i wonder whatts wrong with this pc if you ever think that thought as case supervisor youre an ass i can tell you whats wrong with pch humanoid that questions answe red dont ever worry about it again on diagnosis if you want to use such word the pc is as he is because he hasnt made the next grade now lets set him up and correct any earlier errors so that he can make his next grade we dont go into figurefigure because hes got pain in his side pc comes in he says i have this awful pain in my side oh terrible pain so on hes just walking invitation boy for you to go kooky hes issuing an engraved invitations to the examiner and everybody else connected with it the two things that can be wrong with him are they auditing hes had needs correcting or he should be on the next grade and that sure requires hell of lot of you as case supervisor doesnt it honest papall spank you if he ever catches you pulling this line well hes got this awful pain in his side i wonder what it is i can tell you what it is its either the living hes had or the auditing hes had isnt sitting well on his reactive brisket which can be corrected he should be doing the next grade its always the next grade thats all the think you do you can know more doggone things about pcs you can run comp lete intelligence service on pcs you know they are this and that and woffawoffaw offle well it does you some good dont think that it doesnt it does you some good because it tells you what you just solved you dont have to know what youre trying to solve before you solve it this fellow was hop head bank robber spent the first five years of his life in cast his uh do you see was premedical school student and was expelled uh so forth and etcetera and etcetera and for twenty two years studied yogi see and youve got this list see and you say wow see and by the time you get him up to grade iv hes flying and you say boy look what i did thats actually most of the use of it you can get this kind of situation where you know that the pc is lithuanian and doesnt speak english and has been audited by dane who didnt speak lithuanian your problem as an auditor is to find is to find lithuanian auditor your problem as c s is to find lithuanian auditor ive had that here the other day had that here the other day mana ged it too we were embarrassed one time along side of dock somebodyd been handing out hand outs talking about scientoiogy and some guy showed up and he wanted to be audited on his grade processes and he only spoke one language actually i think we did get him some auditing on his grade processes he just showed up out of the blue demanding his auditing couldnt speak english nothing recently recen tly you talk about standard tech and the quality of auditors and so on we had an auditor who was absolutely the worlds most experienced killer this auditor was class vi but had never audited anybody with any great degree of success and had in the main neglected one certain an especial pc and this pc had been especially he wasn t pc even he had never been audited he was the one who had given over all the money for all of her training her grades everything but she had never paid it back with single grade so she was asking some favor of and i said yes and at that moment she was balled and chained on the whole subject some of you are liable to take that literally it was actually only forbidden to leave and i said you for the first time are going to really learn what grade process is and youre going to run every single one of those processes and youre going to run them perfectly and youre going to produce results because as of this minute you have certs and awards of any kind whatsoever and you get em back just as fast as you put that pc together each grade he makes you get your cert back on that grade took him all the way through to power the guy was absolutely flying you couldnt recognize him at all it was almost over her dead body that shed do this she didnt like him i think but all of sudden he made it all the way she made it all the way all came out right in the end she wasn t auditing on her own determinism laughs thats how exact and good standard tech can be it was quite remarkable it was remarkable feat its much more than i tell you in just this little thing it was win of years duration years duration its great now what did she have to do she had to do exactl nothing but exactly what i told her to do and if she so much as wiggled her little finger god help her and even though she was unwilling to audit him even though she didnt even like the guy even though so on and so on it all came right on up the line therefore the processes which youre using can easily easily easily bypass mere objection you see youre not dealing with let us assume the ibis position you are not dealing with if you take vitamin day the dogs will go away youre not dealing with bunch of old wives tales youre dealing with something that is hot as ninety foot circumference buzz saw you got to learn how to run this buzz saw cause itll go right straight up the line you dont monkey with this buzz sa w you do exactly what the buzz saw says and if somebody under your direction doesnt do what the buzz what you say and does something else well you just turn the buzz saw in to hlm little bit sideways you make it go you make it go right and it will go you can make it go right in the most impossible situations you ever heard of as long as you keep the guy right on the main highway youve got channels and edges on that road he cant go into the ditch you mustnt let him go into the ditch there is an infinity of ditch to go into there is only one road so therefore the approaches to session are simp ly the approaches ive been giving you there arent other approaches to the session you really cant audit covertly wawafafaawagaaw i can give you an infinity of other circumstances these are the things which you handle with session and you dont go anyplace with session unless youve got those things handled now the grade processes you go up the line through have just about as much choice in wording as though they were branded four feet deep on concrete wall there is variation not the faintest variation clearing the command the exact command the exact administration of the process the exact end phenomena it is drill of tremendous precision and that is what youre leading up to when you get those rudiments in and so forth youre leading to this moment where the next grade is to be done and then youve got him all set up and you do just exactly that you tell him what it is you clear the command you get make sure that he knows the command and pollyvolly and he goes on through he doesnt miss and you fumblebumble i wonder where the where is the trim knob wheres the directions for the emeter its hcob lets see the grade chart what are the commands for level 1 and so on this meters terribly new meter just take ive seen it on the he wont go up the highway any fumblebumble at all any slightest any slightest wiggle woggle and indecision and have to think to get the datum and and so forth it there is goes you havent got it i mean theyre not it you havent got the session you havent got the preclear he didnt go anyplace you got it its like marksma n marksma n hes trying to find the trigger on the rifle where is the trigger wheres the trigger you think hes ever going to hit any bulls eyes so here you have the variability of the rudiments the variabilities involved in setting up case the variabilities by which you can run green form or run an l4a or an l1 and in each of those you just get the thing done somehow and the rule is uniformly it sets itself right by itsa or it goes earlier you can on such thing as l1 indicate the bpc reads you can indicate the bpc but you would be very foolish person indeed to be indicating the bpc on something you didnt know what the pc had just read on cause it might be false read you always have to find out what it is which is itsa now you could indicate the bpc in the matter now that that would take it out of the line you can indicat the bpc very complexly theres an old bulletin there that tells you how to indicate bpc oh my god its perfectly ok to do it that way but thats that body of auditing now those are the body of auditing of repair now you also have to know what the process was to know what you are repairing see now that is working with the pc to set it right and that is usually backwards look and you dont do review actions to get case gainsl only one thing to the contrary and thats ot4 it is now review action because the whole rundown it can get so damn many gains for the guy that there have to be done at ot4 before he starts ot5 that its just review action now only its really not review action its sort of tech action but you start send ing people to review its because they cant get on the next process all my life ive had this heavy feeling in my stomach well you send the guy to review why is anything wrong with his auditing theres nothing wrong with his auditing what s wrong with him is his stomach well does that mean scientology wont handle things like this yes scientologyll handle things like this itll handle on the next grade or two sometimes it handles on the next grade and then then drifts sort of back and then two or three grades later or sections later all of sudden he runs into it head on and it does solve then for gods sakes see but youre not auditing the significances and pecu liarities of individuals these are infinite in number you have the main road why are you running up and down these little side paths any of the gradestll handle anything so to hell with it i mean walking up the grade line will eventually handle anything but anything you dont have to have process that handles this and process that handles that dont get yourself associa ted with little doctor that has little pill case there are pink pills green pills orange pills and blue pills now if the individual has toothache you give him green pill and so forth waffa waffa waffa well youre not in that business youre not in that business well there are undoubtedly processes which might do him this and that and the other thing you could straighten this and that and the other thing out but the truth of the matter is on your main line of auditing on your main line of auditing its always grade action that handles the pc now there are certain actions that run through the entirety one secondary running engram running and arc breaks also missed withholds and also ptps run all the way from hundred lifetimes ago to ot8 those processes still remain valid still remain valid well the faults i find with scientologists is they very often will see somebody fall on his head get run over by truck and do some kind of light touch assist and say thats that and then wonder why the guy is limping and then they sort of say scientology doesnt work man ive got word for you that auditor is afraid of work do you see an engram could be run at any time but then this isnt review action it comes under the heading of an assist its engram running as n assist now you say well god if engram running can be done as an assist what couldnt you do oh yes thats right you can always run an engram you can always run secondary i dont care where the grade is but i got news for you know how to run it know how to run engrams the funniest thing engrams dont run if you dont know how to run engrams i get so disgusted looking at somebody who allegedly knows how to run engrams or know how to run secondaries this is an actual one and he says recall moment of loss r ecall of moment of loss and i looked at the thing and i said what the hell were you doing what were you doing in this session what were you doing what what the hell was going on what what what what is this whats this it was running secondary suffering godfrey if thats gotten into the line up holy christ now you see the truth of the matter is that you can take thing like secondary which is in present time near present time the individuals got all of his restimulators for it and you can key it out to f n snap just like that and then the person walks around the corner and meets joe who is associated with it and it keys back in just like that and then you can as an auditor give the guy slight recall of it and it keys out to f n snap just like that and he can go around another corner and he runs into restimulator of it and it thump back in just like that and you can just keep this up eventually itll wear out but i call to your attention that it is about the slowest possib method i know of of running secondary now i have had to pick up two cases two cases who in actual fact were severely severely bogged on an assist level of secondary and engram running that auditors had stood right in front of them sat down in the auditing chair asked them what it was all about and the individual is all boggled up it comes under the heading of secondary can make somebody so depressed that they feel physically ill they feel old its pecul iarity they feel energyless and old and used up and so on and youre in to audit this see youre trying to audit this and youre trying to audit this oh nothing flies there isnt any reason to run anything on the thing why well the guy she just lost her husband he isnt even cold in the ground and some damn fool auditor will say do you recall your moment of loss and so forth yes i guess i do oh good that f nd oh yes i feel much better yes i feel much better shell feel that much better for the next ten or fifteen minutes dont you see what you have to know is the mechanism of release and an auditor that does this sort of things damn fool now good auditor would say now wait minute this characters was doing all right really fell on her head you understand im talking to you about an exception from grade auditing these are the things that can go the whole line see but whats messed up lifes gotta be corrected see some its gone this way in life see theres been life intervention of magnitude that has driven this person off and you can get the idea that if the cannon ball came along and blew off your pcs head he wouldnt be able to make the next grade he wouldnt be there to hold the cans well id say at that exaggerated level its the same thing when person was an innocent bystander and all of sudden why they had this big secondary occur bombo big loss of some kind or another and ive had good auditor good auditor if he was on the ball and he knew his business and so forth he wouldnt ask questions about this or something like that he he would know this and the c s would be informed she just lost her husband and the c s would say alright get in your ruds and run the secondary of death only please that would be run the secondary of death run it run its the fisrt moment he enters the incident wwhat is the duration of the incident and so forth when did you first hear in the news of the subject you know bong what is the duration of the incident alright move through the incident and so on just like it says in the handbook and you go through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and you spill few gallons and quarts of tears and mise motion comes up theres such thing as fear secondary i was terrified the guy was terrified hes been in state of shock hes dead white ever since he can run terror secondary perfectly easy to do this but life has knock ed him sideways you can put him back on the line alright he didnt get up high enough to get his grades fast enough in order to keep life from knocking him in the head and to this degree you can give him an assist and straighten him out another person was given an s and d and i dont know what all to straighten out severe illness i got hold of the pc found the pcd been ill asked the pc whats she been doing told at once ran him to the first moment of the incident ran him through it zoom zoom zoom zoom that was the end of the illness and one of the one of the lazy part of this problem however is do you know it can take nine hours to run secondary it can take ten or twelve hours to run real engram you only run it to f n of course but running it it doesnt just key out it erases you are now dealing with the category of clearing youre erasing the engram youre erasina the secondary thats different alright ill give you the circumstances this is an assist type action the individual was doin all right they were gain on up the line and they stepped under truck now youve got to get him back on the main line again how do you do that well you can give them contact assist taking him to that place if it is neces sary to where the accident happened and make him touch that place and so forth with the part of the body that was hurt touch the object that hurt them and work on it on contact assist just directly one right after the other alwa ys the best type of assist is that contact assist and the somatic runs out you wait for the somatic to run out and so on it runs out when it runs out and bang that is it if you cant get him to that place and so on you run touch assist and the touch assist is run with feel that finger and so on and if the injury was very severe indeed after youve done the touch assist little bit later you come along and you run the engram and that is complete assist now how come were knockin g off all of sudden this business of running the engram cause the person might it might go past an f n now let assure you youd have to be completely ignorant of the phenomena of an f n an f n occurs when the person disconnects from the masses connected with something he ceases to make them and ceases to be there and he disco nnects f rom them alright so he gets an f n now you can disconnect person from his whole bank which is greats which is great and that is what is called release its release of this type and release of that type and the central things you have to disconnect to bring him up the lines are the grade processes right to five so find out what youre doing youre just making him disco nnect thats all the only grades that that is not true on are secondaries and engrams youre erasing something there now hes gain on up the line and only when he gets to clear do you find the final mechanism as far as he is concer ned and why hes doing it what hes doing that isnt the end of it but his bank at that moment or what he knows of in his bank goes brrrroooom erased gone now its the difference between this ashtray ceasin g to exist gone completely and the ashtray simply being put off release is the ashtray being put away gone ashtray is an erased ashtray gone secondary is an erased secondary so you can actually do this you can key out secondary longer thinks that kind of thing you key out secon dary and you can say well to key it out again would be an overrun oh thats so true to key it out before it had keyed in again would be an overrun and to go on keying out something that has been keyed out would be anoverrun but do you know that you can key it out turn right around and plunge him right straight into it again and run it without the slightest conseq uences the ta doesnt go up nothing the proof of the pudding of this whole thing is whats the behavior of the meter now this is the only time you can go by an f n that is two different processes one youre releasing and the others going to clear it so you could get release on this engram and then erase it now itd be much to your horror if you found out actually at the moment of release he had also sort of blown it he had done both actions at once then you might be little embarrassed but ive never seen it happen so you could get release on secondary alright her husbands dead alright good husbands dead now what are we gonna to do were gonna recall moment of loss good floating needle shes saying oh thank heaven i feel so much better and she goes home and she opens up her drawer to get out her powder puff and theres his watch gaal well your release did her some good but she could come right back to you in session and you could do the exact same thing as before and get her to recall finding his watch and itd key out and you go floating needle again and then she could go home and open the close t and find his hat and this could just keep up ad nauseas she could keep keying it in and you could keep keying it out do you see then such things about the fellow has had wreck in this car and he drives to work in it every morning its repaired and he goes on driving to work in it every morning and the next thing you know he develops this horrible neuralgia on the side of his head well its restimulated all the time now if he drove it long enough and restimulated it hard enough and was in it often enough and went past the place frequently enough where he had the accident it would run the engram it wouldnt just key it out it would actually well the familiarity and so on and would just sort of run it out he is hes running through it every time he goes about anything so gone you know oooh and then he sees little picture go by and then that kind of hell keep doing this do you see well so you have to choose whether or not this is an assist action which is necessar by reason of the restimulators of the environment so person can only be released now when hes released on communications he doesnt release from one engram lets look at this he doesnt release from one secondary he doesnt release from one speci fic action he actually may very well be releasing from hundreds of trillions of years of such actions all in an own little flicker of an eye now the length of time it would take to key that back in because hes not on those planets anymore hes not even in that space and time hes not even in that era anymore so its very valid release indeed itll take quite while to key that one back in do you see so hes having difficulties with problems and all of sudden he has cognition that just roars on the whole track it isnt even that he can think on the subject of the whole track but he suddenly has chan ge of mind concer ning the subject of problems christ how long is it going to take to key that back in again man youd really have to bail this guy under to do that do you see now you see why the releases are valid but why releasing guy from specif ic instance in an engram that has to do with injury and unconsci ousness or secondary that has to do with loss you see how these things differ they differ they differ consi derably now as c s you are going to have this sort of situation this individual has had something happen to him in life is driven off the line and youre going to have to order that the engram of it be found and erased and you would only err if the auditor erred now one of the little bits and pieces thats missin g off the line is that if secondary on the secon d run through beco mes more solid you have to send the pc with the same procedure to the earlier secondary to an earlier secondary and if that secondary by the second pass through it running the pc through it becomes more solid and begins to beco more solid you have to send him to an earlier secondary the test is that is beco mes more solid and if you dont do that and if you dont know that you can wrap pc around telegraph pole but i notice that it is missing from the rundown on engram running by chains in this dianetic auditors course book at this time and it is being reinserted into the book and is the subject of at this moment is the subject of hcob 28 september 68 class viii im carefully inspecting back bulletins to find out whats been missed whats disappeared out on the line up and that for some reason or others disappeared on the second pass through if it gets more solid you go to the earlier incident now that doesnt mean you go from secondary to an earlier engram it means you go from secon dary to an earlier secondary to an earlier secondary to an earlier secondary on the engram line you go from an engram to an earlier engram to an earlier engram and ive got news for you this isnt just this isnt just for only for your little guy whos doing an assist this is the only way youre going to solve some section threes and section three is going to have to be audited just that way so you better get hotter than pistols running engrams none on three is this lifetime injury which has impacted all the body thetans into one chunk and is handled by running that engram loosens them all up and away they go now you can run three there is case there is case there never has been case that has none on three that had one on three that had two on three that had five on three such cases there isnt any case that suddenly read the instructions and all of sudden whee they all went away and he didnt have to do anything after that bullshit so you have to know engram running and you have to be damn good engram runner because that engram is gonna run like bitch youre really gonna have to have session control to handle it cause all the time pcll be telling you well i dont know why youre doing this its just evaluation on the whole thing because that really has nothing to do with hes just talking out of the basic incident all the way he isnt protesting the auditor hes talking out of the basic incident and you roll it right on down the line and smash bingo thud there is an exact rundown which you will have oh looks to like you better get very familiar with this ole process known as running engrams as far as running secondaries is concer ned you can have somebody around and this arc break is so thoroughly encysted in grief and so forth that you can key it out and it keys in you key it out and it keys in you get tired of it after while run the secondary where is it what is it person comes into session every time with howling arc break in grief and all upset cleaned up and got review three days from now gonna do the same thing clean it all up goes f n she feels great few days later feels terrible is all very sad you look for arc break of long duration youre liable to find yourself sitting there holding onto secondary roll up your sleeves and audits why be lazy run it establish what it is because it wont itll just keep releasing and comi ng back and releasing and comi ng back and this becomes one of these weird cases that you really cant quite do anything with or for dont you see rocketybockety its one of its one of the types that are very difficult to do anything for they keep getting caught up in this present time situation but if it were out of this lifetime i wouldnt bother with it id leave that for seven eight way up the line see when they can handle such things but you find out two years ago she was doing all right the case was doing all right and then all of sudden she vwaff waff waff and theres period there and that has been handled before and its handled before and its somebody ran it before and so forth so you just roll up your sleeves and you run it and that is the only real criticism i have of modern auditor youre perfectly willing to learn im willing to take responsibility for the fact that some guys hooked things out of the line up and so on but the one thing i cant understand why you would omit from your repertoire would be secondary and engram running for good good solid nothing but secondary and engram running running em to free needle of course stopping them when you get the free needle theyre gone theyre erased naturally you run em through you get the free needle only that time that needle damn it will stay free after youve freed up the needle four or five times on the same subject i should think youd get the word run it the persons gonna keep falling on their head the reason why you shouldnt shouldnt drop it out of your repertoire if you want advertising pieces its pieces on whom you have run secondary or an engram that is close to pt because their before and after is extreme and hes going around looking like he was an old lady about ninety years old and creeping about and so forth and hes been digged in this way ever sznce the house burned down and she lost her all and people know how this character looks like alright you take this person just run the secondary if that one goes solid theres an earlier one with loss you have to run the earlier one if that goes solid you run the earlier one follow the same rules but you just go to that secondary get the moment of it get the duration of it follow it through brooom brooom brooom grind away grind away grind away through and through and through and spill and spill and tears and sorrow and shame blame regret apathy through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and some of these cases you wouldnt believe your eyes youre sitting there youre sitting there looking at somebody who looks like theyre only about twenty years old ive seen in person running an engram ive seen person running an engram goiter at least six inches in diameter recede and completely vanish with all signs thereof within half an hour after the engram was finished it isnt for every time action but there are miracles to be found on it there are rather wonderful things that can happen so you start omitting this from your repertoire youve got rocks in your head so class viii should know how to run an engram because there are going to be some cases you run into that wont just wont go anyplace unless you run an engram and theres the other little interesting thing is you wont be able to shove anybody up through the later ot sections unless you can run an engram theyre just gonna hang right there unless youre sharper than pistol on running engrams but running engrams is lot of fun when you have good meter and you have the technology of engram running as it was finally developed its gas nothing to it its ball and it doesnt take as long as youd think but dont dont be suddenly upset if it the session is twelve hours long you can break one of those sessions but when you break the session youve got to get in all the ruds fly the needle again before you start him back into it see you dont have breaks which go back to the same action every time you have this trouble with breaks every time you have break every time you have new session youve got to fly the youve got to fly the ruds so you have to know this sort of thing now to show you how far out it can get and so on i dont think people today really know how to do touch assist i dont know what happened to the touch assist but i was fascin ated to have whole group of scientologists not very long ago absolutely amazed watching with the most intense fascination watching do touch assist correct and by the book they knew that you touch assist left and right but they didnt know any of the fars or nears they didnt know that you followed the nerve chan nels it was quite interesting quite interesting touch assist is highly complex action it isnt just jabbing the guy in the ribs saying something or other and the action is elementary actually the area the area that youre doing touch assist from you approach on gradient and recede from on gradient and if you have for instance an elbow injury or something like that you would for sure go further from the head than the elbow eventually but if you wanted to practically kill the guy why youd go immediately and directly to an area further down the arm than the elbow as the first touch now contact assist also has its gradients and you do it equally on both sides of the body and its just feel my finger and so forth but you have to also go down the nerve channels cause theres where the current is locked up and there are twelve nerves in the spine and any injury that is severe in the body has to have the whole spine released on the subject and its far and near gradient approaches comi ng back g oing forward so what what if we can forget an assist or it can evaporate lot of things can evaporate on the lines but your job is to hold standard thats why im telling you these things your job is to hold it standard now i havent told you all there is to know about touch assist but i will i havent told you all there is to know about engram running but it is down except for the one data i gave you and as far as im concerned the technology has stayed together pretty well pretty well there arent many pieces of it missing enough of its missing to make some of you curious and people have not held the standard well enough in its application to put it where it should go and now assembling it all putting it together maki ng straight line proposition that is right down the middle of highway with wide open throttle with everything we know about it were in position to make it win but it will keep winning just as long as you continue as you continue to hold the standard thank you very much mechanics of techniques and subject matter lecture given on 29 september 1968 thank you and so we come to lectu re number six lecture number six and we still count very good twenty nine september ad 18 class vi ii course there are many things which i could take up tonight the org students did their first auditing today there were two well dones one apparent false auditing report and three oh my god how could yous and amongst these apparently somebody doesnt know why list is done list is done to bring about cognition on question well let give it an exact order cognition on the subject blowing to f n realization of the question blowing to f n or an item blowing to f n or processed or relisted as in remedy b going to f n and thosere the only reasons you do list and my god you dont do list to have complete list because as near as i can figure from this auditing report the list was being corrected on the basis that is was complete i dont give damn about complete list now lets take how an auditing question can blow up on subject the fellow says were now going to do pr pr 4 and the subject of this is source sources boombol f n by golly i did realize that that that thats is wrong yes its been wrong i havent really been recognizing that and the auditor says if the auditor is one of these ones that you drop six pence in or penny in or depending what country youre in he goes on and says uh i havent done my job and the knucklehead will then try to clear the questions try to run the session and the ta will go up up up up up there is such case folder right in your case folder collection it blew up on the subject of pr pr 4 and then the auditor tried to clear the commands and tried to run it and he ran it for an hour and half and the tone arm was going out through the roof and then by simply rehabbing the f n it went snap right back to the fact that the guy had cognited at the moment that the subject of the process was g iven to him now if that could happen on process therefore it can happen on list but very often one doesnt announce the list but the pc all of sudden can get what the auditor is at are you connected to suppressive person or some such question is asked and the pc says what brand new idea you know wow and the auditor then says alright were going to do the wsu well christ hes got an f n right in front of his face and all hes gonna get out of that is rising tone arm now another instance given the subject for whats going to go on little bit of an r factor lecture on the subject but were gonna run so and so and the question is so and so now what do you understand with this question and at that moment something goes boom you see f n now i have seen something thats so completely insane so utterly insane that the person actually if he wound up in the hands of psych oanalyst i wouldnt say word and that is he has the pc put down the cans while we look it up in the dictionary jesus christ almighty god you mean you let pc off the cans from the moment the session starts to the end of the set bull never you say well hows he gonna turn the pages of the dictionary well what the hells he doing turning the pages of the dictionary the auditor got broken arm pc isnt let off the cans ever during session because an f n can occur at any time in the session and every now and then ill see in old reports took the pc off the cans so he could look up the word and then the tone arm starts up up up up up up up up up 425 the auditor going on and bla bla bla and bla bla bla and the next item or the next bla bla bla and bla bla bla and the next item or the next question and the tone arm going up 425 45 all the way up well where could the floating needle have been it was when he took the pc off the cans the pc looked it up in the dictionary and cognited because that is point where it can go it can go on the command the clearing of the command it can go on the first auditing question asked without it being answ ered or it can go on the first answ er second answe r and actually most often goes on the first answe r on lists the first item and these godawful painful lists which you see that go eighty nine pages or something of this sort are either listing dead horse or the item was the first item so you dont let the pc off cans because those are the sequences of f n ive just given you and it happens on list and it happens on process and it can happen at any time it can happen at any time any time so dont let the pc off the cans for any reason under the sun moon or stars now i will tell you another kooky one ill give you another kooky circumstance with regard to all of this and that is this electronics men think an emeter works because hands swea t and i havent been around orgs to shoot the electronics men who say this and as net result of all of this they remain unshot and they do talk and in this great advance d modern societ in which we live they think that galvanometer works because of hand sweat now the fellow you can just see the fellow swea ting and unsweating he swea ts read and he unsw eats read and he swea ts read and he unswe ats read and he sweats read and he unswe ats read and that is mirrored in the fact of pc wiped his hands and tone arm rose now i imagine some low ta case figured this out that if the pc wiped his hands and then you got higher ta read then immediately and directly and instantly it was the swea t which gave him the low ta read ill tell you what gives low ta read three bthetans that is low ta the whole of low ta the whole subject of low ta is contained in that pc has attested three tone arm 12 now that is something which comes from male cows when you see ta dive guys got bthetans now thered be eight thousand seven hundred and sixty five additional reasons why person doesnt have this or doesnt have that and we could have an infinity of wrongnesses there is reason of my harping on certain sets of wrongnesses im just showing you what goofynesses can come up now listen very carefully when the pc puts down the cans and moves his hands and arms the body density mass of the bthetan beefs up so that when he goes back on the cans again the ta is reading higher im afraid you cannot avoid these horribly factual facts that pc who gets low ta is an unflat three now we had an auditor here today very very puzzled very puzzle d as to how his meter beautifully trimmed at the beginning of session went out of trim during the session at the end of session was found marvelously out of trim and this he was being very mystified about he doesnt know this fact it takes while for meter and can to warm up so the pc grabs hold of the cans or the meter is turned on and if you instantly trim it at that precise instant that its turned on you are turning on cold circuit and youre trimming cold circuit it takes minute or two for the circuit to warm up and your trim will change and this is not true of all emeters some of them heat up faster than others but its safe bet that if youre going to do trim check on meter you do it at the end of session not at the beginning of session and whats your meter doing so far out of trim do you carryit around by the trim knob my meters from one months end to the next just stay where theyre supposed to stay so i dont know why other peoples meters dont unless they uses the trim knob to scratch their heads or something but the point im maki ng here is there are certain data now when you see people trying to avoid this data they have they feel the data is discreditable to themselves or somebody to whom it is discreditable is trying to argue them out of it now you can have this kind of fire fight develop up the line someplace there is such thing as service facsim ile there is such thing as service facsimile its very amusing because that will be the guys service facsimile now this is this bad you can get somebody who is in foul foul condition in his life as far as casualties accidents that sort of thing is concerned and he gets to three and he cant find any he cant find any at all and the ideas upsetting to him now if his grades are out and he has not come up well through his grades his level of reality will not be adequate to embrace three anyway and so you have people going around every now and then you will find somebody going around and saying well idea of body thetans na na ah yeah yeah not true now he consi ders it discreditable he himsel f wants to invalidate it for some reason or another so he starts spreading it about so as to discredit the information and this blocks the way for an awful lot of people so therefore youve got to have grip on your standard data which is sufficient to stand up to all of this cockeyedness this is wild stuff that comes around crazy crazy stuff there is one going in angeles i think it is right this minute that it wont be possib to become clear or ot its not possib to make these grades out of seventy people polled twenty of them thought it was impossible and they wouldnt be able to make it and they didnt have much reality on it whos been at work there one of the first things you see is the invalidation of the state of clear reality is fascinating thing reality is proportional to the amount of charge off case if you took clearing course materials and handed em over to some wog he would look them over and scratch his head maybe come down with cold or something if he tried to run them if you tried to run them on him your possib ility of doing so is so microscopically remote and most of em wouldnt even upset him thats how far they are from clear because there is this stable datumthe amount of charge off case is proportional to the reality also proportional to the awareness so you have somebody walking down the street and there are four elephants and these four elephants are walking down in squad formation and each one of thems carrying green banners and you say to this fellow what the hell four elephants walking down the middle of the streets and he says wha t elephants just that just what elephants so it is very fascinating people are unaware to the degree that they havent got much reality anyway now you let one ofthese monkeys come along and tell you what reality is do you follow its one of these incredible nonsense propositions the whole subject of reality is mixed up in the subject of perception the subject of recognition the subject of truth you wonder how in the name of god the people of this planet could be lied to cause brother can they be lied to look at the newspapers they buy now if you want to know how much truth is in the newspapers all you have to do is read the report about scientology now you know thats for the birds what about the story at the right and left of the one about scientology did you ever think of that theyre just as lying as the one about scientology see the newspa pers at this certain level of action here at this particular time are not particularly kicking back at us they as matter of fact their last report at least they were doing very well indeed but the level of truth the level of truth isnt there and yet these are the people who are keeping people informed well think of the people who are keeping them informed and think of the people who are quote being informed unquote see unreality one of your basic protests is unreality but unreality is proportional to the amount of charge on the case these guys are pretty charged up arent they so theyre in figurefigure bogglewoggle snuggleluggled hanging around theres an old comic strip character joe bliffelstick something like that and he always went around with little rain cloud over his head you know thats the boy thats your standard issue humanoid today see hes got too much storm going on right in his immediate vicinity to see very much out there now the quality of the charge taken off the case is very important if you take charge off on the main line of the grades as they go up why it is basic charge which then blows lot of side charge now if you just took charge off on mass without any judgement as to whether or not it was main line just take charge off just get the emeter to read put person on the cans get the emeter to read probably at the and of fifty sixty years of auditing something like that thered be great oddity would occur his reality would come up to ot do you follow now what weve got is way to go right through the fiddle of the charge line to remove those central charges which then dischar ge all the side charges now pc usually feels better in some way or another but an auditor who badly audits that is who audits very poorly can actually put as much charge on the case as he takes off he can invalidate the case the pc says why you know i feel better i i didnt i have floating needle or something and the auditor says case like yours sir well you do the same thing you say who or what has unmocked you or something and question didnt read person isnt pts now youve given him the evaluation that hes suppressed because youre going to now list the list so the list lists out to dead horse but the pc seems charged up alright ill give you another example of it the list is charged it does read and you give him the wrong item alright when you give him the wrong item youll hang him with that little pocket of charge because that isnt the item so it didnt dischar ge the list so youve got the charge of the list hung up in the fact that hes now got wrong item so that after listing action is done or after listing action session if the ta is high it was wrong item thats its very elementary tas high wrong item youre busy listing away listing away madly on case getting up to your hundred and fifty fifth page or something like this and you notice the ta is starting up well youre putting charge on the case do you see that your tone arm the tore arm is in actual fact the measure of accumulation of charge the needle surges are just gradients of the tone arm you can get tone arm actually behaving like needle and tone arm over long period of time does behave like needle tone arm measures the amount of chargeup on the case at that particular time when you get into the higher ot sections you will find something else very pecu liar happens you can find that your pc will lean on something and drive his ta up and you can do your nut as review auditor trying to get this ta down on some guy who is up around six seven eight levels and his ta is up boy its up 475 or something like that and you suddenly sort it out and you find out hes leaning on something well at that level he can lean on something so much harder than anybody ever thought of that of course you are reading the side of building or you are reading the density of the ridge he is maki ng against his body and you can fish it around actually to find out what he is doing and all of sudden why he says well you what am i doing i well pushing on the ceiling slllll down she come now you can actually reverse this when he is ot8 you can reverse this and as far as meter is concer ned you can put him on the meter have him connected with the body and then have him lean on the wall just lean on the wall not go through any energy body grips and so forth after all the guy isnt the body have him lean on the wall and youll watch your ta come right on up unlean off the wall and it goes down in other words at high levels your ta starts to behave like needle which is quite quite interesting but your needle you see is just sort of of smal l easily read ta they are connected so you put more charge on the case down at lower level the guy isnt leaning on anything but the guys got lot of body thetans or something like that and remember that from three down you are auditing somebody with body thetans so very peculiar things can happen and you can audit him incorrectly do an incorrect action and have the ta go up you can incorrectly list him you can overrun him and so on youve got something leaning against something something maki ng more mass than it did before so you havent taken char ge off the case youve put charge on the case so if your ta is higher at session end than it was at the beginning the case is more char ged up at the end than it was t the beginning elementary do you follow i mean these these these this is this is very easy this is very easy the auditor through incorrect actions put more water in the bucket than he took out and of course the tone arm measu ring the amount of water in the bucket will of course measu re more water in the bucket its its its just that elementary it its not very esoteric datum were dealing in actual fact with creature who can make mass and who does make mass and the mass which he makes below three or actually below seven the mass he makes and so on is normally bank mass now if he is given an item which isnt his item he then has been given something which he then grips and which stays with him and its very funny phenomenon that wrong item will be remembered very very easily by the pc now theres piece of rehabbing which is at this stage of the game being done wrong i dont know why you guys keep askin g for service facsimile i notice lot of pcs can give you their service facsimile what the hells he doing remembering his service facsimile now it isnt true that because he can remember his service facsim ile it wasn t his service facsimile but youre asking pc to do rather considerable feat youre asking him to remember something that has probably been erased and instead of rehabbing it youre keying it back in again so i dont know why you keep asking him for the wording i saw folder here the other day it came in from an org and it said it wasnt his service facsimile because he couldnt remember it and its probably the one valid service facsimile thats passed through the lines its whether or not it rehabs whether or not it goes f n that thats thats the whole test does it go f n right thats it now the other thing the other thing which you must get very straight as far as emeter reactions and processes and so on that you must get very straight is that where an item or process brought about state of release there is an f n there to rehab and if it doesnt rehab he didnt go release at that point well you say well how many times can you rehab this things i dont know infinity so you say alright lets rehab this fellows grades and you could make this mistake as c s as case supervisor say lets rehab this fellows grades tell him rehab the grades and this auditor obediently tries to rehab arc straightwire tone arm rose you give him hell because he rehabbed it wrong or you say its been rehabbed too many times i saw remark in case summ ary here today theres complete error the person has been overrun on ruds now person couldnt be overrun on ruds not possib to be overrun on ruds it is possib to overrun one particular arc break but it is not possible to overrun the whole subject of arc breaks so when you see this you tried to rehab arc straightwire and it didnt rehab and the tone arm went up and you fish around trying to find the point of rehab and it didnt exist why naturally at that stage of the game youre going to get rising tone arm its as easy as that so what do you do about this you say well i couldnt possib ly do this its obviously been overrun well you gotta make up your mind its either been overrun or not run at all one of the ways to do this is to run it and you say god thats adventurous yeah it is yes but what the hells this guy doing being being grade three without his arc straightwire in see so you run it blows down it f ns thats the first time it was ever run i assure you supposing as you tried to run it it just really shot up well at that time you could indicate that it was overrun and try to fish around and find out what in the name of common sense happened to it one of the things just would be to date the session in which it was supposed to have been rehabbed supposed to have been run and get the buttons in on that session because there might have been crash ing invalidation on the session of something that swallowed up the f n in some weird fashion it couldnt have been an f n which appeared below the invalidation dont get that sort of thing there was an f n but the auditor wound up on the guy and told him that wasn t it that it was good or something and the guy cant remember this session because it was sort of painful something bad happened in the session well you could you could rehabilitate the session and get the f n so obviously obviously your right procedure would be youre getting somebody you wanna rehab arc straightwire well the fellow might be protesting it being rehabbed because this is the hundred and fifth time and hes tired of the whole thing so you got protest on it something like that doesnt rehab see it doesnt rehab the tone arm starts up well now it could be protested not overrehabbed but certainly protested the rehabbing of it it could have been that the session is too painful in which it was run the later part of the session was very painful but the early part of the session was all right something goofy like this so one of the things would be to date the thing do just standard dating on your meter date the session and get in some buttons on the session and see if anything happens then youre liable to get yourself an f n now if that action didn t occur this is this is rather working very hard at it see and this is how to be very safe but if that action didnt occur it didnt ever f n it didnt ever f n thats it somebody was t elling lie but your tone arm the tone arm only means overrun when it goes up on something you are running high tone arm means generality of overruns in life you can have person with high tone arm that oh boys does he got overruns in life its quite remarkable how many overruns there can be in life and one of your standard actions is to get the life overruns off of the case and boy does that cool off tas wow now let show you what kind of errors can creep in just as so youre safe guarded against your tech being shot to hell somebody says that you must only get life overruns in this lifetime because the pc liable to get back and bad things are liable to happen and whole track doesnt exist anyway somebody is trying to invalidate whole track so he says you mustnt ever try to try to get hold of life overruns earlier than this lifetime because its liable to get the pc upset well its very very interesting there have been crude versions of engram running on the whole track they apparently didnt have meters then comm ands god knows what they were but somebody on the whole track here and there has tried to run engrams and they inevitably have overrun them so youre liable to find an engram overrun of eighty one million years ago this guy says youre running this process what has been overrun youre running this process and the guy says whats been overrun and it occurs to him engrams good and you try now you limited by askin g what session you see and pin his attention up here in pt somewhere you know in what foundation you see you could limit your question so that he could never rehab it but its obviously been overrun because it reads as overrun but you cant get an f n well now if you know the tools of your trade this wont baffle you do you remember what i told you about the incredible the pcs data man is not something that you as case supervisor or an auditor have god damned thing to do with any time auditing may be run on the only on those things which conform to current opinion any time that phenomenon occurs and its liable to occur at any time because the actually the first foundation the dianetic foundation really blew up on just this one point the board of directors was so upset over the comm otion past lives would cause that they tried to pass resolution saying that more research must be done into the field of past lives well we had parting of the ways anyway because obviously to wrap up the subject one had to research what was there now lets get somebody researching under the bideaw ee college faculty theres this guy with high choke collar and very prim tremendous number of missed withholds second dynamic overts of various kinds but respectable citizen and all of sudden somebody says that hes going to do little research in this line or theyre gonna practice this and that why he permits scientology to be run in that university only so long as nobody just fill in the missin g lines see you could fill in as long as nobody tries to pull missed withholds see as long as we never go into past lives as long as the subject religion is not touched as long do you get the idea you could fill it in see so you get limitation now that is limitation of the preclears data auditing has nothing to do with data it has to do with techn ique so the pc tells you theres eighteen elephants walking on the ceiling boy its not up to you to correct him he can take snoot full of some outrageous drug or gasoline or something and its marvelous we have people who have gone wing ding on gasoline i well i guess they were in the valence of car laughter and hes trying to run out this incident see and this incident has pink elephants walking upside down on the ceiling it has black bats flying in and out of his ears now psychi atry when they found data like that instantly and at once invalidated the person and then they might put it down in their report but their idea of making the thing come out straight was telling the person what the truth was now that is whole failed line it is totally failed it is fighting its last ditch fight as i speak to you now its going to go over niagara falls with barrel boy because one of the tricks it uses is when it interferes with somebody or implants somebody is to put an incredible perception in the implant so if the person says anything about it it will sound so incredible he can then be pronounced insan so you havent got anything to do with the pcs data what he tells you is what he tells you so you do list now lets get what just exactly what i mean we do list and were doing this list and he puts down pink elephants and who or what has suppressed you and he puts down pink elephants catterwacks martians dog biscui t and theres this hellish fall and he sits up and laughter and the damned thing goes f n you dont even have chance to null the list there it is of course you say dog biscui ts and it reads and you say thats your item and he says yeah that sure is you say alright dog biscui ts thats your item you see one of the things that gets wrong with the time track is it has incredibles on it and therefore an incredible is something that wont asis because its not credible the item is dog biscui ts hes been suppressed with dog biscuits some times you practically do your nut trying to figure out how the hell did he get loused up on the subject of dog biscui ts but actually if you went back into it inquired deeply which you shouldnt do but if you went back in to it sometimes the pc explains this to you it all sounds logical but youre interested in the mecha nics of it just the mechanics of it did it blow down was it the item on the list your action then is to verify and give it to the pc as his item those are the things which youre supposed to do not worry about whether or not its dog biscui ts do you see youre not interested in the in in in this data do you get the you get the different orientation on this thing it has nothing to do with you if you followed the exact mechanical steps necessar to resolve it why there you are youre interested in the reaction of the pc not his data the pc says oh yes boy do i have an arc break boy are they on to and so on theyre all pretty bad you know theyve been jumping all over with wicked people wicked people and so on well thats good by all means try to clean up this thing as an arc break at the moment and in the process of cleaning it up say ask him casua lly but not evaluatively if he has withhold and that reads and you pull it and then you check the arc break and it all of sudden doesnt read and the whole thing has cooled off reaction the pc was critical that means always invariably missed withhold see its that kind of thing youre interested in as an auditor not what the arc break was about but that he was arc broken not what the missed withhold was about but that he did have one do you get the differences now the subject of each one of the grades which is to say arc breaks withholds problems you name it but the subject of any grade the subject of any grade is timeless and endless it can always be run forever but not the commands of the grade supposing we tried to run pr pr 1 aa every time the pc looked worried and had problem man we would really wrap him around telegraph pole he would become overrun on that process right he never beco mes overrun on problems you you get the vast difference there he never hes never overrun on problems he is overrun on problems process he can be overrun for instance on problems of comparable magnitude problems of comparable magnitude problems of comparable magnitude problems of comparable magnitude and you in trying to put in the ruds had better well damn well not run any process at all arc break is arcu cdei which is just the trying to find out what the arc break is itsa or earlier itsa you do rudiments by itsa or earlier incident itsa on totality and they never beco overrun but if you insisted on running problem of comparable magnitude for every time you found pc with ptp you would very soon have this one wrapped around telegraph pole so the basic stable datum that you should know is that process can be overrun but the subject of grades the subject of grades can never be overrun for instance you cant overrun pr pry you you cant overrun pr pr 6 with regard to this youre asking the pc how life is well after all youre asking him some version of this as condition arent you but you start asking him about conditions vroooom booms do you see you could ask him how life is alright that also might seem to overrun pr pr 4 too or pr pr 5 right this could this could all of these so the basic background subject of it you can ask somebody what engram he is stuck in well youre trying to get revivification on pr pr 6 and usually do get one even thought it flicks through like that you could still find out what incident hes stuck in but you dont have to run the process p r pr 6 do you follow so the subject of being stuck in incidents inexhaustible every once in while you guys are talking about stuck picture the pc had stuck picture so the pc had stuck pictures its not very interesting pets have stuck pictures now supposing you run pr pr 6 every time the pc had stuck picture i dont know how much mass you would accumulate but boy you would soon have to move the pc with crane and truck now supposing after hes clear he has stuck picture and you tried to run it with power well in the first place it inevitably is somebody elses picture and he is not sufficiently permeating now into the other thetans around the only thing you can run it out of is body thetan and you prematurely beef up pr pr 3 and thats why you mustnt even rehab power you cant run power after hes clear the guy went clear without running power god almighty never run powerl dont ever rehab power after the guys clear but if the guy isnt clear but just on the clearing course and he cant seem to make it and he gets reality on it you go back an d find out he hasnt been run on power well run power because he isnt clear its elementary in actual fact there is not its not very complicated subject beyond this the only power thats available on clear is that you would get out of body thetan and he is being run with his pictures disowned which wraps it all around telegraph pole you can run basic track you can run r6 out of body thetans because thats where most of them are stuck anyhow alright now what whats this amount to what s this amount to we just take this datum as thoroughly stable thing but the subject the subject which you have to know on this see the subject of any grade you can run basic track you can run r6 on body thetan because thats where most of them are stuck anyhow alright now what whats this amount to what s this amount to we just take this datum as thoroughly as thoroughly stable thing but the subject the subject which you have to know on this thing the subject of any grade can be run at any time forever correct along about ot8 youre gonna have hell of time trying to run one of them but you couldnt any more overrun the guy on than it would neither run nor overrun do you see but the process the process the technique that process can be overrun because it is addressed to specific point of contact with the mind and with life and it snaps that and if you overrun it it puts it back again so engrams man engrams can be run from wog to angel secondaries can be run all over the damn track at any grade you ever heard of on any grade you could run an secondary straightwire but not the commands of straightwire but the whole idea of straightwire what the hell do you think youre doing when you put in ruds do you have ar arc break youre asking the guy to recall do you see you ran straightwire all the way communication what are you doing in an auditing session his arc breaks are mostly involved with the fact that his comm is cut or something like that problems although youve disconnected him from the large mass of problems and he now doesnt have all his vast number of problems that he had and the whole subject of problems is not overwhelming he can still have problem you get the idea it goes right on up the line and what do you know you can have guy at five he all of sudden has flea hit him in the teeth about his body thetan hits him body thetan with home he wakes up one fine morning and finds out he has whole bunch of r6 pictures where the hell did this come from i thought i ran all that out yeah he ran all that out but hes not up to point yet where he has turned off all of his attractiveness as thetan he hasn t yet found out that hes the one that grabs hold of body thetans they really dont grab hold of him they basical ly dont have enough reach laughter but until guy is so clear that you hit him on the left ear and it rings for hours as thetan as being hes not got any little trick pieces of mass that are incredible and so he hasnt bothered to notice that he is mocking them up all these little patch up points poor old body thetan around with home cant find hospital address something like that caroms hits the guy and probably would leave but finds himse lf stuck so you run you could shoot body thetan off and by the way they react very well to negative negative exteriorization commands try not to be ten thousand feet above the city laughter but the net gain of all of this is that you undoubtedly could not run body thetan out of wog you couldnt possib ly i dont think it could be done with pistol because you see theyre him he to them he is this composite being he is being but he is influencers by lot of composite beings he is not clust er somebody has originated this thing i am clust er you are cluster guy is never cluster brother he is himself with some body thetans plastered on him but hes too not enough char ge off now when if the guys get up to the clearing course you get another phenomena occurring and its an interesting phenomenon when you get up into clearing course if you just let people audit the clearing course materials certain percentage of them will write in and tell you that there are these black objects and they seem to be other beings and they start flying off when they start auditing and what are these things the guy is already prematurely encountered 3 certain number of cases will do this also oddly enough you could start certain very smal l percentage of cases and its very smal l percentage at ot you could start them out at grade four service facsim ile and they would go on up but the percentage is too smal l to pay much attention to this now if the person arrives at ot3 and he cant perceive these you must recognize that there is insufficient charge off his case now whats the whats the solution to that well youve taken the charge off of the main grade line youve you can rehab the main grade line make sure that it is run youll normally find out it hasn t been its been skimped somehow or another or more charge has been put on than has taken off and then somebody turned in false report or something like this something weird happened or you can turn around at that stage of the game and run him on down through the actual reason they get all smashed together which is accidents impacts and injuries then you can start auditing him down that line and they itll loosen up and all of sudden it all com st raight but what is that thats running an engram which is way down in the dianetics area now the process of running an engram is the only one i know of that does not overrun if the process of running an engram is to go to the beginning date the thing go to the beginning of the incident what is its duration go through it to the end tell whats there that wont overrun its not much of cause you see the subject matter to which it is introduced and so forth now you go back and try to audit the engrams which have already been audited youre not going to get anyplace because you see the reason why that one works that way is because engrams and secondaries are erased theyre not release d theres difference of definition they arent somethingthe engrams secondaries and bank masse s and implants and all the rest of this sort of thingthey just dont fly off or the guy just unpins them or ceases to mock them up and waits till tomorrow when they get keyed in and starts mockin g them up again see thats release phenomenon you erase it there is hole in the bank where that was and it is not likely to key in again so of course there isnt anything to overrun you get the difference so the one unlimited process there is is engram running or secondary running totally unlimited with this proviso dont try to run an incident which has already been erased because now youre going back and trying to put the incident there when its not there and the person is trying to put the incident there and you can get and it reacts to the question overrun it will react to it the engram has been overrun you can get read on this cause it interprets that way to his head the truth of the matter is is you are maki ng put it back there again would be the right the actual action which is occurring on an overrun so one chain or one incident the chain blew see now you care to run this chain he cant run the chain youre asking him something hes got to put the chain there in order to run it again thats overrun thats the overrun it isnt the command overrun its the fact that its gone and it really has gone it hasnt released hes hes now got to put one there in order to have one he hasnt got the skill to do it and he beco mes very upset and very baffled his knowingness about what hes doing is not adequate to knowing that he is trying to put one there dont you see but he really doesnt know how to put one there yet and he can get all flabblebabbled up every once in while youll you will get read on 3 overrun wise up auditor wise up that is one body thetan who is run one too many times through incident one all you just dotis indicate it to him hes been run through it after it was gone and so forth and he blows and then on it suddenly he finds out that theres lot more body thetans 3 wasn t overrun but the pc will read on 3 being overrun one body thetan has been overrun on one engram is what 3 overrun reads on your meter has 3 been overrun woosh very good which body thetan was run too often through the incident pull that one woosh thats good alright indicat that it has been over he has been overrun on incident one or incident two as the case ma be very good we had case here the other day practically fall apart apparently the auditor pc in doing 3 did nothing but overrun everybody that he had hes one of these thorough cases laughter and the review auditor running overruns just the subject of overruns in trying to rehab overruns of course got up to prep check on 3 and was busy rehabbing this and that and my god the case just fell to pieces it went off in all directions the guy simply plastered himself with overrun body thetans by the same mechanism he was asking them to go through the one the two three more times but there wasn t anything there for the guy to go through and then probably running them verbally verbalization go to the beginning or something like this some generality that could stick kick every body thetan down the track the guys are still trying to go to the beginning there is nothing there there now is beginning then they get very confused guys that run ot3 verbalized anyhow are rather bonkers you get the funny picture of the guy pulling an empty chair up across from his auditing desk and saying to the empty chair do you have an incident one that didnt read good ill go attest 3 its actually run telepathically and you dont have lots of commands and so forth if you get up to that point without being able to think guy back to the where the beginning of the incident and thinking him through the thing you ought to quit anyway so this is the way the you you shouldnt quit you ought to get to work and finish your 3 anyway ill make it very tactful now do you differentiate between the idea of the subject and the process these are two different things so as the case supervisor dont make the mistake of believing that the person has been on the subject well this person has just had too many arc breaks run see just dont run any more arc breaks on this pc thatd be the end of him boy you could say dont again run list four the main change in your life and waffle waffle waffle waffle waffle waffle waffle see so thats so how would you overrun an arc break then well you would overrun you dont overrun arc breaks but you could overrun an arc break and you do it this way do you have an arc break good that reads what was it so and so and so and so alright when was that so and so and so and so good c d i pardon r c u c d i good indicate it to the pc good do you have an arc break well i have read here well do you have an arc break yep it read what is the arc break oh i dont know youre askin g him to run the arc break which hes just run which then invalidates his ability to as is and you hang it up and the ta will go up alright thats one way to do it another way to do it is do you have an arc break yes my husband so on and so on yesterday and itsa well r c u alright id like to indicate to you that it was understanding it was break in under floating needle see ok and the auditor doesnt indicat that and the pc said yeah thats perfectly allowable for the pc to say yeah thats break in understanding hes not he didnt understand what the hell i was talking about alright good floating needle see c d i c reads also d youre curious about and desired understanding was that that was the bypassed charge good uh yes good now how do you feel about that arc break now well lets see now he has to put it there dont you see in order to answe r this question and he gets bonkers mess that would occur see its gone and now youre telling him its still there and is in essence an auditor evaluation so he being an obedient pc tries you can handle his bank better than he he just assumes that it must still be there so he tries to put something there but he cant find anything to put there so the ta goes up and you leave him in mystery you play the same gag on him as look at the elephant only there isnt any elephant you see so he looks around and then you from altitude say well you damn fool cant you see this elephant cant you see this elephant anyplace anyplacev cant you see this elephant and the guy says i cant see any elephant oh well drums fingers on table guess well have to send you to the psychiatrist well guy in protest like this will sort of try to satisfy oh yeah yeah i i i can get the dim outline of an elephant yeah thats why the auditors code is the auditors code you say it read when it didnt read you say it didnt read when it read we just had pc wrapped around telegraph pole he let himse lf go all the way through the session with missed withhold well it didnt read when it went by so i didnt say anything about it and the auditor sat there and watc hed him get kind of gray faced and so on as the session went on and didnt say anything about it either yes he didnt get read but the pc had missed withhold reactions and he didnt get in suppress n it now you could be damned fool and every clean read that you see get in suppress on it do you see where where rote auditing becomes impossib you could you could wind session up to whole bunch of inspections before the fact and so on so you make up for this by being yourself acquainted totally fully and utterly with the standard data you are handling you dont have to stop and think that critical pc has missed withhold you dont have to stop and think when you see somebody coming into session very sad and hangdog that he has an arc break of long duration you see these youd know youre not all fumblebumbling around i wonder how scientology compares to freudian god or is freud god was freud religion yes freud was god yes wonder how it compares to that i wonder how this has to do with my case and you havent got any time to do that time at all boy pc comes into session and he looks his eyes are pretty heavy and the auditor doesnt know his auditors code right down through the middle does not say you get any sleep hes so busy trying to find out which is the trim button and which is the plug in that he cant notice anything about the pc pc looks sort of gaunt the pc doesnt look well at the beginning of the session looks sort of gaunt the auditor doesnt in conversational tone of voice ask him if hes had enough sleep if hes had anything to eat are you physically ill doesnt ask himse lf anything like that he waits till hes gone an hour and half deep in the session the pcs f allen on his head if he doesnt know his auditors code the auditors code is the auditors code it isnt something that is put there for reason for instance eat and sleep are the only two things pcs have ever spun on back in the bad old days of the dianetics foundations we used to get every loony pc that could walk down the line they werent even pcs theyd just let them out of institutions and theyd walk in and theyd get audited and common denominator of those who were spinny in session or who spun and then had to be rescue d in some way and heroic actions i we made common denominator what was in comm on to every one of these pcs they hadnt eaten and they hadnt slept and you as an auditor go and let somebody who has had insufficient sleep which you dont know too much about as case are sooner or later going to wrap somebody around telegraph pole and hes going to spin for three or four days in screaming state man sooner or later this horrible experience will occur thats why the auditors code is the auditors code it has data like this in it so when guy goes into session he sits down oh oh yawns good to sit down eave you had any sleep well come to think about it i havent slept for couple of days very good thank you very much you go get some sleep and then we will have session when you are sufficiently rested and im very sorry that this has prevented you from finishing the cycle of action of session at this time indicating the bypassed charge at the sam time so you dont have to take it up in the next session you say you know your data so well that you know the guy is going to have bypassed charge by not being able to complete the cycle of action so you take care of that then in other words you know your business its right on your finger tips all the time you dont have to think what if you were riding bicycle thinking every thought necessar to balance the bicycle and steer it at the same time youll go into ditch man well you go into ditch with auditing just like that if you dont know these things pang pang pang pang these are the things you watch now you all of you know you know you know this data you know it colds you know your auditors code banger see you dont have to think let see what did it say in the auditors code when the to hell with that you shouldnt even be wandering around i wonder what ron meant when he wrote that part of the auditors code it had something to do with it now lets see theres something in the bit of it had something to do with that kidding ive heard things like this the veda oh come now look at india thats known as invidious comparison the word invidious means disgraceful or bad anyway standard tech is just main line tech these are the subjects you take them up these are the only subjects you handle in standard tech they are the subjects of the grades there arent fifty processes and actions in the entirety of scientology now that isnt asking anybody very much to know and know them so cold that he says well gonna do rehab brrrrrrr bow wow bub zee zee barb barb ding ding pow pow pow and the pc says so and so exactl therefore bow bang floating needle thank you very much whats he rehabbing hes rehabbing something completely catastrophic you look over the list and horrors that this case is such an irreparable resistive case and so on do you get the relationship now do you get the relationship do you get what data you have to have what data you have to have what understanding you have to have the grip you have to have on it nobodys asking you to know very much but boy what you do know maaaaaanl you sure had better have grip that is like steel bands pc sits down in the session and right that moment just with one casual glance youve got it sorted out he isnt even talking yet you know youre going to get in the ruds and fly the needle and so forth you ought to just know where it probably is its just as asy as that and you say there he is thats whats wrong with him theres nothing mystic about it the guy will have an arc break or ptp or missed withhold or an overt motivator now youre starting to get faint see its getting less and less likely and then youve got whole bunch of things that if it didnt go if it didnt fly on that if it didnt fly on that then you go through green form till it flies cause the persons hung up on something hes pts hes doing something and you normally will find out on your green form line now you know the guys been audited hes been audited badly and so on well its lead pipe cinch you do the same thing that you would do in any other way fly the needle and take the general assessment form or an l4a something like this whatever it was that you picked up the tool you pick up the tool you know the tool would be there but youre far better off if all of your auditing is against case supe rvision you were either the case supervisor or you were the auditor when the auditor is both the case supervisor and the auditor hes sticking his neck out four hundred and eighty five miles cause hes violating it he knows both the auditor and the pc and if he knows the auditor and the pc variables can enter into the problem do you follow he knows the auditor he knows the pc hahl hes violated two basic principles of case supervision you never talk to the auditor about the case you never talk to the pc about his case as close as you come to talking to the auditor is the auditing report as close as you come to talking to the pc is the examiners report and i can tell you now that youre fool not to have both before you when you case supervise you should have before you the auditing report in its entirety and you should have before you as well the examiners report on the pc you say well how you going to get that well the pc always goes through the examiner of course well how could you set this up if you were in private practice if youd be asked this question well i dont know i guess youd have to appoint the next door neighbor or your wife or something as the examiner and youd have to train up somebody else to audit if youre going to be the case supervisor caus i can guarantee that if youre also doing the case supervision as well as the auditing you will wrap it around telegraph pole sooner or later sounds weird doesnt it but the auditor and the pc always influence the case supervisor whenever theyre visav is with him and personal chatter on the subject of the pcs case and personal chatter with regard to the auditor with regard to the pc case are the only two points i have ever found that wrapped my case pervision around telegraph pole now theres another way my case supervision can be misrouted and upse t and so on is by the pc not going through the examiner the pc leaves the auditing session and leaves review through the examiner now this has the liability that the examiner is liable to be sourpuss and the pc says oh greats boy just made it wows you know and the examiner says hm take hold of the cans boy thats the greatest session i ever had in my lifer yeah thats what they always say yeah good and that would actually be after the fact of the examination wouldnt it so you could mysteriously have the pc cave in by down curve from the examiner but thatd be the only point left the main liability of the case sup ervisor the main liability of case supervisor is false auditing report and he should protect himself every way he possibly can from false auditing report but he shouldnt go around talking to the pc he shouldnt go find the pc and look the pc up and all this sort of thing cause his opinion on the thing is the case supervisors point of view and you can figure all you want to about why it is its an empirical datum one that has been derived from experience i have already cast up the number of cases on which case supervision errors have been made they have been made by case supervisor having seen the pc and talked to the pc about the session the error of errors are talking to the auditor about the session and in when those two points have occurr ed in case supervision case supervision has erred they color its perhaps its cold blooded proposition but the case supe rvisor can be given false report he can be given an evaluative report of one kind or another oh the pc was in marvelous conditions pcs barely able to crawl out of the auditing room thats why you want the examiners now what you want from the examiners simply is the tone arm the state of the needle and what the pc says not in response to some examiners question some examiners going to say to you now what do you ask the pc and your answe r to that is shut up dont ask him nothing theres sign on the desk and it says examiner the mere fact that hes given the pc the cans and checking the meter hes got the pcs folder there you see thats enough the pctll say something and the examiner writes it down and then the examiner must always say thank you very much and that is the limit of his communication because if you let them talk theyll start auditing the pc so you cut that talk to minimum youre liable to see little forms being made up someplace what gains have you had in this session well i got floating needle on this and i had cognition on that now i and theres little thing that i thought was little bit point there and i wasn t quite sure what happened there and so on but i did get floating needle on this thing but i wasnt quite sure about the thing and so on and here the floating needle is busy packing up and the examiner is sure invitation to overrun if the examiner is liable is allowed to talk the examiners liable to talk so the examiner cant talk little tiny bit i can just see it now there will be form there an examiners form and it has questions on it like was your auditor nice to you in the session did he invalidate your gains did you really make your grade and that can kill because its too fast too fast after the session somebody who is still part of the organization and part of apparently part of the line up and blood brother to the auditor sort of and the pegs line is actually challenging him he isnt challenging him so just the sign there and it says examiner and folder meter give him the cans he comes out he can say hello give him the cans when he comes out ok ta ta thank you thank you very much and he can point which direction hes supposed to go thats the end now the case supervisor has an independent tone arm needle state pc statement and he can add these things up the auditor says at the end of the session that the pays ta was at 275 and the examiner report right on top of it says 375 there was f n at the end of session it is false report saves you an awful lot of trouble you simp ly make out your next one and say correct so and so and do not send them to whatever the auditors name was some other auditor correct session so and so something went wrong and then you get better because false report has tendency to be followed by false report so were getting down to something now thats very interesting is that really only an organization can process successfully and over continued long period of time only an organization can process and the individual practitioner may make lot of bucks here and there you have phenomenon of guy who is tremendously successful as in individual auditor he seems to be doing just great as an individual auditor you follow their curves they fall on their heads in couple of years its an organization action it takes the organization backup franchises fall on their heads by not having enough staff to perform all the actions of the organization and they actually are totally dependent on organizations to perform great many services i couldnt even begin to list how many services an organization has to perform therefore apparently apparently the individual auditor makes great deal of money and so forth but its usua lly for limited time got to be backed up franchise got to be backed up by an organization and the franchise is seldom sufficiently organized to stand by itself if it werent for an organization someplace so this is this is the thing now i want to call to your attention that the era of medicine was long and hard won and so on that the era of psych iatry is brief but these practitioners organizing themsel ves on union basis doing this doing that but practicing individually they really dont do well and theyre not going to do well professionally over long period of time because outfits like us can suddenly move in sideways right now they theyre worried about us frantic because were getting all the business theres lot of cream stuff coming out of that field they dont get that anymore theyre worried theyre worried about their appropriations so its an organizational action now lets look at this as an organization function youve got case supervisor theres an auditor theres an examiner theres somebody that sched ules sessions even though that is also the review chief see youre already dealing with minimum number now you can run one godaw ful number of sessions through this line up but if the auditor has to do all of his admin the auditor has to do all of his opinionation the auditor has to do this and do that he wont hit hundred he wont hit hundred because one day hes tired or one day hes this or he slips and he doesnt catch his slips and he gets optimistic about it and he gets opinions and side data starts hitting him he wobbles because hes talking to pc all the way down the line you see case supervisors always got to have another auditor to send the pc to when he gets false report in what the hell else he gonna do so you see the minimum size and shape and design of such an activity now the auditors business is simply handling the pc it shouldnt be on anything else and his business in handling the pc is just running very standard actions on the pc and nothing adventurous running the pc rapidly to the highest possib gain level that he possib ly can shooting him through the line its really very simple action but its one of these simplicities that you have to be very very brilliant to grasp i say brilliant to the degree that you have to be brilliant enough not to be complicated its actually very simp activity but it is just about as complex as the lines that certain number of functions and actions which have to be taken handling the pc theres just certain number of funct ons and actions you start leaving some of these organizational setups out in the handling of pc and somethingll go astray similarly in the tech itself something goes astray if you start leaving thing out like we never run present time problems anymore the pc was release d on problems so he cant possibly have problem we dont know why the case is not chan ging at ot2 anyway the false report is about the only enemy that case supervisor has just getting back to that subject because it makes him think that standard tech isnt working and is wide open invitation to do something else the thing that isnt working is the auditors report normally you would have started out in your career and continued to do nothing but the very standard actions if you had not also seen false reports standard reports have pcs evaluating for you as to what you ought to be doing for their case trying to please people trying to do this trying to do that having case supervision work given to you with which you did not agree all these other thing come along and they finally wind you up in ball so you dont know what the hell youre doing now what youre doing here is im straightening you all out straight and as narrow and i hope you stay that way thank you very much case supervisor dos and donts the total rationale and background of auditing lecture given on 30 september 1968 thank you very much and what lecture number is this seven thats right we can still count and what is the date thirty of september 1968 nobody in the sea org can ever remember day by the way our weeks go round and round and round and we can always tell you the date but seldom the day we have to go look for an almanac well very good where we got to the other evening on processing processing in england we have to give this in both accents dont you see fortunately i dont have to give these lectures in french fellow came along side the ship today and asked if he could come aboard for five minutes in french and i told him je pc pc go very handy thats the totality of my french it means i dont speak french and then it adds the colloquialism at all well anyway we we got up to the line where we had some processes or processes as distinct from the subject right and i feel very good today because i ive actually had some good wins the provisional viiis were busy auditing in sea org qual today and they were going down the line with tremendous pocketapocketap ocketa and making mince meat out of cases left right and center and doing very beautiful job of it i shouldnt have this but in the sea org qual there were student folders to amount to anything there was just one i think and the student got away with it the standard line was just pocketapocketa pocketa anyway the goal line running very nicely now theres piece of line although im going to talk to you about processes im going to talk to you about what you have to do to keep line in case supervisor must not operate by talking to the auditor or talking to the preclear his folders before they come to him must go through an examiner and after the session must go through an examiner so theres an examiner bit form an examiner form in the folder before he does his c s every time and theres an examiner form in the folder after the session this way you cut down the misses now today there was fantastic number of cases very large number of cases audited probably the output of saint hill hgc london hgc angeles hgc went through the hands big quantity went through the hands of sea org qual today done by two auditors the difference between standard tech and hunt and punch you know the hunt and punch on the typewriter it makes difference and in three of these cases it was possib because the examiner line was in and in very nicely and smoothly all the examiner ever does you see is just put the pc on the cans or the preot on the cans record the needle marks whether its before session or after session examiner form records the state of the needle the position of the ta and what the pc sa ys an d thats all he writes that down well in three out of very large stack of folders the pc in actual fact had been audited over ot2 in three of them which is caug ht by the examiner although the rudiments were flown although the pcs indicators seem ed to be in although it all seem ed well at the end of session between the time of the student leaving the session which must have been minutes at the very longest and his reporting to the examiner why his needle slowed down and his ta went up little bit cause he was audited over present time problem and then from his comment of course it was obvious that he was audited over problem he could also have been audited over other things and his comment would have reflected this dont you see so it is very simp the pc says something like oh well that was great review session that was fine review session except of course it didnt handle what i came in to have handled or he says something like this you know and you know at that moment that he has something he thinks should be handled see which is some peculiar thing hes got three legs or something in his estimation and it is simp ly wideopen invitation to get case supervisor or somebody to fall on his head see or for the auditor to fall on his head but the usual is done but in this particular instant why the auditor was actually able to fly the needle on rudiments while the fellow was sitting there with hidden standard or ptp dont you see all of which is very very easy this is very easy to detect this from his attitude from the fact that the end of the session to the examiner something happened to the f n do you see something happened to the ta it would also detect false report on the part of the auditor in this case there were false reports involved there was simply the pcs comment was well you know to this effect it was great session and i feel much better you know but it didnt handle what i came in to have handled or something of this sort you see and you just detect from these facts that something is out now you know something is out but you also have detected slightly resistive pc and what the hell is this he goes in to sessions he gets an f n but it doesnt hold aha aha aha now its explained why this fellow was three months on ot2 dont you see now its explained why he has review folder eight inches thick see it all goes together see and you got review folder eight inches thick hes got hes got something out he has been audited over out ruds or he has been this or he has been that well theres several things which case supe rvisor can do at this moment and which the auditor then does several things one he can get an assessment of the seven types of cases now he can find out what is wrong now of course if the auditor is an eager beaver and goes and flies all of these now he makes it difficult to run chain because it is past an f n already you see what i mean caus all hes done is key out former therapy see well thats gonna key in right away but now hes put an f n in the roadan f n to that degree is in the road what you want is strike or b d do you see just want to assess this thing you dont you dont assess this conversationally you merely make the statement and make the strike the pcs itsa it doesnt exist dont you see now youve got it now youve got it you can put in an rfactor say im going to do an assessment here to assist case supervision and you dont have to say anything im just going to go over this browbowbow teyowbowbow teyowbowbow teyowbowbow teyowbowdow teyowbowbow b d mwumewmempow pop very good thank you very much now of course the second examiner report isnt going to tell you very much because the pc says well i came all the way over here just to get this fellow sittin here and saying something to but he may be very obliging and get something out of it but that isnt the point you want to find what you are going to blast down on to mak this cease to be resistive case and now you put together the standard action for that particular case you dont just fly it with itsa see you do somethingformer therapies man lets get these things listed within an inch of their lives do you follow lets get these former therapies lets find out all about that lets find out theradies similar to them in the past lets find out the thing misunderstood in those earlier therapies lets get this out of the line up alright now physical illness weve got to determine how ill if hes quite ill and so on were not going to audit him at all were not going to audit him thats all until we get some advises on the subject of his physical condition now it doesnt mean that if hes physically ill he has to be turned over inevitably and forever to the mo the medical officer you see but it does mean it does mean very definitely that this is an outness and that we are auditing uphill because physical illness makes such severe ptp that it physiologically has to get some point of resolution oddly enough there are things you can do to knock out physical illness there are quite few things that you can do to knock out physical illness most of them are under the heading of secondaries and engram running and now again were not knocking about running an engram by saying do you have an engram good thats floating needle thank you crap what happened to the auditor who could run engrams you see im sure this will go out im sure this will go out time and time again that somebody will come around and say oh we never run engrams by chains anymore thats old hat you might as well say well auditing is old hat its hot fast precise peration now you can solve physiological illness on the basis of engram running very simp ly very easily you actually can solve physiological illness not by auditing against the speci fic but simp ly by running the chain which is offering itself to be audited not by doing recall release of it lets ge t rid of this damn thing see there is will be some chain in restimulation im not going into the vast difficulties of how you find this and so forth and im not laying you out rote process im trying to talk to you about the theory of what you do well what do you know its elementary in actual fact but the physical illness t he fellow has is on the engram chai n in which he is sitting now as you look at this from diagnostic point of view it wont make any sense at all if you try to figure out what engram chain hes sitting in he is sitting in the engram chain which is giving him the illness this is too simple dont you see hes manifesting the chain hes sitting in now the point is is his reality up to running it now trying to run chain of secondaries on somebody just that action trying to run chain of secondaries on somebody your liable to get into something that is quite hot in order to put the pc down the track into this chain of secondaries it is it just he just flies out of it the charge its too charged an area yet you can find chain that the person is sitting in of secondaries and he sort of goes down the track and hell come back us the track to the one that was too hot to handle he inevitably is sitting in what is wrong with him you see one of these wild things now ill give you one of these terribly difficult case supe rvisor problems you have difficulty with case in auditing the case somebody missed on 5a miss on 5a is quite catastrophic you miss on 5a your guy will probably wind up in ethics or blowing and so forth within about 48 hours its the most positive thing you ever hear of you run 5a wrong bongo its quite something because its very powerful process you see so you run weak process wrong and it wont do very much to the pc but you run powerful process wrong and god help you alright fellow walks in his 5a was out but the examiner was clever enough to notice and put small note on the end of the examination because the examiner also also can make some remark that the case supervise the examiner doesnt say anything he doesnt say anything to the pc but he can tell the c s any damn thing he wants to as note on his report form like pc came in in wheel chair you know of some interest sometimes youll hear this resounding name george alouicious gulch and it really sounds like something and so on and its little kid five years old see and so your case supervision is affected by this because you would tell the auditor to simplify the auditing command and you might even simplify the auditing command for the auditor do you follow just so it comm unicat oddly enough though we are auditing currently i think an eight year old and were auditing him with the full business he apparently understands it all and the funny part of it is before level 0 was run he couldnt talk english its all very mysterious people had to sort of pidgin english you know anything that was done all of sudden they ran 0 and well what arc break what major change occur red in your lifetime da dadada yoppitybopbopbop deyabababa and the thing of this is its the most adult session you ever saw in your life its the funny the early part of the folder you see is is kiddiewiddie makey signie you know and the suddenly level 0 and beyond there its certain they ran an awfully good level 0 so anyway the essence of the thing in this particular instance fellow walked in he had two wrong 5a items so just as bonus the case supervisor noticed that he had very bad burn on his arm so i simply told the auditor to run the engram chain of the burn on his arm hed just burned his arm so obviously he was sitting in it and in addition to wrong power so we corrected the power found the ran the burn and ran it in chain and wound up to the case comp lication of what made him blow see when 5a went out he apparently burned his arm also so he got back to sort of service far thing ran the engram down the chain to period of about six years ago which possibly was wh he started blowing interesting alright now he is sitting in the engram which is affecting him physiologically now theres several ways to go about this sort of thing if fellows on ot 3 what do you do you run down his present life and he cant couldnt find any and had one body thetan or something stupid like that and you just find the this lifetime injury hes naturally mushed it all together find this lifetime injury and ta or ta meter read or meter read to hell with it push him into it make him run it run him on down the track and run an incident 1 itll go straight to incident 1 and itll go long fall b d long fall b d bowbowbowbow now the pc if hes very status happy or something is liable to come out of this explaining how this has nothing to do with him and that there wasn t anything there anyhow and that there wasnt anything there anyhow and so on his reality level isnt up to it his grades actually were never run you can just keep up this process and all of sudden his reality level hey wait minute how can i keep running that same incident only its different incident every time and i only had one and ive now run three i dont get any pictures because when i went clear i ceased to mock up pictures but i got these pictures is there some possibility i am haunted now itd be lead pipe cinch to take care of this physiological psycho somatic illness on somebody with an unflat 3 but i can expect over the years that all sorts of oddities and peculiarities will beco invented as they have in the immediate past so that the method of finding body thetans consis ts of getting him to scan over his body scan over his body scan over his body and scan on the right side of his body the left side of his body top of his body bottom of his body and nothing reads so he doesnt have any body thetans i dont know who the hell invented that but it walked in sideways and becam standard operating procedure it isnt its for the birds now as you run pc on this this is review approach to bird who cant manage 3 youve got to be sure that his grades were actually run now thats thats important the rehab of his grades before you start anything like this that brings his reality up the amount of charge off is proportional to the reality of the pc so get the charge off whenever you can however you can run some chains of this particular character of one kind and another kind and there it is the pc is liable to keep on explaining to you how its all physiological and he ought to be have his head cut off in surgery or something actually the bird is dramatizing r6 which is full of medical doctors and they carve away on body and oh man the body finally comes down to nothing but raw meat and then skeleton and the doctors are all so please d you know just like they look you know that is actually totally in r6 part of the 35 and three quarter day implant which is all pictures you normally dont get to this section of it because i have moved you up to the beginning of it and it all goes pfffet you dont get full dress rehearsal of this if you did god help you its killer youd only get it by dropping into the middle of it but every once in while you have the body thetan of space man standing up on top of cliff and jumping down and jumping up again or you have an odd picture womans head in pit with little baby along side the head these these are r6 pictures and theres just tons of them theres actually thousands of them and this type of odd picture shows up something like this well actually you try to run this too much on well the the guy who hasnt been up through the grades doesnt have enough charge off to see em anyhow he can be the effect of them but he doesnt have enough charge off to see em do you see he can sort of have it all keyed in but hes not really there and hes not looking at the picture so you normally can run these fellows perfectly safely now if you really knew all there was to know about everything under the sun moon and stars in the way of pictures in the bank you dont have to be an expert this way fortunately but you would recognize something about it actually you can recognize it very easily by dating it the date of r6 is seventy five million years ago so you just say this stuck pictures at seventy it seems to you that it might be something at seventy five million years ago if it is why somethingll happen and if it isnt you wouldnt get read on the meter if it is and its some other date why great but that would be little bit tricky to fool with because its thirty five and three quarter day engram duration actually the duration can be much longer in the matter of duress so its bit touchy but the probability is of it being in restimulation is very poorbut the fellow can be the effect of it for instance there is cyclical illness which is dictated in the various r6 implants fellow was forced to get sick at the age of five followed multiples of five and hes supposed to get sick from this and from that and from the other thing measles and you know hes supposed to have and thats certain they predict his health in other words when hes fifty hes supposed to something or other what theyre trying to do is make body cave in see problem r6 was trying to solve was overpopulation with some 250 billion inhabitants on this planet the average through this federation was 178 billion hundred and seventh eight billion beings per planet they didnt eat very much they werent badly keyed in but they reproduced too badly and somebody thought he had this as problem so he tried to cut out the whole population naturally what he struck at was the second dynamic so where you see aberrated second dynamic youre looking straight at r6 aberrated second dynamic youre looking at the pc having gone through r6 or body thetans through r6 second dynamic exaggeration of great aberration on overindulgence of so forth youre just looking at r6 now running engrams can run into this zone or area but the probability of them doing so person who doesnt have enough charge off to do so is very remote now the incident in common to all thetans body thetans all kinds of thetans as thetantype thetan is of course the incident 1 and when you clip the 1 that sepa rates them out from the mass every time but sometimes up the line they get impacted together on some other type of incident it can be quite deadly actually occasionally because clust er of them exerting pressure and so on can really knock somebodys block off but theres something else that isnt totally understood about this by auditors and that is simp ly this that is doesnt have to be cluster to knock your block off it can be just one and then you get the phenomenon run this little tiny body thetan he turns out to be great big body thetan very fascin ating but people who are below 3 of course have all the phenomena of body thetans now if you were red hot in running engrams however you would move your pc on down the track into something he could run so therefore if you are very very good and you are very hot on the subject of engrams engram running and so on all you have to know is that if it goes more solid you go earlier to similar incident now i show you how you can really goof on this going earlier to similar incident you can start taking him down chai n of head injuries and he dives sideways into being spanked and all of sudden youre running chain of spanks and you get an f n on spank ed and say well that finished the head injuries so therefore i nuts head injuries arent flat you have to go back and pick up that then the other thing is the criterion of when to stop running an engram and go earlier is not new material i dont know who sold people on this new material thats just one of the junior indicators new material shows up its real engram and its running but thats junior indicator its not going to hurt the pc if new material shows up you run the engram until the guy comes uptone or goes f n it is whether or not whether or not the thing goes solid now look if its going solid hes running it disowned its body thetans incident that hes running so you get the hell out of there boy and go earlier and sooner or later youre going to pick up one of his own you get the idea and all of sudden the thing will go f n because he separates out from the body thetan dont you see so this is the criteria on which you judge the running of engrams dont think that person got body thetans just because he got to section 3 hes had em the whole way now this funny business can show up the guy has been out of valence all the way from arc straightwire straight on through to the end of ot2 and when you get him on 3 he can be sitting there bright eyed without single damned grade run all the grades have been run on bthetans thats possib it isnt general but it is possible so sometimes when you find somebody on 4 that you cant rehab anything on it isnt necessar ily true that it didnt f n at the time theres f n now because that guy isnt there anymore now you get this odd phenomena what the hell do you do well the ruds were out and lot of other things must have been out to keep him driven out of valence during that period but of course the person the ruds were out on at that time probably isnt there anymore anyhow so the best thing about it is is to detect it and you take your life in your hands is it gonna be an overrun or is it going to be the original run but that which you cannot rehab to f n has not gone f n that which you cannot rehab to f n has not gone f n it after all of your trials and everything and running your session with ruds very definitely in all of this all the way down the line if you still can t get an f n it never did have an f n but this is validity which occurs mainly after section 3 is flat the greatest validity of that remark is after section 3 is flat now you get this crazy combination could theoretically occur the grade was run on him he hits 3 he goes out of valence and youre trying to rehab it on body thetan which he didnt get rid of which you get the crazy combinations but in all such cases this is matter of charge in all such cases this is matter of charge its charged case the case is too heavily charged in order to approach any part of reality and so he cant get reality on body thetans he cant do this he cant do that he will natter and talk about well it seems real to him and do you really mean valences and you know there couldnt be such thing as this and so on well hes not necessarily cluster but the probability is that hes out of valence the probability is that he has had very severe this lifetime injury which has driven him altogether into one piece the action involved is great i mean it you pick up an incident to run it on this fellow when dropped penny on his little finger and thats not the kind of incident you dont neces sarily rule out operations but how savage an operation see how much how much stuff how how violent was this thing how long was he under anaesthesia you know thats the sort of thing that youre asking you want severe engram and an auditor who has hard time confronting also has hard time askin g for real smash ers very often they sort of detour themselves you know they say to the fellow now do you have very severe injury on the track someplace or another and the fellow says severe injury well yes i did have i had an automobile accident and i once dropped box on my toe well well take up this box on your toe that auditors sitting in an automobile accident of his own automobile accidents are rather to be very serious to run because theres automobile train accidents like crazy in r6 they have lots of automobile accidents and trains running through it and more automobile accidents and helicopter crashes and theres lots of accidents so these things are liable to be hung up through r6 so you dont run this type of incident therefore the available charge on the case is of vast importance to you as an auditor how much charge can you find on the case and where do you follow now you get so fascinated with f ns that when case is quite very resistive you want to find an area which will audit for while without f ning see i love goodol nine hour run on an engram see now lets lets weve the pc the pc has got an engram chain that goes down to having been medico in ancient egypt and hes got all the overts on the line of killing pcs or something of this sort or killing anybody who came in cause they did mental consu ltation they werent pcs they were pdeads predeads boy cause they had the right to kill so alright what do we do what do we do here well lets run it lets get down that chain lets get down that chai n lets release this area but lets release it by erasure see now maybe theres something earlier than where itll eventually go f n but weve gotten charge off the case you understand charge off the case now dont pull gag like this as the c s says find this is an important operation see because its hungup 3 is what youre solving here guys all hung up in 3 he didnt find any and hes got psycho somatic illnesses and he sneezes nd goes hu am hm all the time but he didnt find anything in i and so on and yea yea alright well you get something like this dont you see and the case supervisor says find this lifetime injury by which he means an injury not by dropping pin on his fingernail and he prefers an injury to an operation because an operation is liable to take him straight back into r6 an automobile accidents liable to take him back there too and so on so if its just good wholesome injury you know somebody dropped safe on his head or something like that and we run this and we dont much care at the moment its happening and we begin this operation the case which has the smal lest amount of reality when we begin this operation we dont much care if theres any needle or tone arm action to amount to anything were gonna run it its gonna get more solid cause were running bthetan see and were gonna run it and so on and then soon as he detects it more solid just find an earlier similar incident now you as an auditor can goof you can go over into some other chain your own confront goes down and you say this is too damn gruesome blood spattering all over the place and the pc is sitting there sort of nattering and you find an earlier similar incident now you want similar similar incident earlier now you can run this back life after life after life actually one of these is very likely to wind up 750 trillion years ago now we dont care where it goes thats not your purpose you just want the earlier similar incident see now when you finally get this earlier similar incident that blows to fin it will blow him out of all of the bthetan crisscross see its very neat operation and then you right away run an incident 1 got it and very possib ly his reality will still be so damn bad that he will you know he sits there the meter blows up you know long falls blow downs latibow see all the rest of it thats just great and hell come up to say well that didnt do anything and the terrible draft thats all just awfull bad you know and so on yap yap yap yap yap see you dont care anything about thatlets find another type of accident or just ask for another incident 1 do you see if incident 1 didnt f n that time ask for another incident 1 now in this way by finding these various chains and going down them you are actually running an unlimited method of releasing charge off case it f ns on chain by erasure well you obviously cant do anything but plow him in if you run more on that particular chai n now by chain similar incident its having safes dropped on his head that is the chain which can go into having objects dropped on his head but thats the chain its chai n of objects d ropped on his head now objects blowing him up or dropped on his foot is another chain now you can erase that to f n too do you follow so its the number of incident 1s that you can run in the final analysis cause thats the key charge and all of sudden this fellow says wait minute now you can do all kinds of goofy things lot of goofiness can come in people can come in and say the right way to find body thetan is to have the individual scan his hands or wahwhehwo or person with lots of body thetans has needle which hiccups or something you know poof poof poof poof poof thats its just dont buy any of those things see what im telling you here is the straight dope you want to go down the chain that you start out on until you get down to some area that will run run it to f n dive down the bank with the guy and run an incident l when youve got the incident 1 run and it didnt f n bongobingo try to find another incident 1 run it and another one and run it and another one and run it and just have yourself just little old ball now if you dont know this about engrams you might as well quit it is the earliest incident of the engram which holds the remainder of the engram in place so you can start late in the engram and it doesnt give ta action or erase you can start late in secondary now ill give you an idea of how do you start late in secondary you try to run the secondary out of the fellow of his house being foreclosed and its all taken away from him and for some pecu liar reason best known to man or beast it just doesnt run it goes more solid faster than it should well as an auditor you ought to have some psych iatric treatment because youve disobeyed the first law the first law of anything is the first inkling of anything the first incident the first the first the first the first part of the first you get it theres not only the first or the earlier but the first part of the first you understand you want the instant he first had an inkling that he was going to lose his house and you will find more lousy incidents running than you can shake stick at another thing is an incident that is running eventually doesnt change its material but comes uptone so if you use the criteria that the material didnt change in the incident and therefore the incident is unerasable i dont know where that came from either that is just beyond the only its almost casua l statement in old dianetic running and that is simply this that the earlier the incident the earlier the incident the more basic charge flies off the later incident you see that early charge ooh boy is that important see its the quality of the charge now and the earlier the charge is the more quality it has see although you can say any charge off will increase the cases reality thats true but the earlier that charge is and the more close it is to the standard aberrative factors of the thetan and those are represented in the grades youll wake up someday to realize that the grades the subject of the grades are the things that aberrate thetan and theyre put together in that order because they are the things which can be contacted in that order do you see its very tricky those are all the things that aberrate thetan now you can slide over into chain of engrams new chain of engrams after youve got this lets get therapy engrams all of sudden weve got therapy engrams my god hes been operated on chopped up bisect ed and finally you get down to basic in space opera where they used to take him apart and leave him on bench for week because he was bad see and this is the basic on being operated on see something like that you can soar right on down through these cases now were really talking about resistive case when were talking about case that wont run on 3 this guy is out of valence this guy has his identity all mixed up hes got his engrams all mixed up his memory is somebody elses hes got everything and anything disowned right so to solve this so as to get him to get rid of his body thetans not to solve his total reality because that comes at 7 you saw down through this line of anything that would make bunch of thetans group together get the theory see its just bunch of thetans are going to scrunch see so the thetans go scrunch together what would make bunch of thetans go scrunch well psychiatric treatment one of the nastiest chains i ever saw in my life i picked up some couple of psych iatrists on planet which is remote from here had gotten hold of girl and messed her all up and of course she was already group of thetans and then they fixed her up second dynamicw ise and every other damn way that you could possibly think of and then put her in some kind of tub and gave her elect ric shocks in tub and there was burning electrode in the tub they had ball they had ball and when the girl kicked the bucket for some how or another by some carrier method i dont know how got here only of course as being cluster which is longer even possible to pick up or run body all this cluster could do was just make people sick and it obsessively attacked people and those things are around now when you run the engram chain you will run down to point where they becam cluster and itll go down some chain all of sudden youve got that and youve got what we call melazzo the second you run the mutual engram the whole key of it is the mutual engram to them they lot of them just go bingobango bllthth leaving some on whom you have to now run incident 1 to make them blow see thats the common sequ ence of this thing because these clust ers can be so vicious and so hard on body one is apt to think that all pressures this is another one thats been introduced sideways in boy people have been so god damned busy thinking it isnt even funny it is fascin ating you know i find more of these damn additives you know like if the person has pressure on his body he must have cluster it doesnt follow brother it doesnt follow one thetan can give plenty of pressure on body and to give you some idea of how much how much horrible action can be thrown into body or how much action or stress can be put on body by thetan last year i busted my back my arm and my knee they healed up very rapidly but it was all in doing things that were beyond the my arm and my knee they healed up very rapidlybu t it was all in doing things that were beyond the ability of body to stand pick up or resist see i could resist em all right you you get the idea so the guy himself can bust himself up and youll have the experience up around 7 some place of trying to investigate like mad what the hell is this horrible pressure on my shoulder i must have another body thetan i this i that dadada oh my god wows you know and find out that somebody someplace in your vicinity day or two before simply made loud noise or something of this sort and at that moment you protected the body from it to move it over sideways and you havent let go of it yet you idiot its its goof things like this somebody was way up the line came down with terrible lot of nasal trouble and so on and ive forgotten exactly what they told but it was just that they hadnt owned their immediate environment yet and it sort of backed up and were at the present moment holding onto their their nostrils holding onto their nostrils and here you had here you had an advanced ot section person who was ill holding on to her nostril she found this out herself and let go of her nostrils and miraculously in about three seconds about set of operations worth of sinusitis cleared up see the medicos would have had ball with it so dont think that guy also cant do this very reactively down in the vicinity of 3 and 4 or down in the vicinity of service far or down in the vicinity of bm bmbm all thats really wrong with thetan you know is thetan concentrates his actions onto just one of thetans abilities so thetan whos in good shame has got all of these abilities but some guy starts specia lizing in only this fixed ability he cant do anything else hes weak as cat in all other directions so that you get i think it was jung to mention infamous names well i dont know that jung is infamous freud broyer the rest of these guys theyre just bandits but jung i think it was had poltergeist phenomena all he had to do was sit down in the room and bookcase or something would split down through the center see well any thetan can split up bookcases hell i mean thats easy but he didnt know he was d oing it and it caused lot of trouble in other words he was totally reactive on the basis and totally non recognizing improvement in case is mostly meant walking it up the line to advanced realities and awarenesses hes going in the direction of truth now so the handling of case the handling of case whatever process or process youre involved with is to get charge off and there is certain main line charge which you must get off and those are the grades and the fastest way to get that charge off and the most valuable charge to get off are of course the exact grade processes and once youve done those thats it boy thats it lets say you start in and run chain of engrams and this is the one variable you run chain of engrams and then you come along and you try to run the chain of engrams thats gonna be an overrun right away thats gonna be an overrun nothing but because youre on the same chain the guy erased to beco an engram release he got onto the same chain well youre not likely to get on to it very easily unless you coax the bird onto it and you say that chain wasn t flat and you get what the content of the engram was and then try to run the engram again now youre liable to get into trouble now the reason why engrams run so easily out of this lifetime and so badly in this lifetime is the fellow has very few back track associations he has some but he has very few back track associations with body thetans so theoretically the further back track he gets the less thetans hes got you get out of this lifetime why you maybe only got half dozen thetans or something like that that are carried along with the guy do you see so that its little bit difficult to run an engram in this lifetime so dont be surprised when your chains rather rapidly go out of this lifetime and your engrams suddenly run because youre running the guys own engrams do you see but your best bet is to find one in this lifetime and try to get it run because that splits up this but you can never the less separate him out from the mass and increase his reality but you see what youre trying to do see what the design of the bank is is what im trying to show you here now you start main line processes and let us say we have released the guy now on pr pr 4 source with those commands and on that subject and we start to run it again we are in trouble boy we are in trouble because were right exactl where he went release and it now constitutes an overrun and that is now going to be mess right now you ask what in the name of common sense is an s and d but the isolation of source well isnt it funny you can run quite few s and ds on somebody you can run at least w and an s and u s and d on them and as guy goes along and gets pts from some other quarter you can run another s and d one of your sins is running too many s and ds and trying to run s and ds on people that dont need s and ds now thats the main sins running too many s and ds and running s and ds on people who are not pts i mean those are auditor case supervisor sins you show big fat folder thats got forty two s and ds in it and somebody was nuts boy all they were doing was hanging him up with wrong items so of course he got more and more frantic about it because they never did find the suppressiv so that was misalignment of source so theyre giving him wrong sources and these wrong sources will hang up and hell keep these mocked up very nicely thats why you straighten out lists lot of work to straighten out lists qu ite skilled operation actually but in the net gain of this that is the subject of one of the power processes every time you ask fellow how he is youre running conditions when you say to him how does it seem to you now and so forth why youre running some the subject certainly of 5 this is the elementary actions do you follow but you try to run the process itself again uhhhhh murder and sudden death now i have seen the remark in review folder and i hope i never see it again mid ruds have been overrun on the case ive also seen the remark ruds have been overrun on the case well this could mean only that the auditor didnt quit when he got an f n in that session on that chain of arc breaks that would be an overrun but arc breaks run all the way they run all the way from the minus scale to ot8 the phenomena of arc breaks as long as youre in this universe and as long as youre alive the phenomena of arc and u holds true and you get up around ot8 someplace it doesnt matter much but the net result here is that the case supervisor and the auditor they have problem and that is the case which is resistive you have find some charge to take off the case without overrunning the case and thats why when you take resistive case assessme nt and you the auditor flies the needle on each one of the subjects and thinks hes doing something hes just cut the case supervisors throat or if he lets it be itsad hes just cutting the case supe rvisors throat because its liable to f n now you have the the rather touchy business of instead of being able to dive in on this therapy chain and take off bd bd fall bd you know bongbong another incident fall bd fall fall fall you know bd long fall bd fall another incident you see instead of being able to do that youre already going past an f n youre liable to get protest on the thing it isnt keyed in it isnt available now do you get what the difference is so actually to this degree you are prospecting for charge so its just great to fly the needle on everything thats just great only as long as the case is running well now lets take the case that he got his review his case supervision was quite competent his auditing was quite competent and he goes to the examiner and his free needle has packed up between walking the way from the auditing session to the examiner and he says it was great review but it didnt handle the pain in his left lumbosis you know now you have resistive case thats what you know because the normal action not the usual action cause these are all usual actions the normal action that you would take with case didnt fly it the needle f ned and so forth but on those things theres something sitting around some place that isnt released now your problem is when this happens on lower grades youve got all the phenomena of 3 to kick the pc in the head natu rally hes got problems naturally hes got not necessarily problems but hes got all kinds of oddities do you follow so our problem here now what do we do well you do resistive case assessment to find some area of charge and then you set it up for the auditor to discharge that area and when he gets that area discha rged hes gonna get some change in this case we have to know what area the case is really hung up in now case which is out ruds let give you some idea case which is out ruds christ we can put in ruds cleeeeaar back to the beginning of the universe and we can put in arc breaks until hell wont have it oh yes one of the ways you trigger this you see is to ask him for serious arc breaks similar serious arc breaks he isnt gonna f n on that right away and hell look this over one of the ways of doing this is some version of well its just its itsa hes gonna do it by itsa youre going to go earlier so youre doing these little scales all the way see youre doing these little scales well you bleed them for char ge you always do arcu cd ei and now if you really want to start bleeding down on arc breaks or something you ask for one that ordinarily doesnt come up thats side panel incomplete cycles of action if you were to find pc who said in an arc break hes rather resistive pc see and you found that he had hell of time with reality hard to get case change out of him and he says he says something like this hell they didnt let finish it oh well you just start running incomplete cycles of action and tracing back earlier incomplete cycles of action and earlier cycles of action and theyre all arc breaks and do your scale on them too of course the arc break is actually the incomplete cycle of action because that causes n arc break now also overruns cause an arc break so what has been overrun tends to cure arc breaks now if you run wha t has been overrun while being alert for arc breaks you can get more char ge off you can play it against itself now if youre very clever when somebody says prep check 3 or something like this as case supervisor your ears are right straight up and very alert to catch any arc break that shows up you see on section 3 has anything been suppressed babababababambam bam was there an arc break there yes starts to run just little bit too long dont you see and so forth well catch the arc breaknow if it flies on an arc break can you finish the prep check well unfortunately but on prep checks on 3 youre pecul iarly liable to get off into an arc break chains and its one that you should know its standard datum everything im giving you is standard datum the rundown then of rudiments the rundown of secondaries and the rundown these are chains chains chains and the rundowns of engrams can be done on any case below 3 they can be done on any case above 3 so therefore these are very fruitful areas where you look for charge you got it you want to increase pcs reality you just generally remove charge from the case if you want to increase his reality in removing charge from case you remove the highest quality char ge you can get do you follow so the processe s then are little ladder that goes up this which have exact rungs and then theres this sort of bigger rope that you can climb up on both sides now one of these little rungs they handle that whole subject they key out that whole subject the guy feels great on this whole subject see but there is still all kinds of this on the case now if you understand this if you understand what youre doing you understand the mechanics of this thing you wont get wrapped around telegraph pole by somebody telling you something stupid or silly it is always better to audit against an understanding of what the devil youre handling and thats why i like to teach you not against rote there is rote there is rote in standard tech the like of which you never heard of but i want to tell you what is going on you dont have to figure it this is why what rote there is is there now if its itsa and earlier incident itsa and with arc breaks scale that you can assess each time youve got totally unlimited process and similarly on green forms you are very soon going to if you run too many green forms on somebody youre very soon going to have done too many s and ds youre going to have done too many remedy bs there is whats the trouble with green form you can do as many green forms as you like as long as you dont do too many lists on them cause those lists that very soon runs into an overrun fiecause listing is sort of process and it has limitation but if all items of the green form were simp ly itsaed or earlier run with itsa and the arc break with the arcu cdei if earlier runs see itsa or earlier itsa its itsa or earlier itsa itsa or earlier itsa any earlier similar incident i dont care what what came up on the green form see horse chest nuts we dont care good horse chestnuts horse chestnuts horse chestnuts good is there any earlier similar horse chest nuts see thats your thats your bible therefore i dont like to give you whole bunch of cann ed questions about what you say on green form you can ask the pc about this subject and it doesnt beco rote process and therefore it doesnt have an opportunity to get overrun do you follow so youre asking about this subject the subject is what is important now when you run green form and then you try to run five or six process type questions or qs and as big additives of this particular character you wrap the pc around telegraph pole so the only thing you are asking him for the only only only thing you are asking for on green form is the subject of the green form and earlier similar thing on the subject of the green form horse chestnuts itsa itsa itsa f n earlier horse chest nuts itsa itsa itsa itsa f n ea rlier chestnuts earlier earlier f nnow your only liability in this particular instance the thing didnt read in the first place so you have to be alert at every turn for one false read and two suppressed read theyre both he sides of this coin ill give you an actual example the other day fellow went into session and didnt like the auditor and asked for missed withhold it didnt read so as long as it didnt read he didnt say anythingthe idiot and the auditor said thats clean and went on by the thing and pc at the end of the session fell on his head natu rally now exactly what was wrong there was missed withhold suppressed but by looking at it you dont have to ask suppressed every time but by looking at the pc you see theres something there learn to look at the pc you say horse chestnuts and pc yeah horse chestnuts you say on horse chestnuts has that horse chestnuts been suppressed bwooom see mmmm alright good tell about that anything and all of sudden youve got chain that has never come up in view and tells you why the green forms never succeed on this pc t he subject is sup pressed now the other reason the green forms dont succeed on pcs when they dont there are two other reasons one is because somebody overruns the lists that were called for on the green form the other one is that the thing has falsely been reading for time immemorial he had he was out in lower walla walla and some auditor had new emeter he didnt know how to run and hed heard that youre supposed to ask for missed withholds or withholds and he asked for withholds the same time he hit the tone arm with his thumb and the fellow said well youve got withhold it read and the pc says uuuuuuoo dooo he had to think about it well what was that what is it there must be one there so the question goes live and five six seven eight years later the question is still live and the pc is around the bend trying to answe r this thing that never read in the first place you got it thats true of any read all you know as class viii when an meter reads is that the emeter read the chances are it read in response to what you asked the pc the chances are in favor of that but thats all you know about it now if theres anything the least bit odd about the pcs response anything the least bit off you check that read you check for false reads and youre sitting there and the pc has been going natter natter natter do you have presen t time problem oh yes everyone is so mean to and theyve stolen my shoes lately and oh natter natter natter natter do you have missed withhold thats clean oh christ learn how to audit thats what i always think when i see one of these damned things for christy sake learn how to audit you know critical pc missed withhold now that it didnt read doesnt mean anything because you might not have made an impingement on the pc to the you know he might not even have heard you it might be suppressed now if the pc gives the manifestations of missed withhold and the missed withhold question doesnt read you ask suppressed natu rally youve got to work with reads youre not phonograph record at class viii all you know is that the meter read on something it read on passin g car it read on the moon going into another phase the chance s are it read on what you said but the chances are simply slightly in favor of that do you follow now the other thing is is when the meter doesnt read what you know is that the meter didnt read and the chance s are in favor that that is or but it is not anything you can take for granted and if the manifestations this pc comes into session oh yes ah ah ah i hai crying and you say do you have an arc break thats clean thank you very much oh boy youre not going any place from there on boy i dont know what youre doing behind the wheel of car but youre not drivin the chance s are very greatly in favor of having an arc break its not inevitable maybe shes just like that but well you say do you have an arc break it didnt get read has anything been suppressed on arc breaks has anything been suppressed i dont care how you say it you want to get the suppress off the arc break if there is suppress on it and it goes zooomp or do you have an arc break that reads now you can get into this kind of fire fight do you have an arc break has anything been suppressed do you have an arc break that reads and its protest read so the pc says oh i dont think so alright has anything been protested didnt read anything been suppressed read do you have an arc break read im afraid youll have to answe r the question what youve done is prove that the meter read do you see so in moments of doubt you either prove it read or prove it didnt read see you are the guy driving the meter and it is very very remarkable instrument there is meter and i think it sells for 595 pese tas or dollars i think the dollar has dropped below the pese ta now anyhow well after all macnamara did his best and in his best he got us war with viet nam and ran the country into deep debt and as reward he was made the head of the world bank anyway did you know that i think the most remarkable things happen on this planet its just time we got busy you know how anybody could sit around and watch this one the guy runs the country into debt by spending threequarters of its income on military activity that didnt have anything to do with the price of fish and as reward they make him the head of the world bank which is the one loaning the money to the country in order to pay for the war you didnt notice that going on all these things happen all the time so its actually time you got busy see so what you know in driving this thing is that its damn good instrument the 595 kerputnicks medical meter that is sold currently reads only on body motion and passing cars i know ive taken one ive tested one ive tried to run somebody on it i tried to do something with it and it does nothing but run body motion it is very remarkable meter very very very remarkable because the thing reads more on the think than it does on the body and it reads so little on the body that it doesnt even get in your road its very remarkable meter by the way the name of it is very proper its really an electro psych ometer and psych in the dictionary means soul and anybody who calls anything else an electro psychometer would be telling lie if he used it on body or on disease do you get the point its an electrical means of measuring the spirit thats exactly what its name says electra psych ometer its called for short em eter somebody has come along and put on the recent labels of it electrometer theyre trying to shorten the name down but the proper name is an emeter or an electro psych ometer now its very remarkable instrument but like all instruments it wont operate without being operated and you as an auditor have got to have confidence in the instrument confidence in what it says and youve got to know what it says and it says there was charge there of some kind now the charge could have been restimulated by the environment or the charge by the environment suddenly impinging on the pc he had bite by fly in his left ankle or it is by your question and some fidgety pc thats leaping all over the place all the time it could be body motion i dont let my pcs leap all over the place i dont know why you let yours my pcs always sit very still quite remarkable ive never had pc m ove in ses sion to amount to anything and i thought oh wow i was holding them anyway if pc keeps kn ocking the hands together give him one hand electrode he clever you dont have to strap him up but the point is you know the meter read the tone arms quite reliable on anything very reliable there is slight thing that meter will have to warm up sometimes during session but the tone arm is very very very reliable what its doing actually is measu ring the density of the mass in association with the thetan is really what its doing its the amount of resistance in the mass which is connected to the thetan so actually you can lean on wall and get the tone arm reading on the wall quite interesting tone arm doesnt just read on the body it reads on what the thetan is connected to with regard to it actually if you the male and female figures there have been worked out carefully and it might be of interest to you that they are taken from the united state army ohms resistance on dead bodies and the first work that was done on this they went around battle fields for something or in morgues or some place measuring dead bodies and so they worked out pattern of how you went about this so i extended their work little bit and got these positions but dead bodies go from five to twelve five hundred so when you have that read you are then only reading on the body and youre not now reading on the thetan when it flies you have lost connector do you see and its the liveness is the float of the thetan but the tone arm position is the density of the body not the density of the thetan now when the tone arm position is high it is because theres lot of thetan impinged on the body there could be lot of thetans impinged on the body which we learn in 3 or lot of thetan when youre going to start going above 3 they sometimes start driving you out of your mind every time you go on the meter youre about 45 or something stupid like this and then you find out finally what youre leaning on but the main point here is that youre dealing with highly reliable instrument the efforts to curtail or to injure the distribution of the emeter or forbid its use or something like this are quite cunningly slanted and because the emeter is very important fortunately almost anybody can build one if you know the exact circuit and you dont let somebody depart too far from that circuit why theyre very easily manufactured and they give you they give you the done but you have to know what dope youve got if the read is above three it is not body read it has to be thetan or mental mass to push it up there and that can be composed of one or more beings and oddly enough when overruns occur anywhere along the line why the tone arm goes up and that is what causes the thing the guy has been too long at it the guy did it once too often and that is the basic reason for the height of ta now if you go too frantic on this subject why youll have bad time ive seen c ses and auditors go absolutely frantic theyve got to get the ta down in the next two minutes there is reason to get it down in the next two minutes two or three session are perfectly adequate for somebody but all you do is keep clicking charge off and overruns and so on there is fast way to get it down its just the indications of overruns indications of list indications of bpc but it doesnt always stay down it then goes up this is the lick and promise locate the bpc on the thing and something like that and you start blowing the meter down but the main thing that you are interested in is getting it down so that it rides in normal range well how do you get it there well now to get it down youve got to have someplace to take charge off the case correct well the way you take charge off the case to find overruns and rehab em now you take one of these fat folders that comes from the ching wong tao organization and because they couldnt get all the books translated into chinese or something they dont know some of the hot dope and theyve been listing folders and theyve got folders which are six inches thick and so on you actually could start taking charge off to get tone arm down just by going back and finding the over lists and calling them to view and indicating them and finding the item and so on and so on itll do things for the case too it isnt necessar ily whats got the tone arm up dont bet on the idea that you have to find out what the tone arm is up on in order to take the tone arm down you can drive yourself nutty this way too what is maki ng this tone arm go up what is this thing what is this thing what is this magic thing that we are looking for oh there must be some clue to this it must be some specific overrun some place hell i wouldnt try my wits on it id just find an early overrun that would shoot the later one do you ever get tired of doing something good is there an earlier time now ill show you real one its the velocity of the question this is not neces sarily something youd with off on pc but im just showing you mecha nics you could say to this pc you could say did you ever get and theyd choose something see serious arc break this thing here on the whole track on the whole track did you ever kill anybody well you best believe you know naturally well good now were going to find the chain of killing people how far back do you thing thats going to go before it f ns now ill give you an even worse one and this you shouldnt use its out of 7 trace back moments of guilt to basic dont use that but you can take something like the persons feeling guilty now you could make little little list you make up see then that doesnt shoot the whole thing to glory thats why you make up these little lists see it catches some side panel if youre gonna run down but theres charge on it see you make up this little list and youre going to have murder battle anything you could think of see with five or six words you know armies wars see something like that then you assess what reads and wars read good were gonna go down the war chain it read so it mus t be charged we already have now where do we pick up the clue of this is from the itsa of former sessions we get track of this this fellow says this fellow says im just heing drafted fills with horror thats just in passing itsa see well theres certainly something about armies soldiers battles see theres going to be something someplace and he gives you whole chain you could run see now we didnt evaluate for him because he said it see we found this in his itsa see weve heard it in his itsa so we take this and then we expand this out so that is catches more area and we find what part of that area it reads and then we dont fly it with glimpse we run its see christ change pcs left and right now lets take one like this girl has got very bad arc breaks she says when actually its moment of loss somebody has has left her and doesnt love her anymore and this reads as an arc break and so on well you can run it as an arc break by specif ying what the arc break chain is about which is love now where the hell do you supposed that would wind you up now theyve told you the arc breaks about love so you just start running earlier arc breaks on the subject of love this is very heavy subject because its right along side of affinity and you can run awful lot of chains do you follow youre now in the business of finding things to audit but you dont bother ever to do this unless youve got guy you could do it for practice but you dont bother to do this unless youve got guy who isnt running well then you get the assessment resistive cases you find the zone or area in which he is apparently hung up or thats hot and then you find something associated with that that you can run lot of charge off of and you go right on down the bank on this and you blow it and youre gonna change your guy you see how its done thats the formula therefore you can do this as c s unless ouve got auditors of course that just take the list and fly the needle on the whole list and you can get lot of charge off the case now you get motif charge off the case on something the guy is hung up on his psycho somatics disappear and so on see now the guy is not in hospital his sicknes s is ptp to him to some degree but it turns out its physically ill hes physically ill alright if he is physically ill you have to make up your mind what youre going to do about this physical ly illness now is it something that has to be treated and can be treated or should be treated in order to knock it out do you see well theres funny funny thing about this you can get this treated and you usually better damn well had but at the same time youll find out it very often doesnt get well until you audit it ive seen ive seen penicillin hang up for six weeks until the chain was run the made the guy sick now because he was on penicillin he didnt kick the bucket do you see and it did do lot for him and it tended to straighten him out but he would up with wheeze or something dont you see now after youve done something for the acute state of this illness or its been treated in some fashion or another now you can go in and run the engram on it now youll go on down that chain what kind of sickness what sicknes s chain are you going down on now the trick about it is hes physically ill and if you start auditing down an illness chain youre liable to miss it comp letely because it isnt that he is physical ly ill its the fact that hes suffering from bullets in the back you know hes got arthritis and hes suffering from bullets in the back and so on well the trick of assessment in action there would be to find really what is this guy ill from well its to find out what is he sitting in and what is he sitting in now thered be several ways of discovering what he was sitting in and what do you know you could list it you dont list it to f n youve got one of these crazy lists you can make list of what kind of an engram is it itll obey the laws of listing if you want it to obey the laws of listing but there are whole bunch of questions which dont follow the laws of listing because theyre not list questions what has been overrun it doesnt go to one item its not one item list because its not trying to locate source of anything so you can say to the fellow you can say to the fellow something on the order of what are you what are you afraid of now you could list that to one item but you could simply ask him well have you ever been afraid of that before and run whole series of secondaries and so help pete the illness it liable to fall right out in your lap on that chai n of secondaries now when youve run some secondaries another type of engram outflows and flies on secondaries so that youve got something else thats got to go down do you get the idea now that you can audit so fast weve got to figure out ways so that you can audit slow do you see how its done and do you see why now what ive given you is actually in this lecture the total rationale and background of auditing there isnt anything much lies along side of it and unless you add bunch of weird odd facts coming in such as that in order to find out whether or not person has body thetans you should scan the thing up and down nuts the way you find out if somebody has body thetans is can you run an incident 1 thats simple now if you can run an incident 1 but hes just mocking it up well that beco mes an overrun so you better rehab it but if youre running an incident 1 which another thetan incident 1 and that gets overrun you rehab that too youre not in any danger but this is how you find out if there are body thetans because that is the mutual incident the mutual incident of all thetans is incident 1 quite trick to find it anyway i hope the information which i have given you will assist you to study the exact rote actions which you take because this is the rationale which mak the rote actions rote thank you very much certainty of standard tech lecture given on 1 october 1968 and what number lecture is this eight now we know somebody missed one eighth lecture one october 1968 ad18 the substance of these lectures should not of course be delivered with total ferocity because up the line someplace the saint hill course will teach its teach ings and academies will teach theirs and somebody will pay attention to the information which is contained on that and someday in the future the class viii course will contain auditors who can audit and that would be very nice i now find out that most of the data concerning listing is actually still extant on the saint sill tapes this was great mystery its merely that people hadnt studied them now in view of the fact that clay table demonstration has gone out very thoroughly over the past year or two we can expect well people did demonstration corny demonstration i heard about today the little blobs the auditor and little blob was the pc and the arc break was busted line between the auditor and the pc my contempt youre dealing with bank and the bank is in the pc what is the mecha nism what is the mecha nism in that bank that occurs the most deadly sins of auditing are of course auditing without any comprehension of the laws of listing these are that is deadly it can wrap pc around telegraph pole and i mean those laws of listing which were put out in bulletin in 1968 and any one of those not followed can wrap pc around telegraph pole it is very serious it is sufficiently serious that five pcs audited in row on an auditor who did not know the laws of listing and so on and who didnt know these faces had trouble each one of them with ethics almost immediately within some forty eight hours and it goes something like this out tech results in out ethics then out ethics has to be put in heavily in order to hold the line to get tech back in if tech were perfect ethics would be unneces sary so you see that an auditor who doesnt know his business opens the door to ethics and the degree that tech has gone out is direct measure of the amount of ethics which has to be put in direct this has been the subject of actual test now it may not occur to somebody that i am telling you facts i am not telling you my ideas because i say it is true is reason its true because im telling you what it is is because it is true and anybody who has an opinion that differs with rons anybody in the world can have an opinion that differs with mine but you see im not telling you opinions now when i give you the data of scientology and the unraveling of the problems of the mind i am not giving you my opinions i am giving you factsl and they dont comp are with your opinions your opinions havent got anything to do with it and my opinions dont have anything to do with it you understand out tech normally stems from some kook who gets an opinion and he thinks freedom of think has something to do with truth he can think all he pleases he can have all the opinions in the world but when he goes into an org and indulges in one of these god damned opinions that throws tech out shooting is too good for him an opinion of this character well if you get floating needle on engrams then you can never run any more engrams that opinion was bought once into saint hill big discus sions on the subject would you please tell how you could ever run 3 if it was true so all you have to do is think it through know your business and think it through and you will be able to differentiate the opinion from the fact now if clay table demonstration can go out in the year 1968 it can go out in the year 1975 other things can go out but it is not possib to predict what will go out because there can be an infinity of wrongnesses around any rightness there is actually predicting under the sun moon or stars what any academy or saint hill student will suddenly assum because aberration is bunch of stuck lies so some teach ing comes through the truth comes through it misses this guy to the degree that it restimulates some fixed idea now ill tell you how fixed an idea can go bad somebody has been taught for two or three thousand years that man is basicall evil you tell him man is basical ly good he considers that belief or religious teaching and wa he beze your idea to put it lightly because hes crazy now you can prove that man is basicall good for this reason overts read as overts not because hes been taught that it was bad to do it he doesnt get well unless he gets his overts off when we process person he becomes better more ethical his ability rises now look if he was basically evil he would get worse more stupid do you follow so all you have to do is think the think through on the face of it it proves itself there would be reason under the gods green earth to process him at all if he were evil because all you would do would be to run out all the things that taught him to be good and you would wind up with somebody who was stupid vicious couldnt do anything did nothing but loaf yes but processing demonstrates the complete reverse somebodys around feeling tired feeling tired and he cant work and all that well that cant be native state because when you process it he gets ambitious and works but you havent educated him or taught him to get ambitious at work you simp ly ran out his blunted purposes his betrayed intentions he had some good intention he was trying to do something and he got kicked in the teeth too often and then he gets tired so that auditing is in actual fact subtracting process and the final product of auditing demonstrates that mans basically good now in christian countries men are taught that man is basicall evil so you say this to this character youre trying to teach man is basical ly good auditing is subtractive process and takes away the evil deeds and out of valences and into evil valences and so forth and the fellow gets better and he gets more moral and he gets more perceptive and he gets more able and he has more energy and so forth he knows youre its impossible if its subtractive process now lets watch this guy in an auditing session he punishes the pc he knows the only way you could make anybody better is to punish them and his pc beco mes worse more tired less able the iq goes down now this is direct example of fixed idea getting in the road of truth and auditing so thats why i say an auditor has case student has case we are now above the level we can talk about it isnt true if it isnt true for you to an academy student because thats true thats the closest touch hes got to this reality but im not teaching an acad emy student right now and you have business receiving it at that level these are the facts this is the hot dope theyre not based on my opinions i might have entirely different opinions and often have had but i have enough self discipline not to pass them on to you theres lot of things i could believe in lots for instance there are things that i would like to be doing that are oh my god when i look at some of these politicos the worst valences ive ever been in contact with rise to the fore but i dont allow that to color the job i have job to do you have job to do im going to let you in on something i didnt even get r6ed im not from this planet now if i can take it on that itd be very good thing to clean up this planet you who were here can damn well share the responsibility and not say its all up to ron thats an interesting thought isnt it right away somebody comes along and tries to hang as responsible for all the aberrations of the human race because im trying to do something for it well you can expect such thing to be passed on to you but you find out in the long run if you do your job do it cleanly stick to the truth stick to facts do those things which exactly work and go on forward you come out right in the end its the only way you ever come out right when you compromise with your own reality when you deny your own basic goodness when you indulge in your own stuck ideas you dont come out right so somew here up the track somebody listening to this tape he was trained by cracker jack academy supervisor his saint hill course was right on the groove they didnt flub clay table they did great job of it all the way across the lines this guy really knows his business he knows his business backwards and forwards hes moved through 7 he really knows how to do power and he comes to 8 and he hears this tape well the only thing i wish to advise him that if he doesnt keep doing his job and keep the data straight it can get as bad as it has gotten you see the road out is the only road there is the road in and down is total stop and stays stuck forever it isnt road its hole therefore i enjoin upon you the job of listening to the straight data teaching the straight data using the straight data and keening the road out open and when these wild opinions come in sideways to knock them out and kick them aside with the contempt they dese rve holding the line holding the road open is not an easy job every suppressive that comes along the line has to invalidate it he has to discredit it he goes into dramatization of discrediting because he himsel f is terrified what if some other being got stronger its all he can think of what is some other being got stronger he in his egocentric nonsense thinks that the other being would beco more evil and therefore destroy him with more enthusiasm but why does he think that caus he knows damn well he deserves it and once more on this subject how does he know so well he deserves it so when i give you this data i am not giving you very broad area of opinion im giving you exactly what works i am giving it to you exactly as it works and these are the data which you have to know how to do its the data which are stressed on the class viii course you will not find any data outside that perimeter not even worth paying any attention to now somewhere up the line probably somebody will invent something else besides lsd that is now exported with such enthusiasm by psychiatrists to make them drum up business more than one way to drum up business the psychi atrist you know is just dramatizing mad man by definition there are psych iatrists in r6 and certain people go into valences and beco this thing and do it and they attain their public presence by the fact that people know the symbol in r6 and so accept them without too much objection theyre out of valence in r6 now when you get pushed sideways this and that its because you think some new data has come out now i tell you exactly how exactl how case beco mes unsolvable and exactly why an auditor squirrels and ive told you something about this before but this is exactly why and how standard tech is missed by about four or five miles missed and then because the case has been missed the auditor sits there looking or the case supe rvisor sits there looking for an unusual solution because the case now seems unusual all unusual cases are cases that have been mishandled under the heading of standard tech they have already been mishandled by departure from standard tech and then appear to be unsolvable and then appear to need some new solution and the auditor or the case supervisor seeing this odd phenomenon sitting there of apparently an unresolving case then dream up something new or think they have to go into some other area and practice yogi exercises or drill holes in his head or something of this sort do you see how that happens but i assure you of this and this is the stable data this datum right here standard tech has already been missed theres miss in standard tech all unusual cases come about through miss in standard tech the resolution of all such cases is to find out where standard tech becam unstandard do you see so heres this case hes wideopen invitation to the auditor and the case supervisor to squirrel because he appears to be so unstandard buyuyuyu hes not solving we did everything were supposed to do and nothing hasnt happened so we have to do something else now lets dream up some new now the danger of this is these new ideas usually come from stuck and fixed ideas and they dont apply to the case they only apply to the guy who thought them up so much so that the late volney matheson developed drill and he found out the cases that were being audited unsuccessfully way back when when he was fooling around with this with meters and so on he found out what had been audited on the preclear and then put the auditor on the cans and found out that was what was wrong with the auditor you see these failed cases the auditor was trying to audit his case out of the pc hell thats the introduction of fixed ideas you go back over case like this standard flub and honest to pete it is sitting there so big and so wide that you wonder how in the name of god anybody could miss it they could just about as well miss ten thousand watt search light in the middle of dark night it is right therel ill give you an example give you an example unsolvable case came up absolutely unsolvable my god you couldnt do anything with this case well the reason you couldnt do anything with him he had been two days overrun on arc straightwire past an f n and then this couldnt be rehabbed because he was in the middle of secondary but every effort to rehab the arc straightwire f n collided with the secondary which he had already skidded in to because its the next next step up and the pc through overrun and so forth he just slid into the next step up and all the time the auditor was trying to rehab the arc straightwire the guy was trying to run the secondary which made an interesting looking session auditor trying to do one thing the pc doing something else you know well you would have said by golly thats enough thats enough enough certainly to have thrown any case out the window right there yeah yeah yeah the case becam unsolvable but going back through earlier green forms on the case n r s was found on missed withholds an r s was found on connecte d to suppressive group and neither one had been handled or touched by the auditor now how the hell could an auditor go right past the green form see great big r s turn on on missed withhold and never inquire what it was not only that but another auditor had come along later doing green form and had gotten blow down on missed withholds and had gotten blow down on connected to suppressive group and had never inquired what they were in addition to that in the sea check the guy had walked into the organization so damn high on lsd that his eyeballs were archimedes spirals going round and round and that was in the sea check so what happened he sat the case down pulled the missed withhold it was an over your dead body sort of of an action got what suppressive group it was the fellow knew and then rehabbed fantastic amount of overrun and weird release on drugs i dont know the length of the session i think the total session maybe took forty five minutes so here where standard tech had already been passed by we had an unsolvable case that was just sitting there anybody who really didnt know his business would have immediately accepted this invitation to do something wild weird and wonderful here was this fellow with his tone arm stuck way up in the roof unresolvable couldnt be audited nattering wouldnt go near qual hardly could be forced into an auditing chai r reporting to the m spen t thirty six hours or so in hospital where the doctors could find nothing wrong with him these are all unusual solutions his unusual solution to his case was to stay away from qual quals unusual solution was to send him to the hospital people were askin g for some brand new technique to come up and hit it and what was it it was case overrun on drugs with missed withhold and connecte d to suppressiv group also which didnt have to be resolved to solve the case he was also wanted by his draft board and was running out on it as known present time problem which didnt come up in auditing so you see standard tech only had to be about three quarters in to resolve the case case resolved beautifully now when i see folder which is about foot thick with mislisted lists i know there is enough there to wrap it around telegraph pole when i see tremendous number of sessions which didnt f n and when i also havent got the case folder for the entirety of the auditing and the case has been overrun on lot of early processes i could feel very very sad about the whole thing because its almost an herculean job to untangle it the goofs have added on top of goofs have added on top of goofs now youre going to see this in case supervision in class viii you not only have to be whiz bang auditor you also have to be case supe rvisor and there are two distinct skills to audit you only know how to audit but to case supervise you have to know exactly what is wrong with the case in order to order what auditor another trick entirely sepa rate tricks and if you think you have to know it to audit brother what you have to know to case supervise you have to know your data you have to know standard tech data main line because in one of these things you hand it over to only slightly experienced auditor who starts goofing it instead of repairing the list hes never heard of the laws of listing he attests that he has he can parrot something but he doesnt know why you do list and he doesnt know this and he doesnt know that and you ask him to repair list oh my god aaah he doesnt know enough about listing himself to repair mislisted list so you get back case folder where the case is more messed up you said the right thing you said straighten out this list and you gave it back you gave it to this auditor and this auditor he never heard of listing you thought he did but he somehow or another managed to sleep through it all and you get the folder back worse off he he didnt even repair the existing list he added nine page list to an already complete list and the case is worse off than before so you say well we will be hopeful about this and we direct what it is and we get the guy grooved in on exactly what hes supposed to do and we give it back to him or to another auditor and when we get the folder back hes decid ed that it was really not lists that was worrying this fellow but the fact that the man hates auditors so he has run from where could you hate an auditor do you see ant the case is now worse off and you as case supervisor get the thing back you will actually have to decid now that you are in fire fight of some kind or another and its over auditors dead body and so you have to have method of cutting their throats well the proper order is do an l1 with the prefix on lists and just clean up each read as it goes through in other words youre not going to let anybody look at list again youre going to pick up the arc breaks which are in restimulation on the subject of lists and let it go at that because thats all you can do so your case supervision is limited by the skill of the auditor whos doing the auditing for you you sometimes have to pull your shots you know for instance that this case needs to be to get the full four rundown or something like that theres something out with the full rundown and youve got an auditor there that you know damn well he cant do it well so therefore you have to figure out something he can do that will still straighten out the case and thats the only variability you get in case supervision your case supervisor orders may be beyond the ability of the auditor to execute that is usually demonstrated you never really pull your shots on case supervision you say exactly what hes supposed to be doing exactly its when you get into these wild fire fights or correcting correction so you give case supervision and then they goof it so you have to now correct the correction well you can only do that couple of times without all of sudden having such glorious mess on your hands that you had better take some more direct route obviously beyond the skill of the auditor to do even though its very standard action you say the case because he feels very sad is in an arc break of long duration thats standard statement sad case arc break long duration boom boom little data add up at once and you give it back to the auditor and the auditor gets in some kind of fire fight with the pc see and he puts in an r factor well i had folder today the auditor managed to get into fire fight with the pc over an rfactor god i dont know how he did that that must have been masterpiece how could you get into fire fight the auditor must have said something very weird instead of saying were going to do an assessment on the case this isnt what is was but instead of saying im going to assess list on your case and so forth were going to find out what type of resistive case you are must have because he had protest on resistive case so he must have mentioned it course he was good auditor he wouldnt evaluate na now some auditor you give an you give case supervision you say this girl is leading highly illegal sort of secon d dynamic existence so therefore were going to pull missed withholds you have gotten it on your intelligence lines that this is the case with this case dont you see or youve gotten it from something or other or the case natters in session all these various indicators or the case is just chewing up more husbands than she can get married to its sort of assem bly line you know so you figure there must be some kind of an irregularity on the second dynamic so obviously because the case is mad at men or something like this youve got indicat ors indicators indicat ors see and you say case is living rather irregular second dynamic existence pull the missed withholds then this auditor he shows the case the we dont have any we dont have any control over this you see as case supervisor but we sure can find out what happened cause the session wont come off unless its totally false reported and the pc when they go to the examiner isnt going to do anything if the session didnt come off why its going to show up on the examiner line and if it doesnt show up on the examiner line i guarantee itll show up on the ethics line later you got two spots of control here shows up at the examiners or it shows up at the ethics itll also show in further sign ups see so these spots if you were really doing case supervisor job your admin would be to find out who is in ethics whos in ethics trouble what pcs have just gone through here that ethics orders have been issue d on and another one would be from the registrar of who hasnt signed up for the next grade so youd want leaving interview now i can tell you the tech is out if over fifty percent of the pcs going through an hgc do not show up for leaving interview now you can jump on routing and you can jump on this and you can say how the hell did that get out the truth of the matter is pcs must be avoiding it so tech must be out now it would be very interesting then to take such people that didnt show up at the registrars office when they left the organization and to check them back against your folders and then you will find out that aloicious q zilch hgc auditor lies lies lies if the ta is at seven he writes two f n the lies are never slight and so you hang him and get on about your business case supervisors neck is always out the false auditing reports so therefore there are various checkpoints by which the false report shows up but the basis of this is and must be that the case supervisor has certainty on standard tech see he must know that standard tech applied standardly works if hes wondering does this work or something that doesnt work or should i go back to yogi i used to have such fun sitting in an ibis position he cant police it down like that now we had one today case supervision i gave little list to be audited little list one two three four items and this was what by understanding with the pc having trouble with any one of these items or with any one of these items charged and one of them blew down and f ned it was just the list blew down and f ned well i could tell this because the folder was i dont know eight or nine feet thick thats an exaggeration it was only about six inches thick but wow now we say well golly if the guy if the guy blew down and f ned hes got something wild abso lutely wild what terrible auditing he had all the way along the line well its obviously what was wrong with the case well its passed an f n and there isnt any thing you can do about it oh yeah oh as case supervisor that told that the person had withholds from that item so in the next session were going to pull the missed withholds because it was list of people who were trying to help him so i set up list of people who were trying to help this person and one of them blew down and he said oh they were absolutely terrible so i know then at once thats critical opinion so we pull the missed withhold elementary its not even very clever its very standard i want to find out where where is this character sitting this guy been audited over ptps missed withhold arc breaks what see well by ordering prep check on certain number of items after assessment i could tell from the answ ers where hes been sitting i was denied the information because on one of the items he blew down and went f n an d that was the end of that of course you didnt prep check beyond that theres still missed withholds sitting there so now were going to get in suppress on missed withholds and pull the missed withholds and the casell sail missed withholds dont read in session but they must be there they must be there cause the folders too thick see what i mean case has critical opinions folder too thick blows down on people trying to help him must have missed withhold person isnt sad so it isnt an arc break his case rollycoasters so it isnt ptp change oh theres chan ge there the only ones left is missed withholds now that would be comb ined with overts so when it comes back and the person doesnt have any missed withholds thats great im going to have overts and we will get around to this sooner or later and the case will longer go to review the case supervisor is in the business of ending off review cycles he is never in the business of starting them case supervisor who has too many people going to review after he has had them supe rvised in the hgc must be working with the damndest crew of bums as auditors anybody ever heard of or himself must be driven up the wall by inventiveness something must be very out but what you keep your paws on is standard tech dont let that slip see thats the thing which mustnt slip pcs slip auditors slip reporting of cases slips see various things slip but not standard tech that doesnt slip now unless you know that well subjectively and so on it will slip because you just have it on my say so so therefore the progress is that the auditor should be able to get horrendous wins with standard tech and boy when hes really got it in the groove sits down across from that ole pc and he says rattatatat and the meter says rattlybang f n rattata tat booms he just sits there an auditor who can audit this by the way gets so cocky and insufferable he cant be lived with he does and that is frailty because when you get hotter than pistol as an auditor you then automatically assume you can case supe rvise and thats another skill thats really calling your shots and when case supe rvision youre saying the number three ball in the right corner pocket and the auditor he doesnt even pick up cue he thinks its hit with base ball bat so youve entered this piece of randomity on your auditing lines and it tends to sort of begin to shake you little bit but if you know what can be done then you know what he ought to be doing and i assure you that standard tech correctly applied applied standardly gets one zero zero par cientum variations goof balled mucked up application and so forth are all that reduce it so its your business to get it applied your foe is the introduction of somebody who knows best the bird is sitting there auditing the pc and the pc comes up with wide open invitation to squirrel and the auditor the knuckle head departs from the c s and squirrels now youve got patch up of the session sighs because if this auditor squirreled once hes liable to squirrel twice so you have to start nailing it in with ethics presence and then the next thing you know you get the session folder back and hes not squirrel this time boy hes blown his cool from here to the north pole gone hes just in lot of pieces if you were to research into this you would find out that inadvertently youve put him to auditing his exgirlfriend or that she looks just like his mother something is goofed up here of some kind or another something has entered into it which has business in the line of any kind whatsoever when you get into one of these fire fights whereby youre trying to get case supervisor instructions actually done and the auditor is doing other things but every now and then you get an auditor who will be obliging and write down that he did what he didnt do and hes the only guy who can hang you you cant straighten that out as case supervisor youve got to go in through the lines youve got to go in to order restraining youve got to go into all kinds of side lines that you really have business in case supervisors neck is out mile on false auditing report so therefore he must be absolutely merciless when he receives one its the only thing that cana wreck him if he can get the facts and if he can read the auditing report thats another thing its an actual fact if im auditing for blood as qual here can tell you when i cant read the auditing redort it goes back with some aspe rity and velocity i wont have anything to do by the way this is very good rule dont have anything to do with an auditing report you cant read dont have anything to do with it if you get into it you will be over mastered sometimes by your curiosity to know what happened to zilch sort of like one man stanley continued story you know you want to know what happens to zilch so you try to make out this and he had new auditor today and this auditor writes script which is just continuous series of ees and this auditor writes script which is just continuous series of ees and you cant read it and the second you disco ver that to be the fact you take if you are really on the groove and youre really clever you really know your business you turn it around without trying to make it out and send it back for printing in different colored pen over every indecipherable word make him rewrite the whole thing and then you assign him projects in penmanship until he can write so that he can be read you never go it by halves because ill tell you why youre gonna eventually start winding up with headaches as case supervisor you got misunderstoods all over the place youre trying to find out what the hell did the pc say what what is that looks like ees is it leave have boo boo catterwamp and you sometimes read these out as they would actually look and you get butter wump mum hip and you keep doing this youre gonna wind up with an antipathy toward an auditing report an auditor actually part of his training should be to write rapidly legibly anybody can learn how to do it doesnt even take much practice few days ago i ordered an auditor to learn how to write and ill be of gun session came up next session that person did few days later came up the auditor was writing im sure the session wasnt slowed up only took him few days to learn how to write but case supervisor should never accept an indecipherable folder because he starts laying mysteries into his line hell start making mistakes and this is whats more i tell you he doesnt do his job fast see he does his job right now and so forth but that is to say he doesnt do his jod on the basis that the pc has got to be audited cause hes leaving for sdokane just out of pure cussedness dont do the folder what about that cc thats got to leave for sdokane bes got to catch four oclock plane weve got to give him session hes got his reservations and so forthl as case supervisor you should say bubber out bub let him catch the plane next saturday because i want him to go back to spokane right not rushed what frame of mind must this guy be in during the auditing session sitting on the edge of the chair watching his clock lets see its review awawaww in the first place standard sessions are very rapid and very very very rapid and theres percentage in pointing the guy wrong as ive told you before percentage in it whatsoever just make sure youre pointing it right dont think twice about you look at this and you wonder what the hell what whats this whats this i dont know this case isnt acting right and send it back to the auditor to get an assessment done send it back to the examiner to get the case looked at folder looks little bit funny to you looks little bit weird something little bit weird about it send it back to the examiner for another examination dont take chances with it because thats not where you save your time time is saved in the case supervision being correct and in the auditing being expert do you see and youll learn eventually so that your lines smooth out you do them very rapidly but when in doubt the only time you miss is when you get in rush or you talk you get in such rush you send for the auditor cuts your throat boy want to sail stock he thinks hes standing there looking condition of doubt in the teeth maybe hell tell you anything its facts and then of course youre just seeing the pc from his viewpoint and he perhaps is offended he has tried to help the pc and the pc wasn t helped in some fashion or another so hes offended so he blames you the fact that he forgot to start the session and plug in his meter he ignores so in the final analysis your grip on standard tech must be so standard that you expect standard results and settle for nothing less and you solve the problems that you run into in auditing on that basis now you could get into some situation where guy is in an upper ot this would be the toughest situation i would know of the guy is in an upper ot section classification as you walk on the scene as case supervisor and his ta is at 5 and he has apparently had all known remedies hes been run on what has been overrun he has been rehabbed on anything and everything you could think of and he his ta is up there and that something like that will be your first invitation to squirrel because heres heres the facts somewhere in that line of all this has been done is false report it hasnt i found one the other day case was way high what has been overrun has been run on the case bab aba baba i went back i found the session of wha t has been overrun do you know what the auditor did the auditor listed list of what has been overrun indicated reading items on it although many of them read and then didnt rehab any of the things that were overrun the right way to do this list is its it is not list it is sim ply an auditing question for which you are writing down the answ ers in order to do something with them so he write down the first thing and it had fall alright now at that moment you take that item which he has just put down and you run it back to the time it was released and before it was overrun and you may not get an f n on that one you now give the next item the pc gives you the next item and theres read on that so you neglect it the pc gives you the next item you get long fall good you take that subject you run it back you rehab it good now you got the next subject hes talking about all kinds of things you know bookkeepings been overrun well you run it back to when it was released youll get some charge off of each one of these things as you try to rehab it and you get him down the line here another item another item six eight items later that have read each one of them rehabbed to time when they went release the tone arm has gradually come down and in most of cases where this is happening and there isnt also something else wildly wrong it then f ns and the tone arm has been cured dont be surprised if it tends to go up because probably lot of his grades are overrun because they sat on runs or lot of his grades never went release because he was so overrun when he got into scientology and so forth that auditors just sort of despaired of actually getting an f n and theyd give him f ns of 39 or something and the truth of the matter is the guys grades are out and they never did go release but youve cured the earlier overruns you can bring him up to point now where he can do something about it now youd have to decide whether or not it was audited over out ruds or if it was because of basic track overrun that he never went release on his grades which which was the reason which was the reason well funny phenomena will occur you can put in the ruds an upper ot guy or something like this you can put in the ruds before the point put in the ruds before auditing put in his arc breaks ptps on the whole track and get him up to point now check again the release points they dont occur good hes not flat on arc straightwire engrams secondaries the lot all the way up the line he isnt flat on single god damn thing every one of them has to be run you say magnificent how the hell did he get this far well i dont know how far could bunch of auditors that didnt know what they were doing push guy how many false attests can you get an infinity of course but youll see this case and they will say everything has been done particularly if youre new on post somebody wants to shake you down put you in place see well heres this case heres this case zilch hahool everythings been donel hat everythings been done the lot the whole yeah everything what has been overrun valence shifters confront weve rehabbed all grades rehabbed drugs rehabbed educa tion hes had forty five remedy bs one hundred and seventy two s and ds weve done everything we can do hes weve rehabbed all the f ns that ever occur red on green forms and sec checks weve done all of this and there he isl hat and you say oh my gods you start looking through the auditing reports on the case which you have to study very carefully case supervisor always does he looks through these things and he looks through these things and they all seem to be ok it all seems to be done alright wow theres your whole tool bag heen emptied out on the ground every one of thems been used hm i would do something like this on resistive case has anything been suppressed prep check the following you dont care you can always prep check things prep check assessment lists prep check s and ds you dont care what youre gonna suppress you know prep check some things you cant even assess this list anymore theres eighteen assessments of resistive cases in it see and all of sudden something blows down now you can follow what blew down back as the false report chain got it you can take and prep check everything on the resistive cases list including resistive cases lists something is gonna bd somethings suppressed theres something still out handle it now something else comes into view and you find out that youve been handed bundle of lies everything hasnt been done id just comp are it the same thing the guy the unresolvable case the completely and utterly unresolvable case who yet r sed and then blew down on missed withholds and connected to suppressive groups i mean what more do you want i mean how the hell you say can an auditor sit there and actually look at meter do this and notice it because he wrote it in his auditing report and never asked the guy single question what was the missed withhold well it compares to power which i inspected in one of your folders oh my god aaah 5a and it says almost direct auote places place pc says place is not the answ er pc sitting quietly thinking blow down f n and then he took him to 1d drums fingers on table blew down on what the pc was listing without talking in other words the auditing was so god damn bad that the pc has ceased to talk to the auditor he was listing to himself well thats because the item just above it hadnt been given to the pc they were just listed to f n dadadadamm you get it neve r found the item never gave it to the pc or its wrong item the list needs to be checked but theres evidence the pc listing to himself he wasn t giving any items but he had blow down and smiled quietly i dont think he smiled quietly i think he smiled god damned sarcastically what was the item the pc thought of that caused the blow down obviously the auditor should give it to him left the pc with withhold of one item not only did he not give the pc his items on this but he left the pc with withhold of one of the items which is on 1c this is clown stuff but you look back over lineup like this you can find errors unfortunately this persons already been through the cc so that is not corrective list powers not corrective you can get into trouble because you you you can correct it if the person never went clear but you can get into trouble bow do you get into trouble well when you try to straighten it out you inadvertently start running it you find out the list the power list or comm ands or something werent complete and you find that as the wrongness now youre gonna have to run power and you run power after clear you wrap the pc around telegraph pole one auditor in one thousand pcs would be able to do it and get away with it and thinking hed gotten away with something hed find out the pc never went clear in the first place but then your side data comes in oh well i i ran pc on power one time after he was clear and nothing happened i dont see why theres any proviso on that were only dealing with all data see of course you could probably rehabilitate rehab power on this pc or that pc maybe even when they were clear without any great conse quence or even with bit of win see but its not one of these data you could do it with every pc so every time you did it youd take one hell of chance and then the pc that it couldnt be done on boys now you gonna untangle that see because you can only untangle it by rehabbing it which and power is an area where you can get into fire fight on your correction on person after hes been cleared because you of course are never dealing with his power youll find some body thetan on whom of course you could run power so youre busy involved in running body thetan power power on body thetan and then the individual himself of course miso wns this and thinks power isnt flat it gets into mess with great rapidity so were talking in standard tech on the data you can do on every pc every time but again it follows the laws of processes on case supervision there are only so many things that you can do but you can only do them once now when theyve all been done you have to ask the question of were they done so this gets to be very fascin ating because of course they havent all been done now youre only thing you have to solve is which one is false resort not to overweigh the or overrun the the object of the lesson but this is what it takes now youre probably struggling along with an infinity of data and you think that there is an infinity of data and itd only be an infinity of data if you had an infinity of fixed ideas the data are very few the overall technical data are probably under i dont know what they are just at guess two three four five hundred at the absolute outside im talking about data in the body of data theres things like the axioms and things like this you include these things in as far as processes are concer ned why there probably arent fifty and in the numbers of ways to do them theres only one so what are you talking about infinity of data see theres infinity of data theres an infinity of goofiness in life that can go to infinity with the greatest of ease so whenever you see whenever you see somebody squirrelling you know hes already goofed and that is the law concerning it squirrel has already goofed now he cant goof so seriously that he cant ungoof his goof thats not possib unless he takes brick and hits the pc over the head and exteriorizes him forcibly and buries the body someplace and then cant find the pc but if you cant get your goof would mostly consist of being unable to get the pc to come back into session sometimes he has to be sort of dragged back but goof always precedes the squirrelling and that goes clear back to 1950 if somebody in 1950 had taken book one and theyd run engrams the way book one said just that and theyd done that why they would have found high percentage of resolution of cases just like that and they got high percentage of resolution of cases but engram running started to go out sideways and it went out sideways over great many years until short time ago it was reported that engram auditing by chains was very old hat and even looked on like squirrelling brother i sure dont know how youd ever resolve hung up 3 if you couldnt run engrams by chains couldnt its the only road left open see what i mean somebody can come along and take one of the basic central data he can take basic central datum and he can say oh its gone now i know we really dont do that anymore i just came from the flag ship and so forth and they they dont do that anymore move it off the line now standard tech doesnt work anymore and that is normally what happens they either take datum or body of data off the line by invalidation or they put some new data on the line by evaluation and that way the subject goes crooked and its longer straight subject so it doesnt work so people have to invent all kinds of damn things to make it work so you see then why i work hard to hold the line its very easily made unworkable all you have to do is throw away the text book now there are certain beliefs that certain subjects f one kind or another have certain degrees of workability thats perfectly true natureopathy chiropractic to name few antique things phrenology where they told fortunes by the bumps on the skull which i think is they chan ged its name after while to psychology they tell fortunes by the bumps on the brain there isnt actually any difference in these data even psychology preempted the word of soul study of thats what the word means when they start teaching psych ology they started teach ing it by saying they didnt know what it meant thats great place to start student isnt it psychology well we do not know what the word means because psyche means soul and we dont have anything to do with soul you think im kidding but that is how the last psychology text book read that came off the press just ahead of volume one 1950 i was down at the american book company and i saw this blue covered books were comi ng off the endless belt of the binder and they were coming off pocketa pocketa and we were waiting because there was big ceremony involved in it for dianetics the modern science of mental health to come up the first copy through the binder and it was following this blue book so i turned around to to the head of american book and i said what book is that and he picked up copy of it out of the bin it was the university of illinois i think it was psych ology text book it was their basic college textbook and i said i must have this one and took it off the lines right ahead of dianetics the modern science of mental health and i said we will preserve this one in concrete so that the psych ologist cann ot in the future lie about how much he knew about dianetics and that is the way the book starts we dont know what psych ology means it says along about line four or five or ten or something somew here in the volume intelligence cannot change it is that way when the person is born it is the same when he dies you look at this damn thing you never saw such parade of lies in your life so i said well keep this one ive still got it in my library it shows the state of the mind just before ads 0 state of the mind what did they know about it pffft now the great disco veries that are made in universities professor humphgaw the great professor humphgaw has just understood that life has something to do with affinity give nobel prize the lion see see they read our textbook you see and they sometimes you can get textbook on philosophy or religion or something in the library and you can look through it page after page and youll find somebody has marked lines and they have looked through this book only to find things which agreed with their own fixed ideas and this book you go through lot of library shelves on these subjects and youll for sure find one and its marked you know some obvious thing you know men are males you know and youll see over here in the margin so true laughter so you could expect for number of years yet to com i suppose the great disco veries are brought about through somebody reads handbook for preclears or something of this sort and he reads some line in there all of sudden he realizes that that is the subject for complete research foundation and goes ahead and investigates us its pretty weird but theyd be much better off if they found out the line following it too that also was important so that you actually can get subtractions from subject you can get little isolated bits brought out of the subject you can take bits out of context and then build these things up so that somebodys rather pauperized understanding can reach into some situation and get men are males and then build the whole thing up around men are males and theres whole bunch of technology like this but it doesnt work theres workability because very few people have that fixed idea most people know it already so the whole subject is any subject which youre trying to hold the lines of is then wide open to variation if the person one doesnt have variability factor being entered in by some stable fixed idea that somebody has and the net result of it is workability now people who have had the subject work well on their cases and theyve seen pocketa ding thud crash and it worked just like that they dont have any question about this as the right way to do it because it has worked but then people who have been audited without those data and without those laws or rules being applied list over listed under listed items not given to em power run upside down forgot to run grades 2 and grades 3 and before they ran grade 4 this sort of thing they get into feeling of wobble wobble they havent experienced standard tech so they consi der that it is nonstandard and its always more difficult to teach somebody who has been subjected to non standard tech than somebody who has received good straight forward standard tech up the lines but if you really want to teach somebody the subject and make him missi onary on the whole idea is after he has been mucked up from to izzard put him back together again with standard tech zoom thud hes been worrying about his case for the last three years you put him back together again with just straight standard tech and you put him back together again so fast he hardly knew what happened it went pffft pffft pffft neve r knew wow he isnt necessar ily overwhelmed but he now has the idea that is can be done wrong too and i think in any group taking class viii course there will be certain number who have some idea and subjective reality that it can be done wrong there will also be some some smal l number of characters who have done it wrong and have received it wrong and dont quite know what theyre studying and so dont suite know what to hold on to because it havent seen the workability subjectively objectively see theyve gotten into some back eddy of sauirrelishness on the thing somehow or another and just left their case parked in right field and their understanding parked some place back of home base and theyre not quite sure what theyre looking at and they get confused now in this state groping for some orientation groping for something why theyll hold onto some data like fury which may be very minor datum you know like arc contains r they really know it contains r they got subjective reality on that you have to spread them out from that theyre fixed on that because lot of confusion is oriented by that and when you say theres more to it theres also and theres also c why youre spreading em out to point where the confusion starts to hit them little bit and so they go back to the thing well i really am certain that r is r you see how it happens so anyway holding the line holding the line trying to get it to go straight down right down the groove and so on is subjecta ble to many cross currents so that the subject with certain things subtracted from it ceases to work on certain people who then start looking for some other way to do it who then come in with some god damn fool opinion who didnt know in the first place and blow and the whole subject goes up in smok deteriorates which is unfortunate men who know the laws of listing dont follow them then they get some loses on cases now the cases theyve audited dont think they think the laws of listing have been applied so they think the laws of listing are wrong so they invent some new idea of listing which is that all over listed lists must be over listed and that is what an auditor is up against now the auditor himself is subjecte d to certain amount of invalidation because he does what he thinks is neces sary and what he is sure is the right thing to do and he finds out it doesnt straighten out the pc this particular instant didnt straighten out the pc so this makes him feel like hes had little bit of lose he sees the examiner reports the guy left the session apparently ok appeared at the examiner and there was something out well how did that happen so he feels bit invalidated he feels he should do something else beyond the c s heyond the case supervision he should do something else so the case supervisor sees this and then he is subjecte d to certain amount of invalidation from the auditor the auditor you know didnt do so well that time when he appeared at the examiner he wasn t alright somethings wrong well the one thing you can find to agree on in all this and this is the stable datum the one thing you can find to agree on all this is that something is departure from standard tech that gives you an orientation zone from which to orient your disagreements the auditor probably busy blaming thecase supervisor the case supervisor busy blaming the auditor and the pc sitting back there with completely suppressed read on ptp its completely suppressed because present time problem doesnt communicate to him every time you ask for present time problem why he knows what problems are theyre solution to things and he hasnt got any solutions all hes got is worry the communication to the pc is out and it hasnt emerged or hes got an arc break of long duration hes there not on his own determinism forced to be there and he suffers through it all the idea of arc break is completely foreign to him because the word doesnt communicate or because hes been asked for arc breaks and then had them invalidated you can get an infinity of wrongnesses that happened with the guy but the resolution of the case will be arc breaks are out ptp is out or missed withholds are out or hes committing continuous present time overts some grade is out that was supposed to have been run but wasnt the list that was supposed to have been done was to wrong item its falsely listed or the general approach on trs completely out of the case supervisors sight and completely out of the auditors sight early on why it was just const ant invalidation the auditing sessions he had several auditing session in which each one of them was just constant invalidation well thats not right actually what you mean is so and so see something weird has gone on nevertheless you can untangle it all its where youve had departures from these exact actions and some of those departures are important and some of them are unimportant now ill give you an example of what is unimportant i see in case summ aries which auditors do theyre prone to list the administrative errors of the auditor they go through the folder and they list the administrative errors they raise hell the auditor didnt totally date the session he didnt give the year he just gave the month and day and he writes the ta down in the wrong column and you cant tell the difference in that and he doesnt give all of what the pc said and he gave reason why he ended off the session or something these are administrative administrative administrative and an auditor doing case summary case summary case supervisors error summary of course is thing it is going through every session you can get your hands on and finding every auditing blunder in that session and maki ng list of these well making this list well youll find out an auditor whos green at this or case supervisor whos very green at this he will go into this on the basis of the administrative flubs do you see you know he didnt date it and he didnt write down there is summ ary report abso lutely reprehensible there is summary report for this session and so forth and he just goes on and on and on page after page after page its the wildest listing you ever saw because not one of them would affect pc at alit the viewpoint from which case error summary lists are done is the viewpoint of what has an auditor done that would have messed up pc now it could also be done from what would mess up case supervisor so youre interested basicall in what would have messed up the pc secondarily in what would mess up the case supervisor in trying to case supervise it thats why admin is tough and straight just so the people can tell whats happening that is basicall what you want out of an error summary report what you want is what has been done that would have affected the pc adversely what departures from standard tech do you find we find ptp has always been handled by invent another problem aaaa hhh therefore we know theres going to be charge on the subject of ptps so were going to have to get ptp corrected we can prep check it you always got prep checks theyre you can prep check anything overrun chec k for overrun on ptp check for this check for that see overrun prep check do something about it but youve got it there look at this god damn it for one and one half years this case they attempted to solve this case in review somewhere and they consis tently ran invent another problem invent another problem invent another problem and the case has just been getting worse and worse what really hasn t changed his main basic characteristics see youve got your error summary that would have affected the case that was important and the session which goes wiggle biggie zibble zig zig wwww w voom you cant understand it so the case supervisors been done in so you say out admin shoot the auditor thats what your folder error summ ary should consist of what affects the case and what would affect its case supervision thats all thats important there isnt anything else thats important so it says ptp f n doesnt say the pc said anything it just blew this and that it happened two years ago the auditors already been hanged it isnt gonna affect the case one way or the other see so why remark it say the hell with it that way you get the important things the very very important things mislis ted list lists fifty s and ds done in the same week see thats the stuff thats the stuff now you know you know what to order too many s and ds fly the needle on s and ds overrun of find you cant do that do an l1 thatll be your case supervision on s and ds do an l1 fly the needle on s and d rehab if this is impossible l1 with the opening line is on s and ds do something in this character which is very standard standard list you do it to this subject but on folder summary in looking back over it youll find these damned s and ds s and ds s and ds s and ds christ how many suppressiv are there on the planet see theyre over listed under listed wrongly executed you know wow that must be an awful zone now but if we find out we cant do anything about it we better stop restimulating it and you get the other part of the coin you couldnt get anything done about it so dont do anything about it dont get into one of these perpetuals gonna take year and half to rehab this case see because the case is gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse over repair do you have better grip on this yes if you think theres an infinity of data then you must have confronted an infinity of wrongnesses and having confronted it let it blow and hold on to the main line thank you very much the laws of listing and nulling lecture given on 2 october 1968 well this is lecture number what nine lecture number 9 and this is 2 october 1968 d 16 were concer ned this evening with some very precise actions and so we will get straight along with it the laws of listing and nulling are common and ordinary garden variety subject of attack there are more cooks have more cockey ed variations and more advice on this subject than any other single thing because of course it is the one subject that can ruin pc bongo now the laws of listing and nulling are not something that you wonder about you know them you know them or you dont know them and you know them now and you can do them now i call to your attention that reading to you the laws of listing and nulling is something like reading to you the directions on how to play piano do i mak my point you can all know where middle c is now auditing is relatively simple piano but nevertheless it is something to be played it is not something to know about the maker of the piano never crosses the mind of concer t pianist where middle c is is not something he looks down the keyboard he isnt wondering what those black things are now somebody can play piano with one fingertatatatitatota and somebody can play chopin and the difference between these two fellows is is one knows his business and the other maybe in his elementary school read paper that said piano is an instrument which has black and white keys you get the difference now it isnt that people cant read directions and then apply them its that they mises timate the amount of expertise required to actually apply them so we get some student some place and he reads bulletin and he knows all of these things it is just exactly as he said where is the loud pedal the loud pedal is on the right whe re is the soft pedal the soft pedal is on the left in the middle of playing the overture of 1812 he thinks now i want to make it go loud the loud pedal is on the rightleft which was it its on the maybe its the lever over to the side oh i havent put the top up so then he has stageassist ant who comes in and when he wants it to go loud he has him put the top up and when he wants it soft he puts the top down you get the general idea in playing the piano you want it to go loud you stamp on the loud pedal without wondering where the loud pedal is so it is one thing to know it in theory and it is another thing to apply it but there is pecu liarity in something on somebody who can know it in theory and then cant apply it this isnt strange being it is simply lazy being who has never mocked it up in his skull as to what was where you understand so he knows the words the laws of listing and nillingnot nulling nilling what he doesnt know about that one line is that these are all the laws there are there arent any others there arent bunch of hidden data that havent been included in this bulletin these are it this is all there is so there is something to know about the title so he isnt reading at all wondering what laws of listing and nulling have been left out he knows thats all there is now the rest of it is drill drill you are making list of who have you shot of course that would be very long list and wouldnt go to one item but laughing who do you feel most bad about shooting would go to one item and oddly enough the unmocka nd stopand withdrawlist do go to one item there are certain things that are lists that go to one item and those are the standard listing questions now you start wandering off you can list anything but you start wandering off the standard listing questions that are the standard line questions and you are liable to have question which doesnt just go to one item now there is such such thing that it is processin g question and actually the only reason you are lining it down is so you can clean it up you get the idea now it looks like list but its not list because its not standard question you got the idea ill give you an idea of what this is you can say what is wrong with my case actually you could list this what is wrong with my case that is it looks like list it looks like listing question and you think you could list it down to one reading item brother ive got news for you it isnt proper listing question the laws of listing and nutting apply to proper listing questions if you were to say what is wrong with my case and then make list and you said bongobingo and togobak and ragbags are unflat and auditors missed on the floggodick it could go something like this bongobingo long fall ragbags unflat small fall ah ah ruggerbo long fall bd and you all of sudden say well what is wrong with my case is ruggerbo bd well maybe maybe not but all of sudden it wouldnt work out why wouldnt it work out well its not proper listing question in the first place and you have already bypassed the bypasted charge you have restimulated on the first two or three that read so this is list quote unquote it is simp ly an auditing question is all it is its an auditing question which is written down so you can ask any auditing question you can get certain number of answ ers factually if you ask an auditing question and then you make writedown of the answe rs and then you took up everyone of the answ ers as you wrote it down you get one of these what is wrong with my case what is wrong with my case you see tingerwaps fall okay tingerwaps lets see when did i run into tingerwaps see oh yeah that was bluggulogs good ah and then you get down to ragbags wow see oh yeah wow uhum 1960 woff woff waggle waggle waffle waffle waffle and yeah what the hell do you know about that theres whole chain of these ragbags now the earliest ragbag was in oh lets see 2000 numbers tough here lets get date order of magnitude tens of years hundreds of years thousands of years tens of thousands of years hundreds of thousands of years millions of years tens of millions of years hundreds of millions of years billions of years tens of billions of years hundreds of billions of years trillions of years fall more than 5 trillionfall more than ten trillionno read less than ten trillionfall ah 5 trillion 6 trillion 7 trillion 7 trillion 7 trillion long fall all right were in the order of magnitude of 7 trillion 954 million 762 thousand 727 good and 2 monthsbd well so that was the first ragbag now lets see what the hell was that all about and so forth what the hell mate peter had an arc break in it they sent the laundry ashore and didnt get it back yeah we landed in this space right here and i lost all of my clothes and the uniform was so bad you know after that they couldnt believe i was the first mate oh yeahi got that em poh what the hell do you know ragbags clean laugh good now wait minutef n thats an auditing process by which you take up everything in the book its you wrote the thing down with question mark but then it was sort of process and then you got some items which followed the process do you follow and then you handled each item and so on now you dont do that process that way for some peculiar reasonnot because i said soyou see its an illegal listing question its its not listing question its its its process an offbeat processnot because i said so but because it just works this way now we get question who or what is trying to unmock you laugh ba ba baba baba ba ba ba balong fall bd poom okay ba bow bowba bow bowba bow bowba bow bowba bow bowba bow bow long fall bdlong fall bdb d very good your item is ba bow bow and that is because it is question which makes real list and it goes to one item but there are tons of questions which dont go to one item and you can dream up all kinds of them and i see them in all folders from way back when ah where are the roofs you see or something ill give you one that sounds exactly like it would be listing question this will guarantee to wrap some pc around the telegraph pole what environment was dangerous so help pete it doesnt go to one item now youve got to worry that it is an offbeat question and it didnt list to one item and you can t get it down to one item and the pc starts wrapping around the telegraph pole thats because its actually just process its sort of an outofarc process so it is extremely limited what environment was dangerous and every read you got on the list you should have taken up laugh if you everif you ever ran it as process see so there is way of running process to write it down now theoretically theoretically because you often see an f n occur and big bdon any of the process questions theoretically they should be list right well im clearing this up with you because somebody is sooner or later going to come along and hes going to say wait minuteall processes are really lists the fellow who is answe ring question on level 0 is really making list so therefore the right way to run level 0 is to go down the line to level 0 and find the reading item an give it to the pc now he finds the one pc in thousand on whom this actually worked and he has had it you understand it is process it is not listing question and the funny part of it is the processes t hat come up the line dont work nowa rcquestionthe level 3 question the big change you know the big change its just borderline to being an item its oneitemlist funny thing about it is because the unlimited nature of arc you can actually occasionally run it again youd better not but you can actually occasionally run it again not the arcprocess with all the change but you can find an earlier big chan ge on the whole track so you can run it sort of this lifetime and you can sort of run it on the whole track this is not advised im just telling you the behavior of things see but you find the real chan ge that is listed on on the list the pc makes and you run the process just exactly the way it says in r3hanybody is liable to call anything r3h these days it was an exact process i had somebody not too long ago actually rewrite an hcob and send it to on r3h boy i said now i have seen it all and i find out that he was advising people to bypass f ns doing this oh my god the arcbreak registrars proper action is green form thats all an arcbreak registrar should ever do green form he should do green formitsa similaritsa earlierits all he ever ought to do it doesnt mess up anything you can run almost an unlimited number of them because it is sort of pt proposition because youre just handling it with itsa and earlier similar itsa and you clean up more cases than you can shake stick at the arcbreak registrar however thinks he can only run arcbreaks well he misses the guy with the ptps he misses the guy with the mwh and why do most people blow orgs because they had missed withholds so thats idiocy ive never gotten hold of the arcbreak registrars and told them this up to this time directly to their faces so i am trusting you to do so green form green form neve r do anything but green form and because you probably cant trust their listing and so forth say dont list anything list listjust green form yeah he says what if he strikes hes connected to suppressiv group gooditsa similar incident earlier itsa laugh oddly enough youll find out it works dont you see it worked like bomb now if his trs are fairly smooth he wont kick in bpc you actually can kick in bypassed charge of the pc if the if if the trs are out fumble bumble stumble bum ah flumble flumblelets see the laws of listing and nulling i know i know i know this dont tell dont dont tell pc ah dont tell ah i should lets see ive got three listing dont tell pc three reading items on the list and so on i should that means its the first item that isnt right ah its dead horse laughter youre liable to kick in some other time when the pc has been stalled on the track i n some fashion or another which he is in most accidents and things you know waiting for the doctor or something of the sort and here comes in some bpc and this hidden factor flies in sideways because of the slowness and allthumbsness of the auditor see do you get it it doesnt show up in the auditing report alwa ys very mysterious this fellow for some reason or other he the thing didnt clear up now you know it didnt clear up because the session went on and on and its four hour and 95 minutes session see laugh and all he had to straighten out was did he have ptp not even of long duration see its what you really wanted him to do so you said check arcbreaks and see if this pc has ptp of long duration youve noticed youve noticed that every time every time he comes into session he tells the examiner the same thing its all through the folder which of course if you know your business the unch anging case has ptp of long duration the cases which dont chan ge have ptp of long duration i mean the one side of the coin is the other side of the coin you understand well heres heres heres mr blitz in here again with his lumbosis he says it hasnt been helped now you can say oh lets see whats the matter is he an arcbreak or is it woff woff is it some peculiar kind of case maybe he was an eskimo in former life and these engrams got frozen laughter the datum which springs to view at this particular moment is he still got his lumbosis it is still worrying him and hes got ts of long duration and the other datum you know it isnt the lumbosis for the excellent reason that he knows that and it hasnt resolved so he hasnt asised it there could be another reason he hasn t asise d it he is out of valence and cant asis anything but then he would have to be out of valence with the present time problem but it isnt really present time problem its problem that has been every present time for the last few thousand years laughter so the problem of long duration thats what is wrong with this guy and he is always audited over top of ituncha nging case its actually ptp every time hes audited he has ptp ah you can actually fix up case so its unch anging by some auditor finding ptp that didnt exist existing with the fellow has ptp because it always reads on ptp and the fellow goes around wondering what his ptp is and his his problem is whether or not he has problem you see thats false read that can be introduced on the case so you always say chec k for false reads check for suppressed reads now getting down to cases here then there is thing which is called list and that proceeds from thing which is called standard listing question and there are very few of these theres the remedy the remedy b the three suppressiv question ones and there is another one what are you trying to prevent now there are several more that do end up in one item and the arc level 3 grade ends up in one time not just one arc break but it ends up for sure in one time do you understand now you can fool with this arc break all you want to and run it all over the track but the fact of it is youre looking for the major chan ge in the persons lifeyou ask for the major change in the persons life dont you see whatever the question says what you want as an auditor you want that one change now you list for that you find that thing accurately you find the arc break in it and the guy goes release poom very magical very magical now service facsimile every now and then you come across the line and you cant rehab the service facsimile youd never relist the service facsimile or the excellent reason that the pc cant remember it dont be an idiot youve cared for this already laughter its erased why are you bugging him about it but the funny part of it is is you actual could list for another service facsimilenot that he has another service facsimile but you can always get one out of body thetan so actually if the fellow had 500 body thetans youd get 500 service facsimiles laughter you could probably do it 500 times before the pc kicked the bucket laughter most body thetans are above service fac below service facsimiles so you the majority of them are so you would have ball trying to get it but the point i am maki ng is is youve listed for this service facsim ile that is the principal one and so on and you let it go at that well now if you can t rehab it somebody didnt get the right one once in while you are out of luck you cant get the original list now what do you do they didnt get the guys service facsimile and so forth well you could do this is very stunty stuff and isnt advised at all but its perfectly validto ask the guy what is his service facsim ile what the one found was and youll find out he usually remembers it now you ask him what the one found was that you dont have the original list you can list in this pecu liar fashion once in blue moon and get away with it what what were the items on the list you made laughter but in order to do that youd have to get in suppress on the list because his right item was missed what did you tell the auditor you thought it was on whatever the question is with the service facsimilehas anything been suppressed has anything been challenged you know invalidatedwe dont care what as long as you clean up that question i dont know what service facsimile i remember i got awfully nervous at that particular time i im not sure about that i did yeah well we they found it alright the service facsim ile i think was to jump off talli dont know if it was tall blondes or tall buildings laughter it was something like that didnt sound like it he isnt sure but already it wont rehab and you saydid ah you know to find your service facsim ile and so forth and etc ah you know to go release at that point normal pattern nothing happens on that time was anything suppressed anything invalidated invalidation reads ah oh it did yeah his service facsimile hasnt been found it wont rehab so now you can beco the hassles do you recall what somebody said it was yeah ah so and so so and so unclear mumbling you sayw ell all right you could prepcheck the question and ask him if he remembers any of the items he thought it was at the time the oddity is you may be able to get it its very risky handling list where you haven t got the list that was listed better approach entirely is to say mr jinx we have arrived at that point where youre going to be laid off auditing until we can recover your earlier folder which as i understand is in australia we will tell you when we get it and then make somebody in australia send him the earlier auditing folder or make joe blitz who is in alaska mail in that damned service facsimile you dont neces sarily want the whole folder but you for sure want that list it might have been some other squirrely things if you think it was very squirrely why you want it all sent in and you want it now in view of the fact that you are normally operating in an organization those that im talking to at the moment are certainly working at an organization you have communication lines where this can occur its the safer thing to try to obtain the list get the actual list and null it now what s suppressed on ba bow bow has anything been suppressed on ba ba bow bow has anything been suppressed that reads on ba ba bow has anything been suppressed that one reads you know on catawumbs has anything been suppressed see pow on doggerbo has anything been suppressed read on rupptittle has any thing been suppressed long fall on the listing question has anything been suppressed long fall what was it oh yeah well the guy didnt run any list on it unclear speech as matter of fact at that particular time and so forth ah waggle waggle waggle waggle okay now youve unsuppressed these items call them again bluey and blah there are two reading items on the list ah but everything on the list isnt live so therefore you havent bypassed the item now you get down here and you put bar over to the left side of the list and you say list extended date and you put the additional items on the list and one of them blows down you renull the list to make sure the whole list to make sure you havent got anything reading and that is it sometimes pc even gets restive and unhappy because you list the whole list ah there is degree at which he is saying wow wee that is it wow wee when you dont null but youre taking chance youre taking chance you actually are so youve got the fellows service facsimile from the original list that is the correct action now once in blue moon you have to do this other action which im talking to you about you get everything unsuppressed now you could even ask was there anything you hadnt told this auditor you see the missed withhold ah at that time were you arc broken about anything and so on you can pick it up see pick it up pick it up and any every one few of these you find out it suddenly rehabs it was the right service facsim ile and it did rehab but it was listed over out ruds and the f n decla red on it war false report but it was the correct service facsimile do you get the comp lications that can occur here very complicatedit all comes from this now on one of the questions i just asked on an examination i better repeat this the way standard tech ceases to be standard tech is somebody has already done something nonstandard the way to get standard tech back inhes missed some piece of standard tech the way to get it in is you find out what piece of standard tech was missed and you remedy this you got it and the case w ill then fly because there are only so many pieces to standard tech see wild things could have occurred he could have been listed standing on his head any damned thing could have occurr ed there thousands of outnesses that could have occur red in the session this is the one thing ive got to push home to you there are thousands and millionsan infinity of possible errors in session do you follow the only error you are interested in are those errors which violate standard tech you got it youve got to get this point or you wont actually be able to repair anybody you look for the points of standard tech that have been violatedthe session run over pts the session run with missed withhold do you get it the the bird that walked in to the org and they started to do engrams on him and he couldnt run anything and uncle ar speech and so on his ta was up and so on and they went ahead and ran grades and all this sort of thing with the guy flubbed up madly way back down the track on points of release there werent any points of release ever rehabed on this case they were running arc s w without rehab the guy came in ran arc s w you see and got some results for gods sake the ta never really came down but he got results and he had cognition and he and so forth and that was pretty good and actually they marked it that they had an f n but for some reason the next time he came into session the ta was at 6 or something and then theyre going to run seco ndaries and in some peculiar way seco ndaries are run and this case is just doing weird one well actually he walked in with high ta what the hell is somebody off the street doing with high ta well obviously hes been overrun laugh i know but he never had any auditing he never even read book but hes been overrun what overran him well i want to call to your attention that there it lot of livingness going on and also here and there on the whole track here and there on the whole track they knew something dim about running engrams they didnt know it well and they didnt know enough not to overrun it every point of these you find overruns associ ated with them there are various methods of getting rid of engrams in space opera societ they had sort of chapstick that came together with an awful crash while showing the guy photograph of the area he was injured in and this was signal to the thetan that he was supposed to chop it up and wad it up into ball and throw it away if you worked this area over and run that off you find the original incident sitting there thats quite fascin ating but there was some effort from time to time to handle thetans pictured here and there on the track its been known that thetan had pictures they didnt have any other technology to back it up but they had that and where these were run you get an overrun so this can happen the pc comes in and arc s w is great seco ndaries seem to be alright and then engrams the ta went whistles is it getting more solid are we on the wrong chain what the hell is this its an overrun on engrams you wont find it an overrun on any other part of scientology but youll find occasionally an overrun on engrams but most frequently its an overrun on drugs and i would adventure to say that you occasionally have an overrun on life just the subject of living and you occasionally have the subjects of an overrun of dying hes died too many times laughter well his death is release what the hell but youd have to figure out what it is what is it what is it thats been overrun well it could be lot of things been overrun so youd better find out whats been overrun now what has been overrun or what has been going on too long or what have you done too often any version of the question that would communicate is handled and it is not listit is process but you get read on this item and then you do standard rehab and then you askit didnt f nso you ask for another one and you ask for the release on that and its little bit better and the ta comes down and then you ask for the next question and it didnt read and then you ask for the next question and it read so you rehab that and you keep this process up and if you do it well you all of sudden will have this sitting there looking at an f n go ahead dead simple now the fellow lives 50 or 100 years later and hes got high ta see you could ask him again what has been overrun if the question reads there will be one two three items that have been overrun and you rehab each one and youve got it made in other words all that is is method of finding areas to rehab and its process not list get the difference alright now in sequence there are two key processes 1 valence shifter the valence shifter what valence or identity would be safe all right list to one item bong because you want to list it down to the bottom of the pile and bongo which is followed by question what can you confront which is process now you can actually write down these what canyou confronts and sooner or later the guys going to bd on something and sooner or later some wiseac re is going to tell us that all processes should be listed now hear hear good and clean hear very straight if you list question which is not one item question and bypass the reads on the items without handling them you pack the case up youll pack the case up as ne at as nything you ever packed up so if you ever see n an auditing report form if you ever see on worksheet what has been overrun with item item blank blank item you know reading itemreading item reading bd and you just see it there and you look back on the worksheet and you find none of them have been handled the weird part of it is the case will have tendency then to be packed up it is not something you do and correct because youre trying to be pedantic trying to be the villain of the piece who says all the commas must be in the right place youll find that the case is now packed up so somebody has got to go back over it again thats why you must always teach your auditors always to mark the falls and bds dont let them make bunch of stuff without and you know i see most of the worksheets i see these days have falls or bds marked on them there is sf for smal l fall f for fall ah lf for long fall you cant distinguish and doing c s work is very difficult its trick to writing these things down now you would just see horror of horrors what has been overrun some type of process of that particular character which is really just process and if you were to see that listed with falls after it and the thing wasnt even nulled youre not really in trouble you would actually put in on the listing question on what has been overrun has anything been suppressed anything been invalidated put them in very lightly youre going to get lot of read out of it ah very good read the first question on this has anything been suppressed woof fall good rehab it in other words you have to unsuppress the list and get each one of them rehabbed get what the proper repair action is this is one of the vicious ones that can come your way it already happened couple of times you say use what has been overrun list what has been overrun and handle each reading item as it reads and the auditor comes along and he runs little list it is list being well trained its list and he doesnt even mark the reads and hes listed it he didnt do anything with it now what im warning you of is liable to have packed up the case at that exact instant youre going to have trouble with the case now wasnt rehabbed because every single one of those is restimulated bypassed charge it was listed wasn t handled now on sooner or later some auditor is going to make this list hes going to find an item it is going to blow down it is going to go f n and hes got it made and from that hes going to move over into the thing that every process should be listed so i make it loud and clear to you that there are two types of questions one is simp ly process and you write down the answe rs and it does look like list but its not list under the heading of listing and nulling its not legitimate question and under that heading can come any question that reads an absolute infinity of questions you can actually as c s dream them up if they read great but thats how youd have to do it each one of them has to be handled because they are not legitimate questions not legitimate lists an infinity of it now you sometimes do this very lightly to find information from the case lets give you an example where where you are trying actually you are actually trying to find out why this fellow has an invisible field he somehow or another by some mystery has wound up at about 5 or 6 ot and hes got an invisible field well he cant see anything youve got blind thetan or something now you can actually undertake this as an as an action its merely an exploratory action you can ask the auditor to list what it is regarding this invisible field what is it laughter now you hold pistol at the auditors head on this you say falls small falls long falls bds for gods sake mark them down boy mark them down its an illegitimate list dont you see but its still alright its handled like what has been overrun it isnt one thing and it never will be one thing its always com posite now you get into trouble this way by thinking in this framework the magic button ive lived in the atmosphere of this god damned nonexistent magic button since 1950 there is one thing wrong with the org there is one thing wrong with the case now what would you do as to all other considerations look for this one magic thing in 1950 it was the fellow who was supposed to be shot in the gluttonous maximus by biochemical thing which made him at once clear and which we would by now be rehabbing like crazy so we could get on with it laughter i dont know if anybody here remembers those days but there was great deal of discussion in those days concer ning the fact that there ought to be some chemical which one would load up into syringe and the word one shot clear became current but it was actually sarcastic word but people listened for this button and for quite while i researched on this basis so actually ive given time to this idea and i can absolutely assure you completely and 100 that there is magic single buttonfor instance the lrh comm ww was looking through policy letters the other day he said something is wrong something is wrong and therefore it must be contained in policy well alright undoubtedly too within limit and so therefore im going to read all of these policy letters and applying it out and all of sudden he found out that it says that an organization which has undergone period of interiorization heavy traffic internal heavy traffic internal will shortly after that go into slump heavy internal traffic is followed by slump naturally its interiorized and isnt handling outside so it goes into slump you probably remember the policy letter anyway he found this policy letter and he promptly started applying it and got people to promote and just dropped the idea of internal this and that and the other thing and he said lets just have at it and lets do this exteriorization action and im sure theyll make it 4 or 5 weeks from now well have them coming up the line but he should he was looking for magic button magic single button well the reason he came down to looking for the magic single button which would resolve the case at that particular instance is because great many buttons had been very neglected for very long time now at any given what what deludes you in this is at any given instant there is magic button see at any given instant there is magic button which when handled changes to another magic button laugh you do that in putting in the rudiments when youre putting in the rudiments the single magic button on the casea rc break the single magic button now is ptp the single magic button would be missed withhold do you get the idea and actually going up the grades each grade is the next magic button they are magic buttons alright but they are not just one button there is button there will never be button i can assure you there will never be button which pressed with great expertise will suddenly blow person to ot 8 from insane asylum or wog there is such thing and the reason there isnt such thing is because awareness is gradient its what he beco mes aware of now maybe you can shorten this gradient down to an hour but it would still be not one button it would have to be whole series of buttons in this hour ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba do you get it and youd have to know what button to push at any given instant in that hour in order to clean that thing up do you see so the one button to hell with it you can say well i know the button yes yes i know of button the guy is just mocking up his bank and if you could get that and work on that he could be convinced of that why naturally then the whole bank would blow and he would be clear obvious so there is one button well in the first place right above that there are whole lot of body thetans who also have the same consi deration only unfortunately they have the consi deration they are him when they are not and unfortunately above that at 7 he will disco ver that there is another whole row of aberration as matter of fact there are about 6 of them quite in addition to pictures laugh so you see even that doesnt turn out to be one button hes clear alright great great hasnt got any pictures fine now he goes up to iii and he gets rid of all his body thetans so he hasnt got any body thetans and so on he can mock up pictures and not mock up pictures hes in beautiful condition iv is all straightened out res all rehabbed and so forth and he suddenly begins to ask the question why am i not 9 feet tall yet i was 9 feet tall on thursday and i as only 2 inches tall on friday laughter why is that well there are 6 or 7 more things that are wrong with him and theyre contained in the upper line of 7 and 8 im not trying to make mystery out of these things and say oh well you find these things when you get to 7 and 8 there are things like postulates and theres things like interpersonal relationships theres things like the interrelationship with life itself theres on 8 there is who made this damned stuff laughter who made it and also who didnt want him to laughter do you see there are things like this is somebody standing around holding it there and mocking keeping it mocked up laughter you can get lot of questions come up the resolutions of these questions and so on are all thats wrong with thetan now lets get back to where we started here do you have some idea now that the listing and nulling laws apply to legitimate listing questions now there possibly could be more legitimate listing questions than the 7 or 8 which are already there i dont say that some of these would not list to one item but if they list to one item its because youre asking for the mostest or the bestest or the biggestest do you get it who is the biggest watermelon laughter what is the biggest planet you have ever been on one item question obviously because you asked for it and that would determine it to that degree but there are little row of them which dont have the biggest and mostest they just come out to one item and unless they come out to one item cut the pc throat itd be kinder now the questions of va oddly enough are so centrally located with regard to the pcs mind and beingness what have you got youve got persons places and subjects wow and the funny part of it is that you could probably carry them on and on you could probably get some other reads you could probably do this and that and they are so centralized in the field of aberration that they actually you could count on the first bd being the item on the list so that you can cut it short but do you realize that that doesnt disobey the laws of listing and nulling on centralized question like that the first bd is it on the list take it the weird point about it is when you go back to rehab va the minute you go back to rehab va providing the auditor marked the bd which bdd you know he didnt do which bdd really but then wrote down b and put the bd after b he could make some goofy error like this but you go back and repair these va and its very very peculiar youll find out its the first blowing down item now you say well that therefore must be law of all listing it doesnt have to be list of s ds it doesnt have to apply to s ds so its still the one reading item on the list so please differentiate that in va you are just being given fast route which still follows the laws of listing it isnt specia l case it just happens that va follows the rules of listing all the rules of listing occur on the first bd bong thats all its pecu liar and youll find on some s ds that its not true so what ive given you youll see in va its this pecu liarity its the first bd now you can look on va list and you can see that he took the second bd and it inevitably will be wrong item so its not correct its the second bd you look on an s d list and youll find the third bd reading is the correct item insufficiently central to the intelligence of the being you see unclear youve listed here over on the fringes and he blew some charge here and he blew some charge there and he blew if you say persons places what the hell man youre going right up against the substance of 7 and 8 bongo bongo dead on and the person says oh yeah because hes sitting right there its just pecu liarity so that is simply given to you in an effort to let you get it done in hurry and other significance than that so dont lean on it all over the place nd run up big ridge now where an individual is rehabbed on va you always carefully do the whole job you null the whole list to see if it has to be extended in any way why the pc thought of something else when he was listing he didnt have the listing question this that there is goofy outness here see the pc was still thinking about something all of sudden something else distracted his attention and he thought oh well what the hell i mean weve got to get this session through with here ive got to meet my wife or something you know attention came off the session he got bd something goofy like this there is way you can prevent this except by being an auditor what the hell are you doing auditing so up to well what were you doing auditing pc who had to meet his wife ive never audited pc who had to go out and meet his wife at 4 oclock oh not now i want to put in reality factor here we gonna run waffle waffle waffle waffle im going to run resistive case list on you thats hell of gag boy thats real scum didnt this auditor ever hear about the fact that he had to be in arc with the pc one of the reasons the fellow runs the resistive case list he can run resistive case list on somebody who is just momentarily hung up and find out what it is he still falls in these categories the guy was sick on thursday must do an assessme nt on the thing it says he is physically ill thats it so the net result the net result when guy gets the rfactor hes liable to tell you something like ja ja ja ja ja ja you know funny attitude this guy must be in hell of rush ask the guy you were rushed on anything oh yes yes i have to meet my wife at 4 oclock good before we start this session actually i want you to get out on the telephone and call her oh im sorry you cant she driving around in the car now good alright ill tell you what at the risk of upsetting you and so forth ah were going to have this session this evening be back here this evening why why its perfectly alright with i can suppress t his while youre auditing laughter this is all part of making the pc fly you see you actually could have spen t time have you had food have you had sleep do you have to go any place and so forth except this is so god damned pianola and play it by dropping the penny in the mach ine and so forth that it is damned bore as they are currently saying and theyll be saying something else in the future sometime it is drag laughter its waste of time ah therefore therefore you immediately assum that your pc is in one of two conditions to be audited which is he set up to be audited or he aint laughter and of the he aint there are two categories the ones the auditor can repair and the ones he cant well im very sorry im in an awful rush i have an appointment with physician to have my leg sawe d off at 4 oclock laughter actually there is something an auditor can do about thatyou can say go and call him up and cancel it huh why should i do that well one of the reasons is im auditing you mixed practices laughter so therefore process can be written down and look like list and there is thing called list which you then list now as we look into this with more intimacy we find that the definition of complete list is list which hag only one reading item on the list oh yes you know all about that of course the other items that just tick they wouldnt do many exceptions to this rule ah the ah the list which we null with out rude has long falls on various items there arent any exceptions to it none none none that is list and this is brought forward for this remarkable reason that the auditors in 1962 in 63 used to come around and ask all the time how many items should be on the list how many items should be on the list should list be four items what is full list should it be two items three items four items twenty items you have to give it some sort of figure youre asking some balderdash question like how long is rope and its as long as there is comp lete item on it now i have seen some pretty damned long lists i have seen list go two or three pages before the item fell out of the hamper that sounds incredible and it is almost incredible it happens damned rarely but it does happen so you see some auditor he says well lets see ive gotten down to the bottom of the first page and somebody is liable to be very upset indeed if i go on listing page after page ive been shot for it in the past and i dont have any item yet so it must be dead horse listen did the question read the list wont deadhorse listing question which read will ever dead horse because the only reason dead horse deadhorses is the listing question did not read laughter if the question read you get an item and ive actually seen very recen tly folder in which there was reading listing question and then after listing half page the auditor decided it must be dead horse because all the items up to that point did not now read two or three of them had read so what was he doing he was auditing one of these wide things do you know that the pcs attention goes way out and comes way in and goes way out and comes way in cyclicall theres certain test research processes you can run and he starts talking about this see hell say the table the chair the clock there the bureau the glass of water the room wall that duck over there america that star the sea in the galaxy yes yes yes the galaxy the star that other star of the planet of the moon that range of hills the the tongue there the floor you can watch his answe rs they go out and they go in hes buttered around the place do you follow and if he is really dead in and he wasn t really right to recognize there was anything like this and the list is being listed just little bit soon on his case should we say ah it read its going to be long list and you read it and you null it and if the question read then one of two things is true the items are suppressed which is easy to do because you null it with suppress or the list is incomplete and i actually have four little questions that you can ask and you have them on bulletin writeup it most usua lly the first item on the list on long list thats always the figure the cand idate that has been bypassed is the first item that most frequent the second item comes in little bit behind the first item and the list is incomplete or the list is suppressed theres certain various positive things that are wrong with lists you can take these laws of listing and make list of the laws of listing for assessme nt and go down the case with each one and you would eventually find every damned reason one assumes that standard is in before he does the laws of listing so you would have to put on that something like was it listed with out ruds to make it complete assessment form i would just check on that to make an assessment form on this you would have to put was it listed over out ruds and for the uninitiated you would have to list the ruds that could have been out while the listing was going on or which were now out and then you would have total which was m ore or less kn own anyhow but these laws of listing could be added up do you see how you could do that you can take any of the materials of standard tech and list them out and ask questions of it and work them this way and work them that way because what you are doing its the difference between mechanic using screw driver and pair of pliers you know he uses screw driver and he uses pair of pliers well he sure can use them in numerous ways got the laws of listing there are probably dozen ways you could use these lists all right comp lete list theres all there is about complete list because thats what it is but remember by the word list here we mean from an authentic reading listing question two the ta rising means the list is being overlisted its too long inevitable and invariable rising ta inevitably means that something has been done too long and so on sometimes with suppressive and so on you will see ta rise youll see suppressiv eta rise and you say aha thats variation from the laws of listing because look at that its been stuck high ta and it has come down like mad when we all of sudden got this suppressive oh oh oh oh im not trying to make myself right it was simp ly an overrun he was an overrun was around far too long laughter one of the reactions of suppressin g are incomplete cycles of action and overrun on cycle of action to handle the handled is also very suppressiv you got floor all clean somebody comes along tells you to clean up the floor suppressive cleans cleans its one of the characteristic it doesnt make somebody who cleans clean suppressive but he invariably does this hes got the house is all painted its all finished just getting ready to put away the paint brushes the suppressiv comes along and says look at that youd better get to work on that hasnt been painted well enough go on and paint the house hell also com along with only one wall half painted and say you will have to rake the garden now but different suppressives they are in the overrun or in the incomplete so youve found suppressive is overrunning something also you will find that the subject of this suppression is an overrun it is not violation of this but once in while youll find an s d is the reason of high ta once in while and then you sit very mysterious but of course its quite obvious that the person needs an s d hes sick pts and so forth you just happen to give him an s d and you happen to see the ta go down you wouldnt neces sarily always order an s d because some bodys ta was high do you follow it doesnt work now ta rising while youre doing list it means its overlisted and boy you can catch that right now right now right now right now it was t he second item it starts to rise on the third item you can catch it right now just like that pow pow because you see rising ta is first signaled by needle going from right to left instead of left to right now its true that there is little bump that person can go across little bump he can go across and you said jinx and you had surge and then you said brown and it sort of rises little bit you know the needle return to position and then it says balderdash and goes bbblumsp you got it so it isnt the first tiny little bit of motion of the needle and when that thing is going up the pc starts to think there are other things that go along with it he starts to comm lag the needle starts going over to the left and youve already you have forecast of the fact that you are just about to overlist this is forecasted now if you did this if you did this if you nulled the first three items and it was starting to apparently rise on the fourth and it did the first three items and then having done the first three items it looked like it was rising you went back and nulled the first three items you got in suppress on the first item and on the second item and you still didnt have an item you go on listing do you understand and if the ta now really started up like surge you would go back and examine that first item again do you see hes done something we had an example we had person of another nationality and he was given an s d and he put the item on the list which by the way some sessions later came up but he put the item on the list and then he thought oh my god thats not social ly acceptable and he bang and boy nobody could persuade him to let that item read again in america such an item would be mother do you see you wouldnt dare put lot lot of areas wouldnt dare put the word mother on the list in italy it would be priest you know father giuseppee laughter has anything been unmocked yes who or what has tried to unmock you see youre asking anything tried to unmock you right away this is what communicates you know hes askin g himse lf has anything been unmocked anything uncocked father giuseppe aha oh laughter cant give it to him now you do give it to him he is now all in the middle of guilt hell give the manifestation of you having found the wrong item but only visually the way to really get him in trouble is to continue with little bit further and really give him wrong item you let him struggle with that one very often you give the pc wrong item he struggles with it but you can give him right item which he struggles with its whether or not it obeys the rules of listing it obeys the rules of listing thats his item father guiseppi thats it pooh oh oh oh yes yes i guess thats it laughter hell come right straight through it you see alright number three list can be underlisted in which case nothing can be found on nulling the question read the question read you listed list nothing is suppressed two or three items read as you listed itincomplete list nothing read so extend it you put little bar over here and mark extended dont ever you or let your auditors get into position or habit of extending list without marking bar over to the left of the list saying ext and if you ever extend later list later extend an early list is what i mean why say ext with the current date so somebody knows its been repaired now if after session the ta is still high or goes up wrong item has been found and that can happen between the session and the environ and the examiner he left the session having done remedy b he left the session and his ta was at 2 and he arrives at the examiner with his ta at 475 to give you an extreme example you dont have to ask any questions about it whatsoever you just say wrong item back to session or you say examine the list now remember that it was always wisest when you have direct evidence of an incorrect list to get the list corrected before you bingle bungle around with ruds because it is the out rud so this can happen couple of days later only it doesnt show up as high ta it shows up as his face went solid yeah i have some pressure on my face or something of this character unclear i was all right after the session i was sure it was and your correct action is then go back and have the list corrected its wrong item wrong item wrong item another evidence particularly on va he got in ethics trouble within very short time afterwards 48 hours something like that he finds himsel f in ethics ah the he finds himself in the hands of the medical officer now you might run into some firefight like i ran into one time whereby the galley was busy feeding badly in an unsanitary area and whole bunch of crew members came down epidemica lly at the same time i was getting some auditing accomplished with those guys and laughter and now we had to disentangle what this was all about were they being super suppressed all of sudden had mad team walked in on the scene what had happened what had happened well all that had happened was somebody had fed them rotten meat laugh but it sure made one wonder now the funny part of it is the guy who had fed them the rotten meat had had three wrong items on power just 48 hours before he knowingly fed them rotten meat laughter now you say i was looking all over the place to find the wrong itemswe ll i found the wrong items i found the guy laughter thats how far it can go now if the pc says it is wrong item it is wrong item now the trouble with that is is this father guiseppi thing that i just saidso the pc is saying ah i dont think that is my item i dont think that is my item i dont think that is my item all the rules of listing say it is his item what are you going to do interesting questionwhat are you going to do alright we leave it at that laughter im not going to solve all your problems laughter but this is true if he says it is wrong item it is wrong item in the first place he is going to go around worrying about the catholic church to such degree that hes going to spin in if you give him father giusep pi ill will solve it for you there is nothing to it actually ah you ask him just discuss this item with i m not trying to force it on you you dont have to have this item you just dont have to have this item anything been suppressed and so forth on it invalidated and so forth oh i sure invalidated it oh wow laughter now where do you put those auditing reports normally laughter hes landed up with problem hasnt he well if you force the item on him against that sort of thing and so forth as far as he is concerned its wrong item hell come around to it being right item if you just acknowledge it you say it says here that father giuseppe is your item it couldnt possib ly be all right thank you very much now do you say it is too your item laughter on six the question must be checked and must read as question before it is listed an item listed from an unreading question would give you deadhorse and thats all you always listed but let tell you something it could be false read or suppressed read now person who is being suppressed suppresses the suppressed do you see he is suppressin g suppressed because he is dramatizing being suppressed and suppressed reads when you say lightly with gay heart ah is it withdrawn from is it stop or is it uncocked most of the time youll get away with it but the reason this guy is pts he is upset he is sick h he is this he is that there is every reason in the world but boy this guy is pts and remember that the whole subject can be this wsu will normally shine outside of the question and you normally can get your read on it and it says u unmock so you say who or what and you can check it is trying to unmock you some guys who are bit blue only react to is trying to unmock you its current situation who or what has tried to unmock you if it attempted to unmock youthat sense of the question does not reach them so you have to test the question get suppress in on it and you suddenly see it reading make sure it isnt false read in other words you handle this its got to be handlable thing but if even after you handle it still doesnt read and then you knuckelheadedly go list it boy you want to have your own head examined because itll give you deadhorse every tome dead horse proceeds from nonreading question and that is the reason for dead horse and an auditor who does not check the listing question before he lists it is knuckle head now if the item is on the list and nothing read on nulling the item is suppressed or invalidated yes so true so true now one that cures that comes in number eight on suppressed list it must be nulled with suppressed on balderdash has anything been suppressed and then you dont say the item because of course the read on suppression transfers to suppress so if the item is going to read itll read on suppress anyhow and now youve clean ed up suppress so you know the thing is going to read now an invalidated item reads on invalidate suppressed item reads on suppressed and the odd part of it is that it reads the exact amount on suppress or invalidated that it reads itself on the item the reads transfers as to the exact right item its going to read on the list on ragbags has anything been suppressedboom you should try it out few times just to see what the hell happened and all of sudden youre totally relaxed you say ragbags itll read the same read exactly that you just got on suppressed exactly same length same everything its one of the miraculous little things its the wildest thing i ever saw in my life when i saw it the exact read with the same hitch the same level the same unclear its exact and you can transfer it off to suppress transfer suppress it and now suppress will read you can clean it up suppress it again read it under the suppress once more the suppress now reads you clean it up bring it back make the item read againits the wildest thing you ever saw in your life so it is one of the methods of identifying the item is it the item that was suppressed does it read like the suppressed read so then youd say on balderdash has anything been suppressed well you know its going to be it so you do it but to hell with it supposing you wanted to check this thing out you say balderdash did it read the same as suppressed one of the ways of checking it very cute its identical identical read now on an item that is suppressed or invalidated the read will transfer exactly from the item to the button and when the button is gotten in the item will again read just as i told you every once in while you see some auditor say on balderdash has anything been suppressed all right thank you very much thats your item when you are nulling you just say on balderdash has anything been suppressed read when youve got the item say the item and then the its read will come off otherwise its read will stay on it youve got to say the item again on balderdash has anything been suppressed on ragbags has anything been suppressed on bong balderdash is the only reading item on the list you say good balderdash there is your read all right you say your item is balderdash now an item from an overlisted list is often suppressed the damnedest thing you ever saw in your life if you see an 89 page list some knucklehead has done in kyokak for christs sake know that the item is probably the first or second item on the list laughter on occasion when you pass the item in nulling all subseq uent items will read to point where everything on the list will then read in this case take the first read take the first which read on the first nulling so so this idea of slant slant slant slant or x x x x come off of it dont do that dont do that its sf f lfbd say what the read was so as youre coming down you read the first item on the list unclear ah balderdash topsat oh wait minute what the hell is this catterwamps that was lf balderdash sf chipmunks f catnip f unclear f what the hell is going on here well whats going on here is youre carrying the read of the first item right on down in the list if you keep doing this youre going to be in hell of mess in fact i dont know of good method of separating out this awful mess now an underlisted and overlisted list will arc break the pc and he may refuse to be audited until the list is corrected and may become furious with the auditor and will remain so until it is corrected hell also become sad hell also get other manifestations of arc break overlisted and underlisted an incorrect list is something is the first thing you correct for straightening up the case listing and nulling or any auditing at all beyond an arc break without handling the arc break such as correcting the list or otherwise locating it will put the pc into sad effect and that is so true just what it says because it is the same as an arc break longduration arc break that is audited over top of will bring about sad effect fourteen pc whose attention is on something else wont list easily you list and null only with the rudiments in on the pc thats where you would put it doing list you would have to expand that question as i was inferring you would have to say you know while you were being listed you know did you have pts mwh ah an auditor whose trs are out has difficulty in listing and nulling and in finding items oh so true now if you wanted to send every item to the examiner to be checked to make sure it was the right item it would simply be stating this every auditor i have has outtrs we are not sure that the person went release on the process he was run on the analogous statement is none of our auditors have their trs in when trs are out things go release and do various weird cooky things that they shouldnt but when we say trs are out god its got to be awfully damned bad its something that you would break down and cry over the auditor is sitting there eating candy and the pc is looking out the window more or less self auditing and the auditor is reading newspa per between questions itd really be corny see for this to happen listing and nulling errors in presence of auditors code violations can unstabilize pc believe you take pc who is not been fed or something like this or has not had enough sleep etc and you insist on listing and you carry the list over and its already difficult to audit and you shouldnt be listing at time anyhow can unstabilize guy he he can feel like he is absolutely spinning for day two days three days four days woof now the lack of speci fic listing question or an incorrect nonstandard listing question which doesnt really call for an item would give you more than one item reading on list sometimes you see list which has lots of items reading on it for christs sake go back and look at the listing question and it could say are tractors neces sary laughter dont get so obsessed that you think only one thing will read on that list everything under gods green earth will read on it you cease listing and nulling actions when floating needle appears and this is perfectly true you cease listing and nulling actions when floating needle appears you dont cease auditing do you get the nuance of that laughter it means what it says now always give the pc hit item and circle it plainly on the list wait wait wait minute thats auditing past listing and boy youd better his f n will pack right up pc go around what was my item what was my item what was my item see the bank freezes before the pc speaks so it probably went f n before he gave you the item you tee he thought ragbags f n and then he says ragbags and you write it down see there it is sometimes when you are nulling snaps fingers you get your f n now if you just sit there blankly the pc is going to go into mystery so you always give the pc his item and twenty listing and nulling are highly precise auditing actions and if not done exactly by the laws may bring about down tone and slow gain case but if done correctly exactly by the laws and with good auditing in general will produce the highest gains attainable note there are variations or exceptions to the above it does not alter va power procedure people think sometimes this alters it or theyre different im just i already told you why and ethics should be put in where these laws are violated an auditor who isnt convinced of something you should list him on some question insists it goes to one item particularly if the question doesnt read what tractors are sick laughter went into 89 pages and insist there is an item thats too gruesome i know you cant confront it i wouldnt be able to confront it either im sure youllall do these laws correctly and im sure use blackjac k on those people regard these laws of listing and nulling far too lightly far far far too lightly they are very important and with the auditors code are the most important errors that can be made as far as case effects are concer ned so they are not to be regarded lightly you dont list list and then dont null it you dont muck about with listing and nulling you dont let an auditor list and null for you as case supervisor that you are very doubtful of you got it you mak him itsa or something got it yes help you out little bit yes all right thank you very much applauseassists lecture given on 3 october 1968 and you are being well advertised class eights you are being well advertised full spread of the auditor we sent missi on we sent mission up to the pubs org in ww and we got ourselves complete spread in this it has double page internal spread of photographs taken by the only photographer in the field and you will notice that the pictures here are actually posed by sea org members they are not in actual fact the first class eight students and thats because you were all so very very busy that day and the aos are represented here the class v iii auditors course begins at aos but that is quite an action rather typical sea org action actually we banged it together organized the whole shot shot missionaire up to pubs got it on the presses its rolling it will be out and released in england in something on the order of about two weeks from this date and it will be over in ame rica in three or four weeks and it says here that as you read this why class viiis will be supervising cases in your nearest org so it looks like you guys are very well advertised very very well advertised and i am sure you will make the grade you better had the action here is that you have to get reality on what standard tech will do and what you can do with it and which way it goes and so on all of which is very easy ok what s the lecture number which one ten you mean youve gotten up to ten and you are not class viiis yet lecture number ten lecture number ten and this is the third of october ad 18 and this is lecture that covers exact processe s and is very ratatattat the first process i wish to cover is an assist an assist is done on if you will notice your scale of specia l cases the sick pc now the sick pc can also include one that is in flat out agonizing he doesnt know what is wrong physical condition and the approach to that particular case is included in the head under the heading of assist the most comm on assist is contact assist you take the person to the place where he was injured and make him do contact of the injured part to the place where and the thing that was actually the cause of the injury and you do that and you will get somatic blow through and that is that that is very common and very easy to do that is called contact assist and you never do touch assist when you can do contact assist if the thing is there its there this comes from the fact that the exact thorn in the rose garden which pricks your finger will turn on that exact somatic when contacted again in other words if the mest is available you can do contact assist and it is very easy thing to do there are hardly any commands involved with it the less you say the better off you are your whole object is simp ly to get him to go and put hit stubbed shin up against the lawn mower where he has hit it and you make him do that and touch it again and touch it again and touch it again and touch it again i must tell you something about assists when you come up scale as an auditor you can actually see somatic go through now some of you will be looking for painted picture eight feet square it is not that it is simp ly very faint very faint impression and you can actually see sort of faint impression go noise through the pc you know the somatic has gone through the pc also it is assisted by occasionally he flinches at this moment and so on now i must say something about contact assist the object being to get him to go up and touch his shin against the lawn mower is all very well but if you force him to go up there it is the same at forcing sick pc which is very very bad indeed and the funny part of it is that you can to this on gradient re does not want to come nearer than one hundred feet from that damn lawn mower you can actually find this in child thats the closes t he is going to come to it well you make him do contact assist with his shin and his body at point one hundred feet from it and you gradually by gradient narrow the distance to it by gradients that he is willing to approach it eventually he will go up and do contact assist on it that fact probably is not generally known but you must not drag the person up there forcibly because you are going to do an overwhelm now touch assist is the next grade of assist and touch assist is with the command which you dont articulate any more than you have to the pc gets the idea very shortly you touch him with your finger and he is supposed to feel the finger and then signify that he has felt the finger after few commands youll find out that when you touch him he will give you blink or nod or some representation you knock off the verbalization at that particular time and you simply continue to do the touching and he continues to so on now you wait for him to acknowledge its rather hard to do this on person who is only semico nscious then you try to maintain the communication cycle it all depends on what part of the body is injured what you do with this contact assist the most difficult area to do contact assist on is the head and the head and the nerve system of body is pain cushion it is pain absorption cushion and any elect ric shock caused by pain distributes itself throughout the neurons of the body and you will find out that there was wave of shock which went lets say hit head that went all the way from the head down through the nerve chan nels and the electrical you can even measure the spee d of an elect rical impulse through the nerve channels it happens to be ten feet second but it went from there as shock wave straight down through the nerve chan nels which go through the spine and there is about dozen neurons something like that through the spine and it goes to the extremities of the body so you will find person who has had head injury normally had something wrong with his spine afterwards and that is because the shock wave is locked up in his spine so your touch assist should include going from the head to the extremities of the body now if you are just trying to get him back on his feet or something like that you are not going to go to the soles of his feet and try to do super super thorough job of this because later on you are going to run it out as an engram probably but the thing which i am calling to your attention is that it does go to the extremities of the body so your touch assist is not just around his head and you have to approach the injury go away from the injury approach the injury go away from the injury approach the injury close r go away from the injury further approach the injury close r go away from it further approach the injury closer go away from it further approach the injury to point where you are actually touching the injured part go away further and when you are going away and coming up you try to follow the nerve channels of the body which includes the spine and the limbs and there are certain relay points like the elbows and the wrists and the finger tips these are the points you head for the back side of the knee and so on these are all points which the pain can get locked up inthe shock wa ve what you are trying to do is get this communication wave flowing again through the body because the shock of injury stopped it what they know as operational shock accident shock things like this is simply the thing stopped right there see the individuals trying to withdraw from it it is stopped and therefore he cannot get circulatory system going in the area now if you do anything on the right aide of the body you also do it on the left side of the body let us take an injured hand now if you do touch assist on an injured hand you go further away from the body down the hand and closer to the body going across the area of the injury touch at last the injury and then you do exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the body because the brain comm unication system cross locks and you can find that pain in the left hand runs out when you touch the right hand because the right hand has got it locked up so you do the right and left side of the body has hurt his right shoulder you should also give the touch assist to his left shoulder the principles are simply these near and far near far on try to do it on gradient and then use the other side of the body too and the other operating point is follow the nerve chan nels now if the fellow is bleeding from an artery and is going to loose all the blood in his body in the next four or five minutes you would be an absolute idiot to do touch assist and then apply tourniquet the proper sequence is to apply tourniquet and then do touch assist now the proper sequence is not to give him shot of morphine andthen do touch assist because you are processing an individual under the influence of drugs and it will just slow down and nothing much will happen the object of touch assist in this particular thing supposing man had broken his hip or something like that you give him touch assist you give him touch assist try to get some of the shock off of it try to get some of the shock off of it if it were the left hip you would do touch assist to the left hip you would go up the spine down the spine back of the legs to the area and then you would it on the opposite side of the body and its feel my finger throughout except you dont have to say it once hes got it in the groove and then of course after you have got the edge of it off the guy may still be in agony because the thing is pretty badly smash ed up then let somebody shoot him with morphine then let him be packed off let him get the thing set let the medicos have their day plumbing him also let the medico have his day to do what he can try to minimize the amount of conversation around the injured person is one of the main criteria you dont let people talk around this thing even though you have to kick them in the stomach and you dont keep saying shut up and be quiet because that becomes part of the engram you signal them to be quiet and you walk into their chest and you walk them of the scene and then say shut up you know like that and then come back and continue it because you are just putting content into the engram now the medico goes and patches the thing up and hit the structural fact is handled now at some later time few days later day or two later hes out of his shock something like that and he can stand up to auditing now you give him session which runs the engram and you give him just standard engram session there isnt anything peculiar about it it just runs down the chain of injury and all that you understand but that engram running comes under the heading of assist which i cover with you in moment now that is nothing more nor less than contact assist and touch assist and this is how they are done and that is standard tech we have been doing them for yars exaggerated way of saying years and yars and yars and its amazing to to find that there are scientologists around who dont now how to do these two standard actions in standard way alright now what about this engram now this is this special case which is sick pc it could be sick or severely injured pc but its sick pc in other words an acute now condition which is devouring his attention and youre going to fly the needle on arc breaks huh now here is something funny heres something funny if you are auditing him with meter you audit him on exact standard tech it isnt pecu liar brand of tech which enters in but it has this exception youre hope of flying the needle before going into the major action is zero because he is sitting in the major action with all devouring concen trationdo you follow so this is an exception and there arent very many exceptions in standard tech but this is an exception to fly the needle before undertaking major action because the major action is there now this tells you also then if you cant fly the needle before that that the pc is in rather perilous condition and if you try to do forcing technique on the pc if you try to shove the pc into something heavy he isnt sitting in and doesnt want to go into you can easily overwhelm the pc and spin him now just as you cant fly the needle before you run the engram so you must very definitely obey the auditors code and try to do your very smoothest trs and gently gently and thats how you run an engram on very injured person now this approach includes the guy who falls on his head in three because of the restimulation of an engram you are going to find i am very sure somew here in your career individually because he is not going to be very rare an individual who all of sudden has not run out his incident one or his incident two or something of this sort all of sudden he is going to tell you he is dying hes collapsing the body is ceasing to breath and what do you know it is you understand this thing goes into sudden you see he didnt do good job on three and so on he hasnt been well reviewed something like this and he is liable to go into sudden agony on the thing and it could be very real agony now the funny part of it is he cant identify what it is it is very mysterious something wild suddenly occurs now you could actually have this happen with very malignant body thetan all of sudden hits the guy do you see he just started to run this body thetan and wham wham we have already had one in an ao guy did something to slave girl at some time way to hell and gone back on the track and shes been around ever since when they gave her little bit of auditing and tried to boot her out she left but three days later she came back and man she really knocked that guy flat he was the flattest pcy ou ever saw there is case history on this what they did was do the usual did the usual actions of three the auditor however on meter and so forth located and isolated what the thetan was handled the thing ran the incident one incident two neces sary to resolve the situation and finally and forever why the slave girl blew very remarkable circumstance apparently this body thetan had been around for many many century now this these are interesting phenomena in that the individual is suddenly and inexplicably hurting or very ill and if he were ill from ptomaine poisoning or something of the sort you actually could not distinguish it you look at the pc pale clam my looks like hes sick might even be vomiting see something like that now the individual simply could have been fed bad food and is being is going through bad food spell dysentery something like this well what can you do about it you can let him get well and feed him an antibiotic do you follow if he doesnt recover from that i have got news for you it is because it is held up mentally function is senior to structure thought is senior to function and structure and an individual who is bound and determined to be sick because of the bank or body thetans trying to make him sick or something like that brother brother you could treat him all the antibiotics in the world boy you can operate on him do most anything you want to do and there isnt very much going to happen its very funny this kind of an action has taken place an individual with very severe infection fed antibiotics and other medicines to alleviate the thing and just go right on with it just right like that aa auditor comes along in spite of the antibiotics gives him an assist session cleaning up what he had goofed up or what was goofed up on the case and although he stays h on antibiotics and he stays on antibiotics right after the session the antibiotics suddenly start to work and the fever turns of the temperature goes subnormal it all vanish runs out it cycle very nicely its very remarkable phenomena this individual is coughing and coughing and coughing and he has had cough for long time and they to some sort of an analysis and culture and this and that and they finally find out that he has got galloping whoses invented name and only they call it some latin name and it proved it proved it absolutely conclusively that he has got this do you see hes got it alright only he doesnt respond to treatment in medicine they divide illness into three groups patient reaction into three sepa rate categories which is what cause s it what makes it sick you know what makes it come up to an immediate acute condition and what prolongs it now there is data on this in i think dianetics modern science of mental health it talks ab out that now three phases you see so he can get something which precipitates the illness bong hes sick and now he doesnt respond he gets prolongation and he doesnt respond to the cure he doesnt respond to the cure auditor comes along you just do standard tech and run an engram or secondary is all you do but it is standard tech see its done by all rules of standard tech its done neatly nicely smoothly realizing that you cant reach very deep and his ability to axis is very poor and he is pretty wongobongo and if you get him all over the track with fifteen engrams in restimulation one right after the other boy you might as well have shot him with shot gun to begin with you understand so it has to be gently done and the control of the session has to be very good you have to be very good auditor to do this sort of thing and you hit this chain and you fix it up now oddly enough you dont even get to run it out you hit it you date it you do what you can about it and all of sudden the medicine works all of sudden the individual starts to get well or the individual goes back and runs three the individual returns to solo or he gets his next grade or something like this do you follow he gets back into the standard line of things now its called an assist its called an assist but it is done very very very definitely by very standard tech you check your arc break and handle that arc break you check your ptp you check your missed withhold i dont care the guys woowoaw aowoa etc chec k these things because the funny part of it is it may be such hell of break in reality he was sitting there minding his own business and all of sudden bullet went through his head thats the way it feels and he is in agony see whoa you check your arc break and the arcu and cdei and you go through any of the motions you can now the one exception is if you expect the needle to fly you are fool you wont and if you try to force this needle to fly you are just distracting him now you dont want to audit over an arc break you dont want to audit over ptp and you certainly dont want to audit over missed withhold but they will all be germane relevant to the incident hes sitting in you wont get anything else so you pull the arc break out of the incident so you are not running an engram over the top of an arc break you pull the ptp out of the incident its just the ptp of the incident that he has it you pull that out so that you get some change and the missed withhold concerning it and so on so that he wont natter and blow up in your face because its all on the incident but the needle the chances of the needle flying are very very slim you understand the only variation here then is that you dont expect the needle to fly before youre doing major action because you are already doing the major action not of your own choice you are presented with the major action now the pc has presented you on silver platter with the major action bong i was down in the restaurant i was sitting there various noises dramatization of how the pc would soundhope you don need full transcript here are the words without the ejaculations i was sitting there there it goes again there it goes again i was sitting and i was just sitting there and all of sudden my right arm fell off and to this chin music you get in arc break ptps missed withholds he will answ er your questions boy because they are right there ready to spit out and then find out what it is you dont arbitrarily audit something without finding out what it is so this is one of these things where you are doing sort of an assessme nt it isnt list dont you see youre assessing and you ask him what he thinks it is and he normally will tell you i dont know so you have got to suggest it you know he is very often hes saying pc in agony noises again oh oh god i havent got any idea oh my god see thats the type of music which you are liable to receive many not slightly there have been many pcs like this around aos and out in the field except people immediately take it for granted that they are terribly ill and they dont do anything about them you see thats for the birds so you have to do the list and its this little process which you see on my case supervisor notes assess you know bla bla noises take the one that reads the most and do something with it well actually under an emergency of this particular character you are handling the similar situation that i have often handled in babies i am very good with babies and so on i have had lot of experience in this line and i get along great with babies kids dogs people beings horses horses and i argue little bit but the well we do we dont see eye to eye horses feel put upon they have been replaced by the automobile and they feel supernumerary but the upshot of it is that little baby went baby crying noises and you will see some goddamn nurse girl walking back and forward patting the baby in the butt you know walking back and forth and back and forth there there there hush now hush now hush now i come along and i hear all this catas trophe going on and i say what cooks he has colic and so on noises well she has misdiagnosed it obviously and the baby keeps on crying so i take look at the kid and first they have safety pin shoved quarter of an inch in to his butt but the funny part of it is i sort of have to ask him it isnt any sort of telepathic communication i have to look you know i have to look and look at the reactions you know there isnt much communication with it what what the hell you know what is this because he really doesnt answe r up one of the reasons he doesnt answ er up is he is so frantic you know it isnt that he cant talk or communicate so is just frantic thats all the nurse girl his mother maybe even doctor around you know christ almighty he is frantic and you finally say what did you give him for supper oh well he just had his regular ration where is it oh its over there i mean its odd that he wont eat he wont eat i squirt some out on the back of my hand and taste it its live pure live somebody has mixed it up with baking acid or something you know how it is you know its completely sour the devil himself would have turned purple if he had ever got it in his gullet you know i go up and i whip up the kid mess of milk or something and i hand him bottle and he takes very suspici ous you know well all of sudden oh thank god and you find out he hadnt eaten for two days its idiot stuff like this actually see but this is little sort of an assessment lets see could it be food could it be that he is hungry could it be that vague noise could it be is he wet is he chafed or something you know it is something and thats what they miss entirely but its something it isnt ever nothing now you see you have to learn that about cases if case is having trouble it is something it is never really nothing unless somebody has wished nothingness off on him and when you get the nothingness ff you will find out that there was st ill something so this is the way you have to approach very ill pc and you as an eight class viii are going to have this problem in aos and in orgs and you are going to run into it and you are going to have to tell somebody what to do about it well it is something you should learn well it isnt something that is not going to happen to you it is going to happen to you and you have to do an assessme nt of all the possib things it could be only they are pretty obvious has he eaten bad food thats one list see list item it is one of these little assessment items bad food body thetan engram you got the idea something in that order is all of sudden going to cause bd you say it to him and even though hes gone noises my god see you get through you dont have to shout at him you get through you just say it and all of sudden you have got blow down well if its body thetan if its body thetan you would simply follow through the routine of three of ot iii but the second you start contacting what it actually is or identifying it starts cooling off and the pc reaction becomes far more reasonable and rational even though its knocking him half flat you see so what you would do is try to get this body thetan find out whats wrong with the body thetan find out what it wrong with him and the body thetan lets just get little itsa on it lets get some data and then lets try to run an incident one off of this body thetan and you sometimes will find the body thetan has been overrun already on incident one you see number of conditions can exist when you are handling body thetan now the but you find out what condition it is and then you do the usual for three now dont always assume that it is clust er but it could be cluster and there is mutual engram so if it is body thetan you would then do milaz zo which is say you find the mutual engram the mutual engram and the first action of the mutual engram is to date it to date it date it date it what is its date thats the most available datum you date it and then you find out what it is about and you can do both of those you can first your little assessment is what is it see physical illness you know body thetan engram whatever you might thinksee you put it down those are the most likely candidates and you put these things down bad food see and you put these things down and if you dont get blowdown on any of those things dont quit you have got something missing from your assessment line the guy might simply be high on pot and in delusions you get it unbeknownst to you why he took himse lf whole big smok and he went up in smok you see well it could be something so your perception enters into what goes on the assessment form to give you canned assessme nt form of every thing that could be wrong with thetan in this universe would be an adventurous action because operating at different places at different times you will get different items but those are the principle ones now if it is body thetan you got to identify if it is just one or if it is several now the funny part of it is it will answ er up as just one body thetans normally do but when you say is it several you will get bigger read now you want to know if it was several what is the date of the incident that brought them together and you are going to date it and you are going to do standard dating drill that doesnt vary one hair tens of years ago hundreds of years ago the only way you can miss on this sometimes is that it happened last year or it happened yesterday then you would have to start out in minutes seconds ago minutes ago hours ago days ago weeks ago months ago years ago tens of years ago you got it thats the safest assessment and you go on up and dont start slowing it down and say well we got to trillions and nothing happened after trillions comes quadrillions i think they go way up boy thetans are very old but someway along that line you are going to get something like hundreds of billions good and that read bit now is it more than five hundred billions or less than five hundred billion it read on more is it more than seven hundred and fifty billion less than seven hundred and fifty billion it read on less than seven hundred and fifty billion is it more than six hundred billion and meanwhile you are listening for the pc to spit out date the pc very often spits out date oh six hundred and seventy two million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and forty two yes thats right and two minutes you know very good you write all that down it reads like hell bongo bingo bongo thats the incident you run and when you just start to run this incident on cluster you very often very often they go noise fifteen twenty of them leave all at the same time something like hundred of them leave noise thank god know good bye noisealright now if the pc at that moment where gave an aspect of relief and looked well you would say thats good you understand he had to be an ot iii or this sort of thing would not be happening you know you dont run this on people below that level youd kill them so he says yes oh thats great oh my god what relief noises god and you say alright thats fine thank you very much and let him take it up himself now he is going to go on the basis that they all blew and ive got news for you on clust er they dont always all blow there are fifteen of them left it looked so spectacul ar to see such mass disintegrate and so many of them leave but there might be some still around now you have to finish running the engram out to that degree and run incident one on each sepa rate one of them and they go thud thump gone gone gone that cleans it up because the funny part of it is let us say he had terrible throat noise couldnt talk see and then you found this incident you dated the thing you got some substance of what it was all about and all of sudden you got this noise gone you know still going to be left with bit of sore throat youre going to say well thats natural it isnt natural thats the ten or fifteen youve left thats the engram the engram is still remaining with those few do you follow now also there is copy now thetans copy what has just been copied thetans copy what has been copied and make copies of the copies you get the idea so you get this kind of thing the thing came off your back see came off gone but the mass is still there all right whose copying the thetan who has just left thats the trick well this one is copying and there goes that mass crosscopying and you run into lot of this cross copying and so on as you try to run this stuffgot it but for the purposes of an assist the noise goodbye joe see you later thats good enough boy you dont push your luck thats good get on with it some day let him recover let him get his breathe and then hit it later but you normally have these characters coming back saying how it didnt all go away well of course it didnt all go away not all the cluster left went away now the engram wasnt erased there is basic on the engram there is whole chain that hasnt been gone down do you follow you didnt finish the job all it was was n assist you got it so what happens when this fellow all of sudden starts spinning and he says there is an opera singer standing right in front of my face and she is going round and round and round and round and round and i dont know understand it and i dont understand it and oh my god my god noise there goes the fever again you know what is all this same procedure you try and get in the ruds do it to the degree you can make little assessme nt of what this thing might be then you date it cause its going to be some sort of an incident and when you date it if it comes up that the key dates of incident two which is of course seventy four million plus its almost seventy five million almost in pt pecu liar to this planet if it came up with about four quadrillion its incident one they are that far apart thats peculiar to all the thetans of the universe they all got that so of course it tends to make them clust er that is why they blow up and go park and everything works ut when you hit so called incident one all right it comes under the heading of an assist and you cool it off to point where you can leave it and he can bear it and that is it and then he lives to be audited another day you got it those are all assists now it isnt proper session because you didnt fly the ruds for major action you didnt fly the ruds for contact assist you didnt fly the ruds for touch assist you didnt fly the ruds for this assessment you can by the way make an assessment after the assessment you can make an assessment for what it is and then you can make little assessment and write down asking the pc questions well whats the content of it i dont know i dont know well just tell something is it accident is it shock of some sort is it and then he is liable to volunteer one or two items and you sort of put that it is not one item list you see it will work out sort of like that because it is usually just one thing but you are not trying to list and null this thing you are just asking the question you are writing it down to compare the reads do you follow and if he runs out of it you can furnish couple yourself because hes not so violates like hell putting an item on the pcs list so it isnt really listing and nulling action do you understand it is just trying to find some information so it is an assist it isnt really proper session but you must in all cases carry on an assist with the discipline of the auditor dont force the pc he persuasive he gentle keep your trs in do the actions which you can do within the limits of the session do you understand that you are going to run into this character who starts going round and round and round and they say they say the helicopters going to crash its going to crash and you are looking for helicopter accident what the hell its r6 boy and nothing else i dont know i think it is for about day or two it takes this helicopter to crash in r6 there is helicopter there the guy is frozen in alcohol and glycol sitting in block being given big three d dimension cecil b mills special motion picture now the consistency of this you should understand incident one is simp ly incident one person can have himself more than incident one more than one incident one person himself can have administered some incident ones there can be an overt incident one it is relatively simp implant but it is quite effective in lousing people up because it interrupted them from creating what they would have been creating and took away what mock ups they did have and it stopped their cycle and it put some thing there that was unwanted so when they tried to create they created it because it fixed their attention by process by protest all right for this planet for this confederacy and the twentyone adjacent stars and its seventy six planets the incident two it is very long involved and comp lex incident its about thirty six days it starts out normally with capture some kind or another capture and dont think of yourself im trying to run capture of having been airyfairying around in the air and somebody something or other and got you down with net and all that balderdash because people at that particular time and place were walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute and the cars they drove looked exactl the same and the trains they ran looked the same and the boats they had looked the same circa 1950 1960 this civilization has simp ly copied r6 one hundred percent because they were told to and they walked down streets that looked like these streets and lived in houses that looked like these houses and so on thats what the hell and there was suite bit of huffle fluffle and upset and so on before r6 took place what it was was the loyal officers were the body the elective body and they called them the loyal officers and they were there to protect the populations and so forth and they had electe d fellow by the name of xenu to the supreme ruler and they were about to unelect him and he took the last moments he had in office to really goof the floof yes i dont blame you for dropping something and he took these last moments to really upset it he of course had several key birds who were close to him he was suppressiv to end all suppressives he got these administrators and so on and heads of planets in various positions and places he picked off all the cowb oys in the white hats and he got rid of them first fast and then troops not knowing what the hell they were doing but fed all kinds of false orders were fed in against the population to pick them up one after the other tat tattatatattata tat one of the mechanisms they used was to tell them to come in for an income tax investigation and the united states just copies income tax its just r6 they are bunch of dramatizing psychotics these guys so in they went and the troops started slaughtering them and then the troops of course were ordered out to get hold of certain bodies of renegade troops which were ordered to get certain bodies of bad troops and they shot each other up and implanted each other and wiped it out they were making billiard balls out of these places they were imported they were actually the trick was to shoot somebody disable somebody very often needle into lung and at the same time to hit him with frozen alcohol and glycol which preparation is guaranteed to pick up thetan all they had to do was pick him up and put him into refrigerator and they had him boy because if he tried to exteriorize from the body there he was frozen and they threw him into collection points boxed them up in boxes threw them into space planes which are the exact copies dc8s the dc8 aeroplane is the exact copy of the space plane of that day difference except the dc8 had fans propellers on it and the space plane didnt and they threw them into refrigerated units and so on and in view of the fact that einstein was absolutely right man cant go faster than the speed of sound speed of light which is bunch of balderdash the length of time from the planet coltus to the planet teegeeack which is the name of this planet was nine weeks and youll see that it is many light years coitus is one of the planets and is to this day one of the planets of the north star polaris and people were ferried in here by the billions and the billions and the billions and they were ferried in here with boxes and they were put in boxes and they were stacked around and the people who were on this planet already just caught it in the teeth they werent bothered body bothered to pick them up they just shot their administrators from guns and shot their control points out and they took these people in boxes and so forth and they dumped them and then they set off hydrogen bombs on the top of each primary volcano there is on this particular planet and when they blew up it blew the thetans into the air and after the bomb an electronic ribbon which also was type of standing wave was erected over the area the tremendous winds of the planet blew every thetan there was straight into those particular vacu um zones which had been created these were brought down packed up and put in front of projection machi ne which with sound and color pictures first gave them the implant which you know as clearing course and then whole track implant which you know as t ii after this however up about the remainder of the thirty six days which is the bulk of them is taken up with threed super colossal motion picture which has to do with god the devil space opera etcet era they go five pictures to five words and we have the full record of what it is and it goes on for about thirty six days and then these poor bastards were let wander out pardon they were then boxed up again and the boxes were mixed so that there were two assem bly areas one was palmas and the other was hawaii and in these two assembly area they took samp from each volcano area put it in little boxes and they had an assembly line and in palmas it runs down the main street of palmas you get more damned accidents on that main street than you can shake stick at one of our captains was feeling rather queasy until i told her well the old assem bly line of r6 is just twenty five feet from you as you lie here on the slipway that blew the charge the entirety of roman catholicism the devil all that sort of thing that is all part of r6 practically anything you can think of all modern theaters in actual fact are built with the exact symbols shown for them in r6 they even have the symbol on the boxes on the side of the theater they preserve those to this day its so indelible they are not quite right but they still know that there is supposed to be design on those boxes at the side of the audience to the left and right and so on there is supposed to be certain gold gilt design over there and they still put it there and in the thing there are about four or five assignments of who did it there are about four or five different things that might have done it it is blamed on one of these things that time an another thing that time and so on so at to get people very confused as to what was the true cause of the entire thing after they were packaged up they were blown off into space and let em them go to hell these planets averaged one seven eight billion human beings per planet one hundred and seventy eight billion there were two hundred and fifty billion on this planet the name of this planet was teegeeak and this is known as the bomb place and this is the evil place this is the place where they all got smashe d you wonder today where you see large areas of where there is alleged volcanic action has been those are r6 explosions the remains of them if you go down through many layers of civilizations archaeologically you come to green glass now to get rid of the whole damn thing it is only neces sary to run incident one really in most cases which runs out the whole track because the fellow realizes h is m ockin g it up and he knocks it off and that is that but incident two has volcanic explosion which follows the actual explosion as its picture and its very trickedvery tricked up so that you actually bunch of thetans and they get bombed that is one of the its wild that is one of the explosions that is shown and there are several explosions shown in sequence so actually what happened was that there was the real explosion which was the guy was boxed up in box or he is walking around or some of the loyal officers that were caug ht here and so on were chained on the top of buildings and so on so when the bomb hit why they would be flicked of into the fantastic hundreds of miles an hour thousands of miles an hour winds of gross comp lete atomic explosion all over the planet and they were whirled in these terrific winds and so on everybody on the planet was killed and about three days afterwards is actually when the implanters started operating they had it all rigged to operate and then to make long story short you can easily get into one of the false explosions as the fairy queen the fairy palate it is supposed to be fairy palace and dive down to save somebody because there has been an explosion and thats all phony so there is false start after false start after false start to the incident what this is really designed to do is to make the individual cease and desist from creation and to knock out overpopulation this is one of the big ideas they had that they just did all this then they would get rid of all overpopulation the target of it is the second dynamic so it is full of second dynamic suppressions for instance you find people who are totally obsessed with sex with children well that is taught in r6 they were nice guys anyway to make long story short there is even motion picture studio in it the even give the writers and so forth of the thing they had several tricks that they used they can make full figure appear in the room which looks totally solid and totally threed to the person they are just tricks just nothing we know so much more about the mind than the r6er that there is comparison now the net result of all of this was to make seventy five million year vacu um as far as this part of the universe is concerned you wonder why dont if there are saucers around why dont they land on this planet this planet traditionally traditionally over the various zones and areas has an evil reputation mutineers and dese rters and that sort of thing are often dumped on this planet they often come here in refuge because they know nobody is going to come after them this planet is the planet of the evil repute this sector of the universe has very evil repute now all the data which you have that was seventy four plus plus plus billion years ago almost seventy five and this catastrophe overcame this confederation and it has made very unsa vory part of the universe to say the least about well relatively almost modern times twenty million years ago something lie that somebody started up body line on the planet its gradually worked through various areas of barbarism and once more r6 tailor made it to be nothing but cave man civilization but nevertheless they moved up the line and they moved up towards the dramatization of r6 and that is what man calls progress they have managed to make things this way and that way the technology is rather pathetic but they have moved up the line until there is some possib ility of establishing communication with regard to the activity the fate of the r6er you will have many pc will say oh my god they are after well noises sure fixed up an area they fixed up an implant that there people are taught carefully that any man who tries to save the world must be killed he must be mobbed and hanged any man who tries to save the world so i of course shifted our valence over to more optimum r6 valence the whole population of the planet responds like clock to r6 symbols they respond to nothing else they do not respond to reason they only respond to r6 symbols so you occupy the wrong symbol and people begin to think of you as person who is going to save the planet then one and all are more or less u nder orders to slaughter you well they booby trapped it they booby trapped it very badly the roman catholic church somew here along the line through watc hing the dramatizations of people picked up some little fragments of r6 and they make it look like its continued forward into presen t time but the truth of the matter is that the loyal officers were not all killed xenu missed and they were not all killed not by long way although the civilization war battered it still had weapons it still had transport it still had some semb lance of organization and the loyal officers who were at remote bases who were airborne at the time who somehow or another on other planets were not effected suddenly turned around right after this great catas trophe and the administrators and renegades which xenu had brought in were not very effective and fire fight ensue d which put the finishing touches on the galactic confederation the towns that were left and so on were just battered into ruins were you had the renegades that had been hired and so on and the administrators that had been loyal to xenu were still trying to hold out within year he was in under arrest and within six years the lot had been wiped out the loyal officers were triumphant xenu was put with several of his cohorts in the center of mountain which is still on one of these planets and in wire cage which is charged with an eternal battery he is not likely ever to get out and the loyal officers looked around and there was not anything left and of course nobody could manufacture this or that or the other thing and what people there were left they could not obtain any supplies and they couldnt maintain the civilization and what little was left that wasnt battered to pieces simply went by the boards and vanished from history there is base on this planet and it is so shredded away as to be hardly recognizable whenever then anybody tries to do anything about this he is apt to get flashback so you must not go around talking about being the people who are going to save the planet you are the people the planet obeys you are the people who own the planet you are not the people who are going to save the planet and thereby you will save it now i could give you much of the symbolism and so on which goes along with this but you find it recorded this of course man responds to ron shows dmsm h book front cover which is an exploding volcano he responds to that he understands that it doesnt restimulate him because hes not up to being restimulated he just knows that thats all right in r6 everybody is shown crucif ied so is the psych iatrist shown crucif ied although the psychiatrist is dominant character and thats how he gets away with what he gets away with he electric shock s people the medical doctor is not really represented in r6 it is only the surgeon the surgeon is shown cutting bodies to pieces thats the right thing to do actually he shreds body down to just raw meat down to skeleton and the skeleton is in agony and then it too is chopped up anyway every man is then shown to have been crucif ied so dont think that its an accident that this cruci fixion they found out that this applied somebody somew here on this planet back about six hundred bc found some piece of r6 and i don t know how they found it either by watch ing mad men or something but since that time they have used it and it became what is known as christianity the man on the cross there was christ but the man on the cross is shown as every man so of course each person seeing crucif ied man has an immediate feeling of sympathy for this man therefore you get many pcs who say they are christ now there are two reasons for that one is the roman empire was prone to crucif people so person can have been crucif ied but in r6 he is shown as crucified there are certain things which make people ill and that is when they get into certain zones and areas or positions which approximate the r6 position such as body lying in the rain with rat below the cross guaranteed to give people colds and so forth so they have colds from rain yet they take baths and get wet and don t get colds when they get cold it restimulates frozen alcohol and glycol as mix and therefore they get into dramatization so the sickness is very closely tied in with r6 quite in addition to that one of the volcanoes japan on its explosion gave certain definite implant that tells people when and how to be sick they are supposed to be sick at five they are supposed to be sick at ten they are supposed to be sick at four up to fifty the chan ge of life that men get and women get and so on it s all dictated in this sickness implant people are supposed to get sick also body was only supposed to live seventy years which is bunch of balderdash hefore r6 and so forth they lived on and on and on and on and on there was such thing as this they taught people death they taught them amnesia these various things they all com from this zone and area now that is peculiar and lonely to this planet and to this confederation there have been other implants of various kinds and sizes but this is probably one of the longest most violent and wildest implants in this sector of the universe now to get an edge in in this particular area and blow this up as mass engram and so forth is quite trick and we are involved in doing just that universe is saf where people are smash ed that badly it beco mes the business of any thetan because the universe in which he lives as long as it contains cance rous area such as this whole confederation and so on is not universe in which one can really freely move simple so the project is open and shut and as i point out to you once again the truth of the matter it that it is more the business of the inhabitants of this planet than it is mine now where we are maki ng headway we are making headway and we must go right on making headway because we might not ever get another chance the dramatization of exploding bomb is contained in r6 so sooner or later someone is going to smok this planet into cocked hat that is why i have talked occasionally about having to get there with the most now realize when you are auditing pc for god sakes that you are auditing against this background you are auditing against the background of tailor made sickness auditing against background of this of that of the other thing now the grades take one very smoothly up this line but you are auditing basically sick pc why hes an earth man so what do you do standard tech follow the line go right on up the groove because these are the things which stand in the road of any thetan not just the people of this planet but three happens in other zones and places something blows up and five or six thetans who are in the railroad car together or the space wagon and after that think of themselves as just one thetan and get all smashe d together and stay that way for while somebody kills another body in dual and the owner of the secon d body is so revengeful that he promptly jumps on the first guy and this guy is now duel being who sort of hates himse lf thetan goes mad at exactly that point in his career when he begins to stop things so you can always find the point where somebody has gone round the bend so therefore the button stop is very important to remember in running incident one and incident two very important because it will be the point where which makes and breaks his sanity you get the button stop in and the incident starts to run well why is stop so important because it stops the incident any incident dont think thats all there is to the track of incident one and incident two but these oddly enough take the puzzle apart there are so certain other things and i forbear actually to tell you too much about these things because you will at once go out and try to find them on pcs if you dont watch it but there is the incident called the obscene dog that is just little bit later than incident one and sometimes actually by running it why you can get the pc into incident one the obscene dog this is sort of brass dog in sitting position and any body who got around to the front of the dog got caught in some electronic current and passed through the dog to the dogs rear end and spat out thetans didnt like this so there are very often trick incidents of one kind or another and they could vary from being to being but not everybody has an obscene dog and incident one lies ahead of it any how but there are these incidents now i have given you the length and breadth of what you are working with with regard to this planet and when i tell you that an individual is liable to have an assist i am talking against what he is liable to be manifesting when he needs one hes most likely to be in two the odds are way in favor of his being two or hes most likely to be the victim of clust er but these are merely most likely you still go through the whole process you dont just immediately just hang this round his head because it might be an odd case t hat is wrong do you see now if your pc were to suddenly start to spin when he was doing three he has audited an incident one on one thetan and started an incident two on another one who hasnt had his incident one run if you can get to him in time you have the second thetan run back to the incident one and run it in other words the pc makes mistake then pc idea from solo auditing and so on there ideas of running body thetans are some of the damnedest things i have ever heard of pardon ill amend the statement they are some of the goddamnedst statements i have ever heard of they are weird weird how the hell can they dream up these things there was somebody the other day we found who was putting in r factor and he was going through the entirety of model session and so forth i suppose the guy who has trouble running another thetan at that proximity probably not very horsepowered or something of the sort well all i ever did with body thetan was just think got to the noisethink noisego through it and get your stop off noises zoom hey thats mine he would say im leaving good bye now people very grossly underestimate the number of body thetans there are to run tremendous underestimation many people are too frightened of body thetans they all of sudden say ahhh i will go and attest lets hope nobody finds out they cut their own throats because the later ot sections are booby trapped now the exact way you take person who has skimped on body thetans he is still having lot of trouble and so forth he really didnt finish three just went zoom and cut and ran status happy or somethingis you take the individual and you do standard action for four he says hes he says hes four all right he says hes finished three all right well do it dont argue with this dont keep sending these people back on three dont keep sending them back on three the hell with it he says hes done his four ok if they found none and so forth its sort of my contempt the guys told already that he is just solid in the head you know there is not such thing on this planet as body thetan i mean person who has body thetans body that doesnt have any body thetans is just like trying to tell that cows exist on the planet who have heads the way you do it give him the four run down which youve reason to go into at this moment its very exact run down it has variables that if the case is very special case that hasnt gotten along to well you run the valence shifter early before you do rehabs and you will get along much better but if he has been running along fairly normally fairly normal ta do the valence shifter after the line up thats all that determines it case had thick review folder run the valence shifter early on the case if hes not had any trouble you run it after you have done all the rehabs i mean its as elementary as that it doesnt matter which place you run it but it does matter that every time you do valence shifter you must ive found out very definitely you must do confront the individual goes into his own valence and he cant tolerate it and if you dont also do confront hes liable to practically spin on you in the next few days valence shifter is very powerful process so any way that follows one two its one of these things were you set away with it here or there and its alright and you then you assum that it can be alright but it turns out that the majority have to have confront also run and so it beco mes package valence sh ifter is always followed by confront now you do your standard four rundown you get it fine the guys feeling good hes doing this and that and so on and now you just find any injury chain and you run it particularly this lifetime and you run it as an engram standard engram running just by the book absolutely take him down to the end deal with that engram or chain matter where it goes it will go earlier similar and earlier similar it will go eventually to similar incident that will run youve run each one you see but it didnt run out and so you got an earlier similar incident youve got your date of it your erasure you know just text book completely textbook done deftly swiftly down the line he goes earlier earlier earlier f n whooee i sure feel good ive never felt better well what the hell have you done you have picked up every area where he had hell of an opportunity to get hit in the teeth by body thetans and where there might be cluster and you have shaken one or more body thetans loose in doing this rundown dont be amaze d to have whole bunch of body thetans all of sudden clear out zoom they are liable to go but that isnt inevitable that this happens it is just little bonus now you have got it down and it goes f n now you go find an incident one and you run it and lets try to find another incident one and lets find another one and lets just drain this case of incidents ones you get it lets run as many incident ones as we can well of course each incident one will go f n because its on different being and all of sudden you run out of incident ones starts overrun now here is screamy screwy one you can do overrun on three long fall that reads go and attest oh the auditor who could do something like this or the examiner who accepts something like this it complete idiot it isnt overrun on three it means that one body thetan has been run one too many times or incorrectly run through incident one so you rehab the one body thetan and he blows and the person is not now overrun on three its always the body thetan that is overrun now the pc himself could run himself one too many times through the incident and then having done so he would get an overrun on three it would read but you rehab his running incident one and that does not mean he is all out of body thetans he can find body thetan run incident one on it do you understand so overrun on three is where you can lay an egg you can lay big egg as an auditor because it means overrun on incident one or overrun on incident two by thetan or the pc and that is all it means you can t overrun three now the next action the next action with regard to this sort of thing would naturally be something very complicated and clever and on an examination i just gave you havent yet got the exact mecha nism of how an individual squirrels and you better damn well get it the individual has been audited non standardly therefore he appears to be strange beast on whom non standard on whom standard tech doesnt work person whose supposed to know how to audit has audited the person on standard tech and now the person has not resolved so its wide open invitation to invent technique invent something invent something strange this individual is very pecul iar indeed he doesnt respond along this line now what i am trying to teach you is is that only happens where that standard tech has been followed is false report it hasnt been followed you go back over the case and you will find out that he had missed withholds or he had ptps and its blown down on auditing reports and every other damn thing list listed lists mile long and so on and then somebody is giving you false report the case has just been audited by standard tech i mean so what standard tech has not been followed that is what i am trying to teach you there is case that standard tech does not solve there are people who say they have but havent applied the standard action and you look through the folder and you will find the evidence right in front of your eyes ive got to teach you that and ive told you about four times and you couldnt answe r on an examination so learn it now please that is how squirreling begins do you understand that is how an individual gets an invitation to squirel its the false report oh yes we ran valence shifter and we did this and we did that and we did everything noise case is still going in there going noise anybody told anything like that the look of contempt they would get would be quite withering there might even be beam go with it i would look through the auditing report and look over the pc and i would find out the case had been audited over arc breaks he is one of these seven special cases he hasn t been assessed i mean the guy i mean the guy they did it all bonkers and backwards while telling you they did it all the way that was supposed to be done and then you get an unusual case and the way you solve the case is to do right what has been done wrong that thing youve got to learn because it is your only shield against the invitation to invent something new and strange you understand well alright will you get that down because thats very important point that is how squirreling occurs the case now is strange case well the only thing that is wrong with him is that standard tech has not been done while somebody thinks it has so you have got to find out what standard tech hasnt been done and get it done and he ceases to be strange case right now you follow all right now this is wide open invitation the case im just telling you about thats why im interjecting this im not cross with you there is wide open invitation the barn doors are wide open youve run this engram chain it went f n youve found an incident one you ran it it f ned you found you didnt there wasn t any other you didnt going to come up and say well that was it noise finished it all up noise there he sits you know going noise or some other normal mannerisms you see and he looks at that moment like standard tech has just fallen on its head boy hes got an absce ssed nose or something of the sort well havent got any body thetans now anybody who invents some technologywell scan your body and see if anything reads good he is probably ordering body thetan who cant scan to scan anyhow see scan your body did you scan your body oh yes well nothing read alright you dont have any body thetans booh the guy isnt alright hes got body thetans hes got pictures when he himself is clear plus what he is perfectly unwilling to run anything he hasnt got any more he cant find any more thats it you run the basic track and he cant find any more thats it now one of two things is true he either hasn t run his own incident one or incident two or he hadnt got his own capture straight or he hadnt got something straight with regard to his own track on incident one and incident two nothing else thats him hes got that and remember every body thetan there is answe rs up to that to the pronoun this is read oh alright yes hes talking to the pc everybody body thetan knows hes known as m so either himself has done something kookyhes overrun incident one or he had two incident ones or he didnt run his incident two or he ran capture that belonged to somebody else or he ran an incident two that belonged to somebody else and said that was him or he is actually just when he ran his incident two he was only running copy of some body elses incident you know something goofed up or hes got body thetans one or the other now you can establish this very easily but you dont have to be very bright to establish this you just find an engram chain and you run it by engram by chains and you go find yourself an incident one or an incident two and then you run as many incident ones as you can find to run you got it itsthe same damn phonograph over and over do the sam thing find the severe injury chain run the pc through it get it exactly by the book so forth pongopongo go down the chain that or down the chain you are going to get an f n when you get down to the f n at the bottom of the chain why its f ned great thats it thats finished with the chain good find incident one all right so he finds an incident one and he runs it and then you couldnt it wont run out and then something weird happens so you check it for overrun and you are already running the overrun body thetan you have been running the engram chain out of anyhow so you rehab that body thetan and they blow then find another incident one and in this wise the pc all of sudden starts saying i can do this you say good thank you very much bring him up to proper ending point of the session fly his needle on something and let him go do it do you follow it is always the same phonograph record find severe injury chain track down the severe injury chain until it goes f n by the book try to find an incident one find an incident one run it now i didnt even say the severe injury chain had to read on your meter as long as the pc could see it and go through it but we have already run severe injury chain that was so solid and so late and so impacted with body thetans who wouldnt let any other body thetan ever move that if the needle just flicked time or two in trying to run the engrams but they promptly went solid so he found the earlier incident got its duration and so forth ran it and flick thats about all you get an earlier flick and then all of sudden incident one bd long fall long fall long fall bd fall fall fall smal l fall small fall long fall long fall just running it exactly as an engram and all of suddenwhereit went f n the pc said now wait minute i ran mine whe re did the other come from you will find pcs walking around who are clear and who arent mockin g up pictures any more who have got automatic pictures and it never seems pecu liar to them then they start thinking i must have mocked up machi ne which makes up some pictures and so forth exclamation bull they got fleas colloquial termderogatory term for body thetanthey got fleas thats the routine and that is sort of review assist which gets the guy running who aint got any do you see how its donehow that is done exactly by the book you fly the needle you find the engram chain it all goes f n now you have got the gradients of assists and there they are spread out in front of your face there are not many to know how to do there is not very much to knowing how to do there is great deal to knowing when to do what you have to know when to do what well there is not many choices there either so the net result of all of this is that there are assists to assist somebody to run his grades on solo and there are the other types of assists and they run the gamut from making him touch his head to the door he bumped on through to flying the needle finding an engram chain finding an incident one and the individual gets started again on three got itassessment and listing basics lecture given on 7 october 1968 and this is the seventh of october 1968 and i think the eleventh lecture i want to point out with that caption that the last lectu re was the tenth lecture of three october so nobody will think that there are three or four lectures pulled off the line up here this the amount of material which i can give you on the subject of auditing of course is quite voluminous and it is my job to find out how to codify and communicate to you the material concer ning the mind and spirit and the beingness and the universe in such form that it will be comprehensible and usable the certain communication media abse nce thereof makes this difficult these tapes probably have deterioration of only few years span one has to be alert to this kind of thing and additionally we get the wild enthusiasm of somebody of placing material on the line which is completely additive and has nothing to do with it and sometimes do this and sign my name to it and we have the wild enthusiasm for pulling key material off the line which makes other things then not make any sense and these various things have occurr ed in the past and you right now have several instances of this the major one of these has to do with assessment and nulling and we will go into this immediately and directly assessmen t is an action done from prepared list please for god sakes get that through your skull please please please for god sakes understand what it is because it has messed up thousands of preclears this misco mprehension of what this is all about has messed up preclears all over the world an assessmen t is an action done from prepared list prepared list prepared by the auditor prepared by prepared by somebody else it is not given by the pc it is prepared prepared made up listed by somebody else not the preclear prepared list and that is the action of assessment assessment assessme nt that is the word that goes with that there is other word goes with that assessmen t does not go with anything else but that that is all that assessme nt means it is associated with prepared list only prepared list period there are number of laws and actions which go along with assessment theres an entirely different subject just as different as pulling us the anchor and splicing lines different different subject different different completely completely completely utterly utterly utterly theyre even years apart in development called listing and nulling listing and nulling this is something listed by the pc listed listed by the pc pc says it it is from questions the auditor asks the question the pc then gives him items which the auditor then writes down from the pc thats called listing and nulling listing listing and nulling nulling nullingl listingl not assessment not assessment let give you the background of this now the reason im being emphatic is because its practically killed thousands of pcs the confusion between these two things and theyre two entirely different operations now the laws of listing and nutting do not apply to the laws of assessme nt and the laws of assessme nt have nothing to do with the laws of listing and nulling and i never would have dreame d anybody would have mixed up the two theyve got nothing to do with each other in the em eter book em 24 has to do with assessme nt assessment assessme nt nothing but assessments and that is assessmentnow let not hear in the future that somebody hasnt done it and done it correctly because it is assessme nt and it is done and guys come into the line up and they say that is old fashioned and we dont do it anymore and yik yik yik yap yap yap yaps thats the additive we do do it it is key vital piece of auditing assessment from prepared list emeter book number 24 and theres an exact way to do it and it has nothing to do with listing and nulling nothing nothing nothing to do with listing and nulling there isnt any connection with listing and nulling none there is listing and nulling drill in the emeter book listing and nutting has its own laws theyre on tapes theyve been on tape for years at saint hill but people come along and theyve taken the laws of assessment and they said well in view of the fact we dont list and null them anymore you dont assess i dunno yea yea well actually the law of assess of list and so on is so actually to get something to one item on an s and d you grind out every reading item on the list except one and by doing that thousands of pcs have been arc broken and chopped up so i dont care to think it was unintentional because there is list on the saint hill specia l briefing course that tells you how to list and null and the laws which you had recen tly issued in an hcob 1968 are all there on the saint hill special briefing course and they apply to the subject of listing and nulling listing and nulling the laws of listing and nulling you ask the question of the pc the pc gives you item item item item the auditor writes them down and then he nulls the list and there must only be one item which has any read in it of any kind whatsoever on that list so the pc says dog biscuits roast beef catfish long fall bd the auditor then goes over the list catfish or he goes over it dog biscuit catfish doesnt read doesnt read and then nothing read on the list anything been suppressed on the list so balderdash he extends the list balderdash lemons oranges and he goes back up to the top good biscuits dog biscuits catfish oranges lemons oranges reads lemons reads hes had it there are two items now reading on the list so he puts bar over to the side and he extends the list and the answ er is manhole covers and he gets long fall bd now he goes back over the whole list again clear from the top biscuit dog biscui ts right on down the list nothing reading nothing reading nothing reading nothing reading manhole covers thats the pcs item it reads he gives it to the pc and that is the action of listing and nulling and that is the whole action of listing and nulling and that is the way it is done and it is not done any other way and these two actions are entirely entirely com pletely utterly different but i know somebodys come along and says we dont do that anymore we dont do that old drill and we dont ever assess from prepared lists anymore and so therefore nobody knows how to do it because i know at this moment 1968 that is has not been taught for at least two or three years but they knew how to do s and ds wrong they knew how to do those with three reading items on the list and then wondered why their pcs were arc broken the cases werent getting any better and so forth do you get the enormity of mixing up two entirely different things now look youve got to know youve got to know how to assess prepared list youve go to know this now maybe earlier maybe earlier i could have told you i could have told you this sepa rately and so forth and made it all very plain but how the hell could i predict anybody was going to be complete kook because theres an infinity of errors an infinity of errors can grow up the one line is very narrow one i could give you billions of words of lecture and bulletins trying to predict every error somebodys going to make and we would still get one missed so you have to know what you know and one of the things you have to know is thing called assessment and it is em 24 in the emeter book and it has nothing to do with s and ds nothing to do with remedy bs nothing to do with remedy as those are all listing and nutting actions those havent have theyre comp letely separate its as different as ship and bus completely different im using this as an example at this time to show you what can happen that wrecks workable technology one set of laws that has nothing to do with the subject is applied to the subject the action to which the laws are connected is said to be old hat and not done anymore recen tly it was being brooded about very broadly and widely oh well we never run engrams by chain anymore thats looked on as squirrel action how the hell are you ever going to get an f n on an engram chain how would you ever run engrams on somebody that was way up the bank very very chopped up and charged up you couldnt get him to run single engram because the engrams up in the top you can only go through em couple of times and they go solid so you have to do it by chains and then it goes down the line you finally find the basic and the whole cockeyed thing blowsan d somebody to come along and say thats old hat we dont do that anymore well my answe r to that would be we dont audit you anymore you can go on and fall on your head because its dirty trick it does in every pc whose case is only resolvable by engram running by chains at the level of running engrams the reason you have trouble with cases is the usual hasnt been done the standard hasnt been done hasnt been done hasn t been done we had case here the other day wildest thing you ever heard in your life auditors were doin their nuts going around in circles trying to resolve this case this case was an unusual case fantastic ones oh very difficult cycle bla bla bla bla finally the case went into treason or something of this sort i made it my business to try to find out something about this case and what do you know he was on upper ot sections and he had never run grade in his life never run arc straightwire never run secondaries never run engrams never run zero to four never been on power never run r6ew he was an unsolvable case nobodyd audited him so you get the case who was audited with off beat tech and you get the case who has never been audited on tech and they alike can be failed cases and the solution at once to the two types of caset he one whos been audited on off beat tech and the one who has not been audited at all same solution find out what hasnt been done on the road to standard tech and do it and the case r esolves right now and thats how difficult it is so all you have to know is what is sta ndard tech and then find out what hasnt been done in standard tech and get it done now where tech is violated and where standard tech is violated you have to have repair actions which put them back together again now supposing we have case which has eight hundred and sixty nine lists that have been done in balderdash north slobokum and then they lost his folder anyhow and the auditor who did listed list couldnt write and bunch of things like this you thought didnt have his folder and so on and this case is wrapped around telegraph pole hes in terrible shape how you going to resolve that case we havent got the list to correct maybe you havent even got the auditor who knows how to correct list and an auditor who doesnt know how to list and null and thinks that listing and nutting is assessment and whos all screwed up anyhow he couldnt correct it by list anyway but there is way to correct this case and thats very vital its serious thing to lose somebodys lists but there is way there is way and it contains assessment its an action called assessme nt and the auditor dreams up list of things and he says auditing auditors review sessions scientology dianetics do you see lists and then that is put down in column by the auditor and is assessed over and over until one item is left reading and that is assessment and you all of sudden got staring you in the face lists alright turns out to be lists good it could just as well turn out to be auditing or just as well turn out to be review but it turned out to be lists that is the hot button in this fieldno w that will come close enough to whats wrong with him to solve it and then youve got thing called l1 so you say now on lists and you itsa earlier itsa with false and suppress on any of the reads on the l1 you take up each item in order from the top down on lists boom on lists boom on lists boom and you clean each one and all of sudden the pc goes f n and those old lists wont bother him anymore its absolute magic that you can undo bunch of lists and things like that but it depends on the auditor being able to assess now is this technique of assessment so old hat i dont think so now im going to give you some sort of an idea of an assessment as she is done i will write it down here on the blackboard and sheet can go along with this lecture and this is this business of assessme nt this now is prepared list its prepared list and its something like auditing listing review orgs scientology dianetics grades now the auditor makes that up or the case supervisor makes that up and the auditor he puts it into line up like this and he gives it he gives it of course its date which is eleven ten sixty eight in this case and he puts the pcs name on it which is t j pete and heres the other one all of sudden at saint hill i heard with horror that this was going on theyre doing s and ds over arc breaks and out ruds i couldnt understand it last november ive been trying to unravel this since last november why because people would say well an s and d isnt auditing an s and d isnt auditing you know assessmen t isnt auditing assessmen t isnt auditing it is simp ly trying to locate something to audit and you can assess anybody at any time anywhere and theres session involved assessmen t has nothing but an s and d that is auditing but assessme nt is never auditing you say the word right to the pcs bank bombs bombs bombs you can pick him up i dont care if hes in an arc break i dont care what the hell is wrong with him if your own tas are ok you can just go bang bang bang and you can get the item right out of the pc he doesnt even have to be if hes even doped off you can get the item just take piece of paper its got these items on it take your meter and you say these things to the pc you say the first one like auditing auditors lists reviews out scientology out now weve got one column and weve got two items reading and this is assessment this is assessment it has nothing to do with listing and nulling nothing nothing nothing the pcs ruds we dont care this can be done on street corner if youve got some place to park your emeter now weve got two reading items havent we so we go down here the next time and we find out where this thing is lists scientology we have one reading item left on the list and that is all there is to it and that is assessment aint that difficult but let tell you if you cant do this there are large number of cases you cant crack because there are many types of prepared lists now let us get an entirely different action were asking the pc who done it and this is listing and nulling and its in session and were saying who done it thats not legitimate question im just giving it to you so you wont interiorize into your case while i show it to you sarcasm lot of people listen to with banks so we ask the pc who done it and the pc says joe bill pete the auditor marks it fall toger lige now we go over the thing and we say to the pc joe bill pete second one here with long fall toger bob lige oh brother we have two reading items on the list the list is not comp lete because theres two reading items on the list pete and toger and this is not assessment this is nulling nulling this is not assessment this is nulling and it didnt null and we now know theres two reading items on the list so we know the list isnt complete so we put bar over here and we write extended on this little bar here ext we put and under this we get we say on this question who done it and the pc says bigelow long fall bd as the pc says it so now we go up to the top of this thing and we say joe second x bill second x pete toger out out lige out bigelow long fall bd 21 bigelow is your item thats listing and nulling its an entirely different operation isnt it now you ought to spot whoever told you that the laws of assessment applied to listing and nulling now you see how it can get mucked up look it isnt what i says it is its what works and this operation of listing and nulling if done wrongly if those two items pete and toger are left on the list and you simp ly scrub it out and grind it down so that pete doesnt read and youve got toger left you give the pc that item hell go through his skull boom arc break apathy upset beco angry out of session and very often just finishes with auditing right at that point thats the most arc breaky action is listing and listing is dangerous action for that reason you try not to let green auditors list you try not to let them list when guy has really got it down great they can assess anybody can assess theres nothing to assessme nt do you see the two different actions well theres only one way to do both of them there are additional ways now when you get into 5a running power plus youll find out that its odd but its just shortcut 5a follows the laws of listing but on the subject and the person and the place person place subject on those things on those things its just pecu liar but the first bd is always it the first blow down is it so to save time and because the subject is hot and because this is reliable action all you have to do is grab that bongo and give it to the pc and you know it will be true but its short cut and its just peculiar to 5a and you try to do it on an s and d and youll very often get your throat cut list is incomplete on it so 5a can be done in this shorthanded fashion but nothing else i know of can and its unfortunate because it looks like different set of laws but there are different laws it just happens that is always comes out right if the pc in session now 5a can also blow on just the subject of persons persons long fall bd bong f n you try to go past that and youre gonna rise the tone arm right up through the roof now these are such key subjects with an individual that an individual can beco seriously seriously seriously ill or upset within two or three days after wrong power plus so if the pc comes back couple of days later and hes sick or something like that you know his 5a is out its elementary but now when you put it in again do all the laws of listing and nulling with regard to it do everything he says you get such peculiarity of yeah i thought of an item and he didnt put it down or the auditor he said it and the auditor didnt write it down or something weird went on dont you see its very off beat it was lousy session its not dangerous to do 5a it is just incredible the amount of goof by which it can be done the pcs who get very upset and so forth and theyve had bad listing in their past the best thing to do is to actually get the lists and correct them get the earliest list ever made on the pc and find the right item off of it sometimes youre lucky and you can do this sometimes you can get the list and then you can be an idiot too you can get the first list you can get the item off of it it was suppressed its usua lly the first item or something like that first or the second item and its very suppressed and here we are first s and d he ever had and out of that s and d he gets the collector of taxes or something see that was the item it was never given to him hes had twenty thirty s and ds since then so collector of taxes long fall bd and you got the suppress in on it and so on it was an eighteen page list and this was the second item on the list ooohl odd kind of comm boy was that lousy so anyhow long fall bd you give him his item he says yeah reads reads tears yeah thatch its now go to the next s and d and try to correct that its got the same item except by this time it was suppressed and you stopped putting it on the list every s and d he had from the first s and d he ever had is always the same item now he can get little local locks on this suppressed item and that comes out to be the organization executives or something usually cause by that time hes turned kind of vicious do you see what the hell why would you correct more than the first one now if you were lucky enough to get the first remedy b the fellow ever had and get that on its exact items well remedy b for that command will be that remedy b and that blew and thatch it youre handling real horse power youre handling tremendous horse power see those arent light techniques 1950 you could overrun 1955 you could go on and on you could do various things you cant do those things today the techn ique is too powerful its too fast zing boom bung boom when we got into r212 r212 runs so something minor something minute two minutes three minutes couple of items goes f n and that packs up the whole subject but somebody who had to have all of his intensive would some times get run twenty five hours on something that cleared up in two minutes well it was just at that point at that exact point that we crossed the boundary line from techn ology which could be roughly handled and still come out into technology which if its exactly handled sent your pc flying it was at that pointnow somewhere during that period the confusion here on assessme nt is because of this assessment was something done on what was called the pre have scale by assessing these things and running them you could fix pc up now so he could have something so these old prehave scales something around 1959 60 they became so numerous and so heavy that i developed further technology and collided with the whole subject of listing and nulling let the pc put it down up to that time all the auditor ever did was put it down so now when the pc put it down that was brand new set of rules and you had to know these new rules because they didnt follow these old rules its quite obvious they didnt follow the old rules so on the research line as it came forward you find somewhere around 59 60 61 you find the discus sion is of assessment and then time marches on and later tapes when they talk about listing and nulling are talking about the subject of listing and nutting as i have just differentiated for you in this lecture and they have nothing to do with assessment but assessment was the prerun it was the forerunner and all the laws of listing and nulling had to be learned cause they were entirely different than those of assessment now oddly enough you cant much upset pc by getting the wrong item on his list but wait if the case supervisor or the auditor is hottern pistol and hes looked back through this case heres folder foot and half thick of review sessions given at the bide ahee review center and he looks back through this ohh oh my god and then he sees some clue that the fellow was audited before that in bull isle but he doesnt have any of the laws any of the s and ds that came from that area whats he gonna do you can upset the case and do an over review of review of review of correction of correction to correct the correction and youll get into hell of fire fight with some auditor particularly if the auditor is not very expert trying to get him to correct pile of lists he just keeps plowing it in further he himself hasnt differentiated between assessment or listing and nulling he doesnt know what these actions are if he just clubfootedly goes in and leaves three items reading on the list which you told him to repair but now weve got repair of repair we have actually exceeded the ability of the auditor to correct because he couldnt list and null in the first place now very smart case supervisor he says ok this fellows had lot of auditing of various kinds whatsoever in various places and has pretended to be very tough case and so on the basic thing is that standard tech hasnt been applied here someplace so lets find it out and lets try and correct the case up so hes at least auditable alright so he does list and the list is auditing auditors anything he can think of that might be in connection with this centers franchises you know anything he could think of that might add up to this and he turns it over to an auditor who looks bright looks like he has head he hasnt got two heads god knows and then whats this whats this quote auditor unquote do he even messe s up the little simple job of assessment and he gets the item that isnt the biggest reading item on the list he suppresses t hat he suppresses t hat one the first item on the list still in assessme nt is likely to be the one most missed because you dont have the pcs attention or anything and you havent told him what youre doing maybe or something so he misse s that first one he doesnt nothing hears it he just sort of goes blup but anyway theres rfactor you know you got to tell somebody youre going to assess i usually tell them im going to assess list on you keep quiet my rfactor and i dont want anybody talking on assessme nt it isnt auditing youre just trying wo find something and the more the pc talks the more hes going to screw it up so you want him to shut up so you ask him politely with complete arc to shut up you say im going to do list on you and there is reason for you to say anything i would prefer that you did not if he is prone to be yap yap now you go bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark go up to the top of it again bark bark bark bark go up to the last reading bark bark bark bark bark bark thats the item now i dont care whether you give him the item or not but somebody who is very inexpert and who lets the pc itsa itsamamnfwhfmf and has the pc squirming about and doing other things and doesnt know how to get pc to hold the cans and few things like this you know little outnesses like pcs itsaing about his motherinlaw trying to run ptp while the auditors trying to assess list thats something stupid see you get wrong item all of sudden the pc arc breaks because theres hotter item on the list there is usually on these lists the hottest item and it isnt enough to get the longest fall thats not correct to write down the longest fall its the one thats still in because actually what happens is is you sort of scan him up and down the track and he eventually sticks in the falling area it isnt that things scrub out he will just his mind automatically will park where he has the most interest its method of paralleling the mind so as you go over the reading items why his attention goes zuuu uu now if his attention was on one of these items and you give him another item hell therefore arc break because youve excited bypassed charge on the right item and youve given him the wrong item you try to prep check that or do something with that and he arc breaks further so you can you can goof it up even with an assessment so you have to know how to run an emeter thats elementary you have to know how to run an em eter get the guy to sit still so on ive seen auditors doing their nut because the pc was boiling off or doped off or doped off in an assessment and therefore the assessment isnt valid you know the assessment is valid the assessme nt is valid on an unconscio us person you can actually take an unconscious person if your tone 40s good enough you can assess list and find exactly what it is its the auditor its the auditor the auditor thats the law now the net result of all of this is simply that assessme nt is assessme nt but assessment requires that you do get the right item on the list youre assessing its almost inconceivable that anybody could get the wrong item on this list but it0 actually could be done you could get the pc so hes fighting it so hes suppresses it so he does some things so he you know so you can actually correct one of these assessment lists but that beco mes very idiotic its such simple fast operation that the whole essence of it is getting in there and doing it before the pc finds out and then hell all of sudden start saying wait minute yes of course youve parked him right where the most charge is of course he then has tendency to say i have just remembered that woof woof bluff and itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa wait minute woah woah woah youre not processing him you dont know what the hell hes going to itsa youre going to prep check this thing youre going to do something with this thing you are gonna adapt it to recall question youre gonna run it on list 1 well hes pulling the wrong action on it already so therefore its even stupid to indicate it to the pc i see on some assessments very recen tly as why theyre done wrong i see it indicated to the pc and he agreed that that was true and he told that trotdedot waffle waffle waffle i imagine the pc walked out of session probably good and arc broke because theres an excellent chance that this item has excited bpc by passed charge and so on he dont itsa because youre not running it it isnt an itsa subject he could probably get into severe trouble itsaing because hot subject you wouldnt have chosen it you wouldnt have chose n that list subject if it wasn t hotter than pistol on his case oh theres various things you could do about it hes probably curious about what read on the list and that sort of thing aw yeah give him his item in very unexcited sort of way but its not an auditing action youre trying to find something to run and there very often will be many hours or even day or two intervene between the time you did the assessme nt and the time hes gonna be run on it well youre gonna run something real strong on it and there is good reason to run something real strong on it dont you see now you can say well yes itll f n if it just f nd on itsa whv not just itsa on f n aw bull its key to the case so if its handled with the right process it will unblock the case but yickety yickety yackety yackety bill code doo yackety do do da do dee do do f n yeah its just the same old stupid pc as the other one and we did an assessme nt and we found out that it was auditing and and so forth and he told us about the fact awwawaw he said all auditors are dogs yeah dogs the the all auditors are dogs f n arc break needle yeah we itsad it didnt do anything for the case you see what stupidity can enter in here so you say auditors good thats thanks now were going in to and were going to do this and so forth youre handling it when your pc is in session you might do this before the session began sort of thing or do it after the session ended and it usually is very puzzl ing to some green pc to have one of these assessments done after he has been flown on something youve done undertaken major action major action on the pc fly the needle wham wham wham and then all of sudden you pull out this list you see and you give him list and you just say well yes now you dont have to say anything about this im just going to go over this just to see whats here bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark thank you very much good now to put the end rudiments in why in this session has any charge been missed anything anything you care to say anything fellow says well what was that all about were just trying to trying to see where you were now and youre doing fine thank you very much evaluate evaluate good thank you you dont tell him i am trying to find an item so that we can put it together and audit you on it in the future because youve now continued session and boy that is grave blunder see so its usua lly best to give it to him at the beginning of the session really say good how are the cans how are you today joe bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark thats good thank you very much he says what the hell was that all about do you have an arc break well yeah i was very startled very good thank you good fine thats clean alright do you have ptp yeah what was that all about thats problem well i was just doing an assessment of list trying to get some dope here alright he says great great f n now you go into the auditing action that you were going to go into or just knock the session off youve got the dope now that dope if it adds up right can beco process now it can be done on l4a it can be done on l1 it can be prep checked you can pull number of different gags out of it but those are the major things you can do with it on bla bla has anything been do you see list 1 or prep check see theres various standard actions that are undertaken with this item but the item is hot and you want to get it as good as you can you want to run it right down and get what you can off of it and then get an f n that will stay that way for while now that is the use and value of assessment the use and value of listing and nulling now you may find on saint hill tapes you may find on older tapes that this differentiation has not been made you may find it is missin g in tape line up it may be this and that but certainly i am making it clear to you now therefore you should be aware of somebody pulling something out of line up that he himsel f doesnt understand what the hell it is do you see there can be serious action its actually wrecked i dont know how many cases now i dont say that this is now going to be wrong in the future cause you guys are all going to make that right and you guysll probably for long time been trying to straighten up little points like this and so forth and im giving it to you as horrible example of what can happen the technology that applies to arc breaks is suddenly applied to missed withholds to give you an idea see on missed withhold is it arc u or cd i on an arc break do you have an arc break well yes i do weil what was it all about well i was they were very cross with this morning very good who nearly found out you could get that really screwed up couldnt you now i dont mean to be profane about it but i have talked to many peopie very sweetly and i have taught them how to audit with great kindness and they havent learned in many instances they havent learned so you will forgive my emphaticness funny part of it is in this particular unit at this particular time your auditing picks up about hundred percent every twenty four hours thats very remarkable line of gain now the next action here is there are certain methods of teaching which go on on this course and which should go on on this course and which are exterior actually to the bulletins and so on which must be called definitely to attention and that is that case folders of cases supervised by myself are part of the course actions now power folders were done in another day and another time when we were trying to develop and handle power but they nevertheless greatly assisted people in the case supervision of power and they were totally removed from the course so that nobodyd ever seen or heard of these things for over year and nobody knew how to run power all of sudden so i call to your attention that case folders supervised by myself and case supervision by myself are part of the curriculum of this course and those must be studiedand it is the best part of those the sessions that are well done rather than specializing only in session that are badly done since there can be an absolute infinity of error there is only one single track of well done also auditing at this level is not what you get away with its what you do perfectly we are auditing at different strata different altitude it is what you do perfectly youre total perfectionist we dont care how the pc and you dont care either how the pc came out of the session and said oh i had wonderful session you look through the thing and its something like this do you have an arc break who else has been arc broke with you do you do things to make people arc break with you you look over at the examiners form what wonderful session had won there is thing called propitiation you are perfectionist you are not looking for the result you are looking for the perfect rendition of the technology we dont care how the pc felt afterwards because if it was perfectly administered on standard tech you can with perfect confidence say that you will have achieved perfect result on the pc which is lasting but the rough trs the introduction of squirrelynesses the failures to follow the exact things which are being taught the failure to do you have present time problem thats clean do you have missed withhold plunk we dont care if he did or didnt have present time problem why the hell did the auditor have to go and ask about missed withholds without getting an f n on ptps well you say well of course the pc was stuck in missed withhold thats why it didnt f n naahhh youre an auditor youre auditing from level of class viii what the hell do you mean the guy comes into session with missed withhold my pcs dont theyre not supposed to have missed withholds arc breaks or ptps and if i ask them about it and they tell something it f ns not because i say it f ns because it does trs are in now if this guy is all goofed up and hes got out ruds and hes out of session like screaming crazy and hes running the session running the session i dont have an arc break but i have ptp let tell you my ptp so and so and so and so and so and so of course theres missed withhold mixed up in the thing now what were going to run in the body of the session theres only one reason therere two reasons actually that pc does that but we dont expect one of them to be valid which is the auditors trs are out we expect the auditors trs to be in and perfect but when the auditors trs are indifferently in and pc is out of session and behaves to control the session the answ er is out rudiments out rudiments thats all trs fair see now an auditor with perfect trs could probably audit over the top of out rudiments but thats asking hell of lot so if his trs are fair his control of the session would normally be good and the pcs madly out of session we know that the ruds are out its one of these equals out of session ruds out now the answe r to that from the case supe rvisor is rattatattat fly each rud to floating needle using suppress and false meaning simply that you dont leave one of the buttons unless you get in its itsa earlier itsa to f n on arc breaks and when i say its flunk flunk flunk because he said do you have ptp thats clean thank you very much now you do have missed withhold why didnt ptp fly well its either suppressed or false read if it didnt fly it is either suppressed or false read lets get this level of think thats very extreme level of think isnt it when you ask the pc question and the needle doesnt float then it is either suppressed or false read youve asked the pc question now let put this again very strongly and very exactl youve asked the pc question and it was clean didnt read and it didnt f n then its either suppressed because of false reads or there is suppressed something on it why didnt it f n well thats hell of an extreme way of here we labor and swea t and go through twenty five hour intensives and so forth to finally get an f n and all of sudden ron looks at us here and says we ask the pc question we didnt get an f n theres something wrong with that hey now get this as different viewpoint you ask the pc do you have an arc break and the pc f ned cause he didnt have one now if it didnt f n either hes been told he has had arc breaks when he didnt have or hes told he read on them when he didnt so hes eventually suppressed the whole subject or hes got an arc break that is suppressed or hes got one that reads and hes got one that reads you itsa it find out what it was get your arcu cd ei get the charge off of that and then check it and if it hasn t f ned yet you ask him is it suppressed see ana get the read alright is that false you got it somebody told you you didnt have one i dont care what it is you havent got an f n yet so its an earlier similar earlier similar reads there is such thing as an arc break that reads clean theres arc break to f n needle that does not f n on question look at the extremity of this needle that does not f n on question has either been falsely called sometime or another and has so been suppressed or it is suppressed because it isnt an f n f n is native state i get out of bed in the morning and grab hold of couple of cans and so forth and have dial wide f n why theres neither suppress theres suppress on it im not asking myself anything if i ask myself something on the meter and it stopped f ning i would know there was something there or that it was false or that it had been suppressed or there was an answ er i answe r it and it f ns again you should be auditing pc from an f n wondering why the f n is not continuous rather than trying to sweat it through for the next seventy five hours to possib ly get an f n what the hell are you doing with f ns now i know exactly how good your auditing is and how bad it is i dont have to need anything more than the pc did not come to the next session with an f n thats all i need to know start of session he had to have his ruds put in hes losing some portion of the gain he should get so i look over somebody who is an auditor exclamation point and i know that his pcs are going to start coming to session with f ns very soon and to run major action you have to wreck the f n now if you ask pc who had an f n if he had an arc break perfectly reasonable to do and the f n stopped then youve either got false or suppress see the f n stopped but it didnt read then theres false or suppress so youd have to get in those buttons so now lets go back to this the guy says the guy says do you have ptp clean do you have missed withhold plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk he just passed read thats either false or suppressed hes been called falsely so the guy suppressed the read or something but it doesnt f n he doesnt f n on the subject of missed withholds he doesnt f n on the subject of ptps so its false or suppressed do you get the idea now thats hell of an extreme point from which to audit but thats the kind of case supervision youre getting at this particular stage of the game if you wonder whv youre developing such aeronautic proficiency and such aquatic expertness is because you and are auditing from two different standards and ill tell you how to win in this game you start auditinq from my standard not because i say so but because you will find out that it works pcs that dont f n when they come into session have been roughly audited not roughly taught not roughly handled theyve just been roughly audited pcs whose f ns dont even last to the examiner two minutes later you mean an arc breaks handled and ptps handled and his missed withholds off and good session under his belt and hes just cleaned up some big section of his life and his f n doesnt last from the auditing desk to the examiner balderdash my god mine even lasts doing case supervision on your folders horrible thing to say now so therefore the methods of teach ing include the inspection of these case supervision and anything that is improved or done in any way why case folders and so forth which demonstrate this will be added to the course so that this is definitely part of it now something which is supposed to be taken up something supposed to be taken up by the supervisor and so on to find out where the student is actually weak and its supposed to get him to do it in clay the hes supposed to get him to do it so that he understands it its up to the supervisor to get the fellow clarified on these things not asking bunch of goofy question but get it so that he can actually take look at it because the basic cognition on this stuff is its as simp as shot arrow i mean its just simple its like this assessment it arc breaks because i taught it for years and its been done for years and its very simple action and assessment can be forgotten or somebody cant do assessme nt i wonder why an auditor would leave four items reading on prepared list what good it that to anybody and then show that one was three inches long and one was two inches long i dont care how long they ares what stayed in what stayed in thats the whole clue to the whole thing thats all you ever want to know as case pervisor now i assure you that every one of you without going out of valence in the least are going to be exactly in my boots as i am trying to teach you how to come up the line on standard tech each one of you will be occup ying these two boots youre gonna have the same problems youre gonna get twice as outraged and youll have to be able to do it in such case state that your needle floats through the lot so those are methods of course teaching which i must remark upon students quite normally take up case supervision folders take up case supervision folders in group so that each one of the cases the auditing sessions which got well done definitely taken up why that is well done session now you will see in some of these case folders that instead of being raging beast i actually am not much of raging beast i am more than kind because youll occasionally see little slips i dont say anything about see theyre so tiny and knowing that the auditor was so over strained at that particular point that it would seem too damn petty because it didnt mean anything to the session little points of outadmin you know like he doesnt put the time down for four columns so you cant find out when the hell he did the action in the in the session report because he never put down the time so you know that the action and so forth and then theres time put down on the list when he does the list so you cant find where the list fit into the session see these little things i know youll find not saying much about them but you should move up into that level of perfection now as far as tapes are concer ned and listening to tapes usually the quality is so very very bad on tapes over home recorder machines which you listen to through earphones that this course at least is designed to play the tapes in common hall to the students all at one time but this poses the problem this poses the problem of what about somebody who comes in late on course and therefore you could only give the course every so many weeks or something like this youll find these tapes more or less you can somebody can start listening to these tapes anyplace and you carry it on through but all the tapes should be listened to ive tried to tell you often enough on the tapes so that you dont have to take notes its very embarrassin g thing in an auditing session to have to take out your notes i remember one time back in 1950 when an auditor who was going to audit had to find dianetics the modern science of mental health to find out what the canceler was and opened up my book and read the cancele r as part of session youre supposed to know your data very quickly now the student youll find the cases make out on the course best when students start to audit late on the course the students who are auditing later on the course rather than those who audited once on the course turn in far better session theyve got the data the theory under their belt and theyve normally integrated it so that they can put it together into session without lot of questions popping up so student should audit relatively late on course not early on now when i say late well if he was going to be three weeks on course why about the earliest he ought to do any auditing is after about week and half of very furious study and it would have to be very furious study one is expected to go through the checksheet on this course at least three times i consi der that minimum id consider nine optimum if you knew it by the time that youd hit nine boy youd know it and you wouldnt be worrying about it trying to remember it the only reason you make mistakes is yourre trying to remember something thats about as obvious as can be now the other thing is is we teach auditors not cases and on this course why auditors dont have cases there are cases on the course and that is an old rule but there are cases on course and thats the most remarkable thing ive tried to teach you without teaching you through my case and you should be able to be taught without being taught through your case now the net result of that is is auditors dont have cases every now and then solo auditor gets going about his case or something of this sort well all right but he is also the auditor and he cant have the excuse that he keeps bad admin and doesnt audit because his case is bad he is different thing as solo auditor now the whole subject of this course that you sort out eventually are the relative importances and you should have gotten this long long long long time ago it should have been way way way back when the the final assortment of data is actually in the axioms and you should have learned these long time ago axiom 58 intelligence and judgement are measu red by the ability to evaluate relative importances to lot of people datum in scientology is just about the same as data in buddhism is about the same as drop of water in the ocea n and so on the position of the emeter is an equal importance to the trs of the auditor in other words monotone importances you should know this axiom 58 intelligence and judgement are measured by the ability to evaluate relative importances when you eventually sort out the material youre going through you wont find that there are fifty data that are important but you have to know the rest of them to back it up but there are fifty more less than what is important7 what is important and that is the thing you have to break through somebody came in here on this course askin g questions about heredity well i dont care anything about heredity the russia ns have heredity bysink i think had something to say about it somebody dreamed it up sometime or another but brother it has the relative importance of an ink blot on rock in the south pacific so your data has to be evaluated against other data ive had somebody tell that you could find everything there was in scientology in rrshnamurti well it was hell of an exaggeration so i said now show something and they finally dreamed it up and they said well he said something about time and i said good we also said something about time now show where he said something about time and they showed one sentence which was in whole book and this one little sentence by misinterpretation could be said to be the fact that time exists in this universe but nowhere in there did he give it any relative importance and it was jus t of monotone to every other thing in there so somebody comes up to you and tells you well thats just like the vedic something or other theyve got lot to learn because they dont even know the relative importance amongst the vedic actions there is an important vedic hymn ive forgotten which one it is about the fourth one which gives the cycle of action and it gives actually very very wise little piece of information it defines the cycle of action way back in vedic times and in the entire panorama of vedic materials there isnt anything else but sand thats hell of thing isnt it but there is one was one datum there now the people studying vedic hymns i am sure think theyre all of equal importance there was only one useful datum in the whole line up very valuable datum now where where student has to shake himself loose where he has to get himself squared around is to find out what is important and what is unimportant and when he is able to sort these things out he is then able to do what he has to do he is also able to teach and this is primary job which is done by the student under the heading of methods of teach ing this is something that is up to the student to sort out relative importances until he does so he is just in one horrible maze every drop of water in the ocea n is just like every other drop of water in the ocea n and all those drops of water in the ocean they really dont relate to anything well hes gotta get that stacked up and hes gotta find out what are the important data what are the important data and get those things arranged and arrange those important data without recourse to whether or not they solve his case or not for as student he couldnt care buttons about whether they solve his case or not in the normal course of events they of course will resolve his case but they actually wont solve his case unless they solve all the cases some people like to be individualists and have different types of cases im sorry for those people but we may even invent c s which satisfies their status happy seeki ng we have to run on you now technique st and that is technique of spotting the number of spots on spots its very special process its for very genius people if you did such thing as that it would probably be dishonest but i never let my sense of humor get the better with my case supervision but sometimes when you hear what some people think is missed withhold that even i have heard half around the world this girls busy getting off this missed withhold see well ive known that for years i know one girl that went clear to australia and buried herself in the bush and has never come out towards scientology again because she had withhold that only she knew in company with she never got it off in session but i dont think there was anybody in london didnt know it shes down there busy hiding this withhold that everybody else knows it suddenly strikes you with some pity looking at some extreme action like this that humanism and status and few things like that are put above power decency and freedom but those are the relative importances of the being and he will sort those out as time goes along now i could go on and give you lot of data about this and that and the other thing but i do have some very very important data ive already told you that session control is out ruds and relative importances but i want to tell you something very astonishing something absolutely astonishing and that is the one hand electrode as used in solo auditing can obscure floats to such degree that person overruns himself consis tently and you will find t in auditing of such people you will be amazed and he will be amazed when you say there are four five six eiaht ten times they went clear on the clearing course or something of this sort they went release on it or something and he didnt see any floats well he was handling one hand electrode and it doesnt float furthermore it gives ta lie it can be high or it can be low now if you want to straighten this out for yourself get couple of cans with the alligator clip couple of old tin cans the way those meters are designed against i think its size eight or size ten tin can and they have alligator jaw leadins that clip to those tin cans you take those two cans and you hold them and that meter is calibrated to work in calibrated to react to two tin cans one held in each hand now when person gets up in the ot sections he is insufficiently in contact with all parts of the body to register worth god damn on one hand electrode in many cases you very often will find the one hand elect rode is registering 25 that the needle appears to be relatively loose that this appears to be ok if you were to take at that moment two one hand electrodes you know two two different electrodes which are separated each one held in one hand making two handed connection to the machi ne the needle might be doing float and the ta might be in completely different place now its very amazing how completely erroneous this can be the ta can be at 3 floating on the proper two cans and on one hand elect rode can be at 4 stuck but because it actually is calibrated to be floating on the two hands and is floating and is actually floating any effort to get it down from the stuck 4 is of course an overrun life can be marvelous cant it so those electrodes are best and those electrodes are only reliable which are held one in each hand or which are connected to the two opposite sides of the body now word of warning if you try to hook up an electrode against the skin it very often i mean like under the armpit or some tender portion of the anatomy watch it because it only has seven and half volts going through it but it actually gives sensa tion of burn and can actually burn somebody we do have somebody who tries to handle elect rodes by lashing one to his leg and hes always been thinking he is such marvelous special case because it burns his leg well my god it always burns anybodys leg itd burn your leg too dont think i havent made tests of that character all the way across the line but this latest data here about one hand electrode is result of series of tests which i have taken in order to resolve some materials and some reactions on the higher ot sections of research andim telling you this for the first tlme it isnt that ive withheld it from anybody but that it doesnt float as you go up into higher sections you dont get float anymore and you get the weird action then of an overrun and you put now you as an auditor put the guy into review session and its sort of packed up and its spooky and the needles doing this that or the other thing theres not only false needle but false ta so theres worry about the ta is one of the buttons which you must remember comes about in solo auditing and you have to put into your line up his ta worried about his ta his ta is low or his ta is high hes worried about his ta and it comes up as problem and can act as sufficient problem to operate as any other present time problem operates at case gain every time he goes into session he has this problem with the ta and in one hand electrode he can read up to 6 stuck when he actually will be floating dial wide on two cans now you will see then this mystery of this guy was all worried about his ta and hell be sitting on the meter all of sudden hell have dial wide float while youre auditing him and he tells you hes worried about his ta well that is the mystery of it all is hes got some flooky electrode set up which messe s him up now theres some material in progress on this and this will be resolvable but im just warning you that this condition does exist and that you will run into this condition now the actual actions of auditing on solo level are very often very very very very very badly done incredibly badly done guys go into session they dont put in their ruds the rudiments are out and they try to use the ot section in order to handle their ptp you got it and they then audit over out ruds out ruds audit over out ruds out ruds now you get somebody that cant run an engram cant run anything else and he gets onto ot 3 isnt trained wraps himself around telegraph pole messes himsel f up most horribly one are the difficulties is that he will run an incident 1 on one thetan and turn around and run an incident 2 out of another thetan i sometimes find somebody who says when youre trying to run an incident 1 on him well he has reality on it and so on and yet he claims to have done something with 3 he cant have done anything with 3 unless he ran some incident 1s he can very often run his own incident 1 blow quite few body thetans he doesnt necessar ily have to be on it forever but he certainly had to run incident 1 and he certainly had to run it several times now therefore why didnt he well he doesnt know engram running he cant run engrams and not able to run engrams my god he couldnt run em on pc he couldnt run em much less on himself he hasnt any control of his own bank he therefore is somebody who by reason of training and by reason of charged case did not in actual fact have any business being on the ot sections because his case is too charged up now his case is too charged up because his grades are out it isnt very difficult thing engrams secondaries arc straightwire back it down into that zone hes had drugs they have never been rehabbed something like this and god almighty he hes trying to get through the ot sections well its something like this standard tech rehabs all former releases on any subject and if those things arent rehabbed i dont care whether its done early or late on the case if the persons not actually had arc straightwire run if hes not actually had secondaries run if hes not actually had engrams run all correctly zero the real processes of zero one two three four actual power r6ew fudge to it actually run em his case is too charged his case is too charged up now one of the ways you can tell case is too charged up is he starts to run secondaries or engrams or something like this and he doesnt seem to be able to get much reality on it and he sort of brushes it off but somebody arc breaks him and he goes f n well youre clear thats it weve got you release d now on engrams oh now you try to take him up through the grades kooky things like this have happened but those are violations of standard tech standard tech includes that an f n is not valid f n unless its with gis but you say the thing did f n and he didnt have gis and when i started to run it further it packed up and the ta started up my dear fellow you now have found out that is was real f n so f n with bad indicators so you decide its just an f n with bad indicat ors and im going to do something else with this f n with bad indicators and im going to run it bit further im going to do something else with this all of sudden the f n packs up the ta starts up my god it wasnt an f n with bad indicators meaning an arc broke needle it was valid f n youve had it now of course youre going to have to come off of it and rehab it right away bongo rehab indicate the overrun it goes back to its proper f n hes just sort of sour puss pc in general but he never has nobodys ever seen any gis on him neve r seen any good indicat ors and so on well the trouble with the case is the trouble with the case is it is simply supercha rged its just charged up case the guys just charged up like crazy well theres something wrong and person who has arc broke needles is an overch arged case who is liable to go low ta hes potential low ta case so the resolution of the low ta it was very nece ssary to say that standard tech covered all cases there are several ways to resolve low ta it is resolvable by valence shifting it is resolvable by proper run on ot3 it is even resolvable by prpr6 so i have just pulled the rabbit out of the hat recen tly and ive got low ta cases resolvable at the level of arc straightwire and secondaries and engram running we might as well cure them up there as ny other place so i do pull some rabbits out of the hat every now and then what s resolvable on the upper levels ive made it now resolvable on the lower levels all of which is part of the standard tech which youre being taught alright now the high ta is inevitably and invariably overruns inevitably and invariably but theres hooker on this overrun it might be the profession of somebody that is overrun and you have to find the person hes just one damn too many dentists and you find the dentist who constituted the overrun and the ta blows down the subject of dentistry doesnt go but the subject of dentists does do you follow he doesnt blow down on operation but it blows down on the subject of dentists how would you find such thing well you would normally find such thing very easily by the interesting mechanism that he was pts pts you do an s and d you get big blow down on the thing well he was actually overrun on this subject and that made him pts to it and its all very involved in his head but we dont care how it is so overrun is high ta but it could also be the overrun of the person you can get the phenomena of over showing up on an s and d and youll think maybe pts makes high tas it doesnt ok so you got the high ta you got the low ta and other things with regard to that and your techn ique is pretty straight now you think in my teaching of you that i at this stage of the game that i have beco savage that i have beco brutal that i have become utterably mean i call to your attention that i have taught you kindly and sweet ly before now i wont try to make you wrong by saying you have done it all wrong because the actual fact before i arrange this course to teach you this i did get simplification of communication to try to find out where you might possib ly be snarled up and have done everything i could to unsnarl it so im not trying to make you horribly wrong in everything you have learned im just trying to make you horribly right by getting you to get all the gain there is as n auditor and as case ut of standard tech thank you very much more on basics lecture given on 8 october 1968 the assessments supposed to catch little bit of doubt on it because you couldnt quite read what he thought about it and the other one was c s which was for the birds which wasn t actually germane to the auditing session and so it may be brutal it may be horrible but you are moving right up the line with greater speed than i have ever seen group move up before so i thank you thank you now you will find that when an individual has been trained and trained and trained and trained by various instructors instructors not supervisors but he has been instructed in acad emies and on the class vi course and accs or any other kind of course hes had hes had cycle that he goes through he begins he looks at his basics and he says yeah thats right ok ill do it and then somebody comes along and says well that isnt quite right and he gives him something else and steers him sideways and so he doesnt quite know whether that was right or not but he goes on and does it and he sort of gets away with it and hes not sure and then he goes along little bit further and he runs into contradictory datum or datum that somebody else says is contradictory ill give you an example somebody all of sudden said all the laws of assessment really apply to the laws of listing and nulling and at that moment why every auditor had had it and then somebody came along and said well assessmen t thats old hat we dont do that anymore you want to watch this we dont do that anymore and so this noosed up the laws of listing and nulling and then somebody says well the tape on that is lost or something we dont have that today but you just do it like an assessme nt and then its ssss it doesnt come out right and an auditor wonders what is going on but he somehow or other perseveres and he again doubts his own grip on basics so when we get to the level of class viii and we handle this and class viii is probably simp ler course than an academy course probably simpler the data which is delivered including c s now is so straightforward and so simp that its almost unbelievable its incredible that somebody wouldnt have picked up this data along the track to begin with because it was all there actually this current activity is being taught against great deal of in tech out tech activities but we cant suppose that just because class viii has moved into view that in tech out tech contradictory tech you were not quite right even when you did standard tech will disappear forever from the planet but let assure you that as the organization gets bigger and it does consis tently and continuously that you will get more and more areas and the very multiplicity of it the numbers of areas which exist give you that many more opportunities for things to go wrong and i have noticed consis tently consistently that we seem to run the same time trackt he same things happen an org starts up in keokuk and there is town called keokuk i hope some day there is an org there and if there is why im sorry because it simply up to date has been used as hypothetical area an imaginary area anyway this org starts up in keokuk and its going to probably go through the same convulsions of the dianetic foundation go through the same errors of the fifties go through the same difficulties of the sixties probably get in fire fights with the local council you know this itll have undoubtedly somewhat similar time track to the subject as whole except it will have it in smal l bit youll get somebody an auditor went to keokuk and started up something audited quite few pus and moved out and left them flat on their faces never finished up tour got to keokuk and it picked up the cases that were there but it generated some more interest and then some more pcs were audited and some of those fell on their faces but there was org there to really take care of it finally somebody puts franchise center into the area it goes squirrely somebody comes in and begins to give colonies at the same time their giving intensives and it folds up and then finally why good steady franch ise man gets in there it builds up to an organizational status it begins to hold on it starts taking responsibility for the cases in the ares but this is this planet and this is the planet teegeack and this planet had very sorry history and to get anything started at all on the planet is quite miraculous quite miraculous its great tribute to the tenacity and stickt oivity and carry forwardness of scientologists thats its going forward and it is right now theres some little tiny pipsqueak two bit town right at this moment that is trying to pass local ordinance or something against scientology saying it is so evil it is causing fantastic quantities of distress and the birds who are trying to pass the law of course kill four or five patients week in the local sanitarium by various methods of butchery and nobody pays any attention to that so the planet gives you many contradictions its an incredible its an incredible scene where you find the cowboy in the black hat is in charge and where the bishop has nothing but choir boys in mind and he is looked up to as pillar of the comm unity and they wonder why they seem to be eaten all the time by termites theyre certainly carving into that pillar but he is his own termite man and these things happen you see we wouldnt be at work at all if the planet were in perfect condition now the hard way to start out straighten up of the old galactic confederation would be to start it on the planet teegeack and the people who went through that one could start it up anyplace because this was the one which was hit the hardest this was the place where they were brought so to get it going here is fantastic and that however doesnt excuse us for tolerating less than perfection of pushing forward of keeping it going and so on its lot of workan d the vagaries and wobbles of auditors and the public and that sort of thing dont think theyre going to stop wobbling it wouldnt matter if we were in charge of the whole planetyoud still find file clerk or mr bonkers someplace or another would have started up an i will arise which has as its sole goal slaughter of scientologists or something you know i mean its that kind of planet alright so it is tribute to scientologists that they carry on and they do get their job done but along the line of training you get into you get into areas where people are leaning on this training theyre reevaluating it theyre doing this with it theyre doing that with it and when you get to level eight when you get to level eight its instead of falling on your head and feeling that you are now guilty for practice of out tech from here there and every place you probably are maki ng progress n the realization that you had your basic s in the first place and that those basics were the basics and that they were right there and available and you now probably because youve been through it all probably couldnt be improperly trained against the results and precision which you are learning at class viii i can imagine one of you right this minute somebody rushes in and he says oh well we dont do that anymore i can imagine the lip curl he would get in response hed probably get examined very carefully but you see that subject goes as far as it works and it has been neces sary to develop the technology to develop it along certain research line and to make sure that it worked here there and every place amongst the hottentots and the mohicans amongst the park avenue and mayfair as well as down along the london docks and it had to work and it had to work on each all and every and that meant that you had to have nothing but the common denominators so but there is this difference there are the common denominators to all persons and then there are lot of pecu liarities that each person has which are peculiarly his the c s pays attention to the pecu liarities the more attention he pays to pecul iarities the less success hes going to have its q and its q and with difference the road out is one road the oddities that happen in cases are very often fascinating theres many good laugh along the line thats for sure we get laughs along technical examiner lines we got one the other day that just marvelous the pc the pc walked up to the examiner and says i feel great and the examiners report is i feel great r s laughs magnificent whole model must be contained in just that one little sheet and so you will find that what is out and what is being shoved out of line are basic s theyre just basic things now theres certain basic data which have arisen since the beginning of the research line of course naturally because the search was for the common denominator of all cases this was pretty well wrapped up in 1966 and became very standardized about that time but the standardization of it wasn t too possib to one and all because there were certain people who insisted on being contradictive they you know he wrote that wrong well waaaa and they were either operating out of their own banks or against some unfortunate win there is this thing you know about the unfortunate win the auditor goes in and he takes look at the pc and he says what s the trouble with this pc he thinks h has head and hes so fixed on the idea that he has head so im going to run do you have head do you have head do you have head and this one case out of thousand this guy all of sudden goes feel touch mmmm my god i have head my god im in head wows and he blows off and beco mes exterior now this poor auditor this poor auditor will go through years trying to find another person on whom that process works now unfortunately it is trait that he will do more selling than he will do research and applying and he will start selling the idea that this was great process that it is great process that it ought to be done that all other processes are wrong weve been through all of this in the fifties and it simp ly worked on one two three people and it didnt work on anybody else now there is such thing as some processes being so pistol hot that theyre hardly trustworthy r212 is one of these things you can overrun r212 with just while youre turning over the bulletin its its one of those things and people insist that it seems to produce great deal of result for very long period of time so we have somebody who ran r212 fifteen hundred hours oh wow and it did it practically ran him into the ground he actually probably went release on it in the first three or four minutes of auditing and that was practically that dont you see but the auditor who was green would be adjusting his emeter in those few minutes he would be trying to settle into the session so r212 becomes dangerous in the hands of relatively untrained auditor it becomes dangerous because he hasnt really got his session going yet and he hasnt got himself tuned in and the meter down and he hasnt got his paper you know and hes still sort of looking at the pc and hes still trying to straighten this out and the damn thing has gone release hes setting down and you you know settling down for long haul and it all happened already only he didnt notice it it was t oo quick do you follow now that is one of the dangers youre going to run into with class viii techniques trying to get somebody to do them now whats out with the individual is his basics it isnt any airyfairy nonsense any time you hear of this course being taught on the basis of it is all very airyfairy and you have to be in wawawawa cause it is old and really the basic theory that this is sort of feel you see class viii auditing is really an art it really takes certain type personality any any any variety of this why give the guy the bird would you please because what is inevitably and invariably out is basic s now basic s can go out on long trained auditor by being misunderstood or being contradicted and when he comes back to his basic data and looks at it again now he has choice but to get off his misunderstoods and the contradictions and he gets his data back now there are few data that he wont have heard of perhaps and the subject is an advancing subject and sometimes you have little breakthrough of some kind or another but that would inevitably just be put in bulletin form you discover all of sudden that the thereve been couple of them while ive been teaching this course disco very of the actual liabilities of one hand electrode and its liability because lot of solo auditors have thought oh my god my ta is out of sight i dont know what is wrong with my case and then they get into some weird one because they go down into session in reviews you see and review says your ta is 225 and they say wha t well i dont know something must have happened between here and there i wonder what that was their ta was 225 all the time now if the one hand electrode was constant you could throw the trim check knob of the meter over so that the one hand electrode would read what the two hand electrode should read but unfortunately there werent any meters built at this time which you could trim check to that degree they dont trim check one and one half division of ta thats too wide trim check but there are solutions to this sort of thing you can even do it with one hand electrode providing you had two electrodes standing by and whenever you take your your ta grab the two cans and plug them in to find out what the one hand electrode is telling you wrong but the trouble with the one hand electrode is it usually misses float you see it isnt swea t that activates an emeter it isnt sweat that activates one its current and it is actually being activated by thetan and the thetan is not in ones palm so all youre doing is getting distant reaction from the thetan himself and its liable to miss and the number of floats which you get on one hand electrode and in fact i dont think ive ever seen one not real wide float and yet you swap over to two electrodes my god youre sitting there looking at dial wide float so something like this can come up or bug like this can show up but its usually mecha nical bug now that right at this moment is in the process of solution as to what type of electrode is then usab and there are three or four of them been suggested and we well strap it up so this now that it was very big bug but it never really came forward as blockin g the line the other thing is im teaching this course against the development of 7 and 8 7 is all done ot 7 is all finished it hasnt been written up at the time im giving these lectures there is nothing pecu liar and i might as well make remark on this theres nothing peculiar in either 7 or 8 that violates standard auditing nothing in either one of them violates standard auditing not thing its the very standard tech youre using right this moment carries you right straight through 7 and 8 theres the difference being the targets of the auditing shift but theyre handled handled exactl the same way that you handle any other grade or level do you follow theres difference its just what different basic what different combination what different thing are you looking for its that easy you do perhaps another little assessme nt shee t do you see and then you get that and you run that the same processes same everything its different its different target area then you also get to more and more deal with the being and you are i will give you this word of caution it already exists in bulletin and it should be in your pack as an individual comes up the line he has more and more effect on meter so the further he comes up the line the more likely you are to get read on anything he says or anything he thinks so that you ask him do you have ptp and you get long read and then he says you say that reads he says i wa thats why you have to know false read because what he thought was i dont think so and that fact that he thought this thought of course act hes an electric eel you see anything he thinks cause s an impulse and that is why particularly auditing people who are on the upper levels you have to know this definition of read and its precise definition read is what the meter says what it applies to must be established it may be reading on the auditors question which it usua lly fortunately is or it may be reading simply on reaction to the question which gets you into trouble rather consiste ntly or it is some other influence has entered in to the scene so when meter reads you have to find out what read and if anything even faintly seems to be out about it then you have to find out what it is not to actually identify what the exact read is but you say to the fellow its very simp you say to the fellow do you have present time problem fall you say alright what was that its cautious question see oh he said did that read and you say yes that was read well i dont know i cant think of any read well were you thinking something about the question well yes bong your auditing an electric eel see he he can punch reads into this meter and the higher up the line he goes why the more obvious this beco mes you dont have this trouble with wags you dont have this trouble with grade fours you seldom get it on power you begin to get it in the area of r6ew and you sure as hell get it in the field of clears so you longer can take meter for granted you ask if theres ptp you get read you can even say do you have one he says i dont think i do you say good has anything been suppressed and you get another read and he says yeah well i dont think i have present time problem you see the same read you say good why bug him why bug him to death its obvious that hes reading on i dont have present time problem because every time he says this it reads the same way so there is the thing of establishing what is meter pattern of read now youre getting into pretty skilled area did you it consists of knowing the read you just got knowing what read you just got and then comp aring the next read to it were straining at it here because it isnt really this important its just one of those things that goes by for instance an invalidate will get the same read as the item would get suppress will get the same read as an item that is suppressed youll say has anything been suppressed on this item see on this item has anything been suppressed and youll get read now if you the guy said yeah so and so now if you say the item youll get exactly the same read that you got when you said suppressed its almost curiosa itll be the same length and the same characteristic of read this is not very usable in things but its just that all the auditor knows is that the meter read and i impress upon you that youre not going to have this problem in acad emies you get it with can fiddles but anybody can see can fiddle youre not going to get this problem down in humanoid levels as you move on up the line your guy your pc that youre auditing in review you have to then have some idea of what grade or section of pc you are auditing and you expect this thing to really fly now you can get person who is in the upper sections in less trouble than you can get person who is in the lower grades person who is in the lower grades has to be if anything more precise ly and delicately audited hes in more delicate condition but then the meter work is very is much more precise also so you fly the ruds good do you have present time problem see do you have present time problem woah yooo well youre very quick on the draw you know your metering very well and its do you have woah it read see it didnt give an instant end of the line read do you have present time woom good alright youre auditing somebody clear or above if he immediately tells you he has present time problem why good that was read on present time problem but if he starts saying well let see uhhh you say alright was that false read or what did that read on oh what did that read on as matter of fact i was watching that fly over on the window that cleans the read you say do you have present time problem its now null do you get the idea so that its just that little more complex youre auditing somebody more at cause and you can make somebody very unhappy if you start calling bunch of reads that didnt occur have you got it you must not vary on that and but this liability starts to occur from clea r up particularly so i make that point now those are niceties of auditing theyre nicet ies the probability is youd work it out anyhow but youve got basic the basic datum on meter is is that the auditor knows the meter read the probability is that it read on his question the probability is that it read on his question you dont pay any attention to any oddity unless an oddity occurr ed now whats an oddity an oddity is hmm present time problem hmm and you say well what are you thinking about when i ask you the question very smooth way to approach it oh oh yes i think christ i wish wed get on with it yes you ask somebody do you have present time problem and you get this read and with it comes oh that again now well drilled auditor just flies right into the right into the old slot and he says anybody ever said that you had problem when you didnt have oh yes yes yes its wow wow wow itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa anybody else ever said that or has anybody ever said that to you before you get another read anything earlier oh yeah wow wow wow wow itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa see alright anybody else ever said you had problem when you didnt wow see alright anything earlier earlier similar incident similar time similar time oh yeah well hell its my mother aw its my mother shes always telling why do you have you have so many problems i didnt have any problems foom f n g is well very skilled auditor whos very well trained he goes into this drill just as zzzzzt see very smooth now if he had lot of patter this is the way itd sound do you have present time problem that reads pc i i dont i dont i dont i dont think i do have present time problem good is that false read good that was false read do you have present time problem that reads you get the idea you could get lot of stupid patter out of this so thats why some times when guys ask for patter you know i get little bit cross i say what the hells the matter with your own patter you can talk english the only time i get cross with somebody on patter is when he cant distinguish process from patter so he starts asking processin g questions he isnt trying to clarify read or run anything similar he asks some dumb question which is process well was there anything incomplete about that present time problem oh oh now whats he done the pc inevitably is now going to come up with an arc break which is probably session arc break but in actual sober fact incomplete is one of the species of arc breaks an incomplete action brings about an arc break so he introduces this stupid question he should have said is there an earlier similar problem instead of that he says well is there hes trying to solve this problem the pcs on this problem and it isnt surrendering i dont know what he thinks hes running see is he running grade process or something and oh hes gotta solve this problem you know the pays saying oh i yes i had this horrible problem i have this horrible problem nobody will give any candy sticks you know and so on and its terrible theyve done in and etcetera and so on and yup rok rok rok rok well instead of doing what he supposed to do is there an earlier similar incident see thats your itsa line he says is there anything incomplete about that problem oh my gods he instantly is into the zones and areas of liability immediately hes trying to run processl second he tries to run process god knows where hell shoot the pc l over the track if he asks this question like is there anything incomplete about the problem he really doesnt understand that chain of incidents doesnt tear up until you approach its basic that principle he doesnt understand he doesnt understand the mecha nics of erasure what are the mecha nics of erasure he doesnt dig em so he asks some weird question you got it so that the lack of basic understanding brings him around into squirrely action which then gets him into mess he thinks its terribly important problem this kids standing there the kid is crying the kid has got present time problem so his i dont know his helpfulness or his something or other see just flips his control and he comes out with something stupid like was there any time anybody almost never gave you any candy well that he says lets see im supposed to find an earlier incident yeah that would be earlier yeah eas cand been delivered to you incompletely think of problem of comp arable candy i know im supposed to do something here christ let see what is it you get the idea he whats his basic there are only few of these its the mecha nics of the chain its one of the wildest discoveries anybody ever made but you have to on resistive incidents you have to approach the basic on the chain in order to blow the chain its wild discovery man its first time counts now it works even that way in an engram you get the earliest point of the engram and the rest rolls up like tent very often what you think is resistive engram is simp ly because you didnt get to the beginning of the engram but itll blow up if you get the earlier on the chain so you can make the mistake but it is mistake he didnt get to the beginning of the incident do you see you try to run secondary there the guy is at the moment they burned down the house or whatever it is see and you try to run this and you try to run this and you try to run this and you try to run this and it apparently was erasable but it just kind of stuck up and its difficult to run now an auditor who doesnt know that its the earliest see he hasnt got this datum bang right there at his fingertips as senior datum its the earliest its the earlier its the earliest see works that way on secondary the earlier point in time the earlier incident he doesnt know that see so he just lets the pc grind his guts out youre trying to erase this thing yes well tell again well i went up and they were burning down the house and god let see i felt very griefy lets see i feel very griefy i felt i dont know uh um its getting very confused i dont know whether im there or here wohamjm and the auditor just sits there like bump on the log he doesnt either ask for an earlier part of the incident or ask for anything earlier on the chain well what the basic is out there is he doesnt realize why things erase and if an auditor and particularly class vi i doesnt know the mechanics of erasure hes had it now he has to know the difference between release and an erasure now how is it youre actually scolded scolded scolded for going past f ns you can get shot for going past an f n and then all of sudden you get process it is recall bumbershoots it goes to f n run an engram on bumbershoots oh you went past an f n on bumbershoots right now anybody whod be confused about that is gonna be confused about hell of lot of things we released bumbershoots so that we could take some charge off of bumbershoots because he couldnt get near bumbershoots unless we took charge off of bumbershoots so we disconnect bumbershoots he floats free oh great what was he running locks locks locks locks locks he discha rges the locks dont you see now this is less charge in the incident on bumbershoots so bum bum bum plunge f n great three chee rs youd be very mystified if you didnt know about this cause four days later hes all worried about bumbershoots youd say i release d him on bumbershoots four days ago and here he is coming here and telling all about bumbershoots you get awfully mystified and you could say well gee this auditing i guess doesnt work or something it it it i did all this recall of bumbershoots and god damn here he is in here again yip yap yak yak about bumbershoots huh so you say well alright the process wasn t flat i get it it was an arc broke needle good well run it again recall bumbershoots recall bumbershoots recall bumbershoots ta starts up recall bumbershoots ta higher bumbershoots recall bumbershoots tas higher higher recall bumbershoots ta 425 now his next basic is out he doesnt know that overrun causes high ta he thinks high tas are cause d by toe nails growing too fast or something so he doesnt knock it off he isnt immediately signalled overrun bong ta starts up zoooooom has this process been overrun yes it has booooom f n you get what i mean by knowing basic now thats big basic what is it that causes rising ta its terrific discovery you might at least have the courtesy to remember it and yet in two cases in just the last few days the auditor has just sat there as nice as you please and run the ta right up through the roof and it just never occurr ed to him for minute one auditor took c s he took c s he rehabbed sec checks and rehabbed all drugs and then for reasons best know to the man or beast didnt audit the pc again for two days picked up the c s didnt himself remember he had done it didnt review his former session didnt turn the folder into c s it didnt happen in this group and ran it all over again rehab sec checks and rehab drugs and the ta started up wooooo and he just kept at it he just kept at it man that sessions about half an inch thick he just kept at it he just kept at it trying to rehab the same thing trying to do the same thing and watching the ta go right up up up up up up up up up and didnt do damn thing about it didnt even occur to him oooh i finally belatedly got the folder and i blew my stack cause i couldnt find out what the hell i couldnt find out why is the ta going up on rehab and then i found the earlier session and then i managed to read through the squiggle squiggle writing and i managed to find out oh my god he did the same c s twice so he overran rehab of overruns oh and never for one split second woke up to the fact that he was overrunning something well where the hell were his basic s damned important basic ta goes up because of overrun there is other reason ive seen somebody on power going by this datum which was extant at one time or another that they had to ask one comm and at least the thing blew up on just clearing the subject of prpr4 bong the meter blew up f n gis so forth and the auditor asked one command that is he started to clear the command not only cleared the command but he ran it for an hour and half and the ta was going up and up and up and up and up and he finally came to the conclusion about an hour later that there must be something wrong well the c s on it was elementary it was an unneces sary c s it was simp ly to tell the guy its been overrun and rehab it did it fwmp bong down it goes bang floating needle starts on 5 then theres trouble now what was missing there its grasp of data the datum being that high ta is caused by overrun now ill give you another one low ta and i wont use all the key buttons and associ ation is caused by invalidation and low ta is inevitably and invariably caused by some species of invalidation that is not the button and that is not how you get about it but that is the close enough to it so as not to key everybody in in sight the guys been hit too hard hes been punched too hard and thats low ta and thats all low ta is and low ta isnt anything else i can show you session where guy was having rudiments put in and he runs arc breaks with three suppressives in row he was in somewhat suppressive area and as he clears the arc break the ta goes from 2 down to 17 and it f ns at 2 again and on the next guy now hes f ning at 2 now heres the next bird that hes taking up and he tries to he was taking this up on different process prep check you see and ta he gets onto the next suppressive and oooohhh ta down to 17 to cognite to f n at 2 with gis and then he gets on the next suppressive with another process and it goes aaahhh down to 17 and then he runs it out and pongo back up to 2 gis anybody who is running ta at 15 and getting an f n at 15 ought to have his little britches spanked because his auditing is suppressive in some fashion or another hes over whumping and running into the pc too hard all hed have to do to bring the thing up would just be to fish around is it subject that were trying to thats got you going or is it something that weve done in the session oh see he cant get it up the process hes running its trying to f n at 15 christ what do you do about this well it could be an arc broke needle it could be this it could be that the other thing its just something has run into him with truck thats all if you want to get the ta up why you could ask as crude question as what ran into you like truck wha t have you just been run into with you know or what did that guy bop you with or bop you with crude see you know your basic you know your basic see the tad come up whistle come up into normal range and then some sad sack who is just perpetually down low ta and feels sad about the whole thing all the time and he f ns with bad indicators boy thats missed nomenclature if i ever heard one he f ns with bad indicators thats horrible see you dont f n with bad indicat ors you go arc broke needle yeah but if you keep running the process that youre running the process itself is probably not solving what the guy should be run on or youve forced an item or process on him some action is being too forcefully done or hes being shoved into zone or area which doesnt have anything to do with his case dont you see and or he gets on some subject which makes him very sad indeed and then its not cleared up and the ta goes down youd get an f n at 15 now guy who is run this way gives very interesting aspect he now begins to believe after while that when an f n occurs he feels bad so therefore an f n is bad thing to have actually comp utes it out this way and the remedy of it is just to prep check floating needles of course you advise him of the fact that hes been low ta enough times to prep check floating needle and then all of sudden it reverts and something else happens but its standard remedy prep check floating needle so this this you can get anything out of the road by prep checking it if you dont know what else to do with it prep check it you dont want to run it on l 1 forever you dont want to run l4a forever and after just so many green forms why youll have to rehab green forms someday and so youve got this situation here youve got this situation here that you have to handle something that you dont know how else to handle it prep check it prep check it fascina ting you see well its the old old you say well thats not done anymore im sure that somebody has said within the last year or so before this lectu re certainly im sure somebody has said we dont do that anymore about prep checks in fact i ran into somebody the other day who didnt know what one was its the handiest jim dandiest little piece of stuff you ever had anything to do with if you dont know what the hell to do with it prep check it thats just the rule see now you can endlessly prep check theres two actions you can always do when you dont know what the hell else to do youve run into somebody whos weird off beat god help us nobody ever heard of it before some some auditor has audited this fellow in tub of hot water on the theory that the ta is too high when it is cold and therefore youre gonna run into all kinds of goofinesses dont you see and you say oh my god what do i do about this obviously to wrap pc around telegraph what are we going to do about this theres always something you can do about it you can prep check it on the incident of being run in the tub of water has anything been suppressed the other thing you can do you can always make up list and theres where your imagination can play around and the only rule about list is keep it dimly in the same subject area dont have list that has dental operations and roller skating on it dont write up disassocia ted list your items on the list must be associated and you get your clues for these lists by the way you dont have to pick them out of thin air you look back through folders and find the pcs comments about this that and the other thing and you all of sudden find out they always seem to have little nyik nyak nyak nyak nyak on the subject of of banks or something you all of sudden find this guy is clerk in bank and hes you look over this and you read some of the data out of the line and he seems to have ptps about being brokeand so on and this guy just always seems to have this problemand as css you get tired of this problem theres something about he cant pay for anything and the reason he waaa you say to hell with this ill just give you wild example see when you write up list for assessment dont get the pc to list it because youre doing an s and d type thing and so forth the hell with that do an assessment and you you say to yourself banks banking bank managers bank bosses bank organizations money cash checks coin silver gold copper paper checks customers clients see and you make little list see thats as much as you want to embrace in the matter because all you have to do is get corner of it thats what you dont know about these lists see you only have to come in on the edge of the corner of it and the pcll take it the rest of the way and so you write this up as little list and you assess it perfectly bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark and you get it down to that there it is its checks c hecks there it is alright and you just unwind that now order prep check on checks and the god damndest things happen you ever heard of you move in sideways on this thing dont you see actually it wasnt really checks its ledgers and hell eventually tell you that in the process without disputing checks actually hes been entering checks backwar ds into the ledgers so as to make them come out some other way and hes been balancing his books so that he wont get scolded not to not hes got this hellish withhold on money all the way up the line only you softened it up and youre getting rid of his withholds now the hard way to get withhold is have you ever shot your grandmother you know direct sea check question pow pow pow pow pow pow pow see pound pound pound easy way to get it is find the subject or area of the withhold and prep check it you get the withhold very nicely and smoothly thats just use use of an assessment list use of sea check this has infinite variability what are the basics then the basic s is how do you dream up list how do you assess list and what do you use on the list now theres something else you could use on the same list but you wouldnt go past its f n by using this other thing too you do one thing or another see so youd say on l1 youd say on checks you know has withhold been missed you know you could run the l1 but i assure you that the case has to be in pretty good shape to run an l1 he has to be able to pinpoint things and on somebody whos muggyfuggy on something you are much better off prep checking it you got it it isnt its for lower level case its more generalized subject always requires prep check specific particular things the guy just went through saint hill something like that alright youve got particular little items that you can pick off do you follow lets get zone or area now saint hill doesnt go back several lifetimes you got it doesnt go back several lifetimes it just goes back for short period so therefore its l1 date but checks holy suffering christy lord knows where its gonna go do you see so the more generalized subject or the more generalized or lower grade the case als that isnt similar your prep checks b est now you can add certain buttons to prep check eval inval now if you were to try to do joberg or pull missed withholds on somebody who had low ta i can assure you his tad go out the bottom because youre overwhelming him and you also would probably turn on an r s and then spen d long time trying to pull this r s on some imagined crime an r s does mean crime or it can mean an invalidation it could mean one of two things also dangerously you can clean the r s off case and leave the crime sitting there and not now r sing there is two or three instances of this having actually occurred its very hard to find an actual live thief criminaltype crime dont you see you know somebody who actually took the loot and then you find out later he did take the loot and somebody had cleaned clean ed the r s off the case with invalidate but having cleaned the r s off the case with invalidate then the case this person went around and stole thousand where before theyd only stolen two hundred and the money is found on them both times so there wasnt much excuse you see you can clean it off with invalidate and find out it was crime too so somewhere on down the track to make an r s why there is some kind of crime it doesnt have to be against the subject or area that you think but nevertheless nevertheless if you start to heavily hammer somebody and heavily hammer somebody around you wouldnt be bit surprised if he had low ta now you as class viii should simply say low ta self invalidation low ta this case is being invalidated ta sank in the session pc was invalidated in the session got it ta was at 25 at he session beginning and sank to 12 shoot the auditor you dont need to know what anybody said you dont need to know thing sessi on wound up at 12 what happened you see your basics your basics ta sinking is the guy being overwhumped see or left in the middle of an unfinished cycle of being overwhumded something like that dont you see which would also be an auditor crime but lets say they werent running anything very vital and they start out at the beginning of the session ta 225 you wind up the session ta 15 well you dont even have to think your c s on that you dont even have to think about it it is write it out prep check the last session give it to another auditor have the auditor retrained you dont even have to think boom the guy was either invalidated with bad trs or he was run halfway into something and not run through it the session is false report an arc break needle the idea of gis being in on it is preposterous the guy must have been at least propitiative this is the kind of grip youve got to have on data you see the needle going up see the ta going up needle goes up ta goes up needle goes up ta goes up needle goes up ta goes up did you ever notice that the needle goes up before the ta goes up in the opposite direction buuuup buuup buuuuup zuuup zuuun zuuup and the auditor keeps on doing this boy hang him he doesnt know this datum he wont believe it he thinks theres some other reason for it ta going up is overrun ta going down is invalidation got it make and break open and short simple succinct swee t there are differences there are variables to these things you can appear to have variable because you can run an incident which drives the ta down but the auditor would have had to have goofed like screaming crazy with his trs not to have let it run out and come back up to normal range so he had to find an incident where the ta was down where the ta would go down and then only partially handle this woof it up in some fashion or another and then falsify his report to leave the ta down see it had to be combination of things would happen but you say well alright because this excuse will be given to you oh i dont know yeah well yeah you see we were running an incident on his mother and whenever we mentioned his mother his ta goes down well that may be so would be response but why arent your trs adequate to run the incident all the way through instead of leaving it parked halfway through why didnt you ask for an earlier similar mother laughter in any event its hell of flunk end of session ta 185 pc laughing gis in its either false auditing report or the trs were madly out or the acts anch or points were being pushed in two feet back of his head do you understand now when you get the next session you can do lot with the session you can put in the ruds in or during or before that session you can prep check that session you can do an l1 on that session you can do lot of things with it those are the principle things you would do just the ones i gave you and in the next session it will emerge what did happen you dont have to worry about what happened you just know something wild happened and now if youre interested if youre that interested in grooving in an auditor you can look at the next session which is run by another auditor and find out what the hell happened to that auditor and what should he have straightened out because he certainly needs something straightened out so that all nonstandard results are departures from basic s all non standard results are the departures from basics and that is the moral of my little story now either the guy had his basics the auditor had his basics he studied his basic s somebody moved in on him sideways contradicted the basic he found some other data and so forth now he at that moment got departure from standard results and that departure stemmed immediately from having been moved off his basics r ight so then all nonsta ndard results stem from contradiction or misunderstoods or messed up basics and it never never never stems from the individual not having been super airyfairy in the seventh gallery you see he really didnt have the talent for auditing you see his father was clergyman and his basic training was the challenge and that is why we have not been able to make an auditor out of him if i had acade my d of t telling that i would take out little imaginary violin i carry in my pocket tuck it under my chin take the little bow and i would play the little song it may be so we do not know your story sounds so queer we hate like hell to doubt your word and finish it off yourself he isnt teach ing his students basic s he hasnt said to george aloicious gulch your tr 1 is just about the most stinking tr 1 i have ever seen and i want you to improve it hes told him you see the expression which you use is very important and when you are sitting down looking at the pc be very careful of your expression during tr 1 because the expression is very important that isnt whats important about tr 1 and tr 1 doesnt take anything in it about expression tr 1 says tr 1 doesnt it and thats all it says and thats all hes supposed to do and how he does it is his business you got the basic you got the basic of tr 1 you got the basic of tr 1 thats whats your supposed to do with tr 1 alright you can do tr1 or you cant do tr 1 period now somebody comes in sideways and says the color of your eyes have great deal to do i knew hypnotist one time that says i always handle my patients i bet they were too i always handle my patients on the basis of i say there is something you do not like about what is it can you imagine the fellows social approach going around in the neighborhood anybody he meets he looks at them shakes them by the hand and says there is something you dont like about what is it well you know sooner or later that might become tr 1 thats how far basic can go out do you see i one time the best trs i ever turned out in group of auditors was every time an auditor asked question about tr he was read the tr now that might have cut his comm and it might have arc broken him or it might have this or it might have that but you know they all wound up with terrific trs every time he said well now in tr 1 does one hold ones little pinky up or so forth and all the supervisor was permitted to do was to pick up the shee t of tr 1 and read it now he could also have said more delicately is there anything you dont understand about this bud something you dont dig about this what us it well yeah why do they have that date at the top you know something like that clear it up see but what is it he doesnt understand about it not clarifying evaluating on it do you understand its that level of simp licity the basic is out it isnt because this fellow doesnt know hundred and fifty thousand processes its because he hasnt got enough sense not to ask process when he should be letting the pc itsa the simplicity you are finding right at this line right at this time the simp licity is fantastic im sure that you are getting your hands on some of you still perhaps little nervous the finger shakes little bit the pencil i noticed quivers slightly on the page here and there but these are the things which have been out in this particular unit it isnt what would be out in another unit but theyd be things comparable to this these are the things which have been out there arent any airyfairy things your comprehension of this that and the other thing is great assessing you should have learned that in the academy youve got your cast iron nerves not knowing how to assess its em 24 of the emeter book it hasnt changed for years sow to run an engram r3r wrapped up engram running for all time there hasnt been any shift of any kind in r3r engram running engram running by chains there hasnt been any shift in it change in it for years and years and years anybody whose been through dianetic course and has gotten himself piece of data that is cockeyed or upside down or somebody told him we dont do that anymore if somebody said we dont do that anymore he would fix it up so that you really couldnt shoot anybody up through ot8 thats for sure he would be stopped so guys got i dont know how the hell youd ever heal anybody how would you ever make anybody well if you couldnt run an engram by chains i dont know how you have alright so therefore i can tell you positively that not knowing this cold then this is whats happened youve cleaned up filches lumbosis on tuesday and hes had it back again on thursday and you have been damn puzzle d well if you go on keying out this lumbosis its just key out lumbosis is just sitting there all youve done is shift his attention you have improved it to some degree it might never come back again it might come back gain while hes walking to the examiner but all youve done with this lumbosis is to key it out so whats key out you have to know what that is any time you just key something out you pays your money and you takes your chance boy its liable to be back in the next minute its liable not to be back for hundred years but itll be back why because the basic impulse to manufacture the picture is still there and at the least whiff this guys gonna make the picture all over again because you havent hit its its something he wont confronts he hasnt owned its he got rid of its and youre sort of parking dirty laundry over in the corner to be picked up some day and some day hes gonna run something and all the dirty laundry will disappear as he goes up through the ot chains see but nevertheless this guy comes in with lumbosis you say good who in your family had lumbosis well you see thats an interesting question who the hell did have it oh my god my uncle timothy do you remember time with your uncle timothy complaining about lumbosis yep oop what the hell my lumbosis disappeared you say good thats it but hold your breath boy if you were to say just one more sentence or send them to an examiner who is complete knuckle headed idiot and the examiner knows the guys an idiot and he comes up and the examiner says to him how are you zilch how are you hows your lumbosis zilch god almighty jesus christ thats why youve got to shoot examiners who do anything but shell out piece of paper as matter of fact its probably the safest system is to have booth with nobody in it examiners can evaluate with look you know you again you know that sort of what the hell is wrong with you sort of look you know maybe the guys just got headache or something aaiuh guy says what the hell i must look like him you got it alright now thats very slippery straight wire wing bing wow wow technique that i just gave you there its as old as 1950 and it works like bomb on an awful lot of cases i have seen i have seen an entire scaled face completely scaled and scabbed go completely clean and clear in some two or three minutes its impossible yet it happens key out bong gone but when is it going to come back now we run engrams by chains rat tat tat ta bow ta boo bow dee actually if any guys chronically ill any engram chair you find or any really any secondary chain youll find on girl or something like that has got the illness on it you dont have to say lets see what engram chain would i find to find leg injury i think we had better run leg injury chain bull youre liable to get him into the wrong chain you just run the most available chain of engrams and of course he is stuck in the most available chain of engrams and if you know your basics the engram he is stuck in is the engram he is in which is the engram which is giving him the trouble hes having naturally so if you look any place for the engram than the available engram that hes in youre gonna run out something else and now hes got lumbosis and trumbosis and pneumonia into the bargain so its always the most available secondary the most available engram this guy has tough time in life youre gonna run secondaries this guy is angry lot of the time youre gonna run secondaries thats the most available thing but you just run the engram chain now he can walk up to the examiner what the hell happened he says it all disappeared it blew something pft it blew hey pain in my backs gone hey what do you know where the hells my arthritis yeah gone hey wowing see now he walks out to the examiner and the examiner says oh yeah joe had your lumbosis and so forth and he says hows yours and walks out now youve erased the impulse to make the chain of lumbosis by erasing the engram that the impulse was maki ng and it aint never gonna come back more he can get sick from something else do you follow so i can tell you very definitely the pc whose mannerisms do not chan ge has never had an engram chain run on him well his mannerisms come from the engram chain hes sitting in so i watch these pcs that always go ck ck ck and i see them four years later theyve been audited eighteen thousand hours in some place or another and they go ck ck ck and it made big mystery for i wondered what in the name of god is this all about and then i find out that people have been saying for some years oh engram by chains person who does that is sort of squirrely we dont do that anymore you get the difference between release release is hes not going to do it now its out but the basic guts of the thing is what you erase man and an erasure is an erasure somebody the other day in this unit obviously didnt know what the hell it is im talking about right now even though it was on an earlier lecture because he said after he erased the damndest series of engrams in the pc then he wrote on his report he sure looked keyed out oh thats pathetic you might not get the joke but if hed erased the engrams he couldnt be keyed out because there was nothing left to key out and theres nothing left to key in so why would you say he looked keyed out do you follow and of course the understanding of the mechanism of clearing and other such mecha nisms must be very very poor the mecha nism of clearing is simp ly that when youve erased the basic the guy realizes hes mocking it all up then he doesnt mock up any more of those things which he knew he was mocking up its horrible shock to him to find out little bit later that hes got some pieces of him parked over there that he didnt know and hed disowned and he didnt have anything to do with anymore he blows em awful fast but thats what you clean up as you go up from there now guy at clear he feels wonderful why does he key in hes still got body thetans hes still got this and that so you take it apart take it apart take it apart take it apart and just today in research i was punching around to find out exactly how you restore total recall on the total track and so forth which is one of the functions of 8 and found out how you did it on somebody who didnt know how to do it somebody who didnt have it what did you have for breakfast in 1325 b c whole track recall whole track recall the same reality level as you recall this lifetime well opened the door to that one anyway now the rest id like to tell you here is basic s such as how to run an emeter people having emeter trouble what anybodys got nerve having em eter trouble not in this line of country but somebody mus t have moved it in sideways and invalidated metering pushed metering around got to worrying about metering whats metering this way and that way got to doing something wrong with meter and then didnt couldnt put it right again and there was some misunderstood about it something like that but of all things how to list and null that is killer abso lute killer if you dont know that youd knock pc flatter n flounder if you dont know how to list and null exactly right its an exact precision drill you could make mistakes in assessments or from prepared list in prep checks you can make all kinds of mistakes dont you ever dare make mistake in listing and nulling and therefore you dont often order them i look through few folders its pathetic s and d s and d s and d remedy b remedy b have an s and d an s and d and an s and d have w s and u type s and d ah bull its risky action and you only do it when youve really got it set up straight and right i was horrified the other day i had not i had ordered specifically itsa on the green form whole itsa on the green form only itsa similar itsa on the green form guy got to environment and did s and d he did remedy b rather he did an environmental remedy b if id wanted an environmental remedy b at that point i would have said so as c s bov and you know why i didnt say so it was because that damnea review folder was about half foot thick with them we didnt need any more lists on this case thank you so it was itsa earlier similar itsa i ought to give you drill some time its drill you can give somebody run this whole damn case with list 1 itsa similar itsa with subject run the whole case with list 1 itsa similar itsa earlier itsa with subject to f n this is an elementary drill thatd make citizen out of him now you want to know how to run green form how do you run green form how do you phrase the phrases of the preen form oh bull im not trying to make player piano out of you the green form contains whole lot of subject matter and you could do it all with itsa earlier similar itsa the whole green form your trs somebody had disturbed your trs one way or the other to point where you were contradicted and upset about them and so forth and how to really get in ruds that nobody had ever learned nor the conseq uences of auditing with ruds out and i find with horror that youve been doing solo auditing with your ruds out i dont know how the hell you ever made it and oddly enough what the mind consis ts of exactly what is in the mind what is this thing called the mind its such an elementary gimmick that not to understand it is something like explain to the sidewalk it s very elementary there isnt very much in the mind but guy is thinking about the mind with mind and as he can make many comp lexities on the subject and man has managed to for all the trillenia and the reason he has made these mistakes the whole trillenia is simp ly that mind is mind and people have made lot of business out of muckin g up minds and it seems to be the one thing that you can muck up and they apparently could get further for their own purposes mucking up minds they thought until somebody got around to muckin g up their mind theyre not good at straightening up minds and nobody ever issued anybody an instruction manual with the mind and nobody ever issued an instruction manual with body so that one is prone to make mistakes but these things were not understood and just to give you just little rundown of the various things how to run engrams and secondaries how to run an emeter how to do assessment how to list and null trs how to really get in the ruds and what the mind consis ts of those are the outnesses in this unit now there isnt single damned airyfairy anything anywhere there is there so you had to know that you had once known it and had to get it clean ed up and had to get your misunderstood and contradiction straightened out so that you could get it in and play it on the piano and you obviously are playing it on the piano and this lecture youll probably all be thumbs again the main trouble with c sing so far has been c sing from stuck opinions and wishing off ones own case on somebody else well i think this pc must have lot of trouble with train accidents you look back in the guys folder and he has trouble with train accidents not the pc now one thing i wish that you would get used to doing get used to doing is this is an administrative action which can be done by c s or it can be done by an auditor or it can be done in qual or in tech division but whoever does it it should be done and if it isnt done somebody damn well should do it and that is keep tally of all of the c s actions taken and executed in the beginning of folder over on the left hand shee t so that you know everything thats been done now this can get pretty damn corny c s is in order fly each rud to f n somebody did it the other day took break for supper and came back and flew his rud to f n and it shot the ta up to 425 so it can be forgotten within half an hour well think of what happens if its left for six months somebodys had valence shifter well it should be over there hes had that you try to give him another one and youve had it hes had his s and ds hes had an s and du hes had an s and d this you can look it over and you can see what s and d he hasnt had you could give him that one do you follow so its highly precise action if you dont want to overrun cases why you dont run things on them again that have been run so some kind of tally of what has been run on case should be placed in the folder very visible and should be kept up to date as fast as it is run shouldnt be left behind and that way itll keep him from maki ng mistakes see there were two instances two cases smashe d up not here but two cases were smash ed up very badly because when the session was finished the auditor didnt note down anything on he comp leted those actions on review tallies and he came right back to session and did them again complete idiot wrecked the cases smashed em boy alright so the general point which ive been trying to drive home which i think anyone whose been at this any length of time at all is getting wise to is he doesnt have to know hundred thousand combinations of something he only has to know what he knows very well and the basic elements with which he is dealing must be tightly grasped and used and there arent whole bunch of variables that run in from the side there is this game has narrowed down to where you all of sudden dont get new rule for the game every time you try to play it youre playing cards the fellow says oh red cards theyre not valid now youve just gotten yourself fifteen red cards its not that kind of game youre playing these things are stable and if you dont believe they are stable why look around at the results you are getting look around at the results being gotten on your own case and on the cases of others and i think you will agree that standard tech is highly workable tech and it is as workable as it is standard and kept standard and that is the secret of it the standardness of its administration and so on and its getting there its going like bomb and im sure that you agree that it is thank you very much ethics and case supervision lecture given on 9 october 1968 well this is what number lecture thirteen ah and the date nine oct ad 18 i would like to put warning on the tape he said in sepulchral voice thats great word sepulchral you ever hear that word it means from sepulchre tomb on this chee rful note we begin this lecture that if you have something in affluence you apply the affluence formula if you have something in power you apply the power formula if you have something in emergency you apply the emergency formula and if you dont do this you fall on your heads it just happens to be in the general nature of things that you fall on your silly ead now i have seen division go into affluence be assigned affluence and then slack off and chan ge everything and its fall is so free fall that it is practically rocket assist it goes down the conditions with velocity the like of which you never saw it is the most fantastic phenomena youve ever cared to see in your life there are two things you can do with regard to formulas and conditions two things one is to assig n the wrong condition well hes been good to us so were gonna assig n pete power and pete hell he couldnt make emergency if he had one of these firemans step ladders so we assign pete power now the law there and its an operating law is that he will drop one condition below the condition he is actually in let us say he is really in nonexistence but some manager some secretary some executive secretary wants to be good fellow or gets into propitiation or something see so they give oscarvitch condition of affluence cause they want to increase his pay or something you know they dont really know what the hell hes doing hes been sort of wandering around stumbling on his head hes really in nonexistence he doesnt even come to work but hes an awfully good fellow an awfully good fellow holds his liquor free and easy with his girlfriends something something hes really in nonexistence all you have to do is to assign him wrong upper condition and he promptly drops one below where he actually is hes in nonexistence really we assig n him affluence he goes into liability he now is operating in liability in actual fact you will now find out he is operating in liability very remarkable let us take the affluence formula on just one point and apply it to nation one point economize the funny thing about affluence is is if you dont economize youve had it you get in sudden influx of this that and the other thing its usually lot of and the tendency is and the reason why people fall on their heads when they go into affluence is they suddenly spen d it all and interrupt the operation by which they got it in or by which they made it see and at that moment whatever actual condition they are in will lower one condition so we apply economy to firm which at best in danger condition firm is really in danger condition so we start economizing thats part of the affluence formula the firm will at once go into nonexistence let us say government is in danger condition its in danger condition because the head of the government has to bypass all of his ministers to get anything done he has to bypass all of his ministers or is bypassing all of his ministers he isnt really applying the danger formula but hes certainly bypassin g in all directions frantically trying to get something done and so he enjoins economy he says hes not going to chan ge any of his ministries he says hes going to stand by his friends that hes bypassin g like mad he says our program must go on to victory while its already falling on its stupid head you can expect that government not only to go into non existence but that country to pass into other hands not other political hands but other racial hands it works it is true now the reverse occurs the reverse occurs but its just under the same formula guy is actually in emergency and you put him in liability and hell go into danger condition if the formulas of the wrong condition are then enforced he might even drop one or two more down below where he is and he might actually arrive in liability do you follow because the longer the wrong condition is perpetuated the more it drops it certainly drops one but now if we dont let the condition upgrade if we dont do something about it if the condition is now perpetuated and so on he will drop another condition and another condition and another condition so the assig nment of wrong conditions brings about lowering of condition there is way you can assig n wrong condition and get an improvement of conditions so therefore you have to know something about the assignment of conditions now even my messenger proper assignment of conditions little bit earlier i had to go out and show messen ger how to turn on very complicated switch board that she actually should have been checked out on some time ago and i went around i told her to do it she couldnt do it i went out and did it shed already been little bit slow and draggy for the last hour or so and i said what condition should you assign yourself and she thought it over very carefully and she said quite accurately danger condition i had had to bypass h er to do the job now if my messengers know this and they are very young indeed this life of course the one thing they do find out about in the sea org is conditions they find that out very accurately but actually they often err in the direction of more severe condition than it warrants and youll actually pull it down one from the condition it is in so anyway if my messengers know it why you educa ted cats h ad certainly better grab the brass rang if youre assigned wrong condition you are grossly flagrantly illegally in error you will have accepted an illegal order and you could be comme ved for it ill show you how bad it is somebody assigns you condition of liability you accept the condition of liability you beco liability if youre not in liability somebody assigns you condition of liability you do not at once ask for an ethics hearing you at that moment could be comme ved for accepting an illegal order let us say you were only in emergency and somebody assigns you liability and you do not now ask for an ethics hearing for correction of condition and prepare your brief and show exactly what youre doing exactly where you really are you now are liability because you have assiste d in the destruction of the ethics system and you could be comme ved for it because its an illegal order you go around tamely accepting conditions which are incorrectly assigned without then asking for an ethics hearing to correct the condition you then could be com ved yeah but how about the fellow who assigned the condition natu rally its his fault hes cause his fault his fault his fault im afraid not maybe it seeme d that thats the way it was he wasn t in possession of all the facts hes trying to get the job done something of that sort yes he could be called into it but once you start comm eving people for assigning conditions the whole justice sys tem blows up the responsibility is on the receiver of the condition now if you dont get that enforced in orgs and if you dont get that enforced amongst auditors ill give you an idea youre c s youre top dog on the totem pole in your area as class vi ii so somebody goofs the floof but good you assig n him condition of emergency he just practically destroyed pc he didnt do your c s hes been going around saying to the other auditors nya nya nya and all those directions i get when i nya nya nya and you assign him condition of emergency and he actually is in doubt you assign him emergency because you want to be good fellow hes actually in doubt hell become an enemy its the wildest mechanism you ever saw in your life hell drop one hell drop one below the actual condition assigned now reversely this character makes small mistake on his administrative form as he hands it in he displaces couple of comm as hes assigned condition of enemy he doesnt at that moment ask for an ethics hearing you comme v him for accepting an illegal assignment of condition do you follow now you wont be the one probably who assig ns him enemy somebody else assig ns him enemy he doesnt protest youre the top dog on the totem pole you sea misa pplication of ethics comme v him for accepting wrong ethics dition and people are liable to get the word do you see he says my gods life is really tough already been assigned enemy and now im going to be comm eved for accepting the order lets see let figure this out now oh if you accept condition why you get comme ved i get lt yeah well brother if hes that stupid he is an enemy laughter but what you want to do in an ethics hearing an ethics hearing isnt just the guy appears and fluf you do an ethics hearing by the book an ethics hearing in this particular instance must be an actual assortment of what the guy actually is doing so as to establish the actual condition that he is in now you can have somebody chap lains very often mess up the lines in an effort to cheer up things and keep people from falling off the org board they sometimes ask for an upgrade of conditions which should be down graded somebody assigns this person condition of nonexistence and this person gets very upset this person has just goofed the floof across the boards hes guilty of moprey and doprey on the high seas he actually overworked about sixteen seniors and busted up lot of stuff in the bargain he was only assigned nonexistence its obviously wrong condition so he nya nya nya nya nya then somebody comes along and they say look he is nattering so the best thing to do is assign him emergency now he really goofs the floof now hell go around the bend correct assignment in this particular instance was liability now supposing the fellow did all this and then lied about it and made it impossible for anybody to find it out man his effort of getting the show on the road is so dim and so thin that he obviously is in doubt in the first place person who lies to you doubts your perspicuity perspicuitv is smart word for awareness he must think youre stupid some people are so stupid that they can lie about such thing that is so obvious and you have to safeguard yourself against false auditors reportbut let us say that the person looked like he submitted false report and you assigned him liability or something like this and he actually had not submitted false report and he knows this and he accepts the condition he can now be commeved for having accepted condition for false report when none existed because he will now go around and natter and splatter and so forth so as it appears on the surface you assign the condition as it looks if the condition is wrong the condition should be protested to the degree of asking for an ethics hearing if the condition is wrong and ethics hearlng is asked for you should comme v the guy because sometimes this mechanism occurs you say this was false auditing report therefore im assig ning you liability or something out in an org it would be more germane and the guy accepts it and he goes around in apathy he didnt come in and tell you hey hey hey thats not false report thats correct report hes now doubly loused up your lines there are instances of fellows under duress and accused of murder who then just out of savageness and protest fully admit to the whole murder get themsel ves hanged just to make somebody good and wrong this mecha nism exists now you in c sing will have to assign some conditions sooner or later if you do not assign conditions the whirlwind will catch up with you you can sit there like good little fellow and do your job jolly jolly jolly and stay friends with everybody good arc good arc good arc and all of sudden find world of hate dumped on your head its the most remarkable phenomenon you ever heard of cause youre just perpetually assigning the wrong condition you think him auditors friend of yours who doesnt even bother to study his trs to point where he chops the living screaming god out of pc turns you in false auditing report sells everybody on the idea of how you stink as c s because he goes around and says he followed your c s exactly and look what happened you let something like that exist and every bit of good that you can do in the fieid will be destroyed its alrignt to be in full arc and little friends little brother to all the wild its ok until it gets in your road until it gets in your road you operate not on the formula of the greatest good for and him you better stop operating in this narrow restricted area and start operating in the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics and then youll win do you know that you can be looked upon with contempt if you fail to get ethics in in your area when everything is going wrong people begin to think something is wrong with you they begin to think theres youve got something to hide they wonder what people have got on you one time there was neglected area i hadnt paid any attention to it at all i knew if anything blew up in the area i had lot of things to do and i knew if anything blew up in this particular area i could handle it anyhow and i wasn t paying any attention to it i had hundred and fifty items on the plate at the moment and apparently somebody in that area got away with moider and they were getting away with murder and some other people noticed they were getting away with murder and i wasn t paying any attention to this area at all and all of sudden somebody wrote very circuitous covert note does so and so have something on you they thought this individual must be under some special protection they didnt notice that the individual was so far removed from my post as not to be noticed but thats the sort of thing thatll develop people begin to wonderthey know very often more about the actions of people than you do they know that josey ann has just got through goofing the floof they have continued to watch josey anns pcs stumble out of the auditing room and fall on their faces and be carried off in stretchers to the local hospital and you all of sudden assign josey ann and condition of power on the basis of bunch of false auditing reports and not even the examiner dared go against josey ann because they figured josey ann had something on you weird weird situations can occur this is an aberrated planet and aberrated things happen so therefore the ethics presence of class viii and the ethics presence of case supervisor must be beyond reproach must be accurately carried forward and must be established now as you first establish an ethics presence you establish it hard after while you can be careless about it but you have to establish an ethics presence hard otherwise youre just gonna be wrapped around telegraph pole youre gonna be worked to death cases are gonna start falling on their heads you dont know whether youre going or coming you say what s going wrong what s going wrong well you must better look back to about seven or eight days ago when they carted that pc off to the local horse piddle and you didnt assig n that auditor enemy auditor submitted you false report the auditor didnt like the person vividly and took that as an opportunity to cut the person to ribbons things like this happen its an aberrated planet and you didnt do anything about it well youre very unlucky if you also didnt find out about it see because whether you found out about it or not has nothing to do with whether or not you will accurately do it so when youre doing c s you mustnt talk to the auditor you mustnt talk to the pc youre actually at the mercy really of false auditing report and youre at the mercy of false examiner if you run into this situation too hard and too bad you establish your examination line on routing form you establish the regular routing the regular examination report but in an organization theyre usually routed directly through to the registrar so you get second registrar report why theyre not going to sign up so then youve got an auditors report an examiners report and registrars report if youre suspicious about it why put it on the back burner just as note over on the side of your desk but youre gonna ask the ethics officer in couple of weeks about this pc ethics records ok right now but in couple of weeks were gonna ask the ethics officer about this person see were not sure seems alright everybody reassures us that its ok but its just something were little doubtful of write his name on piece of paper see ethics officer and put time machi ne date on it now you could even in an org which is well run send it to time machine with two week date on it so itll fall off the time machine to be sent to the ethics officer in exactly two weeks please give report on josey ann bates sneaky thing to do isnt it josey ann bates up to that moment they have record in the org shes done nothing bad particularly that we can see but it just doesnt seem alright to us and people are reassuring us that this is alright and shes been audited in squirrely fashion and she came from some famous squirrel group were not trying to catch her were trying to catch out tech so we say i dont i dont it doesnt really seem reasonable to that all this is all ok because look shes been back in review here now three times we seem to each time fix it up but somehow or other it doesnt get fixed up and we are applying standard tech according to the auditors report but for some reason or other it doesnt respond in standard fashion now the reason for that is false auditing report now you want an auditor you want auditors in frame of mind that before they will write false report they would lie awak all night shaking with terror you dont want any false reports that you should make very clear do you see the goof might get liability but false auditing report christ knows what youre going to assign for that do you see then you can protect it then you can do your job now im merely talking to you from viewpoint of doing job of work every now and then we see some crime come through the lines now it seems to be very very bad thing to take an auditing report and turn it over to ethics but the funny part of it is is ive caug ht two or three supervisors and five or six auditors way back which has adequately explained to why there is certain zone or area why it is having hell of time now were putting in lot of management let us say in that zone or area we try to manage that area were trying to manage that area were trying to smooth it out were trying to straighten it out were trying to handle it and so forth well theres another zone and area and that is that its tech is out and somebody keeps its tech pushed out and its tech is very hard out it is very out indeed now let teach you something about tech in relationship to ethics although we say this when admin goes out tech goes out tech goes out ethics has gone out the truth of the matter is there is tech ahead of that ethics so its actually when tech goes out ethics goes it becomes neces sary and if it isnt put in then tech goes further out and then admin goes out like screaming crazy so when you find an area or an auditor where admin is thoroughly out you know right up the line from that just one step back of it that tech is outtheres something he doesnt know about tech or theres something techw ise mucked up on his case or hes doing something weird with tech or he hasnt got the word in some fashion or another and then right ahead of that you know that he has out ethics and then you oddly enough trace it back little bit further and you will find that tech was out see its actually four point cycle not just three it is very true it is very true that when admin is out tech is out when tech is out ethics is out do you understand but it backs up one more tech had to be out in the first place so where tech goes badly out heres another maxim here and its an important rule when tech goes out ethics goes in heavily and hard now i havent said you must put ethics in heavily and hard or that you should or anything im just telling you its phenomenon this is phenomenon like when the sun comes up you can see the mountains see theres more significance to it than that when tech goes out ethics goes in hard so any area where you find ethics going in hard you know tech has already gone out and then if ethics doesnt go in hard why tech wont come in so it goes out further and with tech out then admin goes all to hell its just nothing but false reports and chicken scraps on old rolls of paper you can go into qual find that their filing is bad and all you would have to do their filing is bad they cant seem to find folder you glance at their baskets they seem to be full and unemptied and stuff which is comi ng in is in the out baskets and so forth all youd have to do is glance at that if you know your hco training and do you know that you could actually at that moment assign the qual sec condition of liability without making very much error you could assign her condition of liability for out tech you see admins visibly out well therefore tech is out so you look just little bit further than that and youll find out that they should have gotten in ethics and they didnt but ethics is out theyre in an out ethics situation already not just lightly and then for all that to have gone to pieces tech had to go out in the first place now when you see ethics going in hard you also know tech has been out and do you know that people will try to solve things with onlv ethics ethics in ethics in ethics in ethics in ethics in theyre sort of stuck on the time track see ethics in ethics in where the hells the tech now unless tech followed that by going in pointless stupid even you can sort of hold the line somehow with ethics ethics ethics ethics ethics ethics somehow hold the line but eventually it all starts falling to pieces because you havent moved through the cycle youve now go to get tech in sure put the ethics in put it in hard shoot some people hang some bodies to the local church we dont care what but get in the ethics see to hold the situation see c s people standing around you know yak yak yak you know well i audited out the i had lot of bank and ga ta dee dee and they dont do their jobs and they drift off in the noww ow and theres nobody on the sea that its all sort of tumblebumbled and stupid and so forth oh yeah get ethics in youre not going to get tech in unless you get some ethics in you can get it in hard suddenly and shockingly or you can get it in on gradient it doesnt much matter how you get it in but you get ethics in you start assig ning some conditions and when things have gone this bad brother it is not condition of emergency it is not condition of emergency because when tech goes out in an area youre liable to have even government flaps in that area thats how thats how bad it is so an organization which has out tech is attracting the lightning right down on the back of scientology boy and you never really have government flaps or anything like this in areas where tech has stayed in because therere too many satisfied people theres too many friends see but when tech slips and it isnt working anymore then it doesnt seem worth while when morale is bad in an organization tech had to go out in the first place if tech is out if its invalidated if it isnt being done rlght if its non standardized if its shoved all over the place then you can be absolutely sure that morale will be going out because there is reason for anybody to be there scientology badly applied is nothing to protect and thats why you have to get tech in in hurry and the way you get tech in in hurry when its madly out is you put ethics in hard and follow it straight up with tech then you will find the cycle will go on through and admin follows in afterwards and then you have ethics tech and admin are all in now if you find ethics is having to stiffen up if youre getting more ethics than you would normally predict and if ethics is stiffening up beyond anything that anybody thought was nece ssary then you know very well that tech has slipped and slipped badly and that the reports that you are getting must be and it follows true it isnt just reasonability it must be that the technical reports you are getting are false reportsnow you can correct that up in numerous ways you can convene some kind of board of investigation or something and call back fifteen pcs and have them interrogated with regard to this sort of thing what were the results what happened in the sessions and that sort of thing and all of sudden something will come to light youve had tiger walking all over the place these are the situations which you meet these are the situations which you have to handle now lot of auditors trained on this course will find that they are going back to beco the lonely only the smar t thing to do is to remain lonely only for as brief time as possib an organization which does not invest its money in getting an adequate number of fully trained class vis is gonna fall on its head technically and then when class viiis find themselves in lonely only its alright to play god by all means its pleasa nt but shove somebody else along to become class viii because its very lonely business being god he is the most lonesome fellow you ever heard of now you try to hold the fort on your lonely only all by your little lonesome or with just maybe one other or two other viiis in the great swarming organization which is very busy and people tearing in and out of the place and people with their little antlike two cent opinions based on data that is so cheap as to not be comparable to any coin on the planet including milroy which i dont think would buy one corner of one cigarette paper their opinions arent worth shucks tech goes out and you stand there flat footed and let tech go out and let tell you youre gonna have more trouble than you can cope with with regiment of marines tech goes out all of sudden ethics starts going in when ethics starts going in hard it very often goes in incorrectly the next thing you know tech if not put in right at that time why surfeit of ethics tends to start carrying the organization down instead of bringing it back up so your steps and actions if the organization is in turmoil if the administration is bad if people are not doing what theyre supposed to be doing if its all sort of mucky and muckedup and you hear people around and theyre going nya nya nya nya nya nya and nya nya nya nya nya nya well just dont order everybody to be sec checked to hell with that but all that it is is that tech is out tech is out man how to get it in thats your problem how do you get it in the solution is put in ethics like ton of bricks and then follow right along behind it with good standard tech and put it in hard and what do you know the ethics come right off of it ethics will not lift itself out all ethics will do is hold the fort while youre getting tech in if you dont hold the fort at all you wont get any tech in i can tell you that by experience oh you can be charming you can be persuasive you can give them talks you can do everything you want to but you have to hold their hands while theyre auditing the pc and you aint gonna get there because the environment is inadequately filled with chal lenge man thrives on challenge one of the reasons why its dangerous to have an ao in california climate the only challenge in it is smog slur on california im very fond of california but the net result of this is im trying to teach you lesso n which is just as standard as standard tech its how do you apply the technology which youve got to the area in which you gonna operate you gonna walk home everybodys gonna be very glad to see you gonna put you on pedestal youre great guy you know your stuff you graduated and so on youre class viii great theyre gonna agree with everything you say next thing youre gonna hear is invitations to squirrel well bessy ann yes what about her case you know we could have her in specia lly and you can audit her and weve never been able to crack her case you know weve done all the usual things you know youre gonna tell us now that its solved by the usual things weve tried all those weve done all those and cant we get in bessy ann we can get lot of money if you can audit her and weve advertised every place that youre going to audit special ly for us ummm in fact we had one psych otic pc whose brother owns the steel mill see and weve got that all lined up for you well how do you extricate yourself from such traps and get the show on the road well you will assum unto yourself some ethics presence of some kind or another now the wrong way to assume it is to give them try to teach them class viii course in the next five minutes after arrival or to impress them with what you now know they know you know it anyhow you dont have to tell em what you have to do is an ethics presence so you have to point out to the people in your immediate vicinity if ethics is out in the area that ethics is out and that ethics has to be put in so that you can help put tech in and you do the maximum you can in order to do so now some ec that is very enthusiastic about maki ng some bucks but not enthusias tic about running any standard tech which they may consi der waste of time or something of this sort may louse it up little bit but thats job endangerment chit because you as class viii are being counted on to get tech in in your area so its job endangerment isnt it so therefore youre gonna have the terrible problem of the ec will figure that you are now above them the executive council figures you are now above them so therefore you ought to be stepped on put you in your place youre even liable to get in condition where you get whole long series of ethics conditions assigned to you because you put up small argument on the subject that you wouldnt process the brother of the steel mill the way you solve that the way you solve that is to insist that ethics goes in and goes in correctly because class viii has to know great deal about ethics you have to insist that ethics goes in and you say ethics is neces sary to go in so that we can get tech in and then were going to go get tech in now right now i see that when pcs report for sessions the auditors are seldom there they wander in half an hour from now or dont appear at all or something well thatch an immediate and automatic condition of non existence with conditions enforced guy isnt there nonexistence somebodys going to start arguing with you about this well let call to your attention that all the sea org is interested in and all theyre interested in is getting tech in on the planet now it may sound like were trying to get ethics in but thats inevitable were trying to get tech in on the planet were trying to audit out the fourth dynamic engram and furnish an environment in which it can be done and that is the general overall objective of the sea org were trying to furnish an environment in which the forth dynamic engram may be audited out and naturally we have to make sure that is also sets audited otherwise there would be point in putting any ethics in there is point in slaughtering all the people in armenia under the heading that we were putting ethics in in armenia ethics all by itself is pointless all mans justice is pointless really pointless modern justice is laugh just look at the numser of times somebody returns to the penitentiary guy gets two years for stealing car he comes out at the end of two years within four hours hes stolen car so he goes back in for three years he comes out at the end of three years he walks out and he steals car and then he goes in for ten years r and at the end of that time why he walks out and he steals car i mean this is this is not an uncommon record as matter of fact its so bad that its as much as your lifes worth apparently to arrest bank robber his friends just simply get him out of jail at once by force its really really quite remarkable but all it is is pointless punishment in 1835 i think in philadelphia they adopted what is currently passin g for justice punishment and penal syste m and they found out that although there were many systems of punishment involved they found this out by careful observation one that was used in philadelphia where the fellow was put in little cell with bars was the least workable and had the most returns and that is the one that has been used ever since the modern penitentiary system is found to be the least workable in the rehabilitation of the criminal now the cop should be charged with public safety the chief of police is obviously responsible for public safety ten percent of the people cause ninety percent of the accidents there is action ever taken to make sure that those ten percent dont drive or are fixed up as matter of fact every time you try to put in the program it gets fought its just as though people want to see people smashe d yet its criminal action killing people on the highwayst hats manslaughter and yet nobody takes any real efforts they want to slow everybody down well if you slow all the cars down you put more cars on the road per hour and if all cars are slowed down then your traffic is so jammed that nobody can drive in it it isnt really spee d that causes accidents some accidents are caused by spee d but youll find out that somebody spee ding normally had to spee d around the dear old soul who was driving down the exact middle of the highway so as not to run off either side at fifteen miles an hour so public safety robbery burglary sudden death and so on is the business of the chief of police of an area or the superintendent thats his business he doesnt even know its his job its not phrased in his textbook his primary purpose is public safety he thinks your replying to the fact that little automobiles and bicycles ought to be patrolled more closely safety to him is automobile traffic or safety to him is something else so they arrest luke the glook and they send him across the river because the judge got his defense got psychiatrist or something to say he was insan they send him across there he gets checked out as being perfectly ok and release d the following day its common practice in washington d c standard practice somebodys caught robbing bank or something like that he goes across the river to saint elizabeth and they release him the next day pleads insanity sometimes they spend two or three months around saint elizabeth but thats about all most remarkable procee ding you ever saw talk about reward of down stat if the guy can prove hes loony why hes not guilty well this kind of drives the chief of police around the bend but he doesnt he doesnt really object to this so they take this guy and they throw him into the court and very usual procedure and they give him couple of years or something like that and then he goes over and hes release d on parole back on the public unrehabilitated in any way shape or form to do the same thing that he did before just eight months afterwards and then after he does it again why they pick him up if they find him and they put him in the court again and then they put him in the penitentiary system they know everybody knows didnt ever work and then hes back on the public again and so forth you get the idea this is the cycle by which all this occurs this is public safety that is justice for its own sake not to get anything done let us take putting in justice in provence in france ill let us say 1550 robbery murder sudden death is occurring in the provence somebody rides in on the place starts picking up all these marauders and bandits and that sort of thing hanging few of them pushing few of them into some other zone or area telling them to be good and it all quiets down now lets look just give you an odd example that was one of the ways this sort of thing was handled in medieval times lot but whats the purpose there was purpose then the purpose was so that the peasan ts and middle class and aristocracy of the provence could produce in peace and have the results of their production and posses sion of their land and live lives which werent suddenly being interrupted by spea r or arrow there was point point see there was point you calmed it down sos people could get on with it and that was clearly thought in 1550 that was very clear think there wasn t any fumblebumble about it nobody had dim idea of it marauders operating in an area reduced the production and fixed it up so the citizens and people of that area could not lead normal lives and they couldnt get on with it and there was production and it all went to hell in balloon so it was nece ssary to put law and order in on the area so that it would calm down and things could get straightened up and people who had right to live decent lives could go on and live decen t lives and there was question about it has nothing to do with modern justice you may think that think still occurs but it doesnt justice is put in for its own sake hasnt anything to do with public safety so they arrest all the criminals in the town and throw them in jail but in sort of sequence so at any given time there are so many criminals in the population and then they put them in jail for while and release them back in to the population to take the place of the criminals whove just been arrested and taken out of circulation any time some group starts rioting or causing civil disorder tearing shops apart or something like that why you give them more money give them more votes anybody who was trying to keep the peace in 1550 if he were to look at the year 1968 hed be kind of popeyed because for quite while anybody who tried to stop riot was arrested most remarkable situation you ever heard of all you had to do was try to stop riot if you were cop and you went out and tried to stop the riot why you got thrown in the clink by the federal government now im not advocating desperate law and order or anything of the sort but its all pointless why is there anybody there trying to do anything anyhow because the riots are just increasing and nobody goes in and picks up the people who were starting the riots so nobody gets to the basis of the civil engram which is bringing the riot of which the riot is simp ly symptom nobody really gets to the basis of it all they do is start rewarding down stats and chopping the police up and all kinds of weird wild things but there isnt any point in even doing anything about it nobody has any point in doing anything about it do you understand justice gets bad name only when it itself is pointless and in scientology justice is pointless ethics is pointless if it does not bring in standard tech completely pointless there isnt any reason for it why ever assign condition to hell with it let them go out and lie in the gutter if you werent going to follow it in with standard tech what the hell why assign any condition at all so what youve got to look at here is how do you get standard tech in well one you have to know it there has to be such thing and somebody has to know there is such thing and he has to be able to demonstrate that that thing is beneficial and is something that should be preserved that sounds terribly elementary but youd be surprised at the number of people that are walking around in some airyfairy cloud that dont know that and then he has to hold the fort long enough to get it in and rightly or wrongly the only test of which is i still seem to keep the show on the road century after century i always hit an ethics area that is an outethics area hard until i can get those elements straightened up which made it mess and thats gone on for very long time it hit an area in asia minor something like this like ton of bricks bongo until i could get it into production until i could get it situated calm ed down divided up get an economy forwarded get things straightened out holding that ethics in hard boy holding justice in hard hold it in hard all somebody had to do was sne eze nd that would be that see hold it in hard this is the way were going this is the edges there we get this is what were supposed to be doing this is squared up and then pretty soon theres enough production enough abundance enough this enough that you start etching it off easing it off easin g it off you one have to know that you have to put it in hard to begin with and two you have to know when to ease it up and you ease it up to the degree that the technology that youre trying to import into the area is functioning simple you ease it up to the degree that the techn ology youre trying to put in is functioning it is an exact measu rement for instance im trying to build up ill give you it goes along with other types of economy trying to build up port in asia minor see got nobody but few squads of troops dough nothing could build it right up to the stars just put in ethics justice hard into the area move it up say this is where were going get the agreement of people to go in that particular direction build it up holding that in hard not letting it be knocked over and every time youve got shea f of wheat up not letting some bunch of bandits come in and grab it square it up square it up push it ahead but all the time there was technology moving in on the area true the techn ology of the arts and human arts but technology was moving in and the technology would build up people would learn what is was keep carrying it forward ethics and then as they started learning this and so forth ease off id know the job was d one when troops were bored to death i like to see an ethics officer down to such point that he searches over the entire area pitifully turning over match in his hand which was dropped in the hall as the only crime he can disco ver anyplace along about that time why the conditions are upgraded that is to say you dont suddenly start upgrading everybody but the condition you are assig ning is lighter that is the proper condition for that time so there is another rule it requires bit of judgement it is the worse off things are the harder condition is assigned for the same crime you dont always have uniform code of justice when youre going in there as case supervisor for the first time and somebody says pc felt wonderful floating needle all through the session so i didnt do it and when the pc got to the examiner with the needle stuck tight and the ta at four and half there is something very wrong here now if you start to involve yourself with what is wrong there at that stage of the game youre going to be so youre going to be rewarding down stat youre going to be training somebody who is really gonna goof the floof you dont bother to tell him you dont even bother to tell him whats wrong and you say false report youre in doubt bong ah ah you cant do that to oh not only cant do that to you if you insist on something else why we might really com to blows here over this thing the essence of the situation is that ethics is out all over the place because tern has been long out so the only excuse you have to use ethics at all is to get tech in so it becomes hell of crime the examiner talks to the person as hes examined its nonco mpliance with orders liability for the examiner just like that arguments about it and the examiners hes been on post for long time he knows his business and pcs come in well how you doing well i didnt think very much of that auditor anyhow id see well get on the cans nere i dont suppose youre very bad off because i hope youre ok you seem to be alive lets see now you had what at your state of the case well what do you know well he went in liability and he did it the next day and he went into doubt and he did it the next day and he went into enemy just like that all of sudden you are liable to have qualms you say now look if im insisting that conditions of this character are assig ned with this violence the whole organization is going to fall to pieces people are going to say i came back suppressiv ive everything is wrong and the whole staff will quit and this naturally its all going to fall apart and weve only got six staff now and let tell you by long experience thats the wrong line of think the only reason you have sma ll staffs is because ethics is out tech has gone out ethics is out and the only way you can actually increase the numbers of staff you have is to put ethics in hard you say well christ people wont have anything to do with you if you do that boy that is civilian think to end it all do you know the one organization which never has any trouble recruiting is an army but theres hell of lot of manufacturers patting people on the head that cant get anybody to work for em thats interesting isnt it an individual feels safe in harshly discip lined environment you forget that guy wandering around out there someplace is being shot down in flames by people in his immediate vicinity who are maki ng mistakes and goofing up loading their hats onto him and so on if you look at everything from your own viewpoint only you will not notice that guys who do not have your altitude who do not have your ability do not have your command of technology are really getting kicked in the stomach they are much more kicked in the stomach by the loafer the bum the natterer the guy who doesnt do his job than they will ever be kicked in the stomach by ethics and they dont dont feel safe in an environment where ethics is out it outrages them it outrages the principles and reasons theyre there and when ethics is out in an area bad staff stays and good staff leaves and when ethics goes into an environment hard you will find that good staff stays and bad staff leaves its just as inevitable as anything we just got through send ing sea org officer to an organization to take over as something the organization had never had before you say we dont have any right to do this actually weve got right to do anything we please as long as it goes in the direction of trying to straighten something out because that organization threatens the whole economy of an area they over spent themselves and they messed it up and its going to really take some doing to put it back together again sea org officer walked in started shooting people down in flames and instantly they had three or four blows immediately the rest of the staff united very strongly the whole organization i think was put in nonexistence they started working all day and all night to catch up all their backlogs and now weve found out that the three or four people who blew were apparently getting rake offs from merchants in the vicinity and were putting it in their pockets in other words the organization had gone crooked financially well when the tough guy arrived the good guys stayed and the bad guys blew now let tell you had we sent member of the bidea hee goodwill society all the good guy would have blown and the bad guys would have stayed because they could have kidded her see do you get this these are sound hard principles these are facts these have to do with homo sapiens these have to do with beings these have to do with planets people do not feel safe in outethics areas right now the people of the united states at this particular time and period do not feel safe because riots are liable to spring up at any time any place shop keeper cant call his soul his own because anybody apparently has right to walk in smash the windows and say wim rioter and this is all because i dont have zilch therefore i can break your window and everything and some cop tries to arrest him the cop is immediately thrown in prison for interfering with civil rights what the hell do you think what the hell do you think is gonna happen to that economy we speak of techn ology as an economy what do you thinks gonna happen to it its gonna go broke thats whatts gonna happen to it its moneys going to devaluate and be worth less and less its productions going to be less and less valuable security is going to be less and less and people will be less and less h appy to be part of that country now one of the unstabilizing things in countries today is the definition of sovereign power you dont think that has very much to do with scientology it has great deal to do with it because the international law definition of sovereign power is as follows that government which can protect the lands and people from foreign aggression is by fact and definition the sovereign power of that area what did the atom bomb do there isnt government on earth can protect its lands or its people from foreign aggression all some slaphappy nut has to do in any part of the world today with i dont know how many countries have atom bombs flop an atom bomb at any count in the world and there is goes booms and therefore what does that mean that means that the goverrments of nations today cannot protect their government cannot protect their people cannot protect their land from foreian attack because there is defense against that weapon they know this theyre unstabilized theyre dispersed and they know they are fakes they know theyre fakes they know they cant protect the land and people so therefore theyre just sort of tax hungry bums theyre sort of marauders like locusts so they dont get in ethics because they think of their technology as something that is dwindling something that is going something thats losing while you are moving in as vital new thrust of life your technology is not solidly moved into the community your technology is not solidly moved into the nations of the world at this particular speaking funny part of it is i notice in ads and other places that theyre beginning to use scientology phraseology and scientology think more and more this is always flatter this always flatters it theyve sort of heard on it on the undercurrent they sort of think in those terms more and more simply preparing the way vital philosophy is always preced ed by gradual chan ge in the area it is being introduced into the area starts picking up its phraseology starts pickin g up its technology starts getting expressed in the arts long before the people have even heard of it but this is vital new waye its vital new waye justice for the old orders become pointless why should they get in justice why should they even arrest anybody and throw them in jail theyre just going to let him out again and if they do arrest the guy why it isnt going to improve production any because there is thats gone were looking at dying scene it doesnt realize how fast it is dying we belong to new world and as we move forward we have our own ways of handling things and the think that goes along with it is that as long as any area which we control we can keep tech precisel practiced in that area and not squirrelled in any way as long as we can keep that morale will stay up ethics will be relatively light prosperity will be consi derable and everything will go along great but when that breaks down we have to put ethics in to the degree that we have to put it back together again but now as we approach new area where our technology is not in at all ethics of course has to go in very hard cause our tech is so out as to be in condition of nonexistence in that area and right now were really suffering from the fact that we havent taken full responsibility for all mental treatment all psycho somatic treatment on the entire planet were actually shrinking away from cur responsibility to that degree and were paying for it its inevitable then that area in which you will not take responsibility that area in which you will not take responsibility is going to kick you in the teeth bud to be philosophic about it but therefore as you move in as you move forward youre moving into areas where tech is out books things like that wouid precede your actual contact and youll find out people have picked up these books theyve squirrelled theyve done this theyve crossadvised theyve messed it up the cycle has been very very rugged and ragged and so forth to the degree then that the ideas that lot of squirrels would have arisen and people mucked up and youll be running into guys who are running engrams backwa rds and upside down see and the areas getting muddied up all the time right ahead of you your areas muddied up so actually its followed with wave of ethics and you say well the public is really staying away from an organization it works the same way with the public it works with the staff if you want all the lousy public in the world let ethics go out all the good publicll stay away from you if you want good public to move in put ethics in the bad publicll stay away and the good publicll com in this is hard thing to learn but you can eventually get reality on it and it goes hand in glove with what youre trying to do i know very well that people to whom i am talking now and in the future will be facing time and time again being lonely only having rough time of it being argued with about this that and the other thing the type of arguments you get into are so nonsensical as to be unbelievable you know its well how do you explain how do you explain the fact there are more and more people there are more and more people on the planet where are all the spirits comi ng from ba hat explain that nowl hat hat explain that we got you there i guess anderson q c melb ourne inquiry complete gibbering psych otic idiot up to the gills with r6 that was exactly i think what he said you think i was j ust gagging it up huh scientology must be wrong because we cann ot explain where all the new bodies come from all the new spirits where would all the new spirits come from if everybody had spirit why where would all the new spirits come from huh actually what he didnt realize this silly ass he was disproving catholicism catholicism claims theres one spirit per body so he was asking some silly little kid question that is asked of his own religion catholicism and yet he was busy hanging scientology because it couldnt you get the irrationality of it the man occupies perfectly valid position hes looked on hes queens consu late actually hes just gibbering idiot you probably couldnt even catch him to get straight jacket on him birds like that the socie ty in which you operate its awarding down stats its got false ideas things run backwa rds and upside down and somehow or other you have to maintain your own level of truth now you will not show the wear and tear to the degree that you put in ethics and to the degree that you fail to put in ethics youre going to show the wear and tear of it that i can assure you now you notice the class viii course is taught in aos and is taught by the sea org and the reason for that is it is an ultimate in stabilizing technology it is maybe not the last course that will ever be taught on the subject but it certainly is an ultimate to this degree it is standardization standardization standardization of approach standardization of application and standardization of result and they all can go together which is quite trick quite trick standardization of auditing and auditors there cant be any fire fights and arguments it also happens that it is the right way to do it it also happens there isnt any other right way to do it some famous philosopher said there are two ways to do everything and then didnt add the psych otic an d the correct so i sympathize with anybody going to north canyon station which only has in it anyhow scientology population of fifteen because his tendencies will be because he is so weak to do things so weakly when there are not many of you youve got to be ten times as tough youve got to be ten times as strong and you would find out that your area and zone would move up and gather in strength and volume to the degree that you insisted on standard tech this is quite true these are lesso ns which are not based on my opinions but are lesso ns learned across the last eighteen years of trying to relay technology it is interesting that in those eighteen years in the practice and application of the technology itself it has been relatively simple all the way along the line what has made it comp lex is one there was language with which to communicate it and two people seeme d to add to it faster than you could keep it stripped down now to give you some idea of how tech goes out in your area you yourself at this stage of the game undoubtedly have reality on it but maybe at some later time reality will exist on it you knew you had tr 1 you had tr 1 down sometime way in the past you had it that was the way it was somebody came along and he flunked you for it or somebody said that wasn t the way you did it somebody said that was the way you did it long time ago but that isnt the way we do it now something happened that knocked out your tr 1 so you had it once and now somebody cross questions it invalidates it it goes by the boards and you somehow or other got to reacquire it again somewhere up the line well youre reacquiring it fully at viii now one of the ways that is happens is in the research line two data are stated at different periods of research which seem to be in conflict the earlier data happens to be correct the second data is there because somebody remimeographed and misspelled the bulletin so somebody comes along and says the second datum is correct they interpret the material the material since time immemorial has needed interpretation just recen tly in trying to teach some materials i found this astonishing fact that i was trying to tell people it was the simp basics the very simple basic s that made the auditor but the trouble with auditing is it was too simp and their grasp of the subject was difficult because they thought they were trying to grasp lot more than they were trying to grasp and it was trying to grasp this simp thing and grasp that simply and continuously and ill be of gun if the zone and area of trying to apply this didnt say dont pay any attention to basics what you want to study is the upper theory of the thing class viii auditor should be model of simp licity he should have grip on the simple things of life he should know what he knows he should know and see those things occur so that there is difficulty with his head or somebody elses but this sort of thing can happen this sort of thing can happen it would amuse you very much that few weeks ago i was doing case supervision on folder and i looked at the commands that were given and the reasonability and the reason for these commands and in reading the explanation of it all and the folder i got sufficiently confused that i sent for the original bulletin and got it in just to restabilize the situation it was really violent outness but it was an insidious outness do you follow it might possibly at one time or another have sounded reasonable and it might at some time or another have been worded that way so i sent out for the original bulletin to find out if it ever had been worded that way it never had been worded that way in other words even my data at this particular point could be so persuaded so persuaded that i wanted to look it up and its almost unbelievable that i would look anything up because the data which you use are so well known to that it strains my reality to have to tell them to you and every once in while ill forget perhaps to tell you something because i would never dream you didnt know it see i have to think its pretty difficult sometimes to undercut it all the way now lets see what dont they know what couldnt they possibly know very often i have to really dream up production trying to imagine what to get down to now it strikes i remember the first time this ever happened to it didnt happen to guy was watching tv demonstration and he came in and he was absolutely starryeyed and he says i just found something that you do that none of the rest of us do in auditing you acknowledge and it never i never would have dreamed of telling anybody they had to acknowledge it was just so far beyond my reality that anybody would have to be told dont you see so i have little bit of hard time scaling it its not that im trying to undercut it or talk down to anybody it requires real skill and real ability to be totally simple that is the test if you want to get commentary on this read professor snorgborgs or smorgasborg i think his name is disse rtation on the implausibility of electronic theory the book is eight thousand six hundred and fifty five pages its in several sets and it wont surprise you that he died because he didnt know how to push his doorbell and get in out of the cold but boy it sure was complex so you want to refer people that have complex things you say well why dont you read professor smorgasbords dissertation on the basic theory and reinterpretation of scientology theory its very famous book and send them down to the library to look for it if theyve bothered you too much and keep insisting that it is in the library and it at least keeps them out of your hair possibly for some years but to be basically totally simp you have to be terribly terribly direct terribly direct now the net result of all of this is is with terrific simplicity you are trying to get forward very simple fantastically workable technology the routine by which you get it in is also very simple morale goes out and effectiveness and efficiency and administration goes out to the degree that the tech itself goes out to get the tech back in or to get it in in the first place you have to apply very straight direct ethics this is followed through by putting in tech you ease up the ethics to the degree that you get tech practiced in standard fashion do i make my point and that is actually what it is all about thank you very much auditor attitude and the bank lecture given on 10 october 1968 good evening good evening we have here the what number lecture fourteen fourteenth lecture and the date ten ten sixty eight or eighteen ok this evening im going to talk to you about the art of being an auditor this of course is totally dependent upon art there is rules about it one has the knack or he doesnt theres reason why pcs get well rather mysterious thing it has to do with the auditors aura the foregoing have actually been stated by people who were pretending to teach dianetics the general opinion of psych iatry and other mental practitioners of decad or so ago was that well hubbard can do it but he has business teaching somebody else because you see its knack somebody has and of wf wf wf wf we have doubt but what he has found is very good psychiatry dont you wf waffa waffa waffa waft what hell of an insult that was so anyway the net result of all of this is that the general difficulty with which an individual is faced is normally somebody else can do it he is good auditor i wonder what magical knack he has what is it what is it and thats what causes you cats to pick up bunch of hidden data you think somebody else knows something peculiar that you possibly may not know you see and you see oscar q zilch and he seems to get results on the pc so you want to find out what he does you see because you flubbed it and then he says waffle waffle yiggle yaggle buckle buckle and he doesnt know what the hell hes doing and he probably isnt getting results from the pc hes probably just giving sales talk anyhow and the net result of all of that is that mystery about it well the subject of auditing is first recounted in book called the original thesis and the rule has not chan ged between 1949 and now the original thesis is prior to dianetics the modern science of mentai heaith and i was glancing through it moment ago and the last editor of it has not punched this up into the caps it dese rves the reason why auditing can occur is that pc plus the auditor is greater than the pcs bank the pc versus the auditor and the bank is overwhelmed now think it over for minute and youll see that the law has not chan ged in all these years and you speak about basic s that is the most basic basic there is in auditing the pcs awareness plus the auditors awareness concentrated upon the reactive bank is greater than the bank inevitably and invariably as an individual moves up into the upper ot sections if he has made it into those sections then he himself all by himself is greater than the strength and power of his bank this is peculiarly true then in the lower grades that it takes the auditor plus the pc as you would might add up ohms or volts or anything else you know like the auditors volts plus the pcs volts are greater than the volts of the bank do you follow its that you know the auditors apples plus the pcs apples are greater than the counter apples of the bank do you follow its just arithmetically true and if you have the auditor versus the pc then it is the auditor plus the bank is versus the pc and he may already be only one grassh opper power and so its very easy to blow him down you can tell at once when the auditor is not with the pc or when the pc solo auditing is not enough to blow down his own bank because the ta goes lowwhenever you see ta sinking in an auditing session it is the auditor is versus the pc the auditor and the bank are both united against the pc and the result is sinking tone arm now when the pc himself hits too much area in the bank that is hell of an overwhelm of some kind or another this is the solo auditor his ta goes low so in an ao you will very soon see c s on sessions c s on solo sessions where the ta taken on two hand elect rode syste m has sunk below 2 the pc has not adequately made it up through the grades to be greater than his own bank and therefore he should be audited to straighten out his case to remove the charge which stands in his road to repair the grade we missed to put in the rudiments that were out during all of those sessions do you follow now by putting in the rudiments getting the charge off of arc breaks and things hes had with himsel f straightening him out relatively simp nothing very very complex its contained in the phrase at class viii its just fly each rud to f n the techn ique that is use d is itsa earlier similar itsa complicated isnt it now if you however have ever seen d n dirty needle on the pc in the body of the session your trs stink to high heaven because the bank never makes d n all by itself you can immediately and directly then measure your ability as an auditor of uniting with the pc to handle his bank by the cleanness of the needle in the major actions of the session expect needle to go d n in the ruds we expect it to we hit missed withhold it for sure will but to have this happen in the body of the session means that the auditors trs went out now his trs went out is another way of saying he ceased to be with the pc now we can give you the cycle of communication we can gave you all of the various actions which you have to do but theres one action which remains with the auditor is he versus the pc is he on the other football team is the cowb oy somebody in the black hat sitting across the table from him see is he trying to help the pc get through the bank or isnt he now i one time pulled little series of stunts which were quite fascin ating i took in an hcg every time an auditor was going to audit pc i took him aside and i pulled his withholds from the pc and then sent him in to give session the funny part of it is that those who had withholds from pc and who did not get them off gave poorer session than the auditor who did not have who had just had his withholds from pc flipped out of the road before he audited the pc we used to get very splendid sessions by doing this trick im not recommending this trick this was research experiment because it simp ly meant that the pc was being audited by somebody whose rudiments were out on the pc in other words the auditors rudiments were out on the pc he wasn t with the pc he was withholding himse lf from the pc do you see h ow elementary that is now im not saying that is always the case im just giving you this as one little special example now you dont have to climb inside the pcs head although i would expect class viii auditor to be able to audit somebody at four five feet without saying word and if he really polished himsel f up well to audit somebody on the other side of the world without any trouble at all im not giving you anything esoteric youll find occasio nally in trying to audit body thetan somebody who has not been up through the grades and doesnt know what hes doing cant make one move he tries to make the body thetan move and the body thetan moves him you know ho hes sort of telepaths the body thetan to the beginning of the incident thats why they fall back so easily on patter its wonder they dont pull up chair on the other side of their desk to have the body thetan sit down in pretty queer but there isnt any real difference between auditing body thetan telepathically through the material he has to be audited through to blow him and to straighten him out and then those body thetans of course are straightened out oddly enough there is difference between doing that and auditing pc sitting across from you in the lower grades as you audit them you are auditing composite and the processes which you use are those processes which work on composite being the pc is himself he isnt cluster as ive heard some people saying he is being however who is impeded and cross ordered by number of other beings who have caved in and who arent in control of the body but are just there but now thats telepathic action zoooom through the bank and mfafmf mfmfm theres patter involved in it now if this guy is three feet away from him and is called pc he merely has the complexity that hes trying to audit more composite being and he should be able to make the pc do exactl the things he can make the body thetan do he should be able to audit somebody in the next county and why is it that i was always able to tell the auditor what the item would be before the pc listed it it was trick it isnt even trick of reading minds but it is something on the order of horsepower see what i mean so we take this fellow he hasnt been up through the grades at all hes just fake and he oh yeah well i got all my grades in brisbane yeah got my grades in brisbane and hes been through the clearing course couldnt find anything and so forth and it all blew to f n and you all of sudden get hold of him and hes got stage four needle thats going up tick pow tick ooh now the chance that he will be able to audit body thetan is so remote that you may as well forget it thats why the grades are arranged that way now very often person who has been audited well up through the grades gets to clear there are lots of cases of this gets to clear and he finds out theres some other beings here you know what the hells this whats this you know well his reality has been raised up to the point of where he knows hes supposed to be and some of those characters know theyre running ot2 out of these beings and auditing 3 is just breeze there is nothing much to it do you follow this is this is whats known as impingement and effect upon other beings now you will find here and there that somebody has tried to audit body thetan that he has been mad at it didnt work and you get him in review or something and you find out that he has actually arc broken overrun busted up every body thetan he had anything to do with you ill get you where the hell rrrr rrr nothing happened or he got one awful kickbac k hes auditing out of arc did it myself way back when ran across somebody who was actually one of the r6ers and i thought to hell with you bud i aint gonna audit you and that was that as far as i was concerned about four days later why he showed up again he was awfully caved in so i had to pick up the arc break and audit it out do you understand auditing requires unlimited tolerance and charity now you get somebody whose writing very evaluative c ses i reserve the right to say this guy has simply fallen on his head he has had too much waggle waggle and bug bug and so forth but if you will go back through the fellows auditing or go into the intelligence files youll find out that im not pickin g it up on the air waves he said it two days before in his auditing session but you dont find saying this is horrible bum this is dog he really ought to be shot but somehow or another we will audit him because the funny part of it is he wont respond as pc if you have that attitude in session c s could have that attitude but if he colors the auditors attitude too much toward the pc then you get auditor plus bank versus pc and the auditing becomes very difficult and very slow do you see where were going with this see well its elementary now nobody enjoins upon you that youve got to have halo eighteen kw around your skull or anything like that it comes under the heading of the auditor who the auditor should be able to say who he audits and an auditor should be able to refuse pc he doesnt think he can help him is nice way of saying he probably has overts on he doesnt like him and doesnt want to have anything to do with him now that auditor auditing that pc is not going to get very many gains youre dealing not with an art youre dealing with very crystal clear proposition that the pc can overcome and handle his bank if the auditor is with him and the pc has hell of time when the auditor is not when the auditor is against him it becomes impossible somebody auditing somebody in anger can actually spin them i had girl stumble into my office one time that had been audited in anger or i think she more or less walked for about i dont know something on the order of fifteen hundred miles to get to my office somebodyd audited her in rage spun her she had enough sense to go someplace where somebody could help her i straightened her out rather rapidly as matter of fact but then the auditor and the bank combined caved in being that wasnt too well off to begin with thats why my lip curls at the whole subject of psychiatry psych oanalysis invalidative subjects psychology man is an animal this sort of thing because you see i know they dont work because they bust the first axiom its not the first axiom but they bust the first datum that was put out strongly on the subject of auditing therefore it comes back to this what is class viii auditing it is auditing the pc with good trs now do you sit there and say lets see now i have to love this pc therefore im womp womp womp womp womp youre gonna audit over hell of false line all you gotta have is just willing to help him out thats all if youre willing to help him out youre ok and if you know how to help him out youre very ok and if your trs are very smooth they will stem from those other two points if your trs are smooth now this is very very fascin ating and sometimes very bewildering you say well how would i know how would i know i can tell you how i policed and drilled myself along this line it might be rather surprising to you that i drilled myself along the lines of auditing i have had to learn better than any auditor was taught that i was teaching any of the techniques or mecha nics the model sessions the prep checks the sea checks had to learn the trs better than those i was teach ing naturally and that i sat down and didnt drill them out of thin air but i actually did sit down and drill them and every time auditing styles had changed and they have why id drill myself into the new auditing style well thats interesting its interesting to do i was getting good results on pcs in 1948 49 50 i was solving pcs other auditors couldnt solve not because i was doing something different i was running engrams and so forth on them i was running at gradient they could tolerate and i was very willing to help them that was the main difference i wasnt in any contest with them i was v ery willing to help now what what was the difference you can say comprehension of the subject well what comprehension is there of the subject its the same basic s you know now as cases have gone up the line and as things have been learned as grades advanced up along the line why what i have known has been applied i dont have any trouble auditing somebody at distance the only reason you dont is it just hasnt occurred to you you could and when you try to audit somebody into it at distance yes audit their ruds out and you dont audit them properly and they very often are stuck on the track to begin with and theyre also being distracted in various ways but it can be done now you can actually move an animal around on time track in the wildest and most imaginable fashion not because hes an animal but because his time track is so different that it doesnt in the least bit bring any question about your imagining it you are not i am sure on greedy quest for bones nor are you terrified of your master beating you set when we run some savage dog backwar ds on the time track well enco unter unmistakably what he is stuck in its often very interesting to see what they are stuck in most incredible things and it is so different from zone of ones own experience that one can evaluate what hes doing and others but this this you could say is trick stuff it aint it aint it isnt at all trick it is about as common as eating dish of ice cream now you say well i couldnt do that i dont know and so on yes an individual who is surrounded around by tremendous number of body thetans his own case is shaky his own rudiments are out when he tries to do something or other he restimulates his own ridges or those of the body thetans in his immediate vicinity and he doesnt get very far in other words hes introverted now because lower class auditor is therefore impeded hence his extension is poor you then teach him by form you teach him or form that he does so and so and he does so and so and then the responses are so and so and the responses are so and so you teach him these forms and actions now the funny part of it is that matter how good he gets these forms and actions are still there do you see the mechanics of it are still there but youve actually given him something that he can do on communication line now im not saying that you as class viii ought to be able to run somebody through to ot6 or something of this sort without ever speaki ng to him without his knowing anything about it this is not the game im talking to you about but sitting across the table from somebody sitting across the table from somebody and this is the only point im maki ng if you get any other point out of this wow its the only point i am making your intention is actually capa ble of holding him from moving on the time track particularly at his state of case and you can hold him up and freeze him right on the time track you go out and try to audit somebody who is very wog wog and youd absolutely be fascinated youd absolutely be fascin ated an auditor has always verbally been able to handle the pcs bank and make it move around better than the pc alwa ys now you can actually establish zone of freeze well im going to help the pc i suppose that doesnt register on him you doubt he can get back that far into the incident i suppose that doesnt register huh well i dont know if i can help you or not i dont know if im doing right now get get what somebody might be doing i dont say that theyre doing this but think of what they might be doing jesus christ i hope ive got this right guess id better catch up my administration thats all ive got to get this this time and so on well if he doesnt see how nervous i am about this yes move to the beginning of the of the incident if it doesnt register in his voice its gonna register otherwise recall let see what the hell was the command just minute just minute sorry uh recall what the hell was i t well now if your actions didnt make him nervous your think also could you start running on pc some time the same button that youve just been assessed on then you make an effort to stay into pt and he cant go back track see weve both been assessed let us say on catfish see and you say recall catfish and he says laughter that doesnt mean you should travel all over the time track it just means that you should be free of catfish at that moment now all im trying to tell you is there is communication line there its demonstrable with body thetans so therefore im talking to you in your zone where you can grab reality on it that its therefore three feet away possib its therefore actually lot of feet away possib and its beyond range of sight in actual fact it is not something one does without knowing hes doing it it isnt an accidental activity it is intentional i imagine somebody could be real kooky and be in some kind of telepathictype of rapport but then you must be in some telepathic report from body thetans cause you can see their pictures well if you can see their pictures theyre communicating with you now you look at somebody who suddenly walks through that door you dont neces sarily see his pictures most ly because you dont look but the point im trying to make is here there is communication line and its not because you are everybody and everybody is you because thats damn lie it is communication line we use the mest universe and we use verbalization and we use pieces of mest to make the communication positive one of the reasons communication has to be made so positive is elementary that is because theres so much cross think here and there it sounds like the tower of babel all you have to do is walk into crowded room where people are excited or upse t and you get kickback from it obvious i used to think there was something terribly wrong with because i didnt like people around who were miserable or unhappy or something and i thought this was something wrong with you see that is must have something to do with the restimulation of because of that this is way way back when i ran into this and so on and itd make feel mise rable you know id look at this person hed be miserable and id say well god i must have lot of misery on my track and so forth you see how complicated it all was you know i had it all figured out it must be restimulating some sort of an incident and its then therefore wha wha waffle waffle imagine my amaze ment one fine day when my reality had gotten up to the reason i didnt like to see people miserable is because they felt miserable very complicated see laughter and it was something like fingernails on the black board or something and then i came up to point where i was perfectly willing to look at somebody who was mise rable and i didnt have to feel he was mise rable and i could feel how mise rable he was and if i got in that frame of mind i could also move him to point of track you know put him in some other point of track i had big failure doing this one time with an animal who was barking and snarling and raising the living daylights and i thought i dont like you i think ill move you into an engram make you shut up funny part of it is i did move him into an engram but the funny part of it was i couldnt move him before the engram and this puzzle d very great deal i pondered on this for while what was wrong here well it was because i was mad at him to begin with laughter there was arc i wasn t willing to help him i was trying to ruin him every time i walked by why he shattered my ear drums with psych otic lot of yowp yowp yowp you know and i thought the hell with you see im gonna move you into an engram and shut you up i moved him alright he went in he went into an engram but then i couldnt move him ahead of the engram i could restimulate something bad with him but i couldnt restimulate anything good i was m ad at him so there is comm unicat ion line and it is not very airyfairy at the level class viii is you will start getting reality on that communication line now youll get failure here and there of putting through positive communication you wonder why that is and so on the waitress wont come over to you and so on you start asking yourself what was your attitude toward the waitress when you tried to make her come over there and all will be explained now therefore there is this thing called communication and it is communication now communication goes on its own formula lines and so on there are various types and ways of handling something theres permeation theres communication theres intentionedness with the thing and so on these are all upper ot track facilities and abilities they explain such weird things as engines run for some people and they dont run for others and so on well the engine runs for somebody else not because hes got any magic beam on it because when he looks at the engine he knows dont you see and he says well any crazy fool could see that you havent got the throttle open you know you havent turned on the ignition you see but how does he know that so suddenly well ill give you some idea that actually woggleboggles our own engineers i can call the shots in our engine room without going into the engine room and the engines run fine once in while i give up if its too far away and the communication line is too bad and so forth and ive given the directions too many times and they really dont get followed and something else is happening the whole time while theyre trying to put the thing out of communication faster than theyre putting it in ill say to hell with it see im also willing not to win all the time now if youre anxious im not holding myself up as any model here im just giving you framework if youre anxious and questioning your own abilities then you see youve got to win every time to prove to yourself youre alright see ive gotta and this in itself will cancel out certain amount of communication now just in the last week how many times have you spoken to somebody casua lly who didnt answ er you you see well it happens in mest communication which is mest communication because its very positive well itll certainly happen on this other communication line you dont have to prove to yourself you have these great powers i get angry sometimes when piece of mest wont move and then i realize what im doing cause thats why it wont move now these youre moving up into ot capa bilities these are not as complex in fact theyre much simp ler it is the additive of anger the additive of neces sity the additive of pressing it home the additive the additive the additive do you see now i can tell you how to mock up planet see any damn fool thetan can mock up planet the action is its too easy you havent actually scaled your effort down to point where you can do it again do i start mak ing sense its the effort and comp lexity now you can get this idea well to mock up planet for christ almighty let see its got to have core and its got to have swam p and its got to have wuf wuf wuf wuf wuf and then have veins and mountains theres so much water over on the planet let see now the proportion of the water should be about twothirds to three quarters water and the rest of it would be land so that the atmospheric pressure and that should be about three hundred miles and it should be so and so on and aw nuts any damn fool thetan knows what planets consist of you know its just you get it now in studying class viii you are actu ally experiencing this phenomena with scientology youve thought of scientology as very complex here very complex there and very difficult and hard to grasp and theres an awful lot of rules and its awf awf awf awf awf and terrific amounts being demanded of you and so on and i hope you are learning at class viii level that the simp ler it is the easier it is its very thats funny remark its it actually isnt encompassible with words its just well the easier it is the simpler it is the things you have to know are very few actually and you just do those few and do those in simple fashion it all comes out alright its thing you experience its thing you suddenly know thats it pow pow pow pow pow now you can keep check on yourself how good you are there is way you can keep check on how good you are the length of sessions is inversely proportional to the ability of the auditor the longer the session the poorer the auditor the shorter the session for number of actions the better the auditor actions successfully com pleted length of time how long does it take you to get through c s now you say well i dont want this pc because hes tough and this other pc and hes easy and so forth there are tough or easy pcs theyre just you as the auditor hes at different levels of case some of them are worser and some of them are better alright thats hell of way to fail see some pcs are bad pcs some pcs are good pcs nonsense that isnt nothing to it its not true some pcs are at different grades than other pcs now you when these grades are labelled theyre very often inexpertly labelled we say this person is grade four i have seen some of the woggiest grade fours you ever saw and ive seen some of the highest tone grade fours you ever saw do you understand and in the highest tone grade fours you ever saw they were very expertly audited up through their grades and the woggiest grade fours that you ever saw were not audited on their grades at all and they were wogs and somebodyd given lick and promise hadnt even you know really they never even sat down the worst ones off had never been in the auditing chai r at all somebody comes along therefore the falsity of grade assignment gets in our road in the estimation of the case and you are gonna be surprised sometime to find person who is allegedly at ot 5 who is not in actual fact even at arc straightwire the phenomenon actually can occur all the grade auditing was done on body thetan and hes gone laughter it isnt often you will find this but actually the difficulty of the case is simp ly where the case is how charged is the case what grades and actions have to be put in on the case thats all but that thats the only difference amongst cases then once you get that straight why youre great because yours is not social response youre not being responsible for his social conduct you merely know that after he has been audited he will fall on his head ethicswise if his auditing was incorrect and this is usual you get into trouble with ethics if his auditing is out you could almost throw this if you want to get somebody in trouble with ethics why just give him the wrong item on couple of lists and let it go at that and theyll wind up over in ethics all too frequently you can determine it to that degree now that doesnt mean everybody in ethics has been badly audited their life has been badly lived very often their rudiments have been out too long in life they are living over outrudiments and theyll get in trouble with ethics now what what then what then is one striving to achieve he is simply striving to achieve simplicity he is striving to achieve not fixed attitude but an attitude which will not impede the pc from making progress he doesnt even have to really be helpful if fact you can get so helpful you wreck the pc but your trs mustnt at least impede the pc and now theres another method by which you can check up your own auditing ability back around 62 i was working with this methodits very interesting method if you get d n on pc while you are handling major action you stink i mean to put it crudely because its crude if after you have left the rudiments and are into any major action you were to have appear before you on your meter d n you stink your tas are out ive checked this out very thoroughly i can guarantee this there isnt an engram known to man or beast that can turn on d n you can run person through engrams by the hat full and they wont turn on any d ns the read might tighten to bit as he thinks the think but actually it just flows along it never goes d n the only person it goes d n on is the auditor it works like this you can check it up you can check it up yourself you see little tick of the meter you havent given it chance to go d n it all of sudden goes tick you did something or other and theres that tick now you can get in the way of the pc doing this too but if you were to ask the pc at that moment did something just happen that upset you in any way the pc would say yes and itd blow off you can keep track of your own trs man if in tr drills the needle dirties up in any way whatsoever the auditor is goofing it if any d n turns on during drill youve goofed it now if your ability to audit your willingness to help the pc are there the pc is not an unmanageable unpredictable thing it would not be good to do so but you could even set yourself up the problem of pushing him through it with his reds out as matter of fact the per eat auditing session is one in which the auditor is not even faintly lnt uded into the pcs attention the pc is totally unaware of the auditor or the environment and is only aware of his bank and his action and that makes the fastest session the most expert session are that one which has the maximum gains not aware of the auditor at all so if the auditors trying to show off or do something or other that is interesting or interest the pc or all kinds of kooky things the auditor could do theyre all simp ly distracting so the best trs are those which distract the least and get the action done the most smoothly so if an auditors willing to help the pc and if the needle remains clean and flowing you havent got anything out the pc just gonna go along just great thats your own self check i give it to you as its all very well to have other people blowing down your necks and things happening to you because of this that and the other thing but the truth is the truth is that you are probably your own most savage critic probably your own most savage critic matter of fact i possib ly you could look forward to the time when the auditor goofs in the auditing session when he ends off the session why he runs out and jumps overboard laughter the upshot of it all is simp ly this that if you yourself do not have an awareness of what you are doing and critical eye of your own actions it is improbable that you will ever improve you can be persuaded however to have critical eye towards your own actions one is not trying to introvert you anybody who learns to audit in this school the sea org school is never likely to let go of it or be scared of anything when he finishes it up because we are now at the moment down in the ancie nt civilizations and so on it is quite amusing to realize that we are also practicing the stoic philosophic school the stoic was ble to endure now with that preliminary there is thing called auditing presence there is thing called auditing intention and there is thing called trs and the conditions of the session are those which ive just described to you and are in actual fact greater than those i have just described to you they do not exceed those things i have just descr ibed to you there arent hundred and fifty nine thousand others those are the conditions and attitudes of session now when you add to that meter and when you add to that administration youre maki ng sort of one man band action correct now if you had any difficulty handling an emeter or any difficulty with an administrative action you are of course detracting from the amount of cool invested in the session an auditor has to be sort of one man band hes got meter to run and hes got administration to keep up and hes got pc to handle and hes also in charge of the whole environment around him which many auditors forget and as result it is multiple of actions now let tell you how you make multiple of actions beco simple is you learn to do each one perfectly and then learn to do them all together for instance just to put ridiculous line on it if there was any difficulty sometime you eat these eskimo pies and things like this and theyre very hard to eat on summer day without going them all over your shirt they meit when you bite the choco late why the inside squirts requires bit of skill to eat an eskimo pie so as to one be able to eat all of the pie and not leave part of it on the ground and to keep your shirt clean at the same time and not get it all over your face that requires certain amount of skill now it requires certain amount of skill to fire sub machine gun to get any accuracy with sub machine gun it usually has to be supported with two hands one sights along it in some fashion or another he does this that and the other thing but if he was going to be doing something else at the same time he had certainly better learn how to handle sub machine gun rather easily so if you could learn how to eat an eskimo pie and fire sub machi ne gun with deadly accuracy into target at the same time without getting any eskimo pie on your shirt without shooting anybody else but the target and all the time with tremendous aplomb youve got an action there which is less complicated than auditing you have to recognize this the fact youve got several things to do but thetan can do several things at the same time if you dont believe it hold up your hand and look at it have you any idea of how much how much think and action and complexity that requires i suppose you think your muscles do it or something if youre not very far up along the line you will youll think well i flex my muscles and then i and so on how is it that you could bring up your hand and open it why does the thing happen to open do you see now youve educat ed yourself into believing that you have to have this hand in order to open the cover of something i dont know whats wrong with you because you can just as easily intentionedly open the cover of something with intention except you have to be able to permeate the cover to the degree that youre willing to permeate your hand that ive given you some stuff out of 8 actually this is all the trick there is to moving mest so at first you would say oh my god how would we reverse the polarity of the empire state building in other words it seems to be big problem it would seem to be very difficult and so forth but in actual fact it isnt until you recognized the difficultness not the difficultness of it but the complexity of it and the simplicity of doing it are the two things which you recognize simultaneously and at that moment you could do most anything with the empire state building this is all germane to auditing in class viii auditing there is then style its an effortless one man band that goes like the mischief and gets it all done and does it all very simp ly and brings it all right out at the other end it adds spee d and deftness to the ability one already has but it also requires that one recognizes the simplicity of what he is doing before theres real spee d and deftness suddenly come to one there isnt very much to know and thats the trouble with it its almost too little to know so its hard to grasp the feeling there must be something more to it keeps intruding on the fact and all of sudden fuff you do it very easily now so much for the attitude of the session the case supervision of the session is what is audited in the session that is what is done by the auditor and there are certain standard things which make class viii class viii and that is that you insist on nothing short of perfection we leave the ground of the auditor got away with it we leave that utterly almost to we dont care what the final result was if it was done wrong it was wrong there is optimism because i can show you in the long run that every session that is done wrong gets pc who falls on his head eventually your errors of session multiply and they multiply and they are very because youre auditing smoothly youre auditing quickly something like this and all of sudden you make bungle baaa youre the guy carrying flask of tnt in your hip pocket near ly all soup men in oil fields drink it in tea cuss and that sort of thing they think its tnt soup they handle it in the most wild and peculiar fashions and they faint if they see anybody else even going near it they themsel ves know they can handle the stuff they themse lves dont worry about it any but they recognize that if they have dynamite the soup it is very explosive now youre auditing rapidly youre auditing with intention youre already auditing above the ceiling of the person to resist the auditing you already are in case state that can put person almost anyplace you want to put him on the time track just by plain think and then you flub the only answe r to it is you gotta be perfect if youre gonna audit with that much velocity youre gonna have to audit perfectly there must be flubs so it is flubless style now when we look over when we look over well done folder it might seem rather mysterious what is in the folder we see c s something on the order of the c s on this particular one is g f green form and you do green form to first f n you dont do green form to the second f n the third f n the fourth f n its done to f n so its your case supervision is only neces sary g f to f n now you havent seen too many green forms being handed out and the real reason you havent seen them handed out is most people coming in have already been green formed up to their teeth it is not the green form is out of style theyve just been green formed to their teeth now you actually as person starts to hit the upper strata of auditing where he has been badly audited early on you start at once to be cautious about lists about getting him to list im not talking about assessments you start being cautious about getting him to do lists and so on thats good c sing you can run all the damn lists you want to in the lower grades you see but you start getting cautious about lists particularly if you dont have the pcs full listing background if you could go back to the basic list on the track and correct it that would be great but you very often cant do that sometimes its above the level and ability of the auditors you have auditing for you to go back and correct the first list ever made on the case and list then at the upper levels been done too often becomes risky action youre putting the pc at risk all hes got to do is get couple of wrong items and hell throw into restimulation the earlier list so you as case gets on up into the higher levels the continuous ordering of g f g f g f g f g f to hell with it hes had g fs running out of his ears do you see but its comm on action theres nothing wrong with it but you have tendency if youre doing c sing to look through folder to find out how many g fs this character has you know you havent got the full folder you never do theres always part of it in spokane you look through there and you see lists heres great list oh that was good one oh dear god where the hell did this list come from whistles jeez i never saw that in this folder before i have just opened this folder at random and i have found one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen sixteen item list which has been nulled down to the fifteenth or down to the twelfth item and it had left in one two three four five six seven items reading this is listed by the pc not prepared list and its squirrely list i wouldnt know why anybody would have listed it its give quote unquote name and its sixteen one list hes had the pc write sixteen items and one two three four five six seven stayed in and he gave the pc one ahhh now when youre doing case supervising work you look into these things and you very often see this sort of thing so you give some sort of c s along this line you know that you havent got the folder the persons been around for seven years and this is only two years ago it was only last year actually and you think youve got that was the earliest list thats the earliest list in this folder the persons been around for ages so obviously it isnt the earliest list on the case now we probably could correct that list but now were going to get into some kind of fire fight because thats gonna restimulate this and itll restimulate something else and it probably wasn t in restimulation anyhow and the case has long since more or less forgotten that list do you get the idea he we start correcting list which is late list and then we try to correct something else and we look through the case and we find that the green form on january 27 1967 god look at this green form look how far it went didnt f n this green form was not run to f n now thats something else you could restimulate now you could run green form but heres backthere green form that didnt f n heres list that is absolutely kooky see youre getting locked out as c s those are very ordinary actions see listing and nulling green form ah boy we start cancel ing them out get the idea heres green form after green form after green form list after list after list after list the way we actually approach the thing is go back to time when the case was running well how was the case running well well the case rehabbed like bomb on the twenty fifth of september see f n f n f n f n f n good indicat ors all kinds of f ns all over the place apparent gis ta was normal action so we arent gonna correct back any further than that get the think were not gonna correct back of that were not gonna find something wrong with the case in 1962 if we are were gonna find it on generality and so we get proced ure of we take the area now weve had green forms theres flubbed green form theres flubbed list lets say this case does run into trouble and its starting to fall on its head now weve gone back to the area where it was running well and it comes forward into another area and it isnt running well and its little bit difficult to figure out why it wouldnt be running well common error is the case doesnt f n anymore all of sudden she stops f ning ta goes up something happens now we havent got this area now were being denied our normal repair weapons theres listing to do an s and d to do remedy b something like this its starting to get locked out you see by earlier bad listing we havent got the earliest lists we dont know what ones in restim you get the kind of case supe rvisor problem youre being set up with now all problems of this character come under the heading of corrective problems the correction problems so case supervisor problems fall into these two characters and one is corrective and thats corrective of the auditing and the other one is advancing of the case theyre two separate categories you cant correct the auditing without advancing the case but they are two separate categories so all case supervisor actions come under the heading of corrective of the auditing or advancing the case now picking up and running out psych oanalysis of 1895 is not corrective of the case cause their its the case so that an assessment of resistive cases has couple of items on it which is audited over out ruds or grades and continuous overts on dianetics and scientology are the primary ones that are corrective you have to correct the case now somebodys goofed the floof if the case got here this far boy and its still reading on those two things i wouldnt give you much for the auditing it had reading on one or the other of those continuous overts on scientology and nobody picked that up audited over out ruds or grades and nobody picked that up ah so youve got corrective action of the auditing or youve got remaining or almost all of them just advancing the case now case supervisor can advance cases by grades or he can take an action to get charge off so the grade or action can be undertaken that sounds funny but it isnt funny and theres nothing very complex about it and the case somehow or another has gotten to ot 2 and doesnt find any on 3 this simp ly means the case is too charged to be where it is at the time it is now the case wasn t brought up right thats for sure so you might write up something on the order of check the lower grades to see which ones have been run or not run and the order would be they would appear like this in case supervisor folder its fly the ruds to f n thats any rud first f n you get on the ruds fly the ruds to f n and theres something i could tell you about that actually the guy could have ptp and he wont f n on an arc break you should by the strength of your magic eye actually make him f n on it but the truth of the matter is if hes got ptp or missed withhold he really doesnt f n until he gets to it so if the pc f ns on an arc break you are very sure that he hasnt got ptp or missed withhold do you understand the rationale about it so if he doesnt f n on arc break dont shoot somebody for it because its because hes got ptp or missed withhold if your auditor was absolutely cracker jack he could make him arc on it he could make him audit he could just put his ruds in you know pffft ruds in the guys confidence is such that his ruds couldnt be out you know this kind of thing cause rudiment actually is something the guy thinks is in his road so anyway the case pervision of such case will be to fly the ruds to f n see hes at 2 you look back to the folder so you dont find much in the way of rehabs and you say fly the ruds to f n two check rehab or check lower grades rehab or run to be absolutely correct lower grades you can say check lower grades which isnt rehab them maybe hes had too many rehabs but youre fairly sure that theres one out one or more out you could say check or run lower grades or rehab or run lower grades itd be two different case pervisions you think this guy this guy oh you can rehab somebody half to death dont you see so to avoid all the rehab you want him to check these things now theres several ways he could do it he could actually take list list and assess it from the lower grades and find one that read if the list would communicate to the person but the other day we had little kid and hed had several lower grades run on him and ill be of gun nobodyd ever taught him the name of the lower grades and of course he wasnt class vi he was only eight and the auditor got in hell of fire fight with him because the kid thought hed been run on one process while hed been run on another process the whole difficulty is that the kid didnt know the names of the processes anyhow the auditord just asked him the questions now the auditor to check up the lower grades asked with the process names and so the kid didnt know what hed been run on and got into an awful confusion and dropped out of session i noticed vixie barking at him so i imagine his ruds are out he probably has developed an ethics record by this timethis this would be common action you say somethings wrong alright so this comes back to you again this comes back to you again there was some charge came off and you want to get auditors used to just maki ng fall long fall b d type actions so that you can see how much charge is coming off you know on their work shee ts and it didnt take off too much charge hut it took off some the fellow had cognited on the fact that he had an arc break while he was running service facsim ile and he got the right service facsim ile hut he had an arc break at that time and the auditor cleaned up the arc break at that time he got something off on the ruds and he got this bit off do you see on having an arc break then they run the service facsim ile and thats it sigh and this is what youre gonna be faced with case supe rvising some time the ta was at 45 during the whole beginning ruds and it didnt f n now high ta overrun now you have pat process listing what can be overrun its absolutely packaged you do the same thing with it you can run it all you want to any time it has limits of any kind whatsoever you could even be running it up at 9 there is limit on it because if theres nothing been overrun it simply f ns and if something has been overrun its something thats come into restimulation since the last time it was run dont you see its not like listing process its just bunch of items that youre youre finding something to audit so you could do that certainly that ta is up and it comes back to you again and the ta is at 45 and there isnt anything that the fellow thought was overrun now thats wonderful opportunity to do something else just because the pc couldnt confront it or think of it is reason it isnt there something has been overrun normally in this current civilization at this particular time i can tell you at once what is there lsd lsd25 is the first compound distributed by psych iatry to make drug addicts out of people to show them give them an idea of how it feels to be insan hecome very popular or its pot marijuana cann abis indica is the prover name or cannabis americana the proper name of marijuana whether grown in india or america hashish which is simdly solid substance made out of cann abis indica or cannabis american all of which looks like tumbleweed growing in some back lot very easy to come by its one of those its one of those or it is some medical preparation or it is some drug which has been administered to treat he person for insanity or its biochemical cure or something of this sort and the individual thinks t hat hes been release d someplace along that line now you understand you did the usua l to begin with you asked what has been overrun but you didnt get to first base with this itll be drugs itll be drugs and youll rehab em and the tone arm behaves and the guy runs great those are just standard remedies first you suspect ed you see that some auditing action was out that is the easiest and closest one to handle you couldnt find an auditing action that was out or you couldnt find one that was grossly out or the one you found out wouldnt straighten out so its life action its high ta so something has been overrun now the ta is so low that the individual can hardly craw l and ive tried to give you some subjective reality not because you have low tas but ive tried to give you just some handling experiencean d also because it works on anybody and also because you should do it before you you actually should do it before you do full rehab it is your lx1 process which is simp ly an assessment of prepared list and then you get the down stat type of charge off the case when he thinks hes been down stat and you run some engrams to get rid of that run some overt engrams so that is wont key back in again or wont be dramatized and lot of charge comes off the case and then you can do full rehab action and you can get much more out of the full rehab action thats just in the interest of getting charge of the case now notice that is life action thats actually case gain type action it doesnt have to be expressed but its case gain type action now let show you how you could really foul it up because what ive told you is relatively simp now i can show you how you really foul it up got high ta high ta so we do an lx1 and run it without putting and forget to put in the ruds this would be gruesome beyond belief the guy has high ta well you think thats impossib that anybody would do anything like that i assure you that in past years it has been almost fashionable to believe that the next grade would bring the ta down or up thats how gross tech can go out oh well tas at 5 if we give him power why that will bring it down oddly enough power is actually adequate occasionally to bring it down because it hits some overrun in the process of running it and it does come down and that gives somebody win but this is one of those wins that has cut somebodies throat because the next one wont come down itll just go up through the moon your ta must be floating before every major action that is something that seems very new but you must float the ta before every major action the ta must always be floated before major action well the think get this little think on it you could say well christ if you float the ta before major action why do the major actions well thats somebody that thinks his target is floating needle what he actually wants is discha rged case and floating needle floats on release so that if you comp rehend the definition of release comprehend the definition of erasure comp rehend the general definition of the bank what its all about it beco mes very obvious persons reality is goes up in direct proportion to the amount of charge he gets off his case there is some charge which has more quality than other charge charge taken off on the grades has more quality oddly enough any charge taken off over enough centuries would probably dischar ge the case als the rule is still there so youre monitoring against this the guy bounces out of engrams guy cant come close to it therefore you want some kind of discha rging process before you send him into some major action cause hes in need of an assist hes bunged up like fire drill he cant even approach the grades he cant approach these next actions so you have this whole little class of processe s by which you discharge case you can do various little things by which you take charge off case if you were to do category of relatives just to give you this is the routine you see yes the prepared list and the prep check thats one of the methods of taking charge off case do list of all the different types of relatives an individual can have theres usually every little girl had favorite aunt or something who will show up as an ally suddenly and mysteriously at the last moment you know something like this so lets do list of relatives this individualts talking about family family family family family and so lets do list of aunt uncle grandma grandfather father mother and so on and so forth now were either gonna get an ally or suppressiv out of this we dont care what see all kinds of familial names and then just for portmanteau you know just for grab bag and throw one in like friend and then we asse ss it just standard assessment and we prep check it just standard prep check and the case starts blowing out guy says great sessions he doesnt realize were trying to set him up to run something we can just barely manage to fly the guys ruds after half an hour of swea t case is too charged we are undertaking major actions so either the other earlier actions that have been undertaken on the case were badly undertaken and didn t discharge the case the way they should have or the individual is piling up more charge than anybody has right to in some fashion something is going on with this case you actually dont have to know whats going on with the case to the degree that you think you do all you have to know is is lets get some charge off before we do anything else lets make this guy easy to fly if we cant fly this guy easily aww lets work on it bit here huh lets do this that or the other thing to straighten up lets take some charge off lets find some charge where is it so youll find yourself case supervisoring doing this where the hell is some charge here of course youre up against the fact that most of the things you see in an auditing session have already been discharged lets go back to green form done by mazie gulch of dry gulch south dakota who always is dry gulching pcs and were liable to find something very interesting in here overts what type of overts does this pc have what does this pc specia lize in here oh bit here yes he has lot of ignores well what do you know he ignores dispatches ahh good lets make little list here administration business organizations posts orgs well get some charge off this guy assess the thing and prep check it he says god how did they know so youre trying to find some charge so you can take it off so that you can undertake it and get in ruds easily and undertake major actions thats clever case supervision thats not clever correction that is case advancem ent youre not correcting the case to that degree youre trying to advance the case were trying to set this case up to run the next grade hesll get some real advance on the next grade but we dont let him fumble into the next grade we wouldnt let somebody go into the clearing course who wasn t in pretty good shap on r6ew along with that we have program where actually you fly the ruds before you permit somebody to audit solo hes got to come in and have his ruds flown and hes studied the material got it all taped what hes supposed to do hes got to come in and get his ruds flown before hes permitted to solo audit and then hes got to turn in the first session to the c s and get c s on it and get his next c s before he can do his next session and then very few people will be getting into trouble it would only be the dishonest bloke who does seven sessions without c s that wraps himself around telegraph pole but you get what the think is so on the one hand were trying to advance the case by taking off charge and were doing it in an auditing session wherebv were permitting the individual to confront and handle his bank because of the assistance of the auditor and we can take off major charge in an auditing action so as to set up case so he can handle it in solo if guy cant handle his case in solo he had better have an auditor do you follow these are the different attitudes of auditing there is on the one hand the planning of it the putting together of it and so forth ana then theres the application of it these are two sepa rate zones and areas but guy who cant apply it well is not likely to be able to order it well and these are the two sepa rate zones and areas that class viii has to be expert in thank you very much auditors additives lists and case supervision lecture given on 11 october 1968 well i forgot my notes which lectu re number is this fifteen lecture number fifteen and what is the date eleventh of october that brought you up to present time eleven october ad 18 the subject of my lecture this evening is auditors talk too much its impolite but its the first discovery i made about auditors when i was first training auditors back in the late 40s i did train few experimentally and along the line and i found out they all had one frailty they said too much now when c s gets session that looks nearly perfect and he gets it and he says great and then couple of days later the pc falls on his head something has obviously happened in the session which wasn t recorded the most frequent thing that hastened in the session is an auditor additive of comment or attitude which is additive to the business of auditing now it isnt necessar ily slight the additive can be fantastic ill give you an exact direct example that is exact and direct the auditor askin g for arc breaks not noted in the report form but the auditor asking for arc breaks says now if you knew anything was wrong you wouldnt hold it from would you you wouldnt refuse to tell would you now youve youre giving the straight dope that f ns an arc break needle what you see on the auditing report is arcu cdei something like this he was gentling an arc break and apparently indicat ed the thing and then that crazin ess ensued that isnt in the report c s is actually at the mercy of the auditor attitude and additive because the attitude itself is also an additive when you look at an auditing session and since my lecture yesterday actually youre to be congratulated on the org 8 you floated nineteen out of twenty one to the examiner which is fantastic so thank you applause thanks very well done now the business of the smooth tr is simply to put across to the pc and keep the pc interested in his own bank and his own case so therefore the auditor who would say see the pcs looking for an arc break all of sudden he shatters with this oh well now you wouldnt hold anything from would you yeah youre really telling the he hasnt got the foggiest notion dont you see the auditor as personality isnt there bang all of sudden the personality intrudes what does the pc try to do he tries to hold it off stow it and he parks himself to that degree in the session do you see that alright now lets take another one lets take another one pc says this is also an actual on the auditors report it reads what do you do to make others wrong pc says he doesnt do anything f n but the pc an hour or two later and the following day was found to be fantastically upset really fabulously upset after an auditing session the pc is upset what the devil is this hes supposed to run his service facsimile supposed to have gotten bunch of f ns whats he doing all upset well somebody could say well the techn ology doesnt work you know hmm look the technology works but somebody just worked too damn well what actually transpired in that brief period between writing down question about making others wrong and what is noted as pc says he doesnt have any was something on this order you say you dont have any ah come ant come off of it come off of it come off of it people have hundred of these things what do you do an arc broke needlehow would you like to have that blow up in your face in session totally unexpected totally unreasonable now when it goes so far as just this the pc has cognition he says you know i dont think i have that problem anymore you know hes looking at this he thinks thats great you know it just f ned and so forth and the auditor says oh thats great boy thats great glad to hear it boy thats really with it whew it said f n there the cognition is written here but what happened right afterwards see what it is is distraction sudden distraction and session is supposed to smooth out the pc what happens to the pc if enturbulance is run into it so what an auditor says just before the session during the session and right after the session in those three immediate periods which are additive to the actual business of the session are all additives of highly useless derogatory backwa rds nature theyre all for the birds an auditor who has to be interesting who has to think he has to persuade the pc who does this who does that actually is building up on top of the top of standard tech bunch of additives which prevent it from working that line of action has the c s at its mercy because it isnt recorded in the report you can get report which apparently looks ok and from that standpoint and if youve not sending people to the examiner youve just about had it then what you get you hear from the doctor or you hear from somebodv else or you hear from the family or hear from the registrar jukes was here last week and when he came in he said he was signing up for fa fa fa fow and you know he hasnt been back wha ts the matter you look at the session theres nothing in the session that indicates anything why see he came to get smoothed out and got roughed up well what roughed him up he put his attention inside you know he looked inward and somebody forced his attention forcefully outward and just about the time he started to look inside somebody flipped his attention outward so he goes out of session that is the commonest source of outofses sionedness now rough tr is one thing that tends to but it is not actually as near session destroyer as the additives the comments why comm ent see why comment now some auditors think to be agreeable they have to laugh with the pc i never do pc is not aware of anyhow he wouldnt know whether i was laughing with him or not laughing with him besid i havent got anything to laugh about its his joke laughter ive had pcs chortle and burble and giggle and cognite from one end of the session to the other while i was sitting there not with any expression on my face now its rather difficult to assume noexpression you do have face the next point of evaluation you have somebody who is illintentioned in some fashion or another on the examiner line pc goes to the examiner and the examiner looks him over and says oh my god what happened to you pays feeling great actually maybe the examiner has very bad case of myopia and hes trying to see what pc it is something like this and the examiner squints and looks at the pc and the pc thinks theres something wrong with him and it kills the float so there is subject called noexpression there is subject but this is normally what you will find back of the false auditing report it is the auditor additive now theres another thing an auditor can do god help us there is another thing he can do is to fail to give the next command in other words hes not there at all now this can also be deadly when you have somebody whos very green auditing he is liable to chicken get scared and he sees hes put the pc down the track in some fashion or another doesnt quite know what hes doing all of sudden the pays face turns red or something like this and he goes he freezes now when he does that the pc then has to extrovert take control of the situation and somehow or another come out of it but hes been put into it by another being and he has to come out of it by himself so he actually doesnt make it to that degree he doesnt make it so it hangs him up on the track now all of these actions act to hang the pc up on the track the additives the comments and on the other hand the failure to state the pc comes into session the auditor all of sudden forgets what hes supposed to ask for and sits there and looks at the pc and tries to look in his papers he doesnt put in any rfactor he doesnt say ive got to see here what im supposed to do because itd be too derogatory of his attitude or something and he might sit there for minute or two without saying anything racking his wits out the pc goes half way around the bend because hes expecting something to happen that doesnt happen or right in the middle of crucial situation the auditor fails to follow the same patter that he has just followed engram one pattern correct engram two he blows it he tells him to go earlier and then in locating the incident his patter blows up he forgets to ask for well he forgets to ask for the date forgets to ask what it is what does he see forgets to ask for the duration and then just says go through it now that would be maddening situation do you see theres an infinite number of varieties by which an omissi on could also rough up pc so auditing along with standard tech is that thin narrow path through being there enough to get the session done and not being there enough to put on vaudeville show do you see this is the one thing that is usually hardest to teach if i were running an activity where i was very suspicious and i could be more suspicious of sessions than i am sometimes my level of trust is too good but i would actually put it on slow play tape recorder which is voice actuated tape recorder so that the entirety of the session would run off on tape something of this nature then it could be checked back now i wouldnt neces sarily put this on as constant action but if i had one pc if i just had one pc fall on his head after he was audited and i got report in which seeme d to be well done resort and the pc p romdtly fell on his head and so forth i would be thinking in terms of listening to that session i would then want spy system you know where microphone can be taped or i would want that now these these spy systems can be escaped its simp matter just never use the auditing room thats bugged yes its happened three auditing rooms had microphones in them so that sessions and auditors could be checked and then they were never used nobody ever seemed to give session in those rooms well at once one should have beco very wary because it so happened at that particular moment the session were very very very additive the reports looked great and the sessions looked like clown show at the circus lot of yik yak going on several cases messed up and so on it was by auditor additive so it isnt slight now one of the ways an auditor additive can occur is with c s an auditor who is auditing his own pc he doesnt have c s around and you will occasionally be in that position is already breaking down on c s in the first place he has talked to the pc in the second place he knows the auditor so his c s is busted on two counts but there is thin way to get away with it and that is merely to make rigid rule never to c s during session neve r never c s during session write up your c s before the session follow your c s rigorously and religiously when you get to the end of the c s end the session your next c s write it up dispassionately as though you had nothing whatsoever to do with it even cuss yourself out but if you hold that you hold that as very very sound rigid principle you wont get auditor additives into your session which is to c s at the same time auditing is occurring because nothing can be more confusing and it can lead you into an immediate and direct q and you excuse the q and on the basis that youve chan ged the c s do you follow and gradually these two things merge until you become almost educated in q and well just audit the pc on what he needs right now lets see and you sit down now the pc himself is distracting hes somebody to hold on line and if you want to deliver all your sessions into the hands of the pc why then just never c s them so before the session if you were doing this sort of thing before the session you would look over the folder and you would write up your c s as good c s thats what were gonna do when you go into the session thats the c s you execute and when youre all done with the session with that c s done and you write up another c s before the next session and you just win you just win win win youd just be absolutely fascin ated it gets this kind of an oddity somebody comes in and says would you audit and you say yes just minute wheres your folder ill get your folder yes come back in fifteen or twenty minutes and ill rive you session get the guys folder from wherever it is go through the thing figure it out write down your c s from the folder deliver your session now the one the one type of session that isnt true in is when it isnt session its an assist somebody comes bunging up to you and they just got the railroad rail run through their brisket or something of this sort you had better know the c s for assists so well that you simply go into that and dont do anything else if its very handy the scat where he was hurt youre going to do contact if its not very handy youre goina to do touch assist if he is at all auditable you are going to run him through the engram of the incident if it gets heavy and sticks youre going to go to the earlier incident earlier similar incident thats all the c sing there is as far as ruds are concerned you could make some little gesture at trying to put in the ruds but you dont have to fly anything you understand because hes got the ptp youre looking at it hes actually in the rudiments now you ordinarily wouldnt run rudiment with an engram but ordinarily guy like that isnt in position to run the engram on you can do the contact assist you can do the touch assist theres very often on severe one theres got to be some medical patch us of some kind or another now when he comes back remember this is not an assist this is ses sion now youre going to fly the ruds and youre going to run the engram of injury or earlier similar now somebodys just lost their brother or something of this sort and they come in to you crying and theyve got to rush off to the funeral or the hospital or something like that i assure you there is so little you can do about it that the more you try to do about it the worse off yourea gonna be let them handle what theyve got to handle when they come back formal session secondary earlier similar secondary those are the actions which you take if you dont take the two actions which ive just given you lot of guys are going to hang up youll see people going around in grief very upset you ask them and somebody somebody ran recall it or something keyed it out they didnt erase it and it keeps keying back in again you see this guy all bunged up and you say whats the matter what s the matter well he says about two or three months ago i broke my leg and you say anybody ever run the engram yes i had touch assist its actually the formal entirely different thing so that there is formal auditing side of this and the c s for that is very exact you go in you do just that you do what youre supposed to do at the moment of emergency you dont have to fly the ruds contact assist or its touch assist if the objects and so forth arent available you bring em around any way you can you have them tended to by the plumbers give him shot of morphine anything like that if theyre in agony and then when they have progressed and they are not in state of physical shock why they can stand up to run an engram but by that time they can also stand up to flying their ruds do you follow so later on when you run the engram or the secondary youre not doing an assist thats just session do you get the difference between these two things so an assist you can handle the apparent ptp that is in front of you without c s if you always know what the c s for it is and ive just given it now if you want to comm it professional suicid its to badger badger around with somebody without set up c s or case study in front of you because youre liable to run into some very tigerish situations ill give you an idea you say well he just mentioned this he just mentioned his brothers death something like this he just mentioned his brothers death but this secondarys never been run ill run it ahhh how how what were you doing well you say its ok because it f ned and ill just add in and ill run this secondary here and you dont know if that case is going to fly or not on this subject you dont know anything about it lets take look at this now ill give you few little tips of one kind or another in doing c ses in doing c s you should be far more careful to set up the case to be audited than an auditor ordinarily would be you look for places to take charge off of this case lets shave this case down you look for symptoms and signs of very overcharged or specia ltype case somebody carts you in six inch thick review folder ahh resistive case you dont immediately say hes been badly audited for the last two years because the law of averages are that some time during the last two years he has run into an auditor who could audit and if hed run into an auditor that could audit he wouldnt have it six inches thick itd only be three inches thick do you get the idea so obviously if all this period of time nobodyts been able really to pack up this case and figure out what it is all about why in that length of time if nobody has theres something very very very pecul iar and the thing that is pecu liar this you have to keep in mind the thing that is pecul iar is standard tech is out on it theres dear old lady i think she even wore youve heard speak of this old lady before she even wore the little bonnet with the flower off the top of long stem and when she walked the bonnet flower bobbed she was the most precise prim proper little old lady you ever saw in your life and nobody could get to first base on her case i think her tone arm was dirty tone arm and nobodyd ever been able to pick any withholds or overts off of her what we used was the exaggerated overt which is perfectly valid it works its perfectly valid somebody wont give you up his overts and so forth you its rather harsh but perfectly valid way of pulling an overt you multiply the overt what you are trying to get them to confess to is so much more horrible than what they are than what they are guilty of do you see but you can actually make up list for the auditor have the pc questioned on the following points murder bank robbery dese rtion child slaughter bigamy see you can put down list like that horrible the little old lady said she wasnt guilty of any of those crimes all shed ever done was commit adultery on her husband for the last forty years with all of his friends and it blew the case sky wide and handsome and it rolled beautifully what was wrong with the case the ruds were out that was all but this was one of the most resistive cases in whole area it was famous case ruds out and so they go so they are and in your c sing in your c sing you want to get some kind of an estimate of how how tough is this cookie you can write up you can write up and broaden enormously the seven types of cases they ougnt to be called by the way special cases to your pcs people like to be special cases not resistive cases but you can write very very large assessme nt shee t out of those seven resistive cases furthermore you can assess it sectionally you notice the first time it was ever assessed the former therapy read once and then went out and out of valence was the item well now you could have another assessme nt done or you could just grab the brass ring as you went by and assum also that theres former therapy and your next action is former therapy run the engrams of former therapy you already got the assessment out of it see it fell on the first one now if you wanted to be more positive about it you could take whole assessment sheet of just former therapy you see that it read once now you can broaden this it slash ed once and then went out so theres something there now we can broaden and we can list any kind of former therapy that we can think of and we could shake out of the hamper the exact type of former therapy it was now that would be important because you see some former therapies are engrams and some former therapies can be rehabbed now in hypnotism and yoga and several other analogous practices and so forth there is rehab available furthermore drug therapy under seda tion for long period of time and so forth is very often rehabbable so thats already on the list drugs but it might not come up under the heading of former therapy people this personal say well i never took drugs i was just under morphine for seven years in the general hospital we see this all the time so you can do an expansion you can do an expansion and what i told you earlier in session you have got in session only to touch the corner of something and you can slide in on it its as though the bank flew little tiny flags out to the side and you can see these little flags and your job is to try to find one of these little flags and slide in on it now you saw for instance the guy the guy has sciatica or something of this sort and this youre not trying to cure his sciatica its just an index of case what the hells he doing with sciatica or whatever it is whats he doing with this hes grade three release he shouldnt have psych osomatic illness you get the idea i mean thats your think hey this guys been audited he shouldnt be doing that theres something goofy out here some place alright lets see if we can pinpoint this now all youre really doing is looking for an area of charge youre not trying to process against sianificance you just want to dischar ge this case when this case is sufficiently dischar ged you couldnt care less about the flat feet of humanoids thats why im very insulted when the medicos and so forth say youre busy healing nobodys interested in healing bodies but you take fellow who is who is ill in some quarter or another i can assure you that theres sweat deal of charge available in that area do you see the case is heavily charged its aberrated in some fashion so your job is how do you discha rge this case as case pervisor now your first and foremost way to charge the case is send him up through the grades thats your first and foremost way to charge case next grade hes made the grade good send him onto the next grade great now lets say he has had these grades according to his record and hes still got lumbosis now you should get curious at this point as to what this is all about because what it is actually is that grade is out some place or rud is out some place now theoretically you could put in the ruds ahead of the sessions you could also put them ahead of major action or an engram in life you could also put them in at the beginning of track you could do all sorts of weird things with rudiments but it is very very touchy situation i assure you to start running back ruds which are not limited in the command now you could put the ruds in for the last session if you said the last session you could even put the ruds in in the last few sessions by saying lately see lately have you been audited over an arc break lately otherwise youre liable to dive clear back to the beginning of track or you can actually earlier similar when you start putting in ruds earlier you can actually do an earlier similar clear on back to god help us now you could say the date of the engram is 1862 and you could say just prior to that incident what rudiment was out now youre stuck with it because youre gonna have to say earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar and oh my god youre going to have to start running this case on nothing but rudiment clear back to the beginning of track the case youre running it on is in shap to pick up an arc break ahead of incident 1 hes never even heard of body thetan you see why its one of these things like r212 you hardly dare trust it to anybodies hands because it works so fast but it isnt this isnt matter of trust its simply matter of the second you start putting in ruds on earlier similar youre liable to get rud hung now the only thing you can do with it is earlier similar you start putting ruds that far back and youre getting the whole track ptp the whole track arc break and this is going to be run on case which isnt prepared to run anything like that and the casell fall on its head just sure as hell case runs just below the level of its available reality the current reality of the case demonstrates how much charge you can set off the case what is the current reality of the case now person who is at low down in the lower graces and so on he maybe has many many things wrong with him but he has reality on of any kind whatsoever it wouldnt even read on the meter do you follow so your safest c s is on something that will read and therefore you take the assessment you can actually have some fellow who is going around on crutches and you say what is wrong with you and he could tell you ive got an ear ache and you could say weil then something wrong with your legs or something like that oh well that yeah thats thats just nothing it just it bothers well if he never got well physiologically and after something or other theres obviously some terrific charge on the case or body that is holding it that far out of line and your task as case pervisor is is it available well its only available if he has some awareness of it and the way you measure his awareness is with meter now you can look all the way through folder find an awful lot of blunders and have somebody try to put these blunders to rights particularly on somebody who wasn t trained you try to put these blunders to rights you know them youve seen them in the folder you order foolishly as c s to go through all of the persons earlier grades and do all of the auditing and point out all of the overruns and bpc in all of the earlier grades and youre liable to find the auditor youre c sing for in sudden fire fight with the pc under the heading of invalidation the guy thought his lower grades were great so that is why you take these little assessments just let teach you that you can see whats wrong is it real to the pc the way you measure whether or not it is real to the pc is not what is the most wrong but what is the most real to the pc and so you write up an assessment now you know very very very well that this guy goes out and wrecks cars this seems to be the thing he does this is life manifestation now you from your viewpoint are very foolish if youre trying to going to get him over wreckin g cars if thats the goal you set as c s why to hell with it but the symptom of wreckin g cars shows you theres something very obsessed about this fellow someplace and its maaical one button its just some kind of charge and itll eventually come off in one way or the other but it shows the case is very very heavily charged because he seems to talk lot in his sessions about cars and wrecks and you know it just seems to be coming up well lets do an assessment lets write up so youd write up an assessment like cars drivers policem highways just get whole bunch of motors spee d you know rest anything you care to put together and then have your auditor assess this and then he assesses it very nicely and he comes out with one that is reading now that is not what is the most wrong with him it is what he has got the best reality on now you could do an l1 on it you could prep check it you probable could even find an engram chain on it more rarely if it indicated as such you might be able to find secondary chain on the subject theres lot of things that you can do with this now youve got his item now youve got this item and this item doesnt mean its just an assessed item its from your list it isnt the make or break of the case but it does show you zone or area of available charge which when bled off the case will leave the case less charged up and with higher level of reality and the reality and awareness of the case increases in direct proportion to the amount of charge off now the case supervisors trving to solve things like this when the case doesnt seem to be able to do what is asked of him he doesnt seem to be able to do these things hes well its represented by high ta somebody has been audited up through the grades heres typical case supervisor problem and youll go ahh when you see this one see something like this guy is if hes grade three lower grade three his ta is at 5 and he doesnt much like auditors and hes come in for session now whats this whats this what the hell is his ta doing up there well your first action of course is to take his folder if you can get your hands on it and you take his folder and you go back to point where the case was running well and the ta was not extreme now you can come forward from that point and you can find some clue as to what went on it isnt neces sarily however an auditing overrun it isnt always auditing to blame the guy got married twice without getting divorced so that you in actual fact now in coming forward from that point it could be as corny as this you found out that he didnt have any trouble getting f ns last january but so help pete right now wow this is stuck mcgluck man hes parked at high 6 and parachute what re you going to do with him well you know you can run one of these lists which isnt listing question but which will give you an item now when you use question like this its border line thing it might list to one item but it also might not because it isnt proper listing question but you can still do it and it wont damage the pc any providing somebody doesnt try to horse around with it so the auditor that does it has to understand that its not one item list and hes not supposed to do anything with this thing hes just trying to find out what reads what happened since january the twenty eighth which is the date of the session in which it read what s happened since january the twenty eighth date and he tells you this and he tells you that and he tells you something else and tells you something else and all of sudden something reads without even discus sing the matter of overrun prep check on the thing might very well knock the ta down but you certainly have got to set this case up this case has done something since then something has happened and if you dont set the case up youd better damn well not run four and this is where your expertise comes in this is where your expertise now expertise is very standard theres nothing much to it the only thing youre really trying to do is find an area where charge can be removed from the case and remove it now you obviously have to remove it with process the pc can do now all of sudden we find this guy and we do an assessme nt of seven cases or we do this or that or on lower grade pcs like that the common action is green form with itsa similar itsa lists forbidden and it rubs down and it finds zones and areas and before it f ns however youre liable to find another zone or area which wouldnt f n because the process is not not beefy enough and you find some interesting things have gone on now it gives you another zone because anything down toward that f n before that f n if its on another subject on the green form which leads to it is of course c s bait do you see now you could do an itsa you could do an itsa early similar itsa on green form carry it on down the form the thing doesnt go f n all the way through the form you say oh my god now what do we do because we have just run out of ammunition well your first thought is the form was badly done very badly done and your second thought that it was badly done on the first page so therefore you look over all this carefully and you could now establish little assessment that can be done which reestablishes your suspicion and its little items that come off the green form you can have these assessed which one of these was out which one didnt the auditor set you can cross play this do you see what i mean and one of the most fantastic things is somebody with some some withhold like drugs drugs can shoot the ta up the guy got up to grade three and then all of sudden for some reason or another he met some of his old pals that he used to have trips with and hes busy he used to smok with them lot and so on and just talking to these birds he doesnt take it up again hell tell you quite truthfully i didnt do any but just talking to these characters keyed in he keyed himself in of course obviously its rehab action so im just telling you the various categories of entrance and it isnt very tricky it isnt very tricky because the law which governs it is is you find an area of char ge on which the pc h as reality and audit it with simp action now you can find an area of charge on which the pc has reality and get it audited with simple action and now you can find and there is another area of charge where the pc has reality and audit it with simple action all of sudden the case is sitting there with an f n that was all you were looking for in the first place you say run grade four and we were not interested in all the tortures of the damned he was going through as to whether or not he was going to tell the auditor we arent interested in the depth of the arc break he had with his cat these things are not of interest the actual interest in the matter first and foremost and right straight across the line is simply and only that you mustnt start major action without flying the needle and this is gonna be one of our big problems you dont think so but this is gonna be your major case supervisor problem because itll be to you with great urgency and emergency that all cases are brought you immediately get nothing but the tough cases the easy cases are wrecked independent of your interference laughter right away youve got rough cases yes what about this folder what about this folders foot and half thick and grade zero and you follow the same formula go back to find time that the case was running well try to find out what happened to the case from that time forward do some simple action that will establish it further and get charge off and your whole action is find simp action on which the person has reality have something on which the person has reality perform simple auditing action on it and get char ge off if that didnt work then you try to do it forward if that didnt work you wanna find some action some sphere where the pc has reality perform some simple action which gets charge off the case and then see if you can push it do you understand its just case of bmp pow its case of hunt and punch actually now its not very hunt and punch because youre using standard actions to do all this and you must keep firmly in mind this one thing is its the case thats variable not the technology youre applying and man these cases have got an infinity of complexities infinite comp lexities what people can do and how they can get messed up and what thinks can get cross wise in them probably couldnt be computed on an ibm computer now it looks so big and so complex that you could confuse the postulates and stuck ideas and incidents and experiences of the individual with the very simple actions you have to work with you see they look so simple theyre so easy and your most progress youre going to get on the case is the next grade if the case is to be put on the next grade youve got to be able to fly the needle with gis if the pc is in such state that the needle wont fly there is something wrong there is something out along the line of standard tech he really didnt get as far as he got or something weird has happened in his life to key him in upside down and backwar ds and it is your job as c s simp ly to see that new next grade or section is started on him unless t he needle flies easily now i will go further than that in the ot sections i will monkey around with case until it blows out of its head this hunt and punch around with the case until he finally exteriorizes now what am i doing im just hunting and punching around hes gone that now actually i could get him up to 7 and make him do 7 and 8 and all of that is great and so on but he actually should have blown out of his head at about 5 see he shouldve blown out of his head at 5 or 6 and if he hasnt blown out of his head at 5 or 6 then theres an earlier section out now theres probably an we cant go back and put the case ready to fly and then do the earlier section cause its done now what are we going to do see well it did get him little bit further and so on but i would be i would hunt and punch around until i took enough charge off the case start taking it off directly an assessment of exteriorization death release beating it doing bunk leaving responsibility posses sions bodies do an assessment all of sudden pang death this individuals got being out of his head associated with death now look at the number of things you could do with this obviously cant get out of his head for some reason best known to somebody hes still got something or somebody or himself has got some kind of stuck death so you could actually run chain of engrams of death i mean elementary now you can vary that its how can you bypass the f n you could key it out by recall you could run the overt you could run the motivator usually run by key out the recall run the overt series to f n see recall to f n overt series would then be the last action see recall to f n motivator to f n overt to f n theres three f ns available on the same material then see how hes doing well lets see we get report something like this we assessed out death and when i tried to run death the pc said he actually he went back down the track ta 12 and wasn t able to find anything and however he felt good about it but actually there werent very many good indicators in at the end of the session now whats that told you what you know now huh what you know you know that the knuckle headed auditor didnt make correct assessme nt thats what you know you had your nice little list and all of sudden he gave you an item that was in some fashion forced to read the one that would have read is the one on which the pc has the greatest reality and he obviously didnt have very much reality on this because he couldnt get back and run anything do you follow thats your think so you know youve got misas sessme nt we had one the other day damndest fire fight you ever cared to see ran something like this i gave the pc the first command and told her what we were going to run and she said you know i didnt understand that at the time it was assessed and so i told her what it meant and then i said i didnt think we should run it but she said that it was alright to run it and so we did and its one of those do not send to find for whom the bell tolls an assessment because of noncomprehension which gives you clue that your assessment should be checked now if you give now let teach you little bit of piece about assessment if you assess something and then send it to the c s and then the c s says to run something on it when you start to clear the command if you find out that he didnt know the item is your face red because you assessed against misunderstood the pc couldnt have even dimly been in session or interested in what was going on because all he hung up on and read was the fact that he didnt understand you so it must have been very corny assessme nt indeed the thing to do in such instance would be to quick like bunny get the misunderstood off reasses s it almost cruelly on the basis now are there any other when youve finished the assessme nt are there any other words on this assessment you didnt understand you know stick it back in the folder and send it back to the c s you know its an is my face red type of submission but that is the correct action not to run it because look at the mecha nics im trying to teach you here the reality of the pc is totally violated pc that doesnt understand what some very simple word means well actually youre actually auditing then in zone or sphere of what was that is that in the direction of reality its in the direction of total unreality so you wouldnt dare audit such thing it would be horror beyond horror you wouldnt dare audit such thing now you say therefore there ought to be some sort of drill on which we go over the whole list and take us each one of the words on the list before we assess it in order to clear if on the list there are any misunderstoods instead of that we dont inspect before the fact any where along the line we ask the person we can ask the person before we run it now the reason why you dont hang up pcs and give them the assessmen t is they walk off and self audit it youve given him the item youtve given him the item dog chains you didnt do anything about it and then you finally say thats your item your item is dog chains so you get it mixed up with listing and nulling then the pc g oes out of session saying dog chains dog chains dog chains yes they com back the next session its overrun already and then you overrun it see you set yourself up to fall on your head if you trust the auditor completely and if youre not having any assessment trouble and auditors can do the assessment the actual act of c s is assessed list fow fow or assess the following items take what reads and prep check it list one it do what you will do with it find an engram about it you know whatever youre going to say about it see now the proper auditing action is after the assessment is done you do the action at once and then the person says they dont understand that cause you try to clear it with them at that time which is proper auditing procedure youve got to clear the auditing command and they say yeah well i meant to tell you i didnt know what that means you say thank you very much thank you well clarify what that means yes that means boaga boo so fwa fwa fwa thats something you lead dog around on thats it yes now were going to do an assessmen t click click click click assess it out again and you find it now comes out entirely different not the other one that read because what you were getting were latent reads on top of the misunderstood now youll get the one on which hes getting reality so your assessme nt is always assessed against the pcs reality and the only reason you do an assessme nt at all is to get close to where the pcs reality on the situation is you can look in six inch thick folder and you can find it in this six inch thick folder there are eight thousand nine hundred and sixty two auditing errors now question is ive already given you an example of this you start patching up the list but he didnt have any reality on the list being wrong its also something trained auditor has to do to patch up list hes got to be very skilled on the laws of listing and nulling to patch up list otherwise hell dog breakfast the list again so your safest action i then showed you is assess list auditors auditing sessions reviews you know any word that you could think of in regard to this then you assess it now youve got the pcs greatest reality now you run that on and youll find that the pc gets some charge off and it starts straightening out now how manv times could you do this well i dont know its almost an infinity of times its not limited action now the funny part of it is that limited actions only occur in the presence of out trs almost any action beco mes limited action in the presence of bad trs bad trs auditor additives auditor omissions and so on add up as nice as you please you limit the processes and you can audit guy so baaly believe it or not that the simplest process i n the book right here this now ive suddenly given you nocomm bridge and chan ged to an entirely different subject but it is relates to this because ive been telling you how to c s and so forth now im going to tell you something else about it i started in to tell you that the c s is bit at the mercy of the additives or omissi ons or the rotten trs and so forth of the auditor who is auditing for him and that might have left you in slight puzzlement exactly what is the extent youre not puzzle d about it because you have reality on it you think you understand it i got news for you you dont this one you have to learn this is very upper level material this is level 7 and 3 section material so therefore you go trying to teach somebody this and youre gonna wrap him around telegraph pole if he isnt already up the sections so i give you warning what you want to do is put it into peoples heads that they mustnt add they mustnt do omissions and theyve got to have good trs now i want to give you the reasons back of this the reasons back of this it is under the heading of the anatomy of an overrun the anatomy of overrun is very interesting anatomy you would say well its been run too long so it goes up thats great thats very simple but that is the overall mechanic of the thing and the overall appearance and the overall datum what is actual fact happens why is an overrun an overrun well i can give it to you just one two at some time or another the pc decid ed to stop it and from that point on it is getting overrun and that is all an overrun is lets take series of engrams the individual youre running engrams on the track it goes more solid you have to get earlier similar why do you have to get earlier similar because youre running down chain of incidents where he has already got the consi deration that its already gone on too damn long youve got to go back and get the incident where he first decided it had better stop you dont in actual fact get the first incident on the chain it isnt there the first experience he had in this particular line of country he didnt stop it was alright for lions to jump on him he didnt mind it thought what the hell so the lion jumped on him and chomped up body well he just mocked up another body to hell with it body easy come easy go so what after while he start deciding bodies are very important and lions shouldnt do that and so on so he decides to stop lions from jumping on him and now we have chain of animals leaping upon bodies which goes on for years and years and eons and eons and you start tracing this thing back and it goes into the millions and tens of millions and hundreds of millions of years ago how the hell did you ever get chain like that well its running back to somewhere in the vicinity of the original stop its this type of action must cease thats what he has determined this type of action must cease and that is the point which you have to get out of it and that is why in the materials of 3 you get my instruction to get the stop out and in ninety percent of the time if you dont take the stop out of 3 it is already bit late on the chain and it wont blow other incidents and actions have happened before that so wherever we look on the track we find this is true and that is the datum which comp ares to all the other datum and is the datum which makes engrams stick makes them go more solid which makes things overrun alright now lets take the rudiments now this is very interesting in actual fact it is impossible to put in the rudiments too often thats theoretically its theoretically impossible to put the ruds in too often there is limit on the number of times you can put in somebodies rudiments yet you will look in folder and you will sometimes see this arc break up ta overrun down ta well how the hell could that happen now let give you an exact way it could happen at fifteen minutes before lunch the auditor starts two hour session he just has time to get in the ruds he gets these ruds in laboriously they go to lunch and he comes back from lunch he sits down and puts in the ruds ah but the pc expected major action so he stops the auditor putting in the ruds and up goes the ta theres folder kicking around which runs like this its actually criminal its fly each rud to f n and then and it gives about six more instructions so some time just before supper the fellows flew each rud to f n on pc who does an awful lot of itsai ng alright just before sudper flew each rud to f n took long time you might have known the pc it always takes long time to fly rud on this pc the pcs gabby took break went to supped came back and once more flew each separate rudiment didnt even just check em flew each sepa rate rudiment even then it took quite while to push the ta up but eventually the ta went up to 425 on putting in rudiments what two things happened now the pc could have had all the work shed done to get rudiments in invalidated while waiting for something major to hasten in the session or the pc simp ly was trying to stow him from putting in the ruds so the pass invalidated or the pcs trying to stop the pc invalidated ta goes down trying to stos ta goes up so c s knows at once whether or not the pc was overwhelmed by invalidation in some fashion or knows whether he was so rough and crude and dull in his action or was doing something so stupid the pc was trying to stop him pc trying to stop him ta goes up ta down invalidation and overwhelm you got that now in the first place what the hell makes one of these chains youre already aware that youre mocking everything up how come this damn chain can stay there thats curious isnt it well its out of 8 actually its the exercise of permeation for control control by permeation and if you want chairs to tip over and that sort of thing without having hand laid on em of course youll permeate them and tip them over so let us take now this guy who had the lion jump on him and hes got long chain of being destroyed by lions fighting lions shooting lions and hes clear for gods sakes and you start dredging around and all of sudden you find this wild chain having to do with lions well let tell you the exact circumstances of how that chain came into being it used to matter it used to didnt matter damn and then one fine day he decided he was tired of getting bodies mucked up or lions mucked up or something and so as the lion leaped through the air he permeated the lion he permeated his environment to control it in order to stop the lion this is very successful you can stop things this way like bomb theres trick in this its done by permeation and youre just every where at once you know well it freezes or it does something else or it goes off in the other direction dont you see you can make it do what you please alright that was great that was great and then one day lion jumped on him the frequency the length of the track permits the most unlikely incidents to repeat theres sufficient variation that you finally youll get on one of these points again somewhere up the track so anyhow the lion jumps on him he permeated the lion stopping him from jumping and at that moment lion jumped on his back that he hadnt noticed this cause d dispersal he thought he had the environment under control and there was piece of the environment he didnt have under control which causes him to shift his attention from this lion to that lion so this lion hits him and he loses h is body anyway now on that failure chain he will have already got the basic of stomping lions from jumping on him and now you get cant stop lions chain now the damn fool will keen on going through this permeation act long after it doesnt work and it gives him chain of pictures quote unquote pictures theyre very funny looking pictures theyre very thin pictures theyre mostly energy frozen do you see the mechanics well it takes distraction to put him into chain of loses and after while he doesnt permeate things but he still does permeate things and he cant understand why after he walks out of the room he has picture of phonograph do you see well that failed so he doesnt take responsibility for the action any more but thetan can permeate anything anyhow and its often surprise to that things in my vicinity dont move but my body will move my hands will move but that doesnt move thats cause im holding it still why my hand moves thetan is very clever see and you have to he careful what you permeate there are many things you shouldnt permeate obviously you had better stop permeating i suppose somebody who has done that and so forth has whole chain of invisible pictures refraining from permeating but regardless of all of that im telling you this mecha nic which is simp ly mecha nic the mechanics of handling things because it was distraction which gave him his first lose on stopping up to that time he didnt care whether he stopped things or not now he beco mes frantic about stopping and it took distraction like he stopped he permeated the lion in front and turned him around in the airs and sent him somewhere else right at the same time the lion he was going to do this you see right at the same time the lion hit him from the rear so he starts for this lion stops this lion and he gets this lion but he hasnt got this lion under control and he gets so confused he didnt know what the hell lion hes trying to control and its by distraction and youll find then that distraction is an interesting point to handle in the pc its handled just by discha rging the case but an engram which has got distraction in it if you were really gonna run this thing out come hell or high water regardless of how late is was on the chain will really hang you up boy you really can sweat as an auditor trying to run out this engram which has distraction on it do you see he almost he was running the car into tree when another car hit him in the side brother you try to unwind that engram and youre generally going to have ball its going to take earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar do you see why because its got the failure point has been dramatized in it which is the distraction in it do you see its whole chain of distractions and to get down to the earliest distraction is some times bit of trick theres too many conflicting forces t rationalize do you see this now we come right back to what i was talking to you about in the first place what do you think about distractive auditor in session thats interesting isnt it if that was his first point of failure to permeate and if its dramatized on him at the same time hes trying to introspect and handle his bank and hes been distracted in some pecu liar fashion by some idiocy actually his tolerance of distraction is fairly high he isnt scared to death but interjected comments evaluations invalidations the auditor not taking care of the environment gale of wind starts coming in through the window and the auditor doesnt go over and close it you know any one of these things which causes distraction in the session doesnt necessarily ruin the pc because there isnt anything really violent happening with the pc but is sure sort of hangs him with session and he cant get on with it the reason he cant get on with it is because its got the element of distraction the unpredictability and there is where the importance f trs begins now have you got the whole mecha nism i suppose the auditor not saying anything is he was counting by that time on lion tamer to reach out with noose and grab the lion and the lion tamer one time didnt grab out with the noose and grab the lion and it was an omission so omission beco mes distractive too he expects something to happen and it doesnt happen its plus or minus side of the ledger do you see then the essence of smoothness of predictability of doing what the auditor is supposed to do in the session not adding to it not subtracting from it and carrying on with the actions necessary to resolye the case now part of the actions necessary to resolve case re the auditor auditing him now ill give you another little piece of this its the auditor plus the pc versus the pcs bank makes it possible then to audit pieces of the pcs bank so therefore for you to do an assessment of what the pc should go off and audit is bonkerslets look at this again you do an assessment on list which you now give to the pc and you tell him to go off to his solo session or something and do this l1 on wuf wuf you assessed it now his reality then is always increased in the presence of an auditor his reality on his bank is increased in the presence of the auditor because hes got that much more attention he can put on his bank right so therefore the assessment will go deeper than he himself all by himself has reality on this gives you three or four phenomena which sometimes make you very curious as to what happened pc walks out of session and says something entirely different happened if you look on an examiners report sometime this pc maybe has been audited for half an hour and the pc comes out and tells the examiner all we did was assess list trimitygod the persons list yeah we assessed list but there were about fifteen other actions present before the list was assessed well what was being done before that is this is negative gain what was done before is longer important to the pc its erased theyre gone not important pc doesnt comment on it but the list hasnt been run yet furthermore its been assessed by the auditor so the second the pc walked out of session if the pc was given the item the pcs liable to walk out of that session overwhelmed cause he got the item and it was actually not the reality level of the pc it was the reality level of the auditor plus pc the pc safeguarded was able to confront the bank enouan to inspect what was going on but the pc ll by himsel f couldnt you got that so it enters into this equation so there are many rules the auditor plays in auditing which he really doesnt really suspect he actually increases the reality of the pc during the session the pc can become much more aware of his own bank the pcs pictures in running engrams are liable to be far brighter go brighter when the auditor is auditing him then some auditor or other i do c s for him the c s is to run some engrams i intend it to be audited on him and so on and he goes off and audits himsel f like wow you see i already have given him c sed action so it isnt likely that hell run into this on his own volition im already undercutting his reality to some slight degree by maki ng sure that its correct but nevertheless that its pushing the case bit and thats supposed to handle the situation well its audited he goes and audits it on himsel f he wraps himself around telegraph pole do you see w hy so the auditor can be definite liability to the session by additives or subtractives from the session he can actually provide sufficient distraction to key in or hang up the pc in the session he can make an unlimited process actually appear limited because the pc is busy trying to stop his doing it which then gives you the whole phenomena of overrun because the pc has already decid ed its overrun i think ruds are overrun ta up see now pc isnt aware hes doing this hes operating however to do this or on the other hand the auditor in there pitching sitting there just doing his job routinely nothing very magical about it he says what he has to say hes got his trs are in he gives the auditing comm and he gets them executed he follows through and does his job right straight on through actually has enormously increase d the reality of the pc as he moves on up the line and so has permitted him to confront parts of the bank and handle it that he never under gods green earth all by himself would be permitted to do so theres very plus and theres very minus to the situation and theres lot to be gained and lot to be lost all on the same subject have you got better idea of what sessioning is about yes sir alright very good thank you very much standard tech lecture given on 12 october 1968 well you will be very happy to know brethren as we are assem bled here together that we have to bow our heads in prayer for none of you at the moment since youve already gotten each one of you well done now all you have to do is get your 85 on the final exam and in any event you can make your airline reservations for the sixteenth or the seventeenth whatever aircraft you can get on what lecture number is this sixteen fifteenth sixteenth gee i though youd slipped or i had sixteen lecture number sixteen and this is twelve oct correct d eighteen and the subject of this lectu re is standard tech i do not envy you going almost singlehandedly into an organization at this particular state of affairs and having dumped on your lap what you dumped on my lap when you arrived here laughter but im afraid it is that exact situation now what you lack because ive been too busy with your folders you lack big chart which gives you the b cs of c sing you lack that chart ive not been given the space nor the time to get you together with big c s chart the great deal of the auditing which you have been doing is ot section auditing neve rtheless the simp ler actions apply to the lower grades now remember that youve got to be backed up by the examiner very often session will look ok to you if you dont look at the examiners report now its quite remarkable but those sessions wnich were done today i think all of them it is reported got to the examiner with an f n the whole sweeping lot now wnen youre really hotter than pistol they come back to the next session with an f n theyll not only get to the examiner but they come back to the next session thats askin g lot but im telling you that its quite triumph to get all the guys to the examiner with an f n now you must realize that if the report looks absolutely flawless and by the time the person gets to the examiner hes fallen on his head that you have false auditing resort and the most likely two things that have happened is the auditor talked too much and the auditor didnt talk at all it isnt really that he even did something else its just that he did too much in the way of gib gab gab gab he got the pc distracted and upset or he just didnt give him the commands now the other type of additive you can usually spot because its very often in the auditing report do you have present time problem what postulate did you make that gave you that problem what counter postulate was there to this very good then give problem of comparable magnitude to it fine alright good now invent problem good you know there was actually folder around thats got that in it from class vi auditor wow and of course the pc just fell on his head well that was easy to spot dont you see thats easy to spot the hidden one is all of the stuff that didnt get into the report now you can very often tell all the stuff that didnt get into the report by the time of the session the session is one and one half columns long but consu med two hours it doesnt make any sense at all how could they have only one and one half column of work sheet and worked at it for two hours see thats impossib so therefore thats false auditing report just obviously on the face of it now you are to use the examiner to investigate this sort of thing and you can ask your examiner to ask the pc things so you send the folder back to the examiner and you say examiner get the pc in and ask him do you follow so then the examiner and you just you can even make together little little form you can mimeo few forms off you know what you want the pc asked see you can get you can get another point of view on this you can get the examiners point of view now dont think that the examiner has to be very skilled people think they have to put class vis on or something like that on the examiner post all you want is an honest person on the examiner post he doesnt even have to be trained in tech cause whats he doing hes reading meter he has to know the state of the needle and he has to be able to write the language youre auditing in he also has to know that he must not make an evaluative glares and sneers and he mustnt ask lot of silly questions unless hes been told to ask some questions now when you you can have pc brought to the examiner you get this auditing report back and you say oh my god what the hell is this all about and youre trying to figure out what the hell its this thing within two hours and you have one and half columns of work sheet and it didnt seem to work out and the guy got to the examiner with d n and the ta at 5 what in the name of god happened he left the session three minutes before with an f n at 2 but now its at 4 what the hell is going on what is going on alright well you dont know so dont hang yourself up in mystery any question you have about it write out the questions and get the answ ers from the examiner you dont call in the pc you send the folder with some questions down to the examiner examiner calls in the pc asks the questions now you normally will get these things just on straight examiner form that is an additional line im showing you exists dont you see now if youve got five six seven folders which have appeared to you totally well done and the examiner report was great on them and you notice all of sudden that four of these five are back in review within about forty eight hours what do you do about that you convene board of investigation or comm ev cause brother youre dealing with false reports it goes straight onto the ethics line you can ask the ethics officer to interview these people it is the least action youd take and you can convene board of investigation because your neck is out miles your neck is out mile people suddenly start accusing you you see you get the condition you dont assign thats the horrible part of it if some guys in nonexistence nd you dont assign nonexistence first thing you know youre in nonexistence its weird its weird mecha nism and it happens its actual factual so therefore if you get the thing stacked up now dont go around grinding your teeth and snarling to yourself quietly and so forth just put it on the ethics line very forthrightly what the hell happened and you will just be amazed at the grossness f the error it took the auditors all of sudden were writing all of their reports long after the session to make them look good theres collusion with the examiner something weird has gone on here see and the faster you cure it the faster your tech lines are going to work so you just are alert all the way along the line when youre doing c s work to these oggiltyboggeldy weirdities and dont you try to get weird to solve the situation on tech lines these oggiltyboggeldy what the hell is this guy has power 5a three days later hes reported sick well you know the items of 5a are out and although it looks good in the auditors report it might even have slid by the examiner somehow or another the fact that he fell on his head in any way shape or form he got sick he turned up as an ethics case something like this you know treaty false auditing report now these are the fine points these are the fine points of being c s where you have to be clever in being c s is avoiding anybody pushing you into position where you give unusual solutions cause every time they goof theyll ask you for an unusual solution youre being asked to dig them out of it after they havent done anything they should have done only they wont tell you they havent done anything they should have done so you could easily push yourself into situation where you are being required to give unusual solutions when all you really are dealing with anyhow are false reports so any unusual solution which you give which is which is based on false report will just wind the guy up in another ball thats what i mean when i say take it easy take it easy on your hes got to be audited this afternoon this thing looks sour looks like something unusuals going to have to be done and so forth well you can have the pc called in and re examined on set of questions on the basis of that if it doesnt true up you can turn it over to the ethics officer you dont get any satisfaction there you can turn it over to b of i or comm ev do you follow when these situations become consistent you make it b of i or comm ev dont let anybody get away with it the next thing you know youll be doing your nut now ill let you in on something its only the lousy sessions that consum c s time its only the lousy ones itd be interesting to look at the time dates if you knew the exact sequence of times if you took bunch of my c ses you would find that the well dones take about two minutes and the lousy ones take up to half an hour so that i would be able to get through tremendous stack and i have done as many as forty six forty six cases c ses in one evening with great care every line dont you see and the lapsed time was about ten hours now the funny part of it is is out of that ten hours the easy ones didnt consume an hour of it and the rest of the whole time was in trying to unravel the lousy sessions and its interesting that right at that state of time not your folders but another zone of folders and so forth were being filled with false reports and that was what was the trouble there were great many additives in the sessions which werent being recorded and very shortly i alerted looked up and got ethics in with crash it straightened out it will straighten out itll all com out right now but when you find yourself then with c s consuming too much time and its rust hard job plowing through this know then that youre dealing with out tech and false reports you just are you could actually stack up the folders that are probably false reports it didnt make any sense you told him to do something monday and tuesd ay it comes back as apparently done and wednesd ay why the case is misbehaving most remarkably and that hasnt worked so you say something else and it comes back to you on thursday and this ta is way up and everything seems bit awry well the first thing it tends to do is shake your confidence in what you yourself are doing you can get into what the hell you know i have what in the name of god is going on perfectly valid sessions theyre all written up beautifully only those sessions didnt take place do you follow now thats pretty gruesome thats pretty gruesome but somebody can throw you an awful curve this way now there isnt any unusual remedy for the situation certain percentage of this sort of thing will happen so you simp ly take care of it that way any time you make it rule any time youre asked for an unusual solution you turn it over to the ethics officer or the examiner you get note from an auditor this person is waf waf in waffle waffle waffle and yowf waf waft and youve already c sed the folder twice let us say two times and its waffle waffle waffle waffle dont you go waffle waffling your line to that pc is being cut in some fashion or another and youd what not or will not know until you get some further information so you the least thing you can do is turn it over to the examiner and have the pc interrogated the next thing you can do maybe after youve done that second action is turn it over to the ethics officer let him look into this what s the ethics records involved here see what i mean in that way youll stay out of trouble itll all go smooth as glass standard tech is in or its out ethics do you see you cant get standard tech done while ethics is out somebodys giving you false reports somebodys getting away with murder and its just amazing its amazing what can happen amazi ng you will find all kinds of weird things ive been through all this in organizations all over the place i dont think theres anything much could happen that hasnt happened in infinite variety ive had tremendous numbers of wins tremendous numbers of successes bu t some of these points really stand out one time i found that the d of p couldnt possibly aet much done yet there were thirty five auditors on staff but there was very little happening and you know i found the registrar was scheduling the pcs they werent being sched uled by tech services they were being sched uled by the registrar and the registrar would schedule them this way person would come in and the person didnt wasn t even askin g when he should be audited or when he shouldnt be audited and the registrar would just automatically volunteer well how much time how much spare time do you have and the person would say well i dont know im usually free after seven oclock in the evening well very good lets see eight oclock thursdays how is that every thursday they were going to have one hour session see here was complete outadministration well nobody could run that hgc it was impossible they had to have this vast number of auditors who didnt have anything to do they didnt have anything to do because pcs ever showed up in processin g at any given time there were eighty or ninety pcs well my golly you would have figured that thirty five auditors would have clean ed up eighty or ninety pcs in one awful rush they wouldve been out of work by thursday dont you see cause the sessions werent all that long but it was so fixed that an auditor was only about doing an hour worth of work every two days they could have gone on this way for years and they also could have gone com pletely broke do you see now situation like that makes it impossible for c s to keep anybody busy or live so this is the other side of outadmin now you in the first place dont care how much time that pc hangs around as long as when he is to get session he gets the session and what happens in that session is what you said was to happen in it and then you take look at the session and then the next time hes to get session somebody brings him in and gives him session in other words your tech services is operating against the action of c s and the availability of auditors pongety pongety pong well thats all an administrative action now it can go the other way around where you have somebody else entirely who is completely out of zone or area whos doing all the sched uling that hasn t anything to do with anything you know its all being sched uled by the hco exec sec and therefore you cant get people audited when theyre supposed to be audited the less days you leave bad 5 out of action the less the better if youve got to correct 5a or something like that and you want it corrected now that evening if possible so somebody in tech services has got to be on the ball and be able to call in whoever it is so they have troubles so tough thats tough you dont care how much trouble they got youre whole action youre whole action is getting the c s done getting the c s done and getting the case gaining do you do you see so your administrative play you see falls in against the tech and these two things are coordinated one against the other now you dont want tons of auditors sitting around on pcs who are falsely and weirdly scheduled and so forth the sched uling of pcs is very much in the hands of the tech services and its very much under the orders of the c s just recently believe it or not in another zone i had two pcs who just plain goofing it boy they were goofing it up most gorgeously and another pc who was pleading that he should go to the hospital and have his throat cut or something and he had this as thing and you ever once in while go into hospital and you ask some of the patients well im going to have an operation heh so you say is anything wrong with you i dont think so oh yes i ve ive got something i dont know what it is just something i had something else last week but theyre going to operate on guys are just dramatizing see so i was ordering these people to be audited and audited now and boy you would be surprised at the amount of force and pressure i had to bring in to get them audited and the guy who was pleading to have an operation they didnt get around to him he went over and the next thing i heard hed had his operation ah one useless h ole so you see tech services and so on can fail to back you up the auditing doesnt occur in terms of time when you want it or they are trying to force you to get the case audited in some spee dy fashion or something to suit the convenience you dont care how inconvenient it is for the pc you get it you dont care how inconvenient it is you dont care how hard tech services has to work this is to hell with it you understand and if its matter of straightening that case out carefully you want that case straightened out carefully and you want to watch every step of the case as it comes along the line to then the ratio that the less trust you have in the auditor the more actions and the more times you want to inspect it why sell down the river everything from zero to four if youre going to sell anything down the river lets sell the ruds let him goof the ruds let him goof little assessment of some kind or another why sell grade down the river now this is all part of setting the case up to have the major action done and you as c s have the job of setting the case up to get major action done do you understand so if theres any insecurity on your part that the case isnt going to be set up for the major action and somebodys just going to slap happy the major action on through the lines bah at that point you start putting on the brakes see fly the ruds and give him any give him anything dont give him grade so you fly the ruds and dont give him grade so theres two ways you can use little prep checks and l1s and things laughter in actual fact in all respect to this class i havent been doing that just to give you something to do i have used them meaningfully to set the case up better but i wouldnt i wouldnt think twice about it assess the following and weve seen some way back here that the pc was once bank cashier and seems to have failed at it cause its back in some kind of withhold he was giving but when he was kid he didnt want to be he wanted to be banker but now he tells he better not because so on and so on well good alright alright you got some clue we dont care where they got the clue you can even issue interrogations to get clues you saw do it recen tly what is your state of ot and i picked out the physiological illnesses and audited straight in the direction to set the guy up to bring up section or zone of his case which must be holding him down from exteriorization alight now i gave you drill on this see now that isnt standard form to amount to anything but you can call it standard form you can make up these forms what careers have you followed that you have failed at turn it over to the auditor and get it assessed prep check it what you gonna get youre gonna get the rehabilitation of failed purpose the guy is immediately going to be less tired well when you know when these things are the interplay is very simp once again under this heading youre looking for zone or area to audit so that you can test fly this pc whats he gonna do so you never want to hand out major actions i have come to saint hill to have power im going to want my power processin g c s hes going to have his power processing alright somebodys going to try to tell whoever is c sing around there that its really not neces sary to c s the folder before he gets his power processing because after all he hasnt had any power processing yet you dont know where this guy is within seven miles of being set up for power power only works lik bomb and only works fast ill show you how you can save time it only works fast when the pc is set up and pointed hes got to be all straight as die and then send him through power and pongo you really get resultsive seen pc completely chan ge his char acter when he was set up for power and had power alright now pc who isnt set up for it it doesnt even chan ge his arc breaks so your proper action is to make very sure that anybody comi ng in for power has his folder at once turned over to c s and that the folder whether or not you are the c s or not just make sure that the folder is turned over to c s and then they would test fly this guy so we take some completely unlimited process you know like assess list prep check it do l 1 on auditors anything you know assess list auditors auditing yowowowow do list 1 brrrrrr see item by item item by item item by item to f n well christ you can tell by the length of that list how near he is to being acceptable for power the auditor it didnt fly until item fifteen wow this case is charged up like galvanic battery ill bet you he has not even vaguely got his grades it was hard to do dont you see you could look over on the assessmen t and that all seem ed bit difficult but they managed to finally settle on auditing and then the l1 on auditing went the whole page each one reading oh wow now do you see as c s you have an estimate of charge how charged this guy is bow long does it take him to clean up his arc breaks how long does it take him to do this how long does it take him to do that it takes him long time case is heavily charged doesnt take him very long case isnt heavily charged its elementary now supposing the case has been rehabbed in keckuk on all grades and your first action of prep check took all morning and half the afternoon to get it to f n well i wouldnt i wouldnt say your auditors trs were any good doing it but this is against also against the fact that you must be dealing with very charged up case so alright let us rehab or run arc straightwire not as youve been getting arc straightwire to four fly the ruds rehab arc straightwire or run get the folder back boy youre now liable to find the damndest things you ever heard of see well we actually actually either he didnt know what arc straightwire was there was somebody that told him he was once run on recall process and he couldnt remember very much of the auditing and it didnt f n the ta hasnt gone up terribly and nothing bad has happened and so forth now youre left with riddle has he ever been run on arc straightwire hell now if the case is charged up you know at once that he hasnt actually gone up through the grades theres something missin g on the grade line now if you dont trust the auditor too much youre going to make that youre not going to throw away the whole rehab youre gonna get arc straightwire rehabbed or run fly the ruds rehab arc straightwire or run it now if you really didnt trust she auditor at all you would say check the state of arc straightwire and send back the folder now from that data we could determine whether or not to rehab it or run it so we could say rehab it or we could say run it do you follow you could you could slow it down to that that almost nowhere so the amount of action which you assign to be done is proportional to your confidence in the auditor in turning in result and factual auditing report and the action can get very damned complex after while on this sort of thing you can say do this do that do the other thing do the other thing do the other thing only god they dont have ball see because auditing which is administered quickly without any chance for any intervening ptps or anything like this really flies the guy but also auditing which administered very badly is better done in little pieces so that you can straighten it out before it all goes sour do you follow so this is the degree of approach the degree of approach in case supervision now what you audit what you order to be audited probably is occupying your attention it probably is i can turn you chart out ive been too busy working with your folders to give you chart at this time chart will be in existence at the time anybody is listening to these lectu res and its just an b c proposition one of the reasons i dont get busy on it and so on it looks too simp to the simplicity is so simp and i see people bonglebinglina around on this well my god what could they possibly be floofing about you know and yet i see i see early on in the org 8 course and with other experiences ive had recently teaching this the most complex damn c ses you ever heard of people you know they they look at theadministrative blunders of sessions as something that must be remedied i dont know why they have to go back to 1962 to get comma corrected what the hell is going on dont you see i mean im very puzzl ed about what is this surer complexity i suddenly see in my lap and its interesting that for ot cases for ot section repair and so forth its interesting that nearly all or your suggestions here toward the end of this course are dead on see youre calling your shots dead on and the only place i am in disagreement with it is i find another piece i can take off and you didnt quite see that i was heading cases for exteriorization by discharging them so i was looking for another piece i could take some charge off before id finally let it go see you get you get what i was going see cause im actually trying to set you up for 7 and 8 and this this is really the auditing youre getting im just setting you up for that it isnt it isnt that its terribly far to go or anything like that or that youre in bad shape or anything like this but in numerous instances we have actually been able to bring about exteriorization and all that sort of thing and ive been working on that and so on well this is not necessarily the target that you will find lower grade case working toward what he thinks is wrong with him what he thinks is wrong with him will be of one or two categories he isnt total ot in the last ten minutes of the first session you know so that gives him lose and it was totally unreal to him he wouldnt even know what the hell an ot was but its usually hes measuring his gains about whether or not he worries about his wife you know so all of his gains are measured against something like this or in the morning he has his foot hurts and after hes been audited does his foot hurt see this kind of thing so he has tendency with his terrific complexity to start backing you into the field of healing or something and your stable datum your stable datum on that is is the case will right itself by you simply finding any available charge you dont find any available feet you just find any available char ge now ive tried to teach you few times somebody comes in with cold or somebody comes in with an ear do you follow alright now i say i say so and so and so and so find an engram or chain and run it first available that you can find just any engram chain that you run any engram chai n you find on this case will have the ear on it do you follows yeah so its its so so its any available charge does anything you see its that gross and in doing case supervision and in auditing and so forth you dont have to grope around to find the head or the bottom of the pencil its just what ive been trying to teach you its where can you get some charge off how can we get some char ge off alright if we can get some charge off of the guy well we can straighten him up if we cant get any charge off we wont there is magic button which makes case well without taking charge off see all magic buttons they might be awfully magic but they will depend on the amount of charge they got of the case do you follow that thats thats the whole of it now theres various things that actually mechanically render this that and the other thing lets take an out of valence case case that is out of valence is already heavily charged hed have to be heavily charged now the exact mecha nics of this are very very interesting and ill let you in on one little series of processe s you may or may not know that power processing in its entirety was synthesized by myself without using it on one single pc and with having subjective reality on it of any kind whatsoever myself because i was already clear it is one of those wild tours force in the field of that i set up what case will be in the state of and then figured out what it would take to bring about certain exact end phenomenon and then wrote up each power process and then wrote up the three 5a processes on the same thing without single test without single case with subjective reality on it i didnt have any case that could be run on that little bit afterwards to give you laugh i decid ed that i should probably be run on some power processes to get subjective reality on it and about two commands later i was wrapped around seven telegraph poles it did not function boy because i was already clears and ive noticed this before when they try to rehab power after clea r when they try to run power after clear it normally throws guy into rag bag because his case is not in the shape that it takes it so its sort of cleaning clean it makes him look for things that arent there there are computations he longer has so to try to run them he sort of has to mock them up and when he does that why he says he doesnt quite own them and it tends to make them solid and youre liable to put him in the damndest black mass you ever heard of in your life and then youre going to wonder where it came from but below clear power was totally synthesized every single step of it and then i wrote up the bulletins of power and they were all experimental bulletins and put people onto power and did my first power cases and so forth and they all came out like that and i was watching it like hawk because i was doubly trebly critical of it because itd been totally synthesized how the hell did these end phenomena be so exact he so right on see they were perfect on the line so that was the they were supposed to behave and that was the way they behaved and it wasn t because i was saying so because i was saying they shouldnt behave that way and they went right on up the line bong bong bong bong bong and we had power processing now this is an interesting tour force now there is another zone where this has just occur red in the low ta case in order to teach this first class viii course i had to know what low ta case was i knew what high ta case was but i had to solve once and for all what was the low ta case so i could give you the hot dope because that would make zone or area in doubt which was in the technique which would continue to worry you now i could handle low ta case at ot 3 because its forced into one position or another by body thetans either the body thetans are gone and hes still standing back thinking theyre still there you can do various things at this but i had to know the identity of this well first it could be cured more or less at power pr pr 6 has tendency if run exactly correctly to cure low ta case and it cures few of them but i had to find out exactly what this was so i sat back and i figured out exactly what is low ta case exactly what is one and i want to teach you this exact mecha nic because this was totally by synthesis i hadnt had low ta dont know anything about them reality on this of any kind whatsoever so i had to figure it out from scratch and here is the basic background of the low ta case now let now let show you here let show you here what we will call time track now this time track here is wide from the bottom up in terms of time we dont care what gradients they are this is the actual time track in which he would be in valence you got it he would be in valence ok now at this low point of the time track we have an area where the individual has had an incident on his own time track which is so gruesome that he has gone into the behavior i have seen on some preclea rs some preclears desert their own sphere and action to point where in the engram you pick it up originally you fine theyre little girl in the cowd at this execution and they cant quite tell what kind of an execution it is but theyre little girl in the crowd and you run it through the next time and you fine out that there were actually post on they think maybe the gallows and then you run it througn again and you find out they finally discovered who they were they were the headsmans axe and its beheading and then you run it through again and you find out that theyre the headsman and then you run it througn again and so help pete there they are on the block and down comes the axe in other words theyve gone out of valence successively and repeatedly further and further out of valence you got it that was because they wouldnt want to be that they couldnt confront being there and so on now that experimental data is from way way back way way way way back 1952 and so forth so i would action what the hell is this low ta i know when the guy goes out of valence i have this much check on it when he goes into valence of body thetan or he goes out of valence he goes into low ta well what the hell could this be alright well what it was is he had this horrible experience and he moved off there off the time track he moved from here over to there he went he says to hell with being that guy that guy gets into trouble im somebody else now so there he was safely over there now that experience then keys out and you see by dotted line here he comes back onto his own time track and then he lives for little while on his own time track and then one day somebodys selling headsmans axes or something and he goes flip and actually he goes back into that incident its lock hes now out of valence again do you see you got it and every time you have lock on this you charge that up some more charge the basic i ncident up some more see so thats another bar another bar on the side over here see so now he comes up the line again and he comes all trustworthy and everything is fine and he thinks life is gorgeous and everything is ok and all of sudden he gets himsel f into he finds himself standing on the platform of amongst crowd and he says oh my god you know reality break ahhh break where to go another lock puts another one on here down on this basic one see well try to label the engram and this is lock one the first time it happened lock two the second time it happened now he comes back over here more cautiously but when he runs into little girl like the one in the crowd he goes bango out here out of valence which is lock three got it each time its takes him longer and longer and longer to come back onto his own time track and to be himself do you see and every time this happens there was lock one lock two and lock three theyre adding up char ge down here now after while down here in the engram the guy that thing is just so charged up with locks he couldnt get anywhere near it he just couldnt come close to it so that if you tried to get it by normal engram running he just wouldnt go near it and anybody who even faintly invalidates him hes in such state after while anybody who faintly invalidates him drives him out of valence so his tone arm goes down so on such person invalidation knocks his tone arm out of sight that means that there is such an incident as this on the track it is so neglected that even though he knows hes mockin g things up and so forth he doesnt even know enough about it to know that hes still mocking it up do you see that mechanism well i figured this all out synthetically this is all synthetic cause i dont have it so what i did is i put together whole bunch of words which when assessed would make guy have the idea of moving on his own time track over to there overwhelmed driven out wiped out anything you could think of whereby he was gone here and appeared over here at the engram now when we assess that this is the way it this is the reason it works when we assess it by wiped out overwhelmed list lx1 when we assess this thing why we get the basic postulate thats got him over here weve kicked the edge of it its something like boy i dont want there to be anymore of that whoa and which comes under dislocated see or denied or some hes expressed it in some fashion do you see and now heres the oddity in order to run this engram or get near this track we have got to discha rge the locks off the top of it so we recall being whatever assessed and that wuf wuf that puts as you see these big xs that knocks that off then that also knocks that much charge off the engram now we find the engram of being he goes right there and you get the engram wiped out now all of sudden he can get into valence now just to make sure that he isnt also hung with the overt you can also run the overt chain of engrams doing each one past an f n that is to say youve got an f n on the locks you got an f n on the on the motivator engram and you can get an f n also on the overt engram well by that time all of this slide out of valence every time i turn around is cured and then he can get back to asisin g his own time track because the trouble with this guy is is every time he goes out of valence or is the least bit invalidated he cant get any case gain the auditor sits into the session and slightly invalidates him he slides out of valence and therefore he doesnt asis what hes running so it wont f n he actually arc break needles hes just dead body you got the silly mechanics of this well apparently thats the way it is thats exactly the way it works out the wildest thing you ever saw in your life so this type of action is as part and parcel of discha rging case do i make my point yes now this was an important zone or area of discha rge because i found there was some people that even though you did four rundown nothing much happened so we had to figure out because that coordinated against the fact they were low ta cases now the odd part of it is you can do this exact action at engram level now this really puts one into your hands boy that takes case thats all the way down there at the bottom of the grades well you can undoubtedly run it again up along the line someplace it will have changed but this actually will run clear down at the level of dianetic engram so youve got powerful tool in your hands so you find this guy and he just cant seem to make it and hes got black field and he cant see anything well of course what he should do is get ot 3 but as the chance s of running ot 3 on him without procee ding up through the grades is so slight as to skip it you couldnt do anything with it hed look at you incredulously he wouldnt believe anything about anything but you can do this hell run very shallowly hell probably stay in this lifetime the engram will erase he wont have any real idea of whats happening but boy will he discharge enough and all of sudden he isnt the black field case now thats your rough case not necessarily the case with the black field cause he intends to be very often high but theyre alike overcharged they alike dont asis but if you get your low ta case thats the one you use got it i tell you itd work on either one of them but its your low ta case special any such put together as you see in lx1 and the handling of it is one two three four and you know exactly what it is alright now lets take another case lets take this well lets take what used to be the black five theres the invisible one too see but theres the black five and hes way up through the roof and hes reading at 5 on the ta now that comes down ordinarily on the process what has been overrun rehabbing each one youre going to have your heart broken here and there where you give that process out because somebodys liable to just make list the worst youll see on it is they make list and they dont even put down what read and they dont rehab any of it and theyve made you your list you could even explain it to some guys and say now look you list what has been overrun this way what has been overrun it is not legitimate listing question it merely gives you an assessment its sort of of horrible thing which lies between list ng and nutting and assessme nt see its neither fish nor fowl it is simply an auditing question which you happen to write the answe rs down on thats all you could do the same thing you could write the answ ers down to level zero see and youd find one agreed and another agreed and it wouldnt come out to one item cause its not listing auestion but you can use this so the pc is asked what has been overrun and then he lists and he gets long fall maybe he lists the first one and it doesnt read at all so you dont touch it and then long fall alright very good peeling potatoes you simp ly rehab peeling potatoes and you know ive seen the most complicated rehabs recen tly and i suddenly remembered that the earliest rehab bulletins and so on have not been condensed and rewritten theres too much tech in those things those they contain the actual comp lete steps of rehab and rehab does go that way but it isnt that hard to rehab its just how often was he released on the subject is all you need for rehab and it goes f n and thats it so you dont have to follow those those early early rehab remember those were back written just about the time i was synthesizing power and for the first time found that auditors had been overrunning f ns and experience since that time has brought more data to view and the data which we have brought to view is simply that it is only neces sary to ask them the number of times they went release while doing something and they f n particularly if you make them count up the times its very simple so you could you could actually overrun rehabbing if you get it too complicated and the only reason people dont rehab and why it had to be trickily rehabbed is because the rehab itself was hard to deliver to the pc so its been very simp lified how often were you released see count the number of times how often were you release d that didnt f n or were you released didnt f n on that so count the number of times and guy counts the number of times and all of sudden you get an f n and thats it and its an elementary action now while youre doing that you have to watch it cause theres one thing that you dont at this time do is you have to watch it to make sure that your trs remain in you watch it because you see you could rehab operations or something like this and get an arc broke needle on it and not notice it but an arc break needles very easy to establish because youve got bad indicators with it alright rehab bad indicators with it why just ask if theres an arc break or something in connection with this subject its as easy to do as that and you put in the ruds before the release and it then flies and the actual mecha nism which youre using is if you you know it wont rehab or something like this and the f n is an arc break needle theres trouble here some kind or another just put in the ruds on the subject and thats quite allowable because its on that subject so it limits it now when you try to put in the ruds if you put in the ruds generally something like this made cough to think about it if you put in the ruds something weird like this in living you know in living hefore before living was there an arc break enough to make anybody cough now this is silly one see you see you could ask the guy in any limited way so in the taking in the taking of ether hes an ether sniffer or something and it wont f n something like this and you could ask him well in the taking of ether was there any arc break or something like that because youve limited it and actually what youll do is put in the arc break and so forth and youll get your f n probably on the arc break to hell with the ether it probably doesnt have any f n in connection with it do you follow so that you can slide and get yourself sideways out of rehab by putting in the ruds in the vicinity of that rehab you got it so you dont get caug ht in trap of having f n i know its its rather its is it going to i tested this out one time on the subject of death well it was obvious that any mass existed because there had also been release its true because it makes sort of gpm freedom trapped do you see its sort of gpm sitting along here so anyplace guys got lot of mass he must be comparing it to release so in any area of mass theres release available somewhere in it now it takes consi derable glib auditing skill to all of sudden say da da da da been release d and so forth well yes you get fall on it the only reason its hung up is theres also release in it you ask this fellow well now you say you were taking kerosene for kicks and then it releases and the needle doesnt move and nothing happens and there isnt anything to that its all the same well dont try to force through release cause there is none theres gonna have to be some needle action but if theres mass there theres also release there you can ask yourself if this guy is so stuck in the stuff how does he also get to here cause he is in pt he is in present time well howd he get here well he must have moved out of what he was i n see that thats quite quite obvious so of course if he moved out of what he was in he was stopping it because it was overrun as i gave you in the last lecture so he has the mass which hes got stop on it but remember hes still here he isnt there so obviously you can find release point do you see theres nothing much to this actually but if you swea t at it too hard you get him up to stopping it and you can get the stop point and then it wont release and the ta will go up so its rather slippery action so you count the number of times or something like that and you dont sweat at it very hard if it wont release it wont release and youre going to run into this sooner or later find somebody who wont release now there is way that you can still get release on it you say well did you take anything earlier on the track that was similar to kerosene oh yes yes we used to take balderdash in the old days i just remembered yes f n thank you you can get yourself out of that one because the overrun is so overrun that the releases are longer available in it dont you see but these few well chosen approaches to the subject give you road out so we do what has been overrun anything hed list can be rehabbed if it reads it can be rehabbed because hes longer stall with it so there is release point which is registered in it all you got to do is make it do its release point again and hell come off the obsessive stop hell cease to mock it up now if its driven down to an arc break needle by this it will be because theres roughness in the session normally but you can now put in the ruds with regard to it or the session and itll rehab and if it just wont rehab at all then you just think well what was similar to kerosene earlier on the track and you can rehab that and that will rehab kerosene do you understand thats very simple action youve probably been amazed to sit there and watch those f ns happen so fast well it is tribute to your smoothness as an auditor but youre going to have grade 2 class 2 trying to do this for you and so forth he will really be sweating and hell be saying but how could it you know what if it doesnt what if i dont get an f n on it that will be the question which you will be having to answ er and the answ er is well you better had and you just tell him to ask for if it was and how many times and if he cant do it to cease and desist the session at once and knock it off on the first one dont let him go through twelve of them if he cant do it he cant do it but the mechanism of it can be so exaggerated and there can be so much data on it you know wow you have to have the idea however there is such thing as mental mass the mental mass is there because its hung up on the track because of gpm the guy did get out of it one he was released before he got into it and two he was release d when he got out of it and in the middle of it someplace he may have been released half dozen times so anyway the net result of this is that you have lot that you can do now after the guys gone along i mean in c sing youve got lot of it when guys gone along in auditing for six and half months and he hasnt had session for that length of time and he comes back in again and his ta is up and so forth the probability is that theres an overrun in between and what has been overrun is completely unlimited process youre just trying to find out what can we rehab on the case so the guy puts the item down the item reads the auditor rehabs it do you see what s been overrun weighing fish baskets very good alright is there point of release on your weighing fish baskets oh yes f n alright oh yes f n how many times ff ff ff ff one two three four five six every night every night there was moment of release i would leave work f n thank you so youre getting off those overruns one right after the other so discha rging the case with anything that would handle throwing him out of valence its your lx1 approach and they can do more than one of those thats your low ta that he r ses easily by the way low ta case also r ses easily and then your high ta your high ta is overruns and it is vital that you rehab them now your normal ta your normal ta might be just nasty tempered or something but he is readily solvable readily solvable but you still might have to discha rge this so setting us pc to have the arades run gives gain on the grades the like of which you never heard of before wheee now its shame to see somebody use the grades to take the ta down or something dumb like this oh ive seen it done ive seen it done its sham to see somebody who has come through the grades and all hes handled is his current ptp hes actually worried about getting back to keokuk and all you see in the arade responses is getting back to keokuk i could talk about getting back to keokuk my wife will worry if she gets back to keckuk its service facsimile i could make people wrong by not getting back to keokuk so the case isnt set up so you can always get an estimate not on personality analysis but you can always get an estimate the length of time in session the thickness of the review forms and so on and the number of actions which you take is proportional to the numbers of actions which have had to be taken its direct coordination so you know immediately its resistive case now some people are going to resist like mad having resistive case run on them because they thinks its an evaluation so you can call it special case but it doesnt mean anything it just gives you something else to run and in great many of these cases they wont solve even vaguely before you pound right through on that resistive case thats your real resistive case boy when you do the assessment on that thing and it says former therapy fall fall fall fall fall youre liable to find something on the order of when youre dealing with the public at large youre liable to find wild ones nothing can guys in scientology in fairly good shape but boy you can find some wild ones in people walking in off the street they after every session they have to go see their priest to get their throat cut or something you know its crazy business you know they cant have sometimes only learn about it they cant have session on saturday because then thats when they go to see their orthodoptrist or something and you say who s this and then you find out he goes to person who puts his feet in machi ne and turns on bunch of electricity in order to straighten out the bones and this is the general somatic which youve been trying to handle on the case so you can get some weird ones going and they are interesting and you can get very involved with these people but actually hes doing something else hes mixing therapies thats for sure but when you find these things are out why you can correct them one way or the other but when you get right down to handling the actual c s of the run of the mill case the only thing youre trying to do is get enough charge off so that it can run the grade and then boy will it make gain and theres several ways you can do that i havent enumerated all the ways that you could do it but theyre equally simp theyre all the simple idiot order of things like you do little assessme nt you prep check it you take things like well items connected with his profession do an l1 on it now what determines what you do on it is relatively the mood youre in you say actually im not gagging with it because there is determination on the thing one of the reasons you prep check the thing as it comes through one of the reasons why you prep check it as it goes through is one the action is easy to do and its totally unlimited and you feel that the item is suppressed or is pushed down the reason you do an l1 is you feel that hes upset about it or arc broken concer ning it you got it there is there is reason behind the two things im giving you gag i should be careful of my gags now but theyre simple things and they can apply to anything now youve got in the there are several things which have won out well trying to pull missed withhold by force and duress and so on is very often winds you up in the soup very now and then because you may be going up against low ta case invalidation involved gives you r ses all over the track or something dumb like this is liable to occur did it ever occur to you to prep check the missed withholds theyll come out just the same you dischar ge it to point where the guy is willing to look at it because hes sort of out of valence on the whole subject so your best answe r to hard to pull missed withholds that you cant get out and that sort of thing your best answ er to it is actually prep check rather than an auditor pushing him up against the wall with pistol and prep check works very well on it your upset conditions are ordinarily best handled with upset conditions are best handled in ordinarily actions with an l1 or some species of list like an l1 it can be handled in two ways one while the pc is upset in the session it can actually be assessed by general assessme nt to one item which you then give the guy as what is wrong with him in the session that actually can be handled that way to handle session arc break that you dont seem to be able to get to first base on that can be handled that way and that was actually its first reason for design couldnt talk to the pc anymore but you could still assess it and you could go tearing down the line get the one that was left reading indicate the bypassed charge to the pc and you with just absolute magic the pcll just cool right off that can be handled that way can be handled in auditing with an on or in sessions has and then just take that line and clear it take the next line and clear it take the next line and clear it take the next line and clear it those are the two methods of handling an l1 you can always take any list and assess it now the one thing that is adventurous to do is to assess green form that has proven very unsuccessful green form is very successful its handled itsa earlier itsa on cases that do not have very many remedy bs or anything like that they havent had s and d something like this they are connected to suppressiv or something such hatting of that is best handled by an s and d with w with your withdraws unmock stop assessment which one is it and then you do that remedy b now and thats done by listing and nulling of course i said an s and d its done by just listing and nulling now your remedy b if environment beads if guy hasnt had too many of them and so on your best bet at environment and so on is in actual fact remedy b new style and what youve got for your student who cant seem to dig it is to find out what the hell subject hes trying to dig while hes trying to study dianetics and scientology it works like bomb you have to find the former subject and what is misunderstood in that in other words the study remedy b now you can also take the dianetics remedy b and you can run it on an psych ologist and if youre ever gonna teach him anything you damn well better had and you handle it the same way this doesnt seem to this hasnt been too heavily stressed but you could take in psych ology do you see why who or whats been misunderstood something like this then you take that item and youre past but you wait minute were already handling the guys past the guys got some earlier subject than psychology see there was some earlier subject already hung him up so you could say in psych ology who or whats been misunderstood and youd get an item and then that straightens out the subject for him sort of remedy with regard to psych ology you see or you could make it remedy and you get something and you get an answe r and then you list for the earlier subject it was earlier in psychology and then you can find out what was misunderstood in that so theres several ways you can play this cat its all the same thing its all the same action so that we take psych ologist he comes in hes unable to understand what were doing he cant dig it any way or whatsoever you can run remedy as though hes studying psychology do you see and get his misunderstood off the field of psych ology and then he can study this but that didnt work so you do the deeper one do you understand now your rule in case supervision simply follows this is the reality of the case is proportional to the amount of charge off you want to undertake if possib the simp lest possib action undertake the simplest action available and dont undertake the deeper action until the simp ler action has proven ineffective and then youve still got shot in your locker now the next thing about it is is all cases going in to review or something like that should be run on some such formulization as green form youll never find out whats wrong with him but youd have to teach people to run the whole green form with lists before you could trust them with it otherwise youre gonna run us fabulous numbers of remedy bs fabulous numbers of s and ds get into all kinds of fire fights all over the place do you understand youll get overreviewing only because theres listing on the green form do you follow then you dont ever permit anybody to eve send anybody over and say what qual should do with them do you understand i mean some organizational executive cannot send the whole staff in for sea checks cannot send the whole staff in for disagreement checks cannot send the whole staff in for you got it to hell with that cause it causes the case supervisor infinite trouble hes got more cases to straighten out now than you can count so youve had given too many sec checks so therefore you make it firm rule that nobody can order qual to do anything and then to do that then you have to hold qual to green form and then youll have to force qual never to run green form past an f n and then dont let them list because thats the one theyll goof up the most and then teach them itsa and eariler itsa anyway do you see the hang of it the administration and the general handling of the case supervisor yes alright very good thank you very much the basics and simplicity of standard tech lecture given on 13 october 1968 whats the lecture number seventeen lecture number seventeen and the date thirteenth of october ad 18 and this is one of those what day is it sunday sunday well i guess f riday the thirteenth came on sunday alright ok actually ive told you everything you need to know and i have notes and really im just filling in time because i like to talk to you our problems are all before us really as we finish up come to the end of the course theyre not behind us in front of us for the excellent reason that as case supervisor and with your course supervisors we faced at the beginning of the course if anything less t rouble than you face so i am trying to make it as easy for you as i can and trying to give you anything i know which might make your lot little bit simpler and the main thing that makes life rough is the apparency of failure of tech an apparency of the failure of tech and thats what throws it all out of line that is the one thing that throws it all out of line whatever else might be thought to go out of line that one for sure throws it out of line the apparency of failure of tech now i say the apparently of the failure of tech because it always is just an apparency there are many reasons why tech doesnt go in but they are all under the head of it isnt applied somebody gets reasonable theres false resort somew here on the line these are the two chief sources of how an apparency of failed tech occu rs in instruction or supervision of courses supervisor can be so enturbulative that he can actually invalidate the straight data and then because the straight data is gone pull into line great deal of squirrell data to take its place and we have seen that happen before remark like theres reason to study your basic s what you want is the upper level theory thats completely bonkers there isnt any upper level theory there is basics and when the basics are in its in and thats it the main thing about it is is you are working with and trying to get auditing results from and trying to get coached actions out of people who are so overburdened with confusion that whenever you try to put in stable simple datum lot of confusion is liable to fly off its the old problems of work confusion and the stable datum so you try to teach somebody now look confront consists of sitting in chair looking at the pc and actually youll put two people in chair in two chairs facing each other and you say this is all there is to tr 0 now youve got to confront him and youve got to confront him and youve got to do it for couple of hours and thats that now do you know that more god damned balderdash well have to edit out all these swea r words i got to preserve the image of being saintly very hard image to preserve its so out of character the simple action of two people facing each other is so intolerable that it backs right up into supervision so they sit there and break their confront by one flunking the other its an additive the actual action of tr 0 is two people who can sit facing each other for two hours without doing damned thing now do you get the second it starts to you start to put in that simp licity from there on it gets into hell of confusion now i dont know how youve been taught doing it lately thats criticism of how youve been taught doing it im just showing you the basic drill was simp ly to sit looking at the other fellow for couple of hours without break without flicker without anything now if there was anybody observing it it would be not the coach but the supervisor and any time guy batted his eyelids and went twitching and scrunching and fell out of the chair and started to talk and anything of this sort it would be up to somebody else to start him on his two hours all over again now if theres coach and student involved you can reduce it to this so as to take the strain off the supervisor where one is doing the confronting and the other is doing the coaching well now you could add it up now you see how it goes you could add it up to where the coacn doesnt have to do confront but the student does have to do confront and the coach he flunks the student every time the coach cant confront i know that isnt quite right lets take look at this and we start from two people who are going to sit facing each other because that is the one thing men have an awful hard time doing sitting still doing nothing and yet it is an essential because out of the failure of that drill comes an auditor trying to be interesting and trying to enturbulate session so an auditor who is enturbulative to his pc whose trs are out cann ot in actual fact sit for two hours and do absolutely nothing lets get back to basics how basic can you get that is the basic on that drill now in trying to engineer it and in trying to make it work various ways why coach is appointed who policed the other guys confront do you follow now you could comp licate it further by the coach would do various things to try to break the other fellows confront but supposing they did those two things without getting that first one supposing neither one of them could actually sit there for two hours and not be interesting and not do anything and not say anything thats the acid test so even tr 0 can fly upstairs to later complication and forget the early action right so you get down to simp licity the most successful acc that was ever conducted on the subject of trs had this as its maxim every question student asked about trs he was simp ly read the tr the supervisor was completely stopped from saying anything in answe r to the question he simp ly got the trs back and in bafflement in arc break in upset and otherwise the guy finally had to study the thing out for himse lf and by golly we got trs in they really went in in that particular acc they were doing pretty good job by the time it ended simplicity now of course there can be an additional on confront yes of course of course there can be coach who flunks the other guy for not confronting naturally but lets start it out where it belongs can two people sit facing each other without doing thing without twitching at all for two solid consecut ive hours without whisper now if they can do that then you can do something else with tr 0 do you see how basic the basic is well what happens youll ask him to do anything as simple as that and immediately bunch of questions and confusions start blowing off i dont care how youve been taught your trs here it is comp letely irrelevant im just using it as point im just trying to show you demonstration here now the auditor whos got to be interesting who cant administer who cant do this who cant learn his meter who cant get his tr 1 or his tr 2 in actually cant pass that test can he sit for two hours absolutely doing nothing now if he can do that great and if you had somebody supervising that operation who started his two hours out every time he flunked it you put clock up there for that session like one of these photo timers and the guy all of sudden started going this way or started doping off or something like that somebody simply hit the button to begin the two hours you would wind up with unenturbulative sessions now to that ability you can add speak ing replying handling origins handling meter now if you can do all those things without any question and with great calm ness then you can add to it the admin neces sary and youve built it up from somewhere so all im trying to show you here is just an example of how you build it up if you started in on this basis this individual youre trying to teach this individual just one thing youre trying to teach him that an f n must be put down on the report form now you obviously have got to show him what is an f n hes got to know what an f n is youve got to know what report form is and he has to be built all the way up to there or you cant teach him now its very remarkable that we have just found case which has had bit of trouble with auditing and has been little bit difficult to handle in session and ill be of gun if there werent about three lower grades that had never been run here the person had gone all the way up into the ot sections with three lower grades hanging fire now itll make tremendous difference tremendous difference because those three lower grades have now been put in it will now make tremendous difference to the case in its progress because what happens is is when some lower step is missin g on the staircase and the fellow doesnt make it he just more or less keeps marking time on that step now the grade what they call the gradation chart is the only ladder anybody is climbing now and i can actually give you and will simplified gradation chart which gives you the exact whats and whiches as it goes up there are several of them struck out on the original issue one is the cchs in lieu of problems its not in lieu of its not in lieu of problems at all if you had to run the cchs in order to run problems you would run both the cchs and the problems process you cant run the cchs and then say the guys problems release do you follow doesnt make sense but i can give you simplified gradation chart and will but where those blocks are missi ng on the line the case is not going to do well and the higher they go the more trouble they will have and then can even get up to point of where theyre trying to make clear and keep falling on their heads try to make clear and fall on their heads try to make clear and fall on their heads try to make clear and fall on their heads there isnt enough charge off thats the whole thing not enough char ge off the case now look you know about that ive told you all about that but lets look at training and lets apply the same gradation idea to training where you leave out basic simp licity the guy will now have complexity and his training will go around the bend so we find this fellow who cann ot in actual fact turn in session its always some weird thing pc falls on his head afterwards and so on now were going to look for some very comp lex reason because thats all were going to get off this fellow thats for sure all were going to get off of him in explanation is very very complex reasons well you see i really dont hold with the idea that man is basically spirit or basical ly good actually he might or mignt not be and that has always been difficult for and therefore my training well that has something to do with male cows he cant audit because hes got basics gone on his gradation scale of training theres something brother he doesnt know nothin about now you could take your little handy jim dandy made up assessmen t and you could actually find out what it was this is getting very clever this is the case supervisor fixing guy up so he can be trained and we do an assessment and it has the steps of training see trs emeter administration reports you get the idea you just go along the whole thing and you could even rack it up till theres gradient sort of scale of the things you learn assess the thing out and youll find the hole and itll be big hole all you have to do all youd have to do then if you are auditing it of course is prep check it something like that and you will find out exactly what it is and so on but you werent doing it for that reason youre trying to find out where hes missin g on training and you find out itll be something very stupid itll be something very stupid hell finally tell you that the week he was supposed to go through the comm course in the academy actually that week he had to be out and there was good reason for it because he actually had suit going at that time and if he hadnt been present so he wasn t able to take the comm course its something stupid like this and itll be something big now when you know the standard steps of something the reasons why somebody cant attain it look like boulders theyre not tiny little pebbles that are very very hard to find theyre all through their auditing reports theyre all through their training reports it beco mes very very obvious but you have to in order to appreciate that break down what are the steps what are the things one has to be able to do in order to audit what are the things one has to be able to do now you could do something this simp this is all under the heading of standard tech that would be standard auditing there are certain things youd have to know how to do youd have to know how to run an emeter and youd have to know how to write and you would have to know you get it youd have to know these little simplicities you could make list of what they are and theyre not many now on case what does the fellow have to be able to do the fellow has to be able to relax enough in order to well he has to be able to talk lets start lower than that he has to be able to extrovert to some degree so that he can find out that there is somebody trying to talk to him about something more than social conversation now you pick up many pc and when you first start when you first start this is gonna blow your head off in minute when you first start auditing them they audit very slow and very badly and then you run what youve got and you run arc straightwire the old style is the one that really makes the gains that is recall something that was really real to you see theyre not the little tiny shortened commands i dont know where they came from its the long ones recall something really real to you time when you were recall time when you were in good comm unicat ion with someone those are the real ones and all of sudden the guy extroverts enough to find out theres an auditor there now hes still introverted but you run some secon daries to f n you find moments of loss and ill show you how this can be skimped somebody can get the locks by recall loss run and then mark down that the fellow has gone release on secondaries and you know ive seen it on now on folder after folder the guy was never run on secon dary in his life they just said recall moment of loss and the guy f ned on it and they said thats it hes been run on secondaries what damn lie youve seen the mecha nism working right now you run guy we can recall moment of loss and then you can go back and run guy through an engram of loss pardon you can run him through an engram of loss you can run him through secondary of loss you can run him through both i have something to tell you about that tonight i might as well you now one of the reasons we know that every secondary which is mise motional incident has below it an engram is because every once in while somebody falls through the ice youre trying to run secondary and you find yourself running an engram it just happened on case today it isnt something to really blame an auditor for unless he forces somebody from the secondary into the engram but every misem otional moment has moment of pain immediately and directly underlying it theres pain and unco nscio usness on the earlier track than every secondary but secondary can be run independently the deaths of loved ones and that sort of thing boy you can make pc shed buckets of tears when you really run secondary but look how look how it could be skimped recall moment of loss yes thank you good that f ned fellow just recalled losing paper clip then he f ned cause h didnt think it was important see now you say hes secondary release ta da ta da ta da ta da god damn ive seen woman who looked like she was about sixty five when she was about thirty five run on secondary real secondary and run through it for blood for real come out at the other end looking like she was about twenty one theres terrific gain to be gained there alright this extroverts the person some more dont you see now you take the available engram and youre going to find this is also going to include his psycho somatic illnesses if you really run the available engram this is gonna be the chronic ache or pain that he complains about the most so you run that you extrovert him some more now youve extroverted him to point of where he can really see the auditor now hes ready to consi der communication up to that time he could do the comm ands something might get some place but you now have for sure extroverted him youve extroverted his attention you would be absolutely amazed but certain percentage of pcs who walk into session and so on never see wall they see picture of wall in front of wall and you have to interrogate them very closely to know whats going on because it seems too usual to them to be remarked on so they see picture of the wall in front of the wall whenever they see wall now dont think that these characters dont make mistakes when they start to handle machi nery and plow cars off the road the guys who cant drive on roads and have accidents on roads are exclusively just doing this theyre doing it with wild abandonment theyre driving on mocked up road and theyre driving with mocked up controls theyre confront is not up to looking at the control panel of an automobile or at the gear shift or through the windshield they depend on looking at picture in other words its safer to look at the picture than it is to look at the actual object because the actual object they think could kick them in the teeth there are lots of these guys around so you sit down and you try to short it all up and you say were going to run communication process zero without setting this case up well you could often find you can often find case is not running because its sub zeros are out the case hasnt been extroverted enough to really be audited on something analytical something like communication and so on youve got to dig them up dig em up and audit em is your process of line now this is whatll knock your head off do you know that theres tremendous numbers of cases running in the ot sections that cann ot define an arc break do not know what missed withhold is do not know what present time problem is so that you ask them for missed withhold you get ptp you ask them for an arc break and you get missed withhold you ask em for an arc break you get ptp you ask them for ptp youll get an arc break and i have seen auditors sufficiently foggy on the subject to ask the person for an arc break get ptp and then run arcu on it and wonder why he cant get read thats why you cant get the ruds in talk about the blind leading the blind if the auditor doesnt know what these ruds are exactly why and then the pc never has had the command cleared for him how could you ever get the ruds in it isnt that the words are addressed to some tune you actually have to get these ruds in there are real arc breaks there the pc doesnt know what to call them and he doesnt know that those are arc breaks do you see how auditing could be screamingly out now have you ever heard of clearing command well why dont you clear rudiment comm ands see thats an omissi on well its an omissi on because after its been done time or two on pc it doesnt have to be done anymore neve rtheless if i was auditing pc and i got some kooky answ er i ask for an arc break and the guy says yes i cant make up my mind whether to leave my husband or not wow i would know doggone well i would know doggone well that this character had never had his rudiments clean and i wouldnt take it up so as to arc break him or drown him or force him or knock him in the head in session i wouldnt i would let him get away with it one session and then the next session i would clean those rudiments up by com mand until they ran out of his ears you understand but in order to do that i would have to know what they were wouldnt i so let us take such thing as an arc break what the hell is an arc break its break in affinity reality or communication or understanding and that is everything it is and that is all it will ever be now thats break in affinity now what is break in affinity it is represented by emotion now any emotion below affinity is of course in the range of the field of emotion and do you know i had somebody the other day defining an arc break and defining affinity as unhappiness upse t ow wow awful what the hell so somebody when they say im trying to attain arc with somebody would be defining it as something they didnt want to have so therefore you would get backwa rds answ er to every arc break if they like somebody they would have an arc break because so we would get into some wild screaming mess here of some kind or another now heres an even worse one here is worse one believe it or not just today i did session from another zone where recall was defined as going back on the track and going through it and the auditor was little bit upset and he didnt catch it and straighten it out he didnt redefine it as remember he didnt do anything to squa re this thing out and i think very often auditors consi der trying to clarify the comm and as evaluation of some kind what youre trying to do is make the english com straightwe ran into guy not too long ago who couldnt run havingness because he didnt own anything that is to say he had bill of sale to it he couldnt run havingness cause he didnt have any bills of sale another thing is we have childs dictionary on board and the damn thing says source is starting point you cant define it to child and then run pr pr 4 because thats definition of source so somewhere along the line im sure going to have to write down the accurate definitions of these words in english sounds absolutely incredible that youd have to rewrite the english language for the english speaking people its in their big dictionaries were not using it incorrectly affinity is affinity but somehow or other people get this thing going now lets look at this recall as return do you realize that you could never then do an lx1 set the case up couldnt how could you do an lx1 and set it up with recall process and then run the engram you couldnt because hed always run the engram now look at the horrible mess this case would be in he goes through life recalling or remembering things by going back on the track and going into the engram look now thats what we mean by basics are out the command is not understood the command is not delivered the command is not answ ered this guy was actually asked to recall an lx1 thing and defined it as going back on the track and going through it was asked the recall question after giving this definition he answ ered it just once and after that they had to run the engram he ran the engrams very badly because they wouldnt couldnt be set up and here was marvelous point of education this fellow had never heard of recalling hes never heard of remembering he doesnt remember so what the hell good is reviews the review would be pointless you could review this guy endlessly forever if you just hunt and punched and punched and hunted and the commands that hes been given have never been cleared with him he never answ ers the auditing comm and it doesnt matter what you do with him he cant discha rge the bank all you do is plunge him into it now the reason the reviews would be good is because the second he leaves the session and suddenly remembers that they didnt take up aunt hatties death he promptly throws himself into the secondary to remember aunt hatties death this pc d oesnt know how to remember now ive run against cases like this before and i make them run the engram of having come in the room mm make em run entering the room for the session as an engram do you realize therere people around who live in the physical universe as perpetual engram each successive moment of the time track is just another moment of pain and unconsciousness its the wildest thing you ever saw and this person inevitably would give you recall process as returning theyre charged up like galvanic battery you say did the letter come the fellow moves back down the track to when the postman appeared and moves through the incident in order to give the answ er and the funny part of it is is this guy always has this weird comm lag which you never can quite figure out when you try to talk to him and thats what hes doing now of course this stuff doesnt erase because its too late on the track hes moving through life as perpetual engram now when you actually throw him into an engram that has violent fire fight of some kind or another he really falls on his head and the only way he gets an f n is by bouncing bounce into pt or bounce into the future or something of this sort and then you get sort of an f n with gis so you get case like this see and you audit it or you get somebody if youre trying to train how do you get this guy going how do you how do you actually get him to audit these are very difficult problems unless you know the magic answe r there is something missing along the line of the ordinary which theyre making very extraordinary indeed or theres just something missing cause you believe that somebody has turned up pretending to be class vi pretending to have been fully trained in academies and on the saint hill course pretending to have gone through and been audited on every grade up to ot 4 who knew nothing about an engram nothing about meter nothing about auditing nothing about nomenclature this was mysterious character to have walking around in the environment person is allegedly about ot 4 and theyre supposed to know about auditing but they talk to joe blitz and all of sudden after talking to joe blitz joe blitz in some incalcu lable fashion is arc broken and you say what did you tell him well i didnt tell him anything i just told him his english actually wasn t up to being able to answe r the auditing commands and that hed better go study his english little bit more and the guy was an englishman you see you get fend off of some kind or another his arc break was auditing cause he blew him but good hes never studied hadnt been to any academy never been through the saint hill course never been audited on the lower grades and had never opened the cover of single ot section but had simply received them and turned them back in this was revealed when pretending to have class vi almost except for the last item or two on the checksheet we sent to saint hill to get that checksheet and voluminous correspondence ensued and the people at saint hill looked all over for that checkshee t and they couldnt find that checksheet and we finally checked it up and really got the facts on it the reason they couldnt find the checksheet is she wasnt on the saint hill course long enough to be issued one but had simply walked onto the course been told she had to have checksheet and had blown now character like this makes fantastic spoof because that characters pretending like crazy to have had this that or the other thing for various reasons and so you as case supervisor or you as training supervisor come along and youll take this on its facev alue but it doesnt go anyplace there is something very missi ng and that is what will give you your apparency of tech failures you will immediately consider the preponderances that something has been done wrong the majority of these apparencies of tech failures is nothing was done at all its the crazi est situation you ever really cared to walk into its sort of situation that haunts you after while but look at the arc break this person must lay into the environment he has allegedly been trained alright if hes been trained how come he doesnt know if hes an ot 4 how come he goes around trying pardon not ot 4 but if hes grade four how come hes going around trying to mane everybody wrong do you see the people in his immediate vicinity become mystified and it operates as an invalidation of tech well thats serious in its own area it has an affect upon morale and it lays mystery into the environment and this happen all too frequently i assure you but that isnt actually the basis of what im trying to tell you this is the one that really bugs you as case supervisor or as training supervisor you get this guy and you have him do session you get this guy and you have him do session as case supervisor and it doesnt come off the session doesnt occur and then you do your nut and you try to force him in and you put him in condition and that sort of thing and you try to straighten this thing out and you give him another chance and something else falls on its head and you cant quite figure out what the hell is going on here well ill just give you stable datum it is the missingness f the basic s do you know i found out one time some fellow its very true that any auditing at all is better than auditing thats still true you can sure wrap guy around telegraph pole but brother hed be in hell of shape if he wasn t audited at all thats still true but you can get you can get some of the weirdest ones and boy they really puzzle you till all of sudden you see tremendously long session or some auditor who is not too bad is trying like screaming crazy to get something done in that session and he goes on and on and on and on trying to get this thing done and he cant get this thing done and the person just doesnt seem to be able to follow that line this persons this person dont always blame the auditor the auditor to some degree may be to blame you can keep trying to smooth out the auditor for sure but man there is something out there is something very very basically out and you now better make is your business to find out what it is and your business as case supervisor then is trying to find out what in the name of god is out with this case so you can order check of cases just had one just ordered this and it came off very successfully and so forth the person was actually given check all lower grades and then the next c s was run any of those found not to have been run and there were several lower grades that were out and they have now been audited and youll find now the person will fly but you seldom look as far as the person has never answe red the question do you have an arc break see the person has never answe red the question do you have present time problem so look if he cant answe r the question does he have present time problem is he problems release well he couldnt be problems release because problems had never defined for him he has definition of problems so hes never been run on problems he doesnt know what they are you ask him for ptp you dont get any answ er you get some balderdash yes i have problem i didnt tell you yesterday now your response to that in training is simply make these guys define these things within an inch of their lives make them define em in clay and so forth and it straightens it all out and after that all of sudden why things start going along great that werent going along before or in the subject of auditing get each command cleared and make the auditor write down the full details of clearing the command and theres too many auditors think clearing the command is just getting what the pc said and writing it down on piece of paper and running it i could boot such an auditor and hes supposed to get dictionary and hes supposed to go into these words and hes supposed to get this thing clarified as to what is the thought hes trying to put across and today i saw p r pr 4 blow up power process 4 blew up because of source source it was defined as the starting point and the pc was sitting there trying to figure out race track or something the actual truth of the matter is that pr pr 4 did not get run on the case but 5 6 and 5a did thats hell of an omission isnt it but it didnt get run it sort of went actually it f ned on the pc saying they felt good before he started this rehabbed in other words now power that is thrown out this way is practically not repairable theres very little you can do about it you cant fool around with this but somew here up the line thats going to show up on the case pr pr 4 not flat and the time it does why we trust that the auditor at that time will clarify the auditing comm ands and run it so how out can an outness be well you have to figure out what does an auditor have to do to audit what does pc have to know in order to answe r the question and you realty got you really got your fundamentals an arc break is break in affinity reality communication or understanding what is break well it means drop an end off of it now if you have person who is completely impossible to run and is not educated at all along this line at all youve still got the clear the word affinity cause it doesnt mean any other word it means affinity feeling of same ness wi th now the reason an arc break takes place is only because theres been arc before it and what youre doina is mending the flow and if there all arc breaks have to be preceded by arc i dont think you could have an arc break with an enemy who had never been friend thats why civil wars are so bitter because theyre fought over an arc break but foreign war is very often fought with great gallantry and so forth and back few centuries aao there were commanding officer of an infantry comp any was doffing his hat to the other infantry company and saying gentlemen you may have the first shot but they dont fight civil wars that way the russian revolution is the damndest piece of cruelty i ever heard of because it is arc break there was arc and now its busted there are fights quite as violent as those which follow great love so therefore somebody has to know this in order to run it he has to know what affinity is break in affinity he has to know what break in reality is concer ned and there is another way of running it which is perfectly legitimate you see we have portmanteau word because we understand it arc break break in affinity break of reality and break in communication and break in understanding an upset you could say in affinity an upset in comm unicat ion upset in reality an upset in understanding or you dont have to say an upset in understanding you could say misu nderstanding now this is so far out that the other day i gave an auditing item i said assess something or other and then get anything that was misunderstood in it and the auditor so help pete i dont know why he departed from the c s but he ran arc breaks in it i said anything that was misunderstood and the question was never asked the pc but instead did the person have any arc breaks with it i was lready talking about missing arc breaks it wouldve all come out clean and it came out all of sudden finally after two or three columns of hard swea t the auditor not having asked the question he had been told to ask the pc cognited like mad that she hadnt that there was big misunderstanding on the subject and that she didnt understand it and it f ned now this is matter of basic s these are matter of basics and anytime youre trying to put something together dont go into the airyfairy wonderland of it all do something simple guy cant i dont know hes somehow or another he just doesnt seem to be able to run arc straightwire unsatisfactory result something kooky well lets get definition of this word recall what does he mean by it there can be an infinity of variations from the correct one oh fantastic number of variations on the actual definition of recall im sure id hate to be given the task of dreaming up all possib variations on correctness on anything because they are infinite absolutely infinite so youve got to find what is the wrong one and get the right one your wrong one wouid just be some invariable now the weird part of it is that if you just clear the command recall on some pc just order that the comm and recall be cleared and it is cleared the pc goes f n for the first time in his life why hes never recalled anything before he didnt know how to do this brand new idea to him and thats the truth about this pc that i c sed just today his whole case lies straight in that weird definition of recall so therere quite few very simp basics now youre going to get hold of somebody sometime and order that an engram be run on him and your auditors going to send you back fire fight youve ordered the guy to moment of pain and unconsciousness but he didnt have any place to go what is out there is he had never under gods green earth ever realized that anybody ever made any pictures including himself he doesnt know what the hell these pictures are he has never associated it thats comp letely foreign to him and you will also find out the guy doesnt have any past either he has some intellectual concept of the fact that he might have been here yesterday but he couldnt swear to it when you get one of these basics out in the field of auditing recognize that you do not need tremendous number of complications to explain why the case wont live if these fundamentals of auditing these grade processes done on case bring him up toward native state much more desirable more potential level then recognize that any one of the elements connected with those levels if out any one of those elements bars the way now im trying to get you to look at very basic basics how can you run an auditing command this is this tribe of indians that as up there up in new york up the hudson river and so on they had tremendous number of sayings before the advent of the white man like the way to cross the river is cross the river see the way to cook ducks is to cook ducks you know they had lot of these things well this is sort of the game line of country except it now makes very good sense the way to get case to f n on recall process is to get him to recall the way to get case to f n on an engram process is to get him to go through the engram or to earlier similar incidents until you get an erasure and then youll get an f n but what do you have to do to do that well its usually the business of the auditor and when the auditor doesnt take care of it it backs right up into the lap of the case supervisor and you will youre going to be in the position where youll be saying run dukes on recall an auditor the thing winds up in mess pc gets all massy ta goes up you decid there must be something horrible on the track you might immediately leap to complex conclus ion that some horrible auditing had been done which when it was disclosed and pofwa flea fwa fwa and waffle waffle waffle whereas the matter of fact the guy does not know how to recall anything so therefore clearing auditing commands is part of he basic s of standard tech and this class right here i had to teach you how to clear the rudiments and i dont think it had ever occurred to anybody before that the reason the case wasnt in session was because the rudiments were out and the rudiments were out was because the rudiments had never been cleared nobody was really insisting on an answ er to his question do you have an arc break the guy gives you ptp nobody was insisting on an answ er to his question he bought that he bought that i wouldnt have bought it without invalidating and pushing in the pcs anchor points i wouldnt have bought that for that session yes next session now were going to clear the auditing command for you do you have present time problem what does present mean and this girl says oh mink coat so on and you say well lets get the dictionary and look it up see what present means its like i said mink coat so forth yeah i got problems about mink coats you dont know what goes on in peoples minds dont make up your mind that you do because you start going into that nevernever land and boy you is going to go into an infinity of variables you know exactly what you mean but you have to know as case supervisor or as an auditor exactl what these things mean present time problem is one which occurs in the now ness of things it is problem in the nowness of things the basis of problem is postulate counterpostulate mass countermass intention counterintention it is two forces interlocked or threatening to and occurring in now and it has to be in action now to get in the road of auditing so if the pc doesnt know what present means and thinks its mink coats or something youre always going to get problem because thereve been an infinity of them on the track youll also get eventually an arc broken pc because she never can clean up problems she answe rs problems in this wise uh lets see problems problems problems problems have i ever had problem you say do you have present time problem the pc says have i ever had problem let see yes i think back in 1722 now my recalls opening up little bit i had problem now christ i wish we would get off of this process because i always seem to have problems yap yap yap dont you see well the pc actually you can clear it false reads you can do this and that with it but any time you have to clear rudiment with false read some auditor the persons had in the past or that pc sitting right in front of you or that is being audited on your case supervision does not know the definition of it so if you see false read on presen t time problems coming up and is having to be user then you order the clear present time problem cleared i handled that by maki ng everybody in this class do the rudiments in clay i clea red it all at one fell swoop im not berating you im just showing you how this is gonna get in your hair because if i had to clear some of these things up with you guys wow what are you going to do with raw public and things huh so you say to this fellow ive seen idiocies happen on this little three year old kid walks in for session and the auditor says do you have an arc break wow and the kid tries to give him some answ er here in the sea org why they auditors very often fooled he asks six or seven year old kid if he has an arc break and the kid answe rs him very glibly indeed tells him where all the spots are cause these kids know their business dont expect somebody walking in from the public would do you see what fundamentals are how fundamental is fundamental when youre walking on the sidewalk it is the sidewalk it isnt it isnt composition which may or may not have come into being and which may or may not be made of infinite mind i can tell you that ot 8 youre in for some shock s of simp licity the great mystery of the physical universe is mystery but it is too simple so therefore it gives problems do you follow so you have problems occur ring every time somebody has avoided the basic you have difficulties and comp lexities and errors arising when the basic is out now the way you put the basic in is to get it clarified as to that is the basic in auditing itself thats all you are doing is clarifying the basic so if you start to clarify the basic with misu nderstood auditing question youre never going to get down to the basic in the first place do you see how idiotic this its simple its too simple its its actually simp you know to point where ham well you can get very baffled trying to put it across sometimes you tell this fellow turn on your emeter and thats very simple action to you but he for some reason or another has read whole series of directions about the electronic potential of sweat and the hyper sensitive neurons and how the capsulized long fronts go wobble wobble wobble wobble and the business of turning on an emeter to him is production like setting us the electric light plants and light lines of city even back to mining the coal you will see some characters in the lower lower lower areas of training you say if you put your emeter in front of them and you say turn on the emeter the guy doesnt reach over here for the sensit ivity knob what he does is he just minute ill get it yeah yeah heh heh if i ever saw anybody do that id put him back on emeter drills for forty eight hours nonstop youre supposed to have checked out an emeter huh good turn it on for i might even do that if an auditors giving lot of trouble in sessions id say turn on your emeter if he goes just minute ill get it ah yea boy hed sure be back studying ters how the hell can he operate an emeter when he cant even turn it on you see what i mean now if this is the thing which you look for in the case if this is the thing which you look for in the student if this is the type of basic you are trying to put in you will win all the way wherever you see an apparency of unworking tech its this sort of thing that is out and it is frankly too idiotic for you to easily grasp youll laugh like hell over these things sometimes when you finally find out what is out wow its unbelievable it is always some piece of damn foolishness it is never anything complex so therefore you get asked for answe rs to conditions that dont even exist you say this pc has had great deal of fwa fwa and hes done great deal of study and back in llama time and so on he seems to have tremendous amount of ability and therefore he should actually be audited on some easie r process or such higher level process because he says these processes are too easy for him ive seen one like that ding ling good find out if hes ever been run on arc straightwire i did he hasnt then how do you know the processe s are too easy for him oh i get what you mean run arc straightwire on him if they do this guy comes up shining but youre presented with problems which dont exist the apparency of unworking tech includes with it the apparency of difficulties which dont exist in the first place and the way you surmount all this and the ease with which you surmount all this is one hundred percent just look for the outbasics to hell with what theyre chattering about actually assum the attitude that monkeys chatter endlessly but they dont neces sarily make any sense they say that fifty million monkeys writing for fifty billion years would write all the works of shakespeare but i dont think any publisher would wait around that long now youre going to get well fwa fwa fwa now theres an old policy its the person who takes conclusion from juniors is going to fall on his head you can trace back your more serious administrative errors to taking conclusi on of junior without getting the facts you have had the junior has told you some conclusi on and youll find out they normally will tell you conclusi ons because they havent got any facts and i think we ought to disco ntinue processing this pc for the excellent reason that he has not yet made any gains thats conclusi on you say what is the data on this pc well i think we ought to discontinue the he didnt give you any data did he he gave conclus ion what is the data on this pc well hes very hard to audit thats conclusion its data what youre going to have to do is train up and regiment people on the straight forward basis of look when i asked you for data i wanted data what you think about it is completely unimportant to has the pc been run on you say check the grades of the pc up to two where the persons supposed to be check the grades you get it back from the auditor without even asking the pc anything and say he hasnt been audited very much youve had it but you gave it to guy who didnt know how to check the grades up to two so he chickened and gave you conclus ion instead of fact so your main action to overcome all of this get in basics is you just tell them to be gotten in and tell them to be gotten in and tell them to be gotten in and tell them to be gotten and tell them to be gotten in and the next thing you know they go in when you want somebody to check the grades of this pc up to two you want somebody to sit there put him on the meter and ask h im if these grades have been run and then give you the behavior of the meter as you ask him and you can even descr ibe what the grade is as long as you dont run it when youve got that you know where you are you know where you are exactly the processe s were described and the ta went up now it can either be rehabbed or it was never run see it was either overrun or it was n ever run so youve got now youve narrowed it down to grade zero communication was either overrun or never run the rest of them apparently ok but grade zero was either overrun or never run so you have the auditor ask them was it run did you go release at that point and it doesnt f n and you now know it was never run so you can descr ibe to him step by stew exactly what you want those are the basic things you do your nut because its unbelievable to you that anybody could believe some of the things they believe or the outnesses n why case d oesnt run the one i told you about with the recall you know what his advertised ot section is 3 this person has had trouble the whole way has given people around him trouble hes in difficulty perpetually he runs horribly he runs very badly indeed supposing he were to leave session with an f n then hed try to remember something and hed put himsel f back through an engram that wasnt ready to run so you see what youve got to be alert for somebody comes along and asks you for something wonderful yes what magic thing is it going to be that makes this auditor an auditor you could tell him at once you could simply write down list of the things an auditor has to know you could assess those things the one that he doesnt understand and that sort of thing will read people gonna look at you and say well we could have done that heres the joke they couldnt have you have to be very brilliant to be able to think simply and act and use the simp solution and the basis of all of this is that all power is total simplicity the basic lesson thetan eventually learns but when you can get it to effort of any kind whatsoever it is total power you could tear this planet in half if you could think of doing it without any any force so that actual power depends upon total simplicity and after you do it it looks so simp to some people they wonder why they didnt think about it or why they didnt do it or why they didnt conceiv of it well you can point out alright perfectly good i mean more cheers to you if you conceived it we got the thing on the road now alright we assessed how this auditor never got trained we figured it out they dont have any em eters in the academy my god thats right see but these things are usually of that of that category and then what ar ses on all of this is this fantastic over burden of complexity oh many complex complex here there everyplace towers and towers and towers of pure balderdash you get the apparency of tech unworking the basis of it is that it isnt applied now the worst cases youre going to have this is that it hasnt been applied now somebodys going to say oh yes i understand that he was audited by somebody who really didnt have his trs in that isnt what im saying you know he just wasnt audited at all then it starts to dawn on somebody what s that i mean you know well how could he have gotten there yeah well look ive got news for you he didnt get there now when you can mast er that level of think you have mastered near total power in standard tech both in training it in case supe rvising it and in auditing it and youve seen yourself doing that and youve seen yourself doing that on this course im sure and youve seen it stripping down stripping down beco easier and more simp more direct its more action and the less difficult it seem ed the simpler you did it the more f ns were arriving at the examiner now f ns werent just arriving at the examiner f ns have started coming into session so at the beginning of session you longer are getting in ruds because youre sitting there looking at an f n which you have to wreck to do any process see and what youre doing now is youre just in the business of widening f ns do you see well thats in direct proportion if i can teach you this i have taught you all its in direct proportion to the effortlessness with which you regard the action total power is total effortlessn ess and when youve got that you know how to mock up planet now any action is base d on certain simp licities those simp licities are stable they are standard theyll become obscured and comp licated more and more that is the individual gets weaker and weaker he gets more and more com plex the basic is more and more lost lets take this bird he doesnt know what an arc break is he doesnt know what ptp is and he doesnt know what missed withhold missed withhold is defined as something he keeps from himse lf alright its something he keeps from himself ptp is something somebody worries about but he knows that its wrong to worry so he never worries an arc break an arc break is in actual fact problem of some kind now you start auditing this guy and its very hard to push it through very hard now as case supervisor you start handling his case on via but its very hard to push through just cant seem to get any place and its very difficult and the folders get thicker and theyre already very thick indeed and the guy spen t eight hundred hours on 3 and he cant seem to get anywhere you can run into these problems you see theyre big and the farther they have departed from simp licity the bigger the problem seems until it is practically gigantic problem that nobody could possib ly ever solve and nobody could ever see around this problem is so huge and its presented to you normally in this light you start going through the thing and youll find the answ ers to his ptps are worries of sole kind that cause d him to be upse t some weird definition and they dont seem to be anything in the present and missed withhold he doesnt ever have one of those because he never finds out what he is doing he says and youll find something out well you know immediately the guys audited with his ruds out because he cant define em so now with your sword you cut the gordian knot and you say clear each rudiment now youre liable to run into this trouble the auditor goes into the session clears each rudiment and he didnt know what they were either so therefore you had better keep up liaison with some training entity and well say before you start handing this out you had better have your auditors clarifying what each rudiment means before they start hanging up false one with that and all of sudden auditing moves that has never moved before god thats awful simple isnt it now another one is is an emeter trim check should be tested before the session and the meter should be turned on and given test check but if it acts kooky sometime during the session the meter could have been discha rged also you can have trouble with the line thats connecte d with the cans so you want to bounce the line around bounce your meter connection around little bit and these things screw in these plugs and you know you can have pin unscrewed on some of your meter connections it gives you permanent rock sla m now guv should know enough about what goes wrong with his emeter not to run into hell of lot of trouble we had one here the other day unfortunately somebody was busy having hell of time with the pcs tone arm and come to find out the trim check at the end of session was 2 equals 175 so all through the session the auditor thought that he was auditing somebody with very low ta when he wasnt didnt start didnt put his meter into some kind of condition now in solo auditing every now and then solo auditor wraps himself around telegraph pole by not paying any attention to his meter i know one guy ran lot of sessions he ran hell of lot of sessions but he got all messed up on the thing the meter was discha rged i dont know how he made it read at all but he was in deep grief finally cause he knew he hadnt made the section and he couldnt get any ta action and then somebody checked the meter and suddenly found out that it was dischar ged its too kooky see well how do you get these in how do you get all these points in how do you get them in in training how do you get them in in auditing well you make each one defined you get the guy to define each one youll find your outness fast enough thats all thats all the secret there is to it lets find out how complicated he is or how simple he is lets clear the auditing commands for arc breaks ptps and missed withholds big folder big folder guy is so very upset and nervous that he cant seem to get anyplace well there is way you can go about this you can actually assess things in connection with auditing do it on list 1 the result on list 1 and then fly each rud now youve taken away the obvious arc break stuff on the list 1 so he wont blow up in your face and now youre going to fly each rud well with any pc with very thick folder you had better clear the command of every rudiment before you think you can fly it pcs liable to have hell of cognition because where his definition of the rudiment is out the rudiments always been out in other words the rudiment is so out he cant even define it and you pull off these miraculous wins see hooray god almighty people think youre looking over their shoulder and adjusting their brains for them and you say clear the rudiments folders this thick case supervisor you start going through it and you find the kookiest damn rudiments you ever saw in your life and you say nuts clear the rud you look at the answ er to recall processes and look how long it takes to run recall process something like this itll tell you at once what the state of the pcs basics are you know whats got to be done with the case youve got to get the rudiments in on the case and youve got to get these various things straightened out about the case certainly in the field of auditing and its all in the direction of getting the charge off but case is never going to make any progress wi th their rudiments out if his missed withholds are out why hes going to get mad at the auditor and it doesnt matter if hes defining missed withholds to himself as something he doesnt know about whats missed withhold its something i dont know about well if hes got missed withhold defined it doesnt keep him from being mad at the auditor when he has real missed withholds so you straighten it up all of sudden he starts getting these actual withholds off that are missed alright ptp he doesnt know what the hell ptp is his mother walked all over the place i had somebody one time that had problem defined as something you did in arithmetic and knew then that you couldnt solve any problems because the teache r always said they were wrong now that is an outness i n rudiment do you see now we take an arc break define an arc break actually its quite disco very in itself it isnt remarkable that people dont know this so if people dont know this theyre not to blame just by clearing the rudiments youre liable to straighten up all kinds of damn things this is how you bring about miracles by bringing in simp licity where only complexity has existed before thats actually the whole secret of how you get the show on the road the cycle of action is is you say now listen over in the acade my if you fellows would just start teaching the trs wed be lot better off and they say good oh yeah well we do all that youre defeated there actually your auditors you know damn well because they chatter and yak and so forth you know damn well theyve never done their trs you know this so take walk over and say lets see couple of students do confront yeah this one student who is the coach bouncing around in his chair and the others doing this that and the other guy up and the other guys shaki ng his head and yes well there you are and back and forth they go and they look like couple of god damned bobbing sticks and you say when do you do confront thats confront just say my contempt lets see you sit for two hours both of you without moving an eyelash and lets set up couple of photographic timers and somebody else looking in on this every time they see anything happen at all have them hit the timer to get the two hours started all over again and all of sudden youll suddenly start getting your trs in getting some auditing done also it works on this basis theyre trying to give you problems be sure you give them some never let giving of problems be one way flow i hope that clarifies to some degree clarifies to some degree how standard it is or what you are trying to standardize because that is what youre trying to standardize its what youve trying to make there the basic youre trying to get in they are not very esoteric basics and as i say again the test of true brilliance is the ability to conceive total simp licity thank you very much the new auditors code lecture given on 14 october 1968 well here we are comi ng down to the end of the course down toward the bitter end of the course i havent done your folders today so i dont know whether you will leave clean or not you will be happy to know that the two folders which were offered in lieu of the examination on one of them the whole courses auditing was delivered by john purcell in matter of one hour to very well done very amusing on that one the pre ot said when he went to the examiner and when i started it i didnt even know if i was straightwire release and on the other one and on the other one i knew bug existed on the case one way or the other and i handed it out with completely straight face and what needed to be done was the full four rundown and i knew very well the case needed repair action before it could be done the auditor did start the session and then suddenly realized he had better do repair so he ended off did another c s and carried on with it also to get well done so very good now lets see what number lecture is this eighteen lecture number eighteen the class viii course sea org and the date the last time i looked it was the what fourteenth fourteenth of oct ad 18 very good this lecture starts out with rewrite of the auditors code i apologise to those who have gone to great deal or trouble memorizing the auditors code but you must realize that the auditors code was many many many years out of date because it talks about flattening three comm lags of equal length and so forth whereas we have moved us into different strata of approach so the auditors code has to be realigned into the field and area of standard tech it now has the auditors code now has twenty five clauses and is in different form its in the form of an oath and its actually hcob or hco policy letter of 14 october ad 18 which will be in auditor 43 its for you and will be issue d to you tomorrow and its to all auditors in the world since it doesnt just apply to class viiis and you having copy of this can drive it home bit so ill read it to you and take up its various points its the auditors code auditors code ad 18 in celebration of one hundred percent gains attainable by standard tech it begins and then it says i hereby promise as an auditor to follow the auditors code numb er one i promise not to evaluate for the preclear or tell him what he should think about his case in session now that clarifies that the other one you could tell fellow he needed auditing but the word evaluate is very often gets in the road of an academy trainee he doesnt quite know what its all about so he just passes i t by give you an example of evaluation thats not the cognition you should have there its well god these things do happen you know i mean these things do happen somebody doesnt understand this and wild things happen i dont think that you have completed the list because you should put drug fiend on it in listing and nulling i have actually seen auditors sit and suggest items for pcs list now its quite one thing to make prepared list and if its it and if it isnt it it isnt it but its quite something else under listing and nutting to suggest that the preclear put down three or four more items hes listing who or what has suppressed you and the auditor says you should put your mother on the list and you should put so on and you should put so on i know it sounds absolutely impossible but it has happened in the past the usual reaction to this process is so and so so now you should the manifestation which youre exhibiting at this moment is normally considered insane it can get pretty damn wild now this is best understood as being an opposite to what was laughingly called psych analysis developed in the late 20s along with other oddities and the psych analyist he operated this way he would say after hed had the fellow talking for one hour or four hours week for year to find out whether or not he could help him why the fellow would finally remember somebody who had suggested some sexual action to him which was the whole target of the years conversation when he was three and just about the moment he would think of this the analyst was supposed to jump up and say that thats whats wrong with you and now this means this so and so and it means this and this and it means that and that and that now do you understand that now if youre very careful after this you will be perfectly sane thats all see now we can enter on the long one which is five years at four hours week im not joking that was sta ndard proced ure that went so far and entered into this and when i taught i think it was something like twenty one psych iatrists something about dianetics in washington d c they were leading psychiatrists of that area by the way in the nation these birds listened very avidly only they could never get past the introductory lecture they didnt they didnt know that they didnt know and they were in very astonished sort of state and they listened to this over and over and about the third lecture which was i was just giving the same introductory lecture every night and they were supposed to then have some dianeticists who were going to show them how auditing was done and how you ran engrams and how you really did this stuff but they never got to that they just got to this introductory lecture they were sort of frozen state of astonishment and finally after three or four lectures one of these birds psych analyist he went back out of the lecture and he went back and he used it god knows he used it hed never seen an auditing session in his life see but he used it on this paranoid that he had been dealing with for years and he came back and he was madly enthusiastic boy this dianetics really worked i used that return mechanism you talked about and i actually got him returned to an area where he was lying in his crib and he had dirty diapers and his father wouldnt chan ge his diapers and i could point out to him right at that moment that thats why he hated his father what im telling you is actually word for word verbatim an actual incident now that sort of thing can go on and people are so used to giving advice and telling people what to thing that the reverse is quite different from what was normal procedure so therefore it leads the line not to evaluate for the preclear or tell him what he should think about his case in session and it is very neces sary bit if you ever want to see some preclear spin its its on that one he can spin and that is why by the way in psych analysis one third of the patients in the first month of processing committed suicid and its probably just this evaluation plug and then the analyst said he came to too late that was his standard response to this they always came too late i think if theyd come at the year of one year old it would have been too late what is not generally known about older practices is they did not have the target of maki ng somebody sane they didnt have any of these targets they didnt have the target of making somebody brighter or more sane they conclu ded that person once he had an i q he had an i q and it was never going to chan ge and it never would chan ge nothing could change it and you would ask these birds what they were doing all this for and they really didnt know so you therefore find its rather difficult to understand them and the point of difficulty in understanding is very simp one its because you are assum ing that they have goal or target of maki ng somebody sane or maki ng somebody better and they dont have that goal what goals they have god knows i have interrogated them many times the only trouble is when i talk to them they generally go into an hypnotic report of some kind or another they go gong and so forth weird they another practice that was in that field is most of their practitioners came from institutions and they would take somebody who was an institutional case and he would become interested in the subject and then he would be trained and that is was it now you think im joking but that happens to be the truth i counted noses on them one time or another in certain area and found theyd all been institutional cases and many of them go back into the institution after theyve been practicing short time that was what psycho analysis and what they call psych iatry and so forth was all about it wasnt question of maki ng anybody better i dont know it seems to have been some kind of dramatization perhaps dramatization of r6 cause there is psychiatrist in r6 but i will point this out to you about this particular areai will point this out that the word psychiatrist is misuse d and named and has been borrowed falsely and is falsely used so is the word psychologist that is false false name which is improperly used because the word psyche means soul in any dictionary and psych ologist is student of the soul and psychiatrist is one who treats the soul both of those groups using those two terms at this particular time alike say in psych ology they dont know what it means thats fact thats in the textbooks they dont know what this word means and they do not treat the soul but in the next three minutes of play invalidate it it came in with professor wundt of many year ago 1879 leipzig germany that man was the whole modern psych ology actually came in with this fellow wundt and he said man was an animal and he had soul and they called it psych ology do you see so the word is complete misnomer and they have right to it similarly the word psychiatrist is comp lete misnomer they have right to it nowhere in the world is the title psychiatry legalized that is not legally held by anybody they hold the title by reason of medical doctor internship and in most laws anyone who is permitted to administer medicine is permitted legally to treat the insane so the medical doctor who administers medicine is the only one who is actually permitted to treat the insane these other fellows have to have medical certificate the medical doctor by the way would very happily get rid of all of these bovs he doesnt want them that is act ually the state of mental healing as it is now it shows you that we have to put this in an auditors code right up to the front of the line that there have been fantastic abuses in this particular field so therefore therefore an auditor in training should understand that thing pretty well and i have found auditors being trained at level zero and so forth who had been over it who had read it who didnt know how you could invalidate anybody or how you could evaluate anybody and these fellows these fellows w ere doing it one way or the other now one of the ways of evaluation is by an expression you can evaluate by expression you can hold your nose or something you know or frown in some pecu liar way and the preclear now knows he isnt doing correctly now the second one is i promise not to invalidate the preclears case or gains in or out of session now invalidation is the think level of hitting if anybody has any idea of what invalidation means its think level of hitting and instead of hitting the fellow you invalidate him instead of taking maul to his skull you say you are bum so its not very difficult to understand but if you go around telling people their cases re bad they arent doing well because their cases are bad and that they havent had any gains and so on you can fold them up pretty badly ive seen them very very badly folded up and ive seen where invalidation of case coming up on later sessions was very heavy hold up on the case now you can find other things wrong with person rather than to invalidate his case yeah you say well the reason you arent doing well is because your case is in terrible condition and why dont you get it fixed up very often husbands and wives will get involved in what they call scientology fights and start using terminology and invalidation of this particular line and so on and if youre very wise dont do it but particularly thats something an auditor mustnt do now three is i promise to administer only standard tech to preclear in the standard way that puts you in the running now i decid ed id give you some big choppers you know some big teeth that you could come down with now four i promise to keep all auditing appointments once made now the reason that that is in there is i have seen some cases have very bad time of it and i know of one case currently that is having very very bad time of it simp ly because the auditor said he would be there to audit him at such and such an hour and he drifted in late and this guy started to self audit and all kinds of wild actions have occurred from that particular point forward it is bad code break after pc has sat around for half an hour waiting for the auditor his case is so damned stirred up that there isnt very much you can do about it very often hes hes impatient hes angry hes arc broken hes this and that well the reason he gets this way is he puts his sort of his case on time sched ule alright its supposed to be its supposed to be nine oclock and the auditors supposed to be there at nine oclock and hes supposed to be there at nine oclock and so his case is all ready to fire at nine oclock see and then the auditor doesnt arrive still nine twenty and the case actually will be found at this moment on protest or on blow and theyre actually very hard to audit when appointments are not well kept but you notice it says appointments once made so the reverse of it of course is damn it dont make appointments you dont think you can keep alright number five i promise not to process preclear who has not had sufficient rest and who is physically tired now the background of this is one time i drew coordination back in the wichita dianetic foundation tremendous influx of institutional cases were being thrown at dianetic orgs way back when dianetic auditor of those days got so that he could process psychotic standing on his head it was easy as pie as far as he was concer ned they all cut their teeth because for some reason or other great many institutional cases came in and there was proviso that they shouldnt be audited by dianetics at that time and so the foundation did audit them and it was very bad show and it messed things up most gorgeously it wasn t that the cases werent handled oddly enough those cases were handled left and right and center but very often they were sent in as bird dogs and they were sent in to spin they had already received some post hypnotic suggestion under drugs that they were to go to foundation and then when audited were supposed to spin this isnt talking through my hat thats what was supposed to happen to them and we had one case where the parents of the girl showed up about forty eight hours later expecting if the money had been accepted and that she was being processed and the girl had spun and that they could then you know lay it in with an egg an axe well they were so stupid as to send in the lawyers check as her payment and this girl came in and nobody could figure out where she came from and she was obviously spinning madly and so sign up was done of any kind whatsoever they put the money aside to be refunded and sent the girl off to motel or something like that to wait for somebody turning up because they figured somebody would turn up and in forty eight hours sure enough her parents turned up wrath you see what have you done to our daughter to drive her craz well you see nobody had done anything to her daughter nobodyd touched the daughter but she had spun not because she was refused auditing but because shed been set up to shin dont think that post hypnotic suggestion and that sort of thing was not known to these guys they knew all about this and ive seen at least two or three cases directly attributable to this now therefore every once in while case like that will show up now the funny part of it is not that theyre bird dog type case just the psychotic and you dont detect it after all youre not supposed to be able to detect it and these next two are the only times ive ever seen them spin so ive done coordination ive done coordination and that one physically tired and six i promise not to process preclear who is improperly fed or hungry and those characters only spun when they either hadnt had anything to eat or when they hadnt had any sleed and that is the trouble with psych otic they cant eat and they cant sleep those are the two things they have great deal of trouble doing and if you process one of them when he hasnt eaten and he hasnt slept youll have very bad luck indeed im not saying you should ever process one but im just saying whereas if you can get them to sleep and you can get them to rest and you can get them to eat something oddly enough they can be processed they very often present more problem than other preclears people are worried about electric shock the only reason we say anything about electric shock electric shock cases coming in its not that we cant process electric shock cases theyve been given the old heave back into r6 where electric shock is gorgeously advertised the psych iatrist is supposed to electric shock people he does in r6 see and the societys just dramatizing this dont you see well its tended to put the bird into r6 to marked degree and the rest of it is is he is already under some tremendous mental duress of some kind or another and very often still while you are processin g him unbeknownst to you still under treatment and you get the wildest bingbing of mixed therapies which is also in this and so on and there just isnt any therapy involved with it its just method of punishing somebody its like the fellow who was asked psychotic who was given prefrontal lobotomy and he was exhibited to medical convention and somebody asked him on the side well what have you learned all about they were just talking about what marvelous recovery it was the guy was screaming mad man you know all this and the psychotic who apparently hadnt been talking to anybody or other said out of the corner of his mouth in reply ive learned to keep my mouth shut so anyway it is the sleep rest is the time hell spin now if you want to really put length of time in session process perfectly sane person who hasnt had any sleep for about twenty four hours youre going to have long session because the body is sort of an electrical machi ne anyhow and it starts to drain down anything he can put out and its its hard fight its hard fight it lengthens the time in session if hes had sleep and also if hes ever going to get into any trouble or make an error in the session now hes likely to make an error in the session and so is the auditor why it goes in sort of deep and its very hard to repair so the wise thing to do is to size up your pc has he eaten has he slept you havent well very good come back some other day when you have and that way you keen it up and keen out of trouble probably all the trouble youll get into with pcs is right in those two insufficient rest and they havent eaten if you were to process somebody in the morning before hed had his breakfast or before hed had anything to eat at all youd find out his processing reactions were quite different processin g has something to do with the elect rical currents of the body or something like this and fellow who hasnt eaten apparently isnt doing enough with his oxygen or something its ties up with basa l metabolism and you could get very technical about the whole thing actually theres way you can test one of these on one of these meters if you ask the guy to take long breath while hes holding onto the cans and if you then get long fall hes eaten but if he takes long breath and lets it out and the needle doesnt drop dont audit him he hasnt had anything to eat or hes very physically exhausted interesting huh its just an interesting phenomena its not that the machi ne accurately meas ures basa l metabolism or something like that its that it does react in that fashion did you ever see preclear yawn and then see long fall thats why you should put yawn in your administration also cough natu rally cough would fall because theres physical convulsion with regard to it but you dont often notice that the yawn produces fabulous amount of surge well if it produces large surge you know your pc has eaten and hes slept very well in spite of the fact that hes yawning theres somebody yawning now ok those two those two when i see those two violated and so forth my hair stands on end because it means that the auditor who violates those two is one of these fine days going to wrap preclear around telegraph pole and one day i noted in an auditing session that the auditor said at the end of the session which hed apparently known all along that the gains werent very good because the preclea r had only had one hours sleep in the last twenty four hed apparently known this the whole session and it hadnt affected his judgement as to what gains to expect he shouldnt have expected any gains at all but what stood my hair on end is the person he was processin g had just come to my attention as once upon time an electric shock case in an institution brother he didnt know it but that auditor was riding right along the edge of that cliff in motorcycle at ninety miles an hour the rocks falling down into the chasm with every spin of the wheel nuts so best way to stay out of trouble in that direction is has he eaten slept good fine now heres the next one i promise not to permit frequent chan ge of auditors the funny part of it is that you will find that after youve been through about three auditors on preclear he may very well get sort of nervous and queasy and the lower the state of case the more nervous hes going to get and he well wag just starting out he would feel if you gave him on his first subze ro levels if you gave this guy three auditors in row hed feel hed have to get anything he was going to say off to them all over again hed have to tell each one about himse lf all over again and itd make rather hideously anxious sort of session does this fellow know or doesnt he know and then he would also go so far as to think maybe he had to do all the processe s over again too theres all kinds of kooky things happen so insofar as possib particularly the worse off the case insofar as possib keep the same auditor now this mostly gets violated in review now let show you this oddity review gets the worst cases its only the case thats messed up and in trouble that really gets into review right so he has review on monday with auditor tuesd ay with auditor b and thursday with auditor c well now if it was all on the same cycle of action more or less he would find he was very confused indeed youve actually impeded his case gain and once more if you did this to psychotic without knowing he was one and so on he would probably spin so it is actually better in review if youve got three auditors in review or something like this or more it is better to wait till that auditor it is better for the review recep tionist to see who was auditing him last time and put him on that auditors sched ule and know when that auditors going to be free and tell him to be there then not to backlog him cause it can be done in the same afternoon this is this is just good sense but its something you should caution recep tionist or somebody who isnt used to scheduling people and so on that doesnt mean anything to them they just throw the folders around this way and that see its something to caution them about now its not good enough to maintain on duty one auditor who does one session week just because somebody started session last year and you cant chan ge the auditor its not good enough reason not to give session because that auditors longer in the organization thats not its not good enough for that well what im talking about is is frequent frequent change of auditors every time the guy gets list why he gets some different auditor hes always being audited by different auditor and next time different auditor you can unstabilize him and actually your processing is so swift these days that its very simp to schedule the same auditors simple simple simple and the only reason youve been shifting auditors around in class and so on is to give one another practice and so on and to that degree its tolerated its actually been too much done too much right on this clas sso that was number seven numb er eight i promise not to sympathize with the preclear but to be effective notice this is chan ged now masked under that is custom and habit which saint hill gets into periodically saint hill does alright lots of the time but every once in while ive noticed that amongst the students all missed withholds become arc breaks they wont pull missed withhold on each other all theyll do is run arc breaks on each other in other words as students sort of their mutual rudiments go out dont you see so you can ive seen this go and happen and then be busted up and then happen again and then go again so many times that its natural sort of phenomenon certain group starts to get sympathetic its what they do see so they smash up each others cases act ually mazie ann day after day has had this howling missed withhold from her instructor her supe rvisor see day after day she exhibits the manifestation of an arc break day after day the guy who is auditing her pulls an arc break because he sympathizes with her because he realizes that anybody should be mad at that supervisor its on you poor thing basis and will actually go on and continue to pull arc breaks but there isnt an arc break in the lot its missed withhold and the person doesnt recover now if you start theres lot of this on record if you start sympathizing with the pc about how badly his mother has treated him or something like this or sympathize with his hard lot youre actually admitting that you cant do anything about it because the three cycles of doing something for somebody who is having trouble are first and foremost be effective cure it up handle it well if you cant cure it up and handle it you can make him comfortable thats the second stage if you cant cure it up or handle it you can make him comfortable and if you cant make him comfortable you can sympathize with him its that low grade an action so instead of sympathizing with mazie ann about how bad off it all is and how shes being treated and so forth and so on be effective maybe she is being badly treated well dont stand around and sympathize with her make sure that the ethics is in better in that area and if if its her well make sure she gets audited and somebody pulls the missed withhold you know be effective dont stand around on the beautiful sadness of sympathy when auditors start that boy you can just kiss your gains goodbye and your students longer start maki ng wins in the academy or at the class vi course pcs start going up in smoke actually its marvelous method of putting somebody at effect oh you poor thing same thing as saying youve been overwhelmed same thing as saying you are the effect do you see you are the effect alright number nine i promise not to let preclear end session on his own determinism but to finish off those cycles i have begun that means that if pc blows the session the auditor is remiss for not finding noting when it happened the arc break and not handling it before it resulted in blow not noting and finding the missed withhold that is going to make him blow do you understand those are the only reasons pc ends session on his own determinism but the same time that precludes that the auditors trs are going to be sufficiently smooth so that he can even be understood and so that he is auditing remember it is an auditors code its very bad thing to let pc end session on his own determinism actually you can see an arc break coming that is going to wind up in blow for as long as an hour and forty five minutes before it happens doesnt speak of very alert auditor certainly its detectable ten or fifteen minutes before it happens it never happens suddenly and its flagrant session arc break which is handled with the list 1 so what the hell i mean the auditor wouldnt be very effective if some preclear blew session and then when the preclear blows session hes just left parked right there and its either got to be picked up by somebody else or something effective has got to be done in some other quarter and so on once in while preclearll walk out of session just because he can t stand it anymore there are silly auditor errors pulled by some complete untrained bird like four auditing commands which are all different all spew ed out in row with the pc trying to answ er one or the other of them and then refusing to tell the pc which one hes supposed to answer i mean the outness of this kind of thing on very very unprofessional coa udit level and so on can be pretty kooky and sometimes preclear would end session just on matter of self preservation but this understands that the auditor has within his power the ability to continue to handle and continue the session and it is an auditors code not an amateurs ten i promise never to walk off from preclea r in session now this is one of the serious things that has happened from time to time the auditor simp ly gets up and walks off leaves the preclear sitting in the middle of an engram or an unfinished cycle or something like that the auditor gets up and walks off yes it has happened eleven i promise never to get angry with preclea r in session now that i have seen spin pcs and its about the only time ive ever seen pc spin the auditor became furiously angry with the preclea r in session he must have been some auditor he was up in spokane or some place and this pc this pc traveled couple of thousand miles in total spin to get to the organization and get the thing handled and so on but all that had happened hed just gone into rage at her in session she wouldnt answ er the auditing comm and and for reason at all he went into rage arc broke the auditor or something but it can have very serious conse quences tweive and heres new one it is i promise to run every major case action to floating needle gone is your old three equal comm lags and so forth number twelve i promise to run every major case action to floating needle and thirteen i promise never to run any one action beyond its floating needle that catches i t both ways and the middle doesnt it number fourteen i promise to grant beingness to the preclear in session it doesnt say i dont promise to go on tip toe around whenever im around the preclear when im out of session let read that one again fourteen i promise to grant beingness to the preclear in session its modified its in session but i have seen auditors treating preclears as though they were still in session when theyre out of session and ive seen preclears sort of hanging the auditor with the fact that theyre his pc out of session its unfair and goofy in both ways and so on ive even gone so far as to occasionally tell preclea r who tried to continue the session after the end of session you are not now in session and they sometimes blink and say yeah thats right i didnt say bug off but i might have thats in session its in session sometimes you get pc hangs himsel f around your neck god help us fifteen and this is different and new one i promise not to mix processes the processes of scientology with other practices except when the preclear is physicall ill and only medical means will serve boy that is open to lot of interpretation i imagine but the net result of all of this is that before you could have misunderstood it to the degree that the guy couldnt possibly have had his leg set if he was being processed you see an extremity of that character could happen youd better have arteries tied up and legs set because bodies are rather inhuman things it doesnt mean that when preclea r is sufficiently ill and he wont recover that you shouldnt process him at all doesnt mean because hes being given medical treatment you should abandon him ill tell you something funny in this particular field the original experiments way back 1945 the original experiments on this line determined that function monitored structure in other words function ran structure that was big lesson actually endocrine compounds like hormones and so on could be given to somebody well thats physiological i mean you know you can give him hormones and so on well he should have responded in some fashion to this and then after they were mentally unburdened of their problems or troubles it would work but it wouldnt work in other words the wild variable was that hormones and certain preparations and by the way it was undertaken with people who were just released from jap prison camps who had been starved during the better part of world war ii in japanese prison camps and they were coming in to oak knoll naval hospital and it was very difficult to handle these boys because they were very badly deranged they had been subjected to brutality the like of which nobody ever heard of and they werent really treated as prisoners of war at all they were rust absolutely inhumanly butchered and these fellows were carrying terrific amount of mental stress so that on some of them you would give them preparations like amino acids which is the acids of protein so maybe they could begin to digest their food again or something like that wouldnt work you know wouldnt work damn little to do with it because theres enough coordination there they could imagine that they were associated so this this is interesting this is interesting from this standpoint because it brings you up to this one the guys on penicillin but his lumbosis wont cure up hes got pneumonia he actually can be on penicillin and it isnt handling the thing he isnt getting any better or hes getting better very very slowly indeed now he was so ill before he went on any antibiotic that he couldnt stir but now that hes on the antibiotic he can stir around little bit do you follow now this magic can occur now that he can pay attention hes not running high fever or something like that but he isnt getting any better hes come up just that little bit and hes stuck rignt there you can audit the engram and the penicillin works ive seen this ive seen this and done some work with this its the most miraculous thing you ever cared to see i mean the feilows been hanging five for three weeks and theyre starting to step up the penicillin to million units an hour or something like this you know he isnt getting any better he doesnt improve they continue this is all anything you know and then just run the engram of the illness or put in his ruds or something like this and all of sudden wham all cures us in about four hours so what it is is sort of penicillin assist its reverse flip you say well you shouldnt audit person under drugs you shouldnt audit person under soporifics which are sleep sleep drugs you shouldnt audit person under those that produce wild eupnoria or vnee vnee ney cay you shouldnt process him when hes on that kind of drugs for the excellent reason that the processin g probably becomes part of the trip so you try to process him later why then it restimulates this and he sets into sore of fog its wild its kind of mess he has sort of processing engram you know and hes somewhat hypnotic wnen hes on this stuff so that you say to him something or other something or other hes liable to come out the other end of the session without remembering single thing that happened in the session thats expressly the type of drug i have people came around and say mazie ann has been on tranquilizers for fifteen years and does she have to come off her tranquilizers because she has petit mal seizu res so that you can audit her i often think the tranquilizers didnt do her any good they havent even got her tranquilized look at her man what the hells the difference youre talking about some tiny thing as far as penicillin is concerned or stomach pills or something like that forget it processing wont do anything with it or to it or apart from it or anything it doesnt have anything to do with processing at all because it doesnt produce an hypnotic state doesnt produce lowered thing that leaves you at the end of the session with sort of scientology engram you got it alright number sixteen is i promise to maintain communication with the preclear and not to cut his comm or permit him to overrun in session theres one for you that puts it right where it lives boy it doesnt say maintain two way communication with the preclea r in session nobody really understood that anyhow cause that wouldnt make much of session but it says i promise to maintain comm unicat ion with the preclear and not to cut his comm or permit him to overrun in session so an auditor reading that has to find the point where you stop his talking without cutting his comm and thats an interesting one to learn and it is thing there is an exact point where you do this and its very easily seen and very easily understood not very hard to but if its not pointed out in any way to the auditor hes not likely to have much of grip on it hes liable to cut his comm cut the preclea rs com m without knowing hes cut comm you see alright and permitting preclea r to run on for another page and half after he has passed the f n is just the best way in the world to knock it in the head number seventeen i promise not to enter comments expression or enturbulance into session that distracts preclea r from his case now that covers about it all you cant not supposed to enter comments like yeah boy thats sure great yeah youre really doing groovy anything you know expressions includes facial expressions or enturbulance that means dropping cans emeters auditing report pages opening and closing drawers looking for kleenexes and so forth and it also includes having odd objects on the auditing desk its distraction it aiso includes maki ng the environment safe enough to audit in it so that you know that the environment is not going to be interruptive cause thats going to enter an enturbulance into the session and this is one of the main reasons for false auditing report you get an auditing report looks ok the preclear falls on his head two days later this has been what has happened thats been what happened thats very heavily the facts now number eighteen that is to say the auditors entered without putting it down hes entered comments expression or enturbulance into session that distracts the preclear from his case alright number eighteen i promise to continue to give the preclear the process or auditing command when needed i have seen in actual fact the maddest thing ill add to that in the session i promise to continue to give the preclear the process or auditing command when needed in the session now ive seen what that exactly means is i have actually seen an auditor give the orders to run back into an engram and then shut up ive actually seen this not just once i dont know why and i dont know what they do and they havent got any explanation for it at all the guy never comes through with the second command never says go through the incident something just some freeze you know they freeze somehow or another ive seen it couple of times and either the person just went blank or was himself sufficiently distracted or didnt know what he was doing but boy does it leave preclear to scramble for himself two minds put him down there and hes got to get back on one and its definitely very hard scene on pc nineteen i promise not to let preclear run wrongly understood command now if he answe red it as wrong command and then you caught it and then you corrected it youd be in violation of number one of the code youd now be evaluating he thought he answe red it right you told him it was answe red some other way so therefore it means that the things have to be cleared and they have to be correctly cleared you say what is the definition of that and the individual then gives you some definition which is the wrong definition and then you turn around and give him the right definition you are going at it all backwa rds and upside down so i guess you jolly well better have little old slit of paper to hand him and have him read the definition now this auditing comm and im going to give you is arc breaks and is for affinity and that means youre going to have to go into the business of training some preclears itd be nice to have little book that explains all of these words wouldnt it this is what it means now when you catch up on your homework preclear i will audit you now the only difficulty with that is after the guy read the book he has some f ns while he was reading it so youd have to check for it if that happened but that is one of the major sources of auditing gain pc didnt know what the hell he was being asked see he had the words and totally evaluated some other way they were weighted you know he had the weight of the words all different its like the childs dictionary comes up and says source is the starting place he couldnt run the process on that source is not the starting place it would be the point of origin or it would be the originator or where something was begun or dreamed up or mocked up and then guy could run it so source beco mes thing that doesnt have starting place well thats race horse wandering around in the pasture he isnt at the starting gate dont you see its easy ok twenty so the way to get around that nineteen on the wrongly understood command and you notice its wrongly understood command is bring your preclea r up right i wouldnt even bother to bring him up right in session id say study all these definitions so i can audit younow for years weve had to educa preclears only nobody ever admitted it have to educate him into whats going to happen what hes supposed to say what hes supposed to do and so on when you dont do this i see some of these preclears running around being psych analytic subjects i have actually had i have actually had somebody sit down in the session and start to run psycho analytic session on not psych analytic session psych analytic i dont know what the hell they call it orgy wing ding actually and they start to tell you about their not just even the words theyre using well when i was little child i did have an awful lot of trouble we had lot of hired men around and about the place and each one of them violated in turn there was joe bill pete tom oscar now you see now these and id say wha ts going on well dont you want to know all about this and so forth and id say i dont want to know anything about it have you ever told anybody else about these thing oh yes we always talk about these things who s we and my psych analyst very good do you remember time when you first heard that you should have some psych analysis thats very good what was the date of that very good alright now what is the duration of the period very good i never i never monkey with it boy i never monkey with it that is former therapy getting in your road and it would read on your seven resistive cases well you dont let anybody act like that in session either educate them or scan it out boy it does take the cooperation of the preclear i dont know if youve ever noticed that about auditing then there was the auditor who was the only one in session who ever got any gains laughter alright and heres another one i promise to estimate the current case sta of preclea r only by standard case supe rvision data and not to diverge because of some imagined difference in the case now im putting wee pons weapons into your hands the weapons alright twenty two i promise never to use the secrets of preclear divulged in session for punishment or personal gain now you know the old one of that there is never use scientology for personal gain but id see auditors all over the place getting rich and everything and organization getting rich so it cant be well interpreted but this is what people worry about now you will probably see somewhere over in an ethics code appear another one person who knowingly waits until hes in session to divulge evidence of crime is culpable because then youll find nobodys ever confessing unless hes in session but anyway regardless f that this is what people worry about they worry about the world worries about this they think that if we have such power that we can get information out of people like this they actually have had reporters and things mention it to very recen tly what about all those hundred and thousands of cases you have at saint hill and all those tremendous secrets you have on people and all of this kind of thing so they worry about it they think people are entitled to their secrets in actual fact i wouldnt give you two bits for the whole collecte d lot you know man has lot of crime mixed up with vanity some pc see that comes in and boy he gives you this long criminal record and so on i feel like asking him sometimes are you bragging or confessing you know its the truth because its not worth all that its not worth all that only in their zone and area it is we have become more blase imagine though imagine though in the nineteenth century how fellow was made guilty his entire life because he had once seen photograph of lady who was naked to the waist this corrupted his entire life i dont know the main thing about it is see the value of the withhold is this and we could be jumped on for this so ive included it in the auditors code thats the only reason its there we actually dont do anything about it actually there was one hell of crime comm itted not too very long ago and it wasn t owned up to and it was admitted in session actually nothing happened to the fellow he was not punished for it in any way now goes the continued story he wasnt punished for it in any way nobody did anything to him and so on do you know that he went ahead and tried to knock himself off he then tried to mete out his own punishment in the thing and right this minute is in hospital having undergone an operation he didnt need he was getting well and it all traces back to waiting until he was in session to admit to crime punishment was given him of any kind whatsoever it was very heinous crime punishment was meted out so he started meting it out himself and thats what hes doing right this minute and there is other explanation to it its not guilt complex its bust hes maki ng sure he gets his throat cut for it cause he knows dog cone well it should have been but it was nded out in session well the world worries about this what happens to this and i have actually seen pc actually made very very ill where his auditor suddenly trying to make him guilty in session for what hes doing and i have seen pc folded up for being charged for something which was divulged in session and it after all the auditors code is an attempt to maximize case gain we now know this we now know that it is only where tech is out that ethics has to go in you got it you get tech in on the guy why its silly to try to get in ethics why its reverse end to alright number twenty three i promise to see that any fee received for processin g is refunded if the preclear is dissat isfied and demands it within three months after the processing the only condition being that he may not again be processed or trained now weve had this custom for some time but it might as well appear in the auditors code because lot of auditors are not bound by this its wild one actually because the truth of the matter is is every time that i have been around and somebody was talking about money being refunded not on any auditing i was doing but money should be refunded for the training or processing or something like that and you gave it back to them without even this last qualification that he may not be trained or processed again and so on its very very rare that the person will take it back ive stood around and gone to hell of fuss to make sure that somebodys money was refunded and it was almost impossible to do and when it was done and so forth why they went around sort of hang dog and shee pish about it and it made mess but this is something other profession could do this is something nobody else on the planet would dare do the manufacturer is forced to do it with his products but nobody in the field of healing has had enough answe rs so its total dare now if we have that in the auditors code we can start to insist that it be practiced in the field of medicine and we can hold it up as something wh ah is applicable to professional ethics in general and it could go so far as well if the patient dies there is reason why the family should receive medical bill of course it is fantastic propaganda weapon and the truth of the matter is youre far better off to do this youre far better off if you were individually practicing and some sc comes in and says that didnt do any good whatsoever youre probably practicing on somebody who is pts who is connected up messed up she or he is seven resistive case to becin with theyre not going to do you any good at all anywhere the best thing to do is just promptly say alright sign this waiver that youre not supposed to be trained or processed again anyplace good here is your dodo right now bong you find the persons wait minute in the first place they do it sometimes just trying to get even with you they got missed withhold or something of this sort so theyre trying to get even with you somehow and they dont mean it the number of people who would accept their money back on the condition they were never trained or processed again are so few but it is not something another profession could do they wouldnt dare all the moneyd have to be returned you actually can throw that down the throats of people legislatively when other professions are willing to adopt clause of this particular character then they can talk about being ethical until then they had better not talk about us defense line and if all auditors stood back of that as defense line it would be very good one indeed now twenty four i promise not to advocate scientology only to cure illness or only to treat the insan knowing well it was intended for spiritual gain thats actually not to get anybody off the hook and not to agree with any laws or anything else its boy do you go in the soup when you try to go any other distance than for gain for the individual himself ok and number twenty five is i promise to cooperate fully with the legal organizations of dianetics and scientology as developed by l ron hubbard in safeguarding the ethical use and practice of the subject according to the basic s of standard tech that should straighten out lot of it so that is the new auditors code good bad or indifferent right now there is code of reform which is being put together but that would be the code of scientologist and i dont know what results are coming in on this on code of reform but it is very interesting project which will probably be adventured upon again somewhere up the line and the project is writing every prominent man or every professional man in the entire comm unity giving him description of dianetics and scientology of the various things it has done and oppositions it has met and what it can do and askin g him for his advice in the usag to which it could be placed and askin g him for any recommendations hed have as reform of its practice and theres some fantastic numder of these things being mailed out theres about oh i dont know theres about three million or something like that in the united states and some vast number in other areas and the net result of all of this will eventually be codified into code of reform but it will be the code of scientologist or in practices or organizations and very doubtful if anything would be added to the auditors code it just sort of blows the criticism thats been going around and at any time you find the subjects under criticism it is very good approach say ok what do you want chan ged nobody can complain about that the auditors code which you have been going by of course is fundamentally correct and as you see it has not actually been invalidated its been put in different form and it has been brought up to date so that the floating needle and so on is included in that alright so much for that i hope you agree wist that i very good now there is its one thing to freeze subject guy by the name of augustus whose real name was i think octavius whose real name was probably bastardus or who was kicking around about the time of cleopatra or something anyhow he was all mixed up with some jerk some epileptic by the name of caesa r its all sort of confused in mind at the particular time because i wasn t in rome at the time but this bird augustus he called himself which meant top dog or something he froze the boundaries he froze the boundaries of the roman empire and he said rome hereafter must not expand and hes the man who killed rome all you have to do is say in this universe something may not expand and from that particular moment on it stagnates and will eventually fail and fall which was woeful fact actually he said every eldest had to serve in the footsteps of his father so that nobody could get out of any profession his father was in the boundaries of the empire must not expand any further than they are but we will hold it at that point of course immediately it started to crumble he had lot to say it is very very bad thing to totally freeze something in this particular universe now ill point out to you that what we know however we still know and that is that we know the basics as we come up the line it is absolutely amazing how little this auditors code has chan ged in fifteen years but here is this minor change it is adapted to the increase of technology the net result of an unchanging absolutely never to be varied situation is of course stagnation but something can continue all the way from standard basic s in other words you can have certain standard basics and develop on top of those basic s more can be found out about what you already know we have an already workable path that path is very workable it is very swift i reserve and i wish to impress this upon class viii student i reserve the right to release further advances of technology i can assure you that they are not going to invalidate the things you already know now because everything which has been developed has been developed forward along the exact lines which you see them in now but let give you an example this morning i was doing the research on 8 and i was very fascinated with horrible circumstance whicn took place and i immediately checked it up with two other auditors that i respect on the ship and i checked it up with these auditors as to whether or not theyd ever really seen this phenomena and all of sudden an explanation fell out of the hat about something and i found out they had both been wondering about this also and i collided with it because somebody sent new meter and it is not new emeter in design it is simply that somebody changed the manufacturer and the new manufacturer before he can release or before they could accent this meter i of course have to give pass on it well i had actually already given pass on it i hadnt been able to detect any vast difference in this meter but i had noticed that the needle of the meter was tiny bit thinner and probably the movement of the meter itself might have been little bit smal ler than in other meters but i had not noticed anything more than the fact that the meter was very lively it was lively its more lively than the original mark ivso i hadnt paid any attention to this and yesterday my meter ran down or had to get charged up or something like this and somebody put this other meter which is the prototype its not the meter which i would normally use anyway it was the prototype and they put up the prototype on my desk for my use for checking something out and what do you know i turned the thing on and i checked over something and i thought you know that should be release point of that action and i got an r s i got wild rock slam now i looked at this meter again and it wasnt tuned up in any pecu liar way but i suddenly recognized why i hadnt been aware of it before id turned it on and used it that it had l terribly faint light very very thin needle which is off pattern dont you see and so i looked at this and i thought what am i looking at here why should i r s this is sort of mad and so i said i better check out if theres been an invalidation because r s invalidation they go together so i checked out and sure enough there was tremendous read on an invalidation and i thought thats really remarkable but if its tremendous read on the invalidation why doesnt it r s so i went and synthesized again the exact point and situation on the track which had made it r s and it held for moment and then it r sed again and i suddenly realized that invalidation would read of course it was float it was floating needle it was floating needle and the invalidation was id invalidated floating needle but on this very very light meter with this very light needle with my case section where it is ive stopped floating i r s i get hair dial wide r s and what it is is reverse rocket read the r s begins with rocket read which is backwa rds from right to left and i get backwards rocket read as it pops it pops like that and then pops the other way and thats all it is its just its quite remarkable but it took different meter to demonstrate the thing and so i asked one of the other auditors and he said oh yes and i said what cases have you seen something like this on and one was 3 and one was n ot 6 an ot 3 an ot 6 alright now the datum that suddenly emerges here this meter was tuned up rather more sensit ive than meter normally is and was in itself much livelier meter so if you were to turn up standard meter to maybe one hundred and twenty eight on its sensi tivity switc h knob and then to tune it up to four or five or something in that particular range in the ot sections i think you will find out that you get your floats beco reverse rocket reads and if youll watch this carefully there wont be any doubt in your mind about float in the upper sections now to give you little more data on this found out recen tly that auditors didnt seem to know that after an individual was clear that his thoughts read on meter and you notice its only recently that we have had to do anything about this the thoughts read on the meter you ask the fellow some question on the meter all he says you know on green form and all he says is to himsel f is i dont think that i says this to himsel f and you get long surge pow now an auditor who didnt know this but in auditing preo t he would think the thing read so actually what you have to do on anybody above clear is you have to be wary of the fact is their thinks read matter what they think itll read particularly if theyre thinking against something if theyre thinking negative of some kind or another up against the bank or against the auditor or against the meter or something like this you will get read so that makes case above clear actually some cases down at grade four this lively but very few but lot of auditors would just keep on buying this you see from clear on up that every time they had read that was positive you could wreck cases that way so were having to teach people how to get in suppress and false and because auditors have done this in the past good thing to get in false reads and it cleans up lot of cases right alright now we have had case or two in the upper ot sections recently who have appeared before the examiner with wide wild r s and to show you how odd this is we have somebody who was comm eved because he r sed on something and in case was it an r s there is such thing as an r s but it is not what we think it is float at certain high case level with certain tune up of sensi tivity actually behaves at an accelerated line it looks like an r s now the least you could tell about it even with an ordinary meter is the person should start rocket reading and reverse this is sort of pop the needle pops backwar ds from right to left and you can usua lly really tell if you tune up your meter right why your floats beco absolutely unmistakable because they begin with pop now as the guy goes on up the lines this phenomenon begins to increase and if your meter is already set up to read this pop why if you were auditing somebody at ot 7 or ot 8 i can assure you that his float would be rock slam well in supervising your folders and so on i have learned some new things and so on ill continue to learn them ill continue to publish them and ill continue to make sure that you receive them i dont expect tumultuously changing future i do expect very successful one and as we move it on up in the line up we will undoubtedly have things which we notice which can be incorporated and when they work out uniformly to the better good of all cases they will themselves beco standard tech very good thank you very much an evaluation of examination answers and data on standard tech lecture given on 15 october 1968 thank you thank you we have come to the end of the trip that sounds very bad in some connotations now you probably want to know what you got wrong on the examination the examination is what processes do you use on the green form well for some reason or another you characters have forgotten that you can have and have issue d and have done green forms it is the ordinary qual action now the reason why this was not hit hard in this course is that so many green forms had already been handed out amongst the students that we did not heavily use green forms the best thing you can do with green form is to itsa earlier itsa thats the best thing you can do with it and out of that you could even omit arcu cdei if the guy didnt even know what he was d oing on that just itsa earlier itsa do you follow you can run arc breaks with this so an auditor you could train an auditor to use green form rather easily if he could recognize an f n and knew enough to get an earlier incident but green form apparently your answ ers on green form were very poor now it takes rather skilled auditor to run listing and nulling so you tend to minimize that and you tend to minimize that but when environment reads on green form the proper thing the actual proper thing to call for if your auditor is skilled is remedy b when you get continuous present time overts reading the best thing on that is the listing and nulling question which is actually of the family of s and d questions its one of those very good questions is what are you trying to prevent and that is what you use to handle continuous present time overts now an s and d reads if the person is connected to suppressive person or group and you would do an s and d and the s and d of course is done on wsu an assessme nt of which s and d is required and if you start doing too many s and ds on case all it does is invalidate the last s and d but you can run one of each kind theres an f n available on w which is withdraw theres an f n available on stop theres an f n available on unmock so therere actually three types of s and ds that can be run you wouldnt even bother much to clarify that but beyond saving that if person has been run on withdraw s and d then it should not he run i dont know if you could get if you realize this but your recall or remember being blank is sort of an s and d all by itself on your lx1 that type of list now theres several of these types of lists by the way just as notation here theres several of these types of lists theyre all handled the same way dont all of sudden believe that they are something brand new and wonderful and strange for instances the money course people are giving all over the place is just one of these llist it would be handled exactly the same way run the motivator engram run the overt engram and the thing would be in actual fact just those things associa ted with money and itd simp ly be list of these things associa ted with money gives the person prepared list its already prepared its issue d its not changed not added to and its simply assessed and you do recall or remember and so forth on that just filling you in on little bit of data here the lists have not at this moment been prepared and as result i didnt give them to youbut your lx1 your lx1 is simply the pattern that is the pattern the other pattern the lx1 is the pattern by which you run recall get an f n run activator chain of engrams or secondaries get an f n you can get an f n from secondaries and youd get an f n from engrams overts secondaries you can get an f n for overts secondaries you can get an overt for f n engrams and that is one pattern another pattern of action is you assess this little prepared list very simp little list and you can do for something like auditing or something like that you can do the l1 on the result of this little prepared list or you can prep check it these are all of family of actions they actually can be addressed to anything i just saw about i dont know must be twenty page auditing report on prep check of what you have been going over called you know they make list like auditing auditors you know so and so so and so that little list and then prep check it and that little list all by its little lonesome produced twenty pages worth of session on case that has been kind of noca gain case and all that sort of thing but thats all by itself you see now actually you can prepchec k floating needles you can do all that sort of thing but this is all outside the zone of green form you dont disco ver these things on green form these are the things which case supervisor adds up as neces sary on the case and he puts the thing together now when you send somebody over for green form over to qual your ordinary action would be something on the order of omit lists you havent got any security in your auditing your lists and theyve done too damn many lists already so just omit lists do the green form itsa earlier itsa and youll just be surprised what these characters can run into on this so you apparently forgot the green form and that is quals chief weapon now one of the things about the green form is people mustnt send people to qual to get disagreements check to get sec check to get bop bop bop bow bow people cannot dictate what happens in qual except the case supervisor do you see so that executives throughout an organization can send their staff in for anything they please as long as it isnt done this also follows on into the field of the arc break registrar its very unfortunate that it is known as the arc break registrar because what they ought to be doing on those people is green form and what they ought to be using is itsa earlier itsa thats all they ought to be doing on the whole arc break program the arc break registrar the arc break auditor thats all they ought to be specializing in because its very safe very safe and if you omit lists off of it youve got an unlimited run it really doesnt matter how often or how long you go on this sort of thing but i didnt issue these green forms to you for the reason that anybody can do green form its very simple ive taught you some very standard actions now remember when youve been putting in the ruds exactly the same action you use in putting in the ruds is what you use in handling green form except it ceases to be what is just in the rudiments and it beco mes the whole green form goes that way now this has you had another one here what does setting up case mean and apparently you missed this left right and center and some of you undoubtedly got it but it was common miss it was question 246 you fly the ruds or green form to f n before starting major action and brother you better remember that cause if you missed that on the examination man wow youre going to have trouble we had somebody just day or two ago in auditing do the unforgivable thing the guy had somatic so they thought theyd put the full four rundown through theyre gonna handle lousy little pt somatic with full four rundown why that somatic ought to have been handled and everything ought to have been handled on the case they guy was set up to go dont you see and so setting up case is you fly the ruds or green form to f n before starting major action and that you wouldnt attempt any major action on case dont attempt major action on case that apparently has something wrong with it handle whatever is wrong with it before you attempt major action and if i can give you that the casell fly youre handling guy who is dead in his head or stuck here on earth or something like this the major actions of case are to fly this thetan i dont know i might even go so far as to have somebody who is having consis tent tonsillitis and lumbosis and bogwoggus and that sort of thing make him get himself straightened out medically before id touch him yeah the case is obviously going to get audited with all the grades to cure his god damn tonsillitis now the difference of viewpoint is is you really shouldnt give damn what shap the body is in as long as it does not deter the pc from flying so your ruds and your little green forms and your actions of this character and how you set these cases up you set the case up before you attempt major action and youre going to have terrific wins because the major action is for something else its to fly the guy not to handle his ingrown toenails do you see t hat so im clarifying it here because it possib ly wasnt clear quest ion number 247 how do you set up case there is consis tency on this there some said just ruds some didnt mention f n hardly any mentioned green form others went into more comp lex action of setting up case such as running engram chains and that sort of thing but you set up case with ruds or green form to f n or list 1 or list 4 but you set up the case somehow see you can you can go into more complex actions yes thats very true you can run engram chains you can do this you can do that and the other thing see but where you havent set up the case you throw away the major action and when youve thrown away the major action youve got place to go so you set up the case you dont run somebody with constant persistent present time problem on major action like grades dont say well itll all be handled when we do problems bunk problems are addressed more or less t the whole track i had somebody the other day had somebody the other day run on the grades and all that handled was her present time problems as messen ger see that was flunk thats throw away of the whole line of grades because in actual fact the present time problem wasnt really straightened out on the case you want this person to look at life see we want him to look all around and we want him examine his track and we want him to fly on this stuff so this this youve got to get because its the very guts of modern auditing alright and question 250 is explain the mechanism of release and at which point you get an f n the f n occurs when the pc disco nnects from the mass thats release when he disco nnects from the mass thats release oddly enough it translates through to the person that when he for instance was in prison and they let him out thatll read as release too which is perfectly ok cause it was release from the mass do you understand but its release from the mass and the comment here on the case these not my comments but the people who corrected the examinations quite few amazingly had this wrong and for some reason had it confused with other thetan pictures and some even said its when you create the mass i wouldnt know how you got that wrong if its too the trouble with it is its too damn simple its too simple thats whats wrong its actually almost impossible to comp licate the answ er so ill give you the answe r very bluntly here is mass when you take the thetan out of it its release when you erase the mass and leave the thetan there its an erasure and there is other complexity to it pleased thats all there is thats all there is there isnt any other com plexity to it whatsoever ill go over it again theres mass any old damn mass ment mass prison cat fights alright the mass alright heres thetan hes stuck in this thing see and hes saying im not happy i get yowl all the time you know i yowl i keep seeing these bars in front of my face yap yap yap yap yap complain complain complain complain comp lain why is he complaining caus hes stuck in mass hes out of time hes in mass and so forth you come along you audit him you go poof do you see this oddly enough will drop out of sight and hell say whee thats release alright now weve got another action and here he is stuck in prison hes really stuck 199 years to go and we come along and we erase this the engram hes stuck in the mass hes stuck in we get it asised it doesnt disappear its gone gone it aint never gonna come back more and thats an erasure only two actions he gets out of the car or you scrub the car thats all there is to it you try to make anything else out of it and boy you gonna go around in circles sure we know he makes up the mass sure we know all kinds of comp lications sure we know that the mechanics of electricity show that ohms volts often resist yes we could probably fix up slide rules that would tell us the exact density of the release hes stuck on and i imagine somewhere up the track if i dont keep my eye on it some damn fool will do this but thats all there is to it he gets out of the car or you erase the car in either way hes rid of the car but if he just gets out of the car hes still got car somewhere if you erase the car he isnt ever gonna have any more trouble with that car because its gone we dont care that he mocked up the car in the first place he usually hasnt found this out and very often hes so disowned something he has mocked up that it appears to be something somebody else mocked up and sometimes it is something somebody else mocked up who is right there that moment looking down his throat but we dont care what the hell i dont know why you worry about where the hell the mass came from at the stage of defining release who cares where the mass came from it is and you can take him out of it or you can erase it you got it brother thats all there is to it wow wow wow now you could exteriorize and get him out of the body and then you can get complexities like that you can exteriorize him and get him out of the body only he took the mass with him so he complains that it really wasn t release cause he didnt think he was stuck in the body he thought he was stuck in some mass its what he thinks hes stuck in it isnt his idea hes really stuck in itlike like fly paper but you can do those two actions and theyre entirely different now heres another onewhat is the matter and how do you handle someone who found none on three and i got one on you guys you never checked out on your study materials at an ao on 3 you never didyou never did and by god from the lesson ive had here you know what im gonna clo dey gonna give star rate checkouts before dey ever get 3an d thats going on right now going on right now that was telexed to them yesterday they study it and study it and study it and they can call it name rank serial number everything else whet her they can confront it or not we dont give damn and then we fly the ruds and let them go at 3 and of course when they fly the ruds they go f n they say its all gone we say very good its all gone thats great you didnt find any oh i never had any im pecul iar im one of those people whose feet never stick i was actually born in the universe as free being and i am still free being this stuff craw ling on is simply rumor and at that moment we will fly rud run incident ii capture to pilot find some engram incident is and run them and the funny part of it is is you know sometimes this happened it sometimes has happened that after weve done this once or twice the guy all of sudden wakes up and he says hey you know theres lot of these hahaheheeheehoo we say heres your study materials and your pack again guess you go back to the old salt mines boy you understand now were not trying to invalidate his 3 were not trying to get him to audit 3 forever or anything like that but he ought to be reasonable clear of fleas so we dont have to use through the following ot sections flea powder on him every few minutes and the reason for ot section failure is failure not to audit 3 but failure to check out the materials of 3 the most abysmal ignorance you ever heard of seems to exist on this subject i dont know why maybe body thetan reads it laughter so youre going to find lot of these cats and the thing to do is to pat them on the back and say cheers and not evaluate for him and tell him its an unflat 3 throw him into session run an incident ii capture to pilot run him back run some incident is and then they either dont have any more or they do see its an open and shut proposition if you cant clear it up in review session theyve got more if you can clear it up in review session thats it do you follow and theyre going to have to do it all over again at 7 anyhow it isnt that they departed its that theres other phenomenon of case at 7 almost as startling as that of 3 and if you make them go back and audit 3 too often and too many times and so on youll start running into phenomena of 7 and then the guy sort of gets plowed in and doesnt know where the hell hes going or coming boy and he tan really get chewed in but the way youd straighten it out is just take the repair actions which youve been taught on this course you could do an assessment of them and ba ba ba body thetans and sessions and invalidations and solo auditing and bowwow and examiners and review and auditors and so forth and i dont care run it on l1 prep check it whatever you want to do with it you could straighten him out do you understand if he overruns 3 theres another trick i think ive told you that already you can overrun body thetan on 3 so itll then read as an overrun 3 well the answ er to that is always who who overran 3 whos overrun on 3 and youll get all of sudden we had one case who had apparently run 3 and in great thoroughness had overrun and arc broken every body thetan he had actually it didnt take more than about half an hour review session or something like this to clean him up both ways from the middle and he was getting more blowing off than you could count because thats ail we were pickin g up you know overrun arc broke overrun arc broke overrun arc broke overrun arc broke and it was running overrun f n arc break overrun f n ftn overrun f n he looked like somebodyd left open the gate of menagerie but the guy really started to fly so you can set em up you can set em up it doesnt matter they can also do gorgeous job of plowing themselves in on this but we can pick them out of it so so what also the larger majority of it when they do study the study materials and they do audit go clear as bell you hit them on the left ear and they ring for half an hour and of course the trick of it all is is after youve done the clearing course the guy usua lly goes free of the body thetans so he parks them all over in left field he is clear do you see but his environment isnt so therefore he often goes clear has ball thinks that life is wonderful and suddenly falls on his head again and cant understand it actually what hes done is run in some body thetans the reason why you discha rge it on 2 is so the body thetans wont be so charged up they can spin him when they hit 3 and if the guys fixed up 2 and discharged the thing bit on 2 when he hits 3 he wont spin if you were to take somebody who was wag right straight off the street run incident 2 not as the capture but just run incident 2 just the volcano and let him walk off youd probably have dead man on your hands within five or six days and the way were getting away with it is fantastic but let point out that its were getting away with it because once they start to freewheel through this stuff they cant sleep they cant eat and theyre finished the body dies for lack of rest and so on because the incident itself is set up to do just that so its nothing to play with isnt it interesting that we havent had it happen well its an attestation of modern auditing and the preparation of cases and the way it doesnt happen is to get the bank discha rged bit show the guy what to do and it doesnt happen its really remarkable also weve already pointed out the bypassed charge if he didnt know about incident 1 and nobody pointed out the fact that there was an earlier incident 1 and he ran the volcano he would spin for sure but the mere fact that he knows theres an earlier incident 1 and i dont know how it got removed from the materials because there was doubt of it in the original material release incident 1 is way earlier and you point out the fact that incident 1 exists and that all by itself tends to discharge 2 so it cant wrap somebody around telegraph pole and thats why it isnt happening im just telling you the other phenomena could happen however you dont he doesnt study the materials never reads the materials hes never been audited hes never come up through the grades and some how or another we force him back and run volcano just that only we erase the volcano and let him freewheel well the whole bank freewheels all thetans in coordination do beautiful freewheel straight through r6 and hell freewheel for days and days by freewheel i mean its automatic run it must starts and it keeps going do you see basically thats why the materials are confidential so just that wont happen to somebody thats why we say the case should be prepared well prepared he should be run up through the grades thats why we say he takes ot 3 when hes sup posed to take ot 3 thats why the guy when he runs ot 3 should run the study materials of ot 3 he should know them and casualties will occur its something on the order of you take and put knife through the right hand tire of car while its doing sixty miles an hour itll go off the road well thats stupid thing to do isnt it thatd be very stupid thing to do well so you dont do that to somebody now i dont know if you knew or not that there was any liability to 3 but there is that liability to 3 that it is prematurely run and so on now the material is somewhat self protecting because very often somebody gets hold of the ot section materials and we have had that happen and they looked at it and said wha ts this got to do with it doesnt have anything to do with and so forth there isnt any picture on it theres realitv on that and they walk off and leave it and they dont even know they got their hands on anything in other words its so far beyond their reality that they dont even contact it which is quite remarkable additionally supposing somebody came along to get the materials didnt run any of the materials and then all of sudden accidentally ran piece of 3 there he would go but he would have done himself in with his own lies well the materials to that degree is self protecting i imagine some psych iatrist who got hold of it would decide to test it out on some patient hed probably go mad far quicker than the patient alright but the answ er to the question wha t is the matter and how do you handle someone who found none on 3 he had severe physical injury and got them all packed together and run it like an engram its the melazzo actually the majority of you got this wrong some said you check it and run the grades and others that you unburden the case with lx1 assessments and prep checks and so forth the guy who found none on 3 has been packaged by severe injury and what you do is run the engram of the severe injury and then blow some of them off the clust er and then you can run some incident 1s or you can run an incident 2 and then some incident 1s do you see but the mechanism of the cluster is what you havent understood supposing you had twenty gum balls and they all rolled around independently of each other just great now these twenty gum balls are somewhat loosely heaped up and somebody hits them with sledge hammer now can you tell one gumball from another gumball but if you run the engram of being hit with sledge hammer then they get separate again you get the mecha nism and thats the basic mecha nism by which you handle one of these none on 3s its just one of these simp things like release see heres whole bunch of body thetans all piled up around this bird and somebody comes along with base ball bat and hits the lot and they go squash and now they cant tell the difference between one or another and each one has different viewpoint of being squash ed and so the thing doesnt asis and theyre all tangled up and that usually puts each one of them in different position of the back track in addition to the squash its mess man so you just run the engram of the squash they all come apart and run individually and thats the melazzo and that is what you do with none on 3 hes had severe injury now it may be whole chain of injuries before you suddenly get release but the top one was the clust er even though is didnt erase you at least got the thing that disco nnected it do you follow funny part of it is you can do that two or three times if you ever ran into cluster of person who had been electric shocked violently electric shocked its liable to come off piece meal as clust er you know it isnt pc but some electric shock case having kicked the bucket under the gentle ministrations of what they laughingly call the butchers alright that character goes out as one piece dont you see and he sort of flies around and then he hits somebody thats clust er there be pressure on the body now the preclear wont be part of this cluster itll simp ly be hitting him so the thing you do is youve still got to find mutual engram of the cluster and then the pc may be very confused because hes never had that experience well thats right but its still just the mutual engram of the cluster and then you run the incident 1s out of it and it all goes sssssl its very easy operation if you know the mechanics of the thing so if youre ever puzzle d about this remember hitting pile of gumballs with sledge hammer and then figure out how you would fix that up and thats all there is to it once more youre mak ing too much out of it simple elementary alright now the next one is what do you know when you ret read on overrun on 3 well theres been one incident number an incident 1 overrun on somebody or something but it doesnt mean 3s overrun it means somebody has been overrun on an engram in 3 got it alright and most of you said to handle it like an overrun boy youd go mad trying to handle it as an overrun somebodys got to find what who which has been overrun therefore its very peculiar overrun dont you see if somebody people whove run the thing verbally go back to the beginning of the incident see theyve said this half dozen times the thing is already erased the thetan parks back at the beginning of the incident but there aint anything there and so he stays there in confusion what am i supposed to do here what am i supposed to do here what am i supposed to do here what am i supposed to do here you catch him month or two later and all you do is indicate the fact that hes overrun it and he goes thump what do you know sssst gone see its one of these damn fool foolishnesses see everybody knows the mind is so comp licated that nobody could possibly figure any of these things out truth of the matter is theyre so buried under complexity that theyve been very hard to dig up but once theyre dug up boy they look as plain as dogs bone on the lawn and then you come along and you say see that over there thats dogs bone its just been dug up and people say now lets see is it the bone of cow its irrelevant it doesnt matter what its bone of alright here was question 270 should you find out what the ta is up on before you get it down mostly said yes should you find out what the ta is up on before you get it down not nece ssarily not necessar ily at all you can simply ask the guy what has been overrun it very ordinarily comes down do you follow im afraid that was one of these trick questions one of these sneaky questions but if you first try to find out what it was up on before you did something to get it down you would very often miss this is one of these wild questionsthe ta that starts going up dont you ever as an auditor sit there and watch ta go up you indicate ask if somethings been overrun pc cant find anything come down you start messing around with it at that particular point and youre liable to be in severe trouble right in the middle of session he cant answ er the question he doesnt know whats been overrun thats not been overrun you shoot at it couple of times and it doesnt come down you had better instruct any auditor auditing for you to pack it up and ask for c s dont go on with the thing going up and dont get in fire fight over the pc trying to get it down similarly low ta dont do that in the middle of session all of sudden the guys ta goes low dont start bugging him dont start chopping him up about it because hell get frantic thats why pcs should never be able to see the ta neve r he starts getting frantic youve entered present time problem into this thing and you know very well by the mecha nics of it the person who has present time problem he doesnt make any case g ain well lets look at it now the guy knows hes got his ta high or he knows hes got his ta low he now has present time problem right the weird part of it is youre not going to solve it your chances of setting the ta down at that moment are zero thats how you get into these fire fights cause the guys now got present time problem if youre going to ask him anything do you have present time problem yes i have presen t time problem i have ta thats high well good thank you very much youll watch the ta come down you see its idiocy but if the guys ta is starting to rise and you cant immediately go back and say hey wait minute it goes back to here and rehab it right now pack it up dont just sit there and fool with it ta which inexplicably goes up when it shouldnt be going up usually forecasts itself long time before youll see this persons ta acts up suddenly why actually the thing i would do on it is i wouldnt fool around with ta that suddenly inexplicably goes up the auditor tried to rehab say did i bypass an f n so forth and yip yip and so on was something been overrun and the ta keeps going up oh brother unload unload knock it right off right there pack it up and say thank you very much and send it send the thing for c s or make somebody send it to you for c s what you normally order what you normally order that is the most successful is seven special cases something has appeared on this case that wasn t here before and youre liable to get the most astonishing result out of this and once you do that wham wham wham wham now dont in session try to c s it at the same time ive tried to keep you from doing that but if you cant immediately spot hey wait minute i bypassed an f n on you you should see it right in front of you you say what the hell was the matter with i mean there it was he got an f n on clearing the command and i thought he was still f ning on the last process and obviously he f ned on clearing the command and i missed it the tall go flow boom f n see nothing to it but if that doesnt happen and it doesnt clear it and so on then you had better do an assessment and every other damn thing those are the proper actions for handling high ta or low ta but if the guys ta is going low and hes getting arc break needles with the ta down at 15 and all of this sort of thing and oh wow wow wow you can get into an awful fire fight with pc under that one too and the best thing to do if you dont immediately rehabilitate it wham wham wham and its quite obvious what this thing was all about in the first place it isnt gonna do him bit of harm running with low ta cause itll come right back up again usually low tall come right back up again theres case after case around that every time you ask them question the ta goes down to 17 and then as they answ er it it goes back up to 2 so why get why get all sweated us about it but he goes down to 15 and has an f n well thats for sure an arc break so that you can check that out easily enough you can check it out now but if its getting difficult to check out pack it up get another c s get back off of this thing and take look at it and see whats wrong with this case all of sudden all will meet the eye youre busy processing somebody who is so pts it is pathetic the whole behavior of the case is this you start tracing back through other arc breaks the persons had its always an arc break with mother or its an arc break with something or its an arc break with wuf wuf vuf and each time they have this arc break the ta is sunk persons pts as hell this is the time to run an s and d something of that sort hes pts you know that low ta equals invalidation high ta equals overrun theres nothing more simple than that do you follow alright now whether you know it the thetan starts to spin on incident 1 well he doesnt spin on incident 1 really in the first place but he has run an incident that should be what do you know if the thetan starts to spin on section 3 and so forth or something he normally has run 1 on one thetan and 2 on another thetan so thats hes got 2 which has been run without its 1 and its when you run 2 without its 1 that the guy spins yet people will do this every now and then they run they will run on this one and 1 on joe and 2 on pete now pete starts to freewheel so all you have to ask is whe n did you run the incident 2 something like that and alright then get the same thetan down and run an incident 1an d he unspins just like that magical right now thats all thatts wrong do you follow some said not enough food and rest and other said the case was overcharged both of which are probably true but the actual action is hes run usua lly run an incident 1 on one thetan an incident 2 on another thetan and youve got an incident 2 run now with the thetan going through the thirty six days all on big freewheel and maybe whole cluster started through it and the thing to do is to whip it back and get the 1 run on the guys who are going through 2 and you get the incident 1 run itll unspin just like that theres nothing to it alright explain the mechanics of lx1 its the basic postulate he made to move off the track the mechanics of lx1 is simp ly he couldnt stand it anymore so he decided he had been wiped out driven off over powered overwhelmed whatever the words are of lx1 and hes moved off the track and hes not now in his own valence and by running recall you discha rge the top of the engram and you can run the engram out to then and he will get back in his own valence and he can stay in his own valence as long as the case is very badly over charged hes not likely to stay in his own valence some two or three people by the way believe implicitly for some reason or other i dont know why but some two or three people believe that if youd run lx1 you omitted the valence shifter on the full four rundown and i dont know how anybody would figure that out because the full four rundown doesnt have anything to do with lx1 and one case that had had the valence shifter left out of the full four rundown had lot of trouble at once so its not something that you would leave out theres probably fifty ways you could handle the guy out of valence well the first way that was ever written about is in dianetics the modern science of mental health it says get into your own valence theres was after way you can handle it but the case is so over charged he cant stay in his own valence so you have to discharge the case so anyway case can be discha rged will eventually get him back into his own valence but the full four rundown flips him out of the valence as body thetan and gets him into his own valence so that you can run confront on him if you run the full four you recall the being you run the motivator chain you run the engramovert chain those are the actions you take and that is the only actions which you take you actually could prep check it or something but it seems silly to prep check it because its too hot button and that isnt whats wrong with him ok actually i think you did most remarkably well and i have noticed i have noticed that anybody who can pass long examination with high grade normally knows what hes doing now there are few more points id like to make here before while i still have chance to explain them to you now one at this juncture it will be available to you i have been working too hard with you and so on to actually put together your book of case supervision and what you lack is why certain things are done here and there and i havent explained that in all things it seems sort of mysterious and its funny to to have to explain it because it sort of feels to like im explaining why lead pencil makes mark you know here is this biro and he has its so damn simple some of these things you see hes got folder six inches thick well now look if that many auditors had worxed on him for that long and he is still getting audited the case is overcharged thats very clever analysis isnt it thick older so were going to undertake lot of actions to take charge off the case because its all on the basis that reality is proportonal to the amount of charge off it alright but its that kind of think that kind of think and you wonder actually c s 7 was saying to the other day on one case here god that was clever to prepcheck floating needle look what it did for that case how on earth did you ever guess that cause it just says prepcheck floating needle see bong you know assessme nt nothing bang you know and prepch eck it and wow it goes on and on and on and on and on and its all straightened out and the case d oes beautifully im afraid i cant take too much credit for it because the guy has complained to his auditor about floating needles and he has even said that every time he gets floating needle he feels horrible hes complained to the examiner about floating needle not not very mysterious so i just looked at this and read it over and so forth and i was reading through it to find where i could straighten this case out little bit more and i ordered three prepchec ks on it and the first one to prep check floating needles naturally you see so youre not very mysterious its sort of like asking to explain why is that white sign white what color paint do we use to paint white sign and i look sort of blank and i say well alright white paint great i never would have guessed it you know alright so this guy this guy its reading the folder its reading the folder its reading whats going on thats why auditors have to be able to write and if you want to keep yourself from getting headaches as case supervisor you should insist like hell that auditors either clarify what theyve written or write plainly because otherwise you can pick up case you know trying to make the damn thing out and you want to help the guy and somebodys standing in your road with horrible scribble and and you get strained up on it boom but you look through this thing and you say well i dont find my wife and so on but in the next session wa wa wa wa gab gab and my wife and so on aw for christs sakes theres mystery about it the guy keeps getting off the same withhold and he keeps getting off the same ptps and so forth and in setting up the case lets just make sure that these things get cleaned up thats all they obviously arent getting clean ed up one of the ways and the ways the idiot way they dont get cleaned up is the guy has withhold and he gives it as an arc break the guy has ptp and he gives it as missed withhold so im likely to be as evaluative as this pres check the missed withholds he keeps giving them as arc breaks and ptps and theyre very obvious its guesswork on my part i mean they are see an arc break i dont know how im going to pay for oh god christ thats not an arc break never has never will be and yet somebodys running arcu cdei and then they run this column after column and page after page and arcu cdei and do you have an arc break and heres big fall and then they clean up false and the guy never does give them anything under gods green earth but ptps and then im liable to say fly the ruds but clear each command and the case straightens out you see you cant straighten out case on missed withholds if nobody asks him for anything but arc breaks you see its all this idiot stuff like the way to cross the river you cross the river you know the way to get in the boat is you get in the boat if you want to get the pc someplace in boat you have to have boat to put him in you know its this kind of stuff and the violation of logic is so fantastic as you wouldnt believe it and until youre case supervising you wont believe how easy it is to do its terribly easy very very simp well you cant clean up one rudiment if the guy never doesnt know what the rudiment is and is always cleaning up some other rudiment right you see the case the case is always having trouble with x or something hes always having trouble with this guy hes always having trouble with this guy hes always having trouble with this guy hmm well yes hes at least got problem with him see so you could actually specif ask him about the problem with joe and by earlier similar itsa get rid of it because hes obviously got joe identified with admiral henobarbus back in someplace you know wow its not complicated cases are not complicated when you know this theyre very simple but you have to do the thing youre supposed to do and thats what standard tech beco mes for instance the guys got to have his arc break cleaned up hes in sad effect alright hes in sad effect what you gonna do sit there and pull missed withholds well you know very well thats idiotic but its just as idiotic to clear up his missed withholds by running arc breaks or try to clear up his ptps by he keeps saying theyre arc breaks do you see theres some illogic about all this theres something that doesnt add up about all this and all youd have to do is look for what doesnt add up and thats that but i want to make this point with you very sharply and that is the available f ns how many f ns can you get now youre liable to get yourself problem that runs something like this some weirs problem see and it runs something like this former therapy and you run the motivator engram and the guys still got somatic but its f ned well it f ned well you cant do anything more with that can you still got somatic and you know hes still got somatic of having his guts cut out or whatever they do and he ran the engram of it oh what can we do all is lost theres an available f n on the overt you find and run an overt chain you find out he was maki ng specialty of cutting peoples guts out and thats the somatic and thats why its still there now lets say heres an actual case of somebody who had an incident 2 shot in the brisket run out dischar ge to f n alright great still sore still got the somatic you say oh wow we failed theres another f n available on shooting people in the brisket so you run the overt side of it and the somatic goes pft magically so you dont do any more work than you have to do if you got rid of it running the activator side great but if you ran the motivator side and the guys left with somatic you still got an f n on the overt side do you follow now sometimes you run recall being and then you run doing it and youll get rid of both sides very nicely but it sometimes doesnt work and remember youve still got an f n left look at the number of f ns available on the recall process any recall process theres an f n available any activator chain of secondaries theres an f n available any activator chain of engrams theres an f n available any overt chain of motivators theres an f n available theres an f n available on secondaries overt secondaries theres an f n available on overt engrams and theres an f n available on recall the overt so you got one item assessed off list and what do you know you got six f ns available the possibility of running them all on most cases is slight because you try to run the secondary and theyre liable to plunge into the engram but at the very least youve got two you have been given sketchy line up of it because its usually sufficient but look how many are available now weve got assess the item kicked on some list so we could run recall being kicked bang recall being kicked we could also run recall kicking thats two f ns now we could run the engrams of being kicked and we could also run the engrams of kicking and thats four f ns thats four f ns on the same subject its just which way did the flow go so dont feel all is lost if youve run an engram chain to an f n all is not lost youve got the other chain you can run this mellow says well i got this horrible head this horrible head and it doesnt go away and my back hurts and my head hurts and it just doesnt go away and youve run all of his head injuries and his back injuries and well well get clever you get clever you have an engram chain on the other side you can run also to f n which is him hurting peoples heads hurting peoples backs and youve probably got one on heads and youve probably got one on backs do you follow theres lot of f ns available but your minimum number of f ns on any button is four recall motivator recall overt engram motivator engram overt and if you if its all very sad and mise motional also why youve got two secondaries available recall this death whatever it is see being sad about some relatives death see and you run that thing out and thats all squared around alright did you ever think or running somebody being sad about your death do you see see theres two different things available see and very often when your death engrams or your death secondaries rather wont run its because you know the fellow just lost his uncle and he felt very sad about it and hes griefy and he runs it through and he still feels griery about death and it went to f n but he didnt didnt feel so good and so forth run the secondary run the secondary of somebody feeling bad about his death and all of sudden the whole thing will go zzzt and this is the phenomena now hear now cause every once in while youre going to have gotten an f n on some injury and then have the person complain that it f ned before he got rid of it have you ever had that happen it shows up every now and then well it f ned on the motivator or it f ned on the overt and it hasnt f ned on the other side and theres still mass there theyre not they actually if they checked it over theyre not now sad about their uncles death they just know they got this funny griefy feeling stuck on their skull so they say well it f ned i think it f ned too quick well sure it didnt all disappear well if that side of it f ned hes release d from that side of it theres two sides to that you know now you can turn around and run the other side whichever way it is and the rest of the mass goes pffft and then that really does f n itll be relatively small f n but if youve ever had somebody complain oh well yes well i f ned on it but it really ended off too quick yeah well they had it coming one way and went the other way you pay lot of attention to that cause you know youre running this guy with motivators when hes guilty as of bunch of overts so he f ns on the motivators but the overts are still there bugging him but of course theyre all ready to blow theyll blow now go binge you could just run them very briefly and theyd blow but he dese rves the motivator dont you see and you ran out the motivator now he hasn t got motivator but hes got the overt so he gets sort of unhappy you got it thats how many f ns there are available theoretically therere six f ns available on any button you should be able to plot this course off the top of your head theres nothing to it alright now theres another point here which i havent covered with you too well missed withholds missed withholds missed withholds you are always asking for missed withholds and so forfih and i very often say missed withholds when i say rudiments but the rudiment is withhold the rudiment is not missed withhold the standard rudiment is withhold not missed withhold but withhold and here and there in your sessions youve missed time or two because you havent used withhold because theres whole line of the whole subject of withhold is absolutely fascinating the whole subject of withhold is miraculous and marvelous guys who go around withholding and guys who have withholds and all of this sort of thing you get so accustomed to thinking that guy is bad off because he has withholds that you dont wonder whv hes bad off because he has withholds well hes bad oft because he has withholds not because hes dishonest but because hes not flowing in certain direction and he cant flow in that direction and he keeps it piled up on himsel f and you can get the same action now as well you can practically push his face in you can get something that feels very much like body thetans and so forth just because the guy is withholding just that just withholding nobodys missing withhold hes just withholding ill give you an example way back when i was fooling around and doing some research thing i all of sudden found out sitting at breakfast that it was very unpleasan t procee ding sitting at breakfast for the excellent reason that the wax type of milk carton which is cold clammy and slimy sitting only three or four feet from if i would beco incau tious enough to let my perceptivity slide out if that far i would collide with this damned cold slimy milk carton see waxed paper milk carton so id have to eat breakfast held back from this milk carton after while id find myself getting sort of cross and id get up and id be fine and then i suddenly realized maybe other people get up against things and they dont go back out in that direction so i have checked this out and that turned out to be the case thetans withhold they withhold energy they withhold beams they withhold emotion they withhold mass they withhold from going someplace when they shoot somebody they withhold from being him nobody missed it and case can get just gorgeously stacked up because of withholds withhold withhold thus american girls are very often quite withholdy and the reason why is is over in america the girls dont arent taught to shake hands and theyre taught that they must be reache d for and never to reach and that its unladylike to reach and that sort of thing criticism of it one way or the other but you will eventually find them sort of and anybody else in the world thats been trained that way you eventually find them sort of caved in and you as an auditor might think theyve committed some fabulous crime whereas its more important than the fact that they must not ever reach in the direction of man or mustnt ever reach in the direction of another person its which directions they mustnt reach and theyre withheld permanently from that area see there they are withholding withholding withholding withholding withholding withholding eventually they squash their noses and now you come along and youre asked to perform some miracle freed from squashing my nose sort of miracle you know now this is very unimportant in the lower grades but when you get up into the ot sections what im telling you now is very very important because you are going to find some guys have nothing more wrong with them than the damn fools keep on holding onto their bodies from in front and that those horrible somatics theyve got that is tearing their knees apart or something like that is sim ply them pushing on their knees its very mysterious oh what can be wrong with george he seems to have these sore throats all the time well now the guy is up around an honest 5 or something like this and he starts developing sore throat and so on you of course dont audit in this fashion but you could say you know why dont you let go of your throat boy so hell say oh have i got ahold of my throat yes very difficult very difficult the guys get into ot sections they one will withhold from things and they can damn near pull their skulls off or crush their chests or something see or theyve got hold of the body or somebody has offered them something and theyve suddenly tensed back from it and its practicall busted their ribs or something and you run into one of them right after hes flinched from something of this sort he walked out of the building and he comes back in and hes all caved in and you say oh my god what masses have we got he must have more body thetans lets see what can we do what wonderful process do we have to run on this bird and the funny part of it is if you use the rudiment withhold particularly as you get up into the upper sections as well as the rudiment missed withhold and the way you do that is you ask for withhold and then determine whether or not its the kind of withhold which is discreditable so somebody would miss it or whether its just plain withhold and youll ask for the missed afterwards or not ask for it but the actu proper rudiment question on ot levels is withhold not missed do you have any missed withholds now ive been watching it go on here for some time and been expecting in vain for some of you to suddenly ask the ordinary garden variety way back when rudiment do you have withholds or are you withholding anything now you start asking ots if theyre withholding anything and fifty percent of their somatics will just go up in smok see so youre missin g one this is the great ease with which some of this stuff works so the guy has just went up and pulled himself back on the curb suddenly so that he couldnt be hit by the taxi cab and he comes in and hes all so on you set in youre getting in the ruds you dont have to know all that see youre getting are you withholding anything and have you withheld anything or something like that and you get little read and he feels wonderful oh yeah taxi cab i got myself back off the curb i withheld yeah thats it whmi because youre dealing with somebody who is already pulling and squashing and grabbing now theoretically you could also ask somebody where you got hold of the body and that would cause it on the ot sections you cant figure out what in the hell is going on add that to your repertoire just do you have hold of the body or are you pushing on the bony in some way if theyre not you wont get any read and if they are the damn meter will blow up you got the point because youre dealing with somebody who holds onto bodies who pulls back bodies who withholds bodies who withholds energy who pulls in energy beams do you follow so that you certainly check this on the upper levels not very important on the lower grades we found out that newspa per reporters were never never never able never never never never able to make little beep meter we had work whereas any anybody who had been audited at all could make the thing connect and spark and short circuit we had little machine wed set it up and we found that newspa per reporters wogs guys off the street theyd look at this thing and theyd try to do it see rather pathetic you know theyd try to do it and nothing happened they couldnt make the thing close actually all you had to do is put spark between it and buzzer went off you can set up two two contacts or hold one contact next to body while the body is also connecte d to another contact very low voltage and you hold that out from the cheek and then somebody stands off thirty feet and makes beam he puts beam between the cheek and the finger and the buzze r goes and he can turn the buzzer on and off at will its one of the most remarkable experiences you ever saw i n your lifethe lower level guy he couldnt do it and anybody who had been audited at all boy he could make that thing go beeps and off and on and first hed say christ i couldnt be doing that that is not possible and then ding yes that was hey im an electric eel see he could do it he could do it thirty forty fifty feet away as far as he could see it which is very interesting indeed now if guy can do that he also can of course apply close up on his own body the most fantastic amounts of energy actually you can apply him almost at any distance you got that one now also let give you another one that goes along with some ots go around get high ta because they lean on things and if all else fails remember that they also can lean on things they habitually push against wall because rooms are too smal l and they dont catch themsel ves doing it and it pushes up their ta they lean on the wall very simple they will do anything that guy would do with current current or force you can expect anybody to do one guy had terrible trouble because he had ringing in his ears and he was ringing them now to show you how far out some things can as there is dictionary which i did not do which is called the scientology dictionary ive never read it it was called to my attention the other day that the definition of recall in it is to reexperience which is completely wrong i merely bring this up as what happens when i start clarifying materials few bulletins few things come out that i havent written i havent said anything about theres some er ors creed in those things and it throws technology out this is what youve got to keep an eye out for if you run into this sort of thing why send it through to and let find out whether or not it is factual or not on clarification because youre liable to get in some arguments with somebody on it another datum i wanted to give you is you can do two or three assessments on lx1 and run each one of them with engram chains and recalls and everything else i mean its quite remarkable they move upscale on lx1 theyll get different buttons and you can do the same things with them all over again now we have we have pretty well reached the end of the line here we have pretty well reached the end of the line and we have the general situation pretty well in hand not to pile you up with tremendous amount of data here in the last few minutes of play but i will tell you this that putting through this org viii course as we have called it aboard has been quite tour force it has been called for lot of coordination in lot of ways and i noticed even down in the last few minutes of play that we were still riding close to the edge in some instances an d all that got straightened out now i want to talk to you for just few minutes here on the subject of what you will be doing what your difficulties might be first and foremost people are going to ask you wha t is so different about standard tech that is different from scientology and wise guy sort of answe r which is perfectly legitimate is well you see standard tech is the way ron does it that was s ort of just you know floor the opposition but the truth of the matter is is standard tech is standardization of processes so that they apply to hundred percent of the cases to which they are addressed and that was the main thina and it was codifying style of auditing which produced maximum results in minimum time and that was what standard tech was and theyre going to say well that therefore invalidates my class iv my class vi and you say duo not not at all not at all but in due course when you have learned all there is to know about everything you can also learn to be totally simple and when you achieve that you have achieved then maximum velocity and maximum gain standard tech is simply how to achieve maximum velocity maximum gain in processing and what are the real importances in processing and how do you set cases us and what do you do with them the truth of the matter is the subject itself was pretty well wrapped up in 1966 but required settling down and it hasnt been until now that i have settled the whole subject down and have begun to take out of the lineup additives which have been put in there that were unnecessar and made it come back and do what is was supposed to do for instance as youve seen even on the ot sections i have taught you how to get something like maximum gain out of the ot sections ive taught you how to get more gain more velocity out of the actions which other people would say well i dont see how thats any different than anything ive been doing i sit down at table i let people talk to while i fiddle with my em eter i dont see how anythings different about that and so forth well ill tell you to whom it will make great deal of difference itll make deal of difference to somebody who has been trying to put across to somebody that his case hasnt been handled and people have gone on not handling it for some time it will make great deal of difference to that person it will also start to make difference to anybody else in the vicinity who is audited by comparison hes been audited one way and he suddenly starts getting audited in highly simple way and he starts maki ng much faster case ga ins in the same line of direction so in actual fact standard tech for all of the technology or for all of the work which has gone into the simplification of it for all the work of codification of how i got it across to you and so on is more of an experience than an action it is something which is experienced and after youve been at it for while youve either got it or you aint you see its something you experienced now just as the lowest mark on the course was the one who had been audited the least this coordinated he started to catch up undoubtedly in the last couple of days but it took catch up because its something one experiences now i dont want auditors at large across the world to believe that all of their training is invalidated quite the contrary what i believe is that somebody has invalidated their training what were doing is deinvalidating training what they have learned they have learned and then somebody has pushed it aside so they felt that is was not learned and what it required was stabilization and giving one back security of the data and if one had security of data he could then carry on very nicely and very smoothly because with that secur ity of data and with somebody holding him on the square hair line road of it he all of sudden realized that by doing it just this way and using must this data he all of sudden got things to fly which have never been flown before and so therefore the biggest hump in standard tech is the auditor making it work and the auditor having it work on him can he make it work as an auditor does it work on him and so on and out of that of course you get your superlative auditor for instance itd be very difficult to kid about how this worked or that worked or something else worked i know how these things work and anybody who has worked very long in this field with standard tech and hes seen this work and hes seen the put together and hes managed to cut it down to where hes to look at it is totally simple and so forth to jar him out of that rut would be very very difficult indeed in fact people are liable to accuse him of being unbudgeable or conservative or fuddyduddy whats the matter you mean he wont run pcs wiggling their ears anymore and so forth but people are going to ask you people are going to ask you why is standard tech so different than just general tech well actually there is general tech there has really never been anything but standard tech but it required codification it required delivery it required simplification and once the research line was completed on it it had to be delivered and it had to be delivered in the simplest possib fashion it is neces sary actually for an auditor to go all over the research lines and datas and side panels and everything else of this whole subject as he does on the class vi course before he can appreciate all there is to know and how little of it is main line action and if he gets that all settled and straightened out he knows tremendous body of data about the mind there are fabulous amounts of it you actually if you settle down on just standard tech only and didnt know the other lines then people would think they were making fabulous disco veries every time they found out that you could match terminal couple of mock ups see they didnt know that that was ever part of the subject matter but do you know oddly enough if hypnotism and lot of other subjects of one kind or another went this route the material which was evolved in the days of mesmer and charcreax was considerable there was an enormous amount of it and its been boiled down now to some little tiny balderdash that doesnt even work but there was lot known in this particular field there was lot known and it has all more or less disappeared it isnt know to anybody anymore its very funny now any day now i expect somebody to break out and find out that there is such thing as an hypnotic rapport guy pinches himse lf in the shoulder and somebody else feels the pinch and theyre going to be very fascin ated row did that happen actually its all part and is called actually mesmerism back in the eighteenth century if one doesnt know the scope of disco very of subject he cannot then take hold of its various importances if one doesnt know how wide the study is then he cann ot also find out how narrow is the walk that goes through it if you can grasp that youve got it made and youre going to see that when you talk to an acad emy student and youre going to tell him just exactly what youre doing is great and hes doing just exactly this and you actually think you have cracker jack auditor and he can do exactly what you say and go ahead and this is great and you think thats fine there is reason to make class vi out of him hes doing so well this guy is in danger of stepping off the edge of the sidewalk and finding out some horrendous thing like invent problem get himself some big win feel that the field has not been covered or researched and then hes completely off into some brand new field scientology being only this tiny little simple thing you see hes in this brand new field which has vast ocean of data in connected to it because hes never been exposed to the data he actually wont be an auditor who can hold the line until hes also found how much there is to hold and then he will understand it now when you try to relay to somebody this is standard tech i am class viii yes people are going to be making bunch of lot of fuss over you thats for sure and you have dese rved it youve earned it they will try to feel uninvalidated not invalidated and this sort of thing and be happy about this well you can help them be happy about the whole thing by saying oh well you see the funny part of it is is all the simp things you know are true and the only difference is is you dont know how true they are and ron said for to tell you that standard tech does not invalidate anybodys tech but is just the high velocity fast streamlined way through and it takes the total expert to do it it is the road to total gains well you have to know great deal now all of you have been trained great deal down through the years youve had lots of training of this way and that way and youve done this and youve done that and youve done the other thing the net result of it is that you can look back over it and you can see you can see where its shined up and you can see where it was rather dim and you undoubtedly those of you who have been through saint hill recently and so on and those of you who are very old timers indeed have very good grasp on the whole width of the subject have very very good grass on the subject itself and know very well it is only where your own insights have been themselves then invalidated by bad training or by counterdata or something of this sort that youve had any loses at all now im not trying to tell you you might have known all this before that would be little bit too much that would be bowing out of the picture too much i have done reevaluation of materials reevaluation of add ups and that is very definite part of the spee d which you attain in them these materials have been groomed within an inch of their lives really and this of course is not something that one normally sees when one is trained in some subject he does not see the amount of research or testing or other things that go on with it well thats all been there too but if you notice you have not been trained anything that was very contrary to anything in your training its more main line than otherwise but you certainly have shed lot of com plexities that somebody or another has given you the main the thing that you will run into is the fact that auditing is team action its team action it requires the ethics officer and the hco exec sec and the org exec sec and the qual sec and the this one and the that one and the promotions peodle and the this and so on and the handling it up what i expect you to do what i expect you to do is set and hold the standard and continue to go forward with the standard and by doing that and by doing that consis tently set up examples of what can be done and continue to set up those examples of what can be done so that people eventually realize that thats what can be done and then they start doing it too that i do expect you to do and i know youll do that it has been an all night all day proposition of training the first org viiis you have had some fairly damp times of it i have had some rather snarly times i have never read my c s 7 the lrh comm staff has never made the tape of snarling over some of these folders and so forth but she often threatened to do so because some of them were pretty gruesome i mean the snarls not much the folders and somehow or another we would bring it all off and somehow or another why amongst us we seem to have gotten through with it and you all made it for which i thank you very much now youve contributed great deal to this class you have made the grade in more ways than one and i appreciate very much what youve done and i respect you great deal for coming here and going through the lineup and coming out the other end victorious and for that i wish to thank you thank you very much
