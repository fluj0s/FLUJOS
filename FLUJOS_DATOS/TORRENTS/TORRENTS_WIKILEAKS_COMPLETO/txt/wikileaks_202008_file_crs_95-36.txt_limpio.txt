resources science and industry division summary the advanced technology program atp was created by pl 100418 the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 to encourage publicprivate cooperation in the development of precompetitive technologies with broad application across industries administered by the national institute of standards and technology laboratory of the department of commerce this activity has been targeted for elimination as means to cut federal spending since fy2000 original housepassed appropriation bills have not included funding for atp many of the administrations budget requests have proposed termination of the program however atp continued to be supported although at levels below that achieved in fy1995 when the activity was expanded significantly in fy2007 the program was funded at 79 million the presidents fy2008 budget request did not include financing for atp the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 replaces atp with the technology innovation program tip and provides 652 million with an additional 5 million in atp fy2007 unobligated balances 176 less than the previous fiscal year pl 110 69 the america competes act authorized the creation of tip program rationale title v of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act pl 100418 established the advanced technology program atp this effort grew out of concerns over the competitiveness of american companies in the global marketplace while numerous factors affect the rate of technical progress in an economy what was seen as critical is how quickly and successfully science and technology are transformed into new or better products processes or services the commercialization and diffusion of goods and services stood out as significant problems in the ability of us industries to compete underlying the structure of atp was an effort to foster cooperation among government industry and academia to facilitate the generation of new technologies for the commercial market while opponents argue that joint ventures stifle competition proponents assert that they are designed to accommodate the strengths and responsibilities of various sectors collaborative projects attempt to utilize and integrate what the crs2 participants do best and to direct rd activities toward the goal of meeting marketplace demands joint endeavors are seen as reducing risks and costs while permitting work that crosses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience program operation the advanced technology program was designed to serve as focal point for cooperation between the public and private sectors in the development of industrial technology and to help solve problems of concern to large segments of an industry as noted in the conference report to accompany the bill placed within the national institute of standards and technology nist in recognition of the laboratorys ongoing relationship with industry atp provided seed funding to single companies or to industry led consortia of universities businesses andor government laboratories for development of generic broadbased precompetitive technologies that have many applications across industries awards based on technical and business merit were for highrisk work past the basic research stage but not yet ready for commercialization market potential was an important consideration in project selection scientific and technical review generally was performed by federal and academic experts business plan assessments were made by individuals from the private sector awards were for either product or process technology development individual firms were restricted to funding of 2 million over three years money was to be used only for direct rd costs large firms provided at least 60 of total direct and indirect projects costs small and mediumsized companies were not required to costshare direct costs joint ventures could receive up to five years of financing for any amount limited only by availability in such cases the private sector provided more than 50 of funding while universities and federal laboratories could participate in collaborative work the atp grant was made solely to companies pl 102245 modified the original law and required that the recipient of an atp award be firm that is usowned company that has majority ownership or control by individuals who are citizens of the united states or business that is incorporated in the united states and has parent company established in country that affords american firms reciprocal opportunities according to nist through the end of 2007 824 projects were funded of which about 28 were joint ventures approximately 24 billion in federal funds have been matched by 22 billion from the private sector small businesses or cooperative efforts led by such firms made up almost 68 of the awardees the first four competitions ending august 1994 were general in nature in 1995 nist restructured part of atp to focus on various groups of projects in welldefined programmatic areas designed for longrange support selected in conjunction with industry since fy1999 one competition has been held in all areas of technology the america competes act pl 11069 authorized new technology innovation program tip to replace atp the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 provides funding for tip while similar to atp in the intent to promote highrisk rd that would be of broadbased economic benefit to the nation there are several differences in the operation of the new activity support under tip is limited to small and mediumsized businesses whereas grants under atp were available to companies regardless of size in addition in the advanced technology program joint ventures were required to include two separately owned forprofit firms and could include crs3 universities government laboratories and other research establishments as participants in the project but not as recipients of the grant in the tip initiative joint venture may involve two separately owned forprofit companies but may also be comprised of one small or mediumsized firm and university or other nonprofit research institution single company could receive up to 2 million dollars for up to three years under atp under tip the participating company which must be small or mediumsized business may receive up to 3 million for up to three years in atp small and mediumsized companies were not required to cost share large firms provided 60 of the total cost of the project while in tip there is 50 cost sharing requirement which again only applies to the small and mediumsized businesses that are eligible there were funding limits for the fiveyear funding available for joint ventures under atp the tip limits joint venture funding to 9 million for up to five years the advisory board that was created to assist in the advanced technology program included industry representatives as well as federal government personnel and representatives from other research organizations the advisory board for the technology innovation program would be comprised of only private sector members in its first year fy1991 atp was funded at 36 million appropriations increased to 48 million in fy1992 679 million in fy1993 and 1995 million in fy1994 for fy1995 financial support expanded significantly to 3405 million including rescissions funding for fy1996 was 221 million 225 million in fy1997 and 1925 million in fy1998 congress provided 1975 million in fy1999 including rescissions in fy2000 the appropriations bill originally passed by the house included funding for atp since as stated in the accompanying report the program has not produced body of evidence to overcome those fundamental questions about whether the program should exist in the first place however atp was financed 1426 million for fy2000 the following year again the original housepassed appropriations bill did not fund the program although 1457 million was ultimately appropriated the bush administrations fy2002 budget proposed suspension of new atp projects pending program evaluation the initial appropriations bill passed by the house terminated atp final legislation financed the effort at 1845 million the following fiscal year 1788 million was appropriated after rescissions in fy2004 both the presidents budget request and the original housepassed appropriations bill provided support for the program however atp was funded at 1705 million after mandated rescissions while the fy2005 budget proposal and the original appropriations legislation passed by the house once again did not include funding for atp 1365 million was provided after mandated rescissions this situation held for the fy2006 appropriations process although 79 million after mandated rescissions was finally appropriated by congress for fy2007 the administrations budget did not include funding for atp nor did the appropriations bill initially passed by the house and reported from the senate committee on appropriations during the 109th congress final fy2007 legislation provided 79 million for the program the presidents fy2008 budget request contained support for atp the initial fy2008 appropriations bill that passed by house hr 3093 would have funded atp at 931 million while the senatepassed version provided 100 million 308 million of which was to be directed toward other programs in the federal bureau of investigation and the us marshals service the final fy2008 appropriations legislation pl 110 161 finances the new technology innovation program at 652 million with an crs4 additional 5 million from fy2007 atp unobligated balances the tip initiative replaces atp results nist has undertaken numerous analyses of atp the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office has also studied the program in its first evaluation 1994 nist concluded the program had stimulated research that would not have been done without the federal support that rd cycles within companies have been abbreviated and that valuable business alliances had been created1 however in may 1995 report gao argued that these conclusions can not be adequately substantiated by the information provided in the nist study on which they are based2 acknowledging that it was too early to determine the longterm impact of atp the gao report stated that some of the indicators nist utilized may create false expectations of the programs economic success nist vigorously defended its methodology additional studies funded by nist found that atp shortened rd cycles by half and accelerated technological progress within the firm stimulated productive collaborative activities among companies and between firms and universities facilitated commercialization and increased private sector investment in high risk technology development3 an april 2000 progress report reinforced these earlier findings4 this study indicated that participants in 261 projects have identified more than 1200 different applications or uses of the technologies under development and that the majority of these are new solutions to market needs or improvements in existing products or processes product cycles are being reduced and while 24 of respondents said that they would not have undertaken the project without atp funding most others noted that the rd would have been significantly slower without such support nist found that organizations are pursuing different rd than they would have undertaken without atp funding and that this work is more technically advanced and risky the atp financing also stimulated additional private sector money in these technical areas than otherwise would be the case over half of the companies are now able to make new or improved product in march 2000 testimony raymond kammer then director of nist stated that approximately 120 new technologies have been commercialized according to nist 1 national institute of standards and

commercialization and diffusion of enabling technologies progress report by jeanne w powell and karen l lellock april 2000 crs5 more than 60 of atp projects have resulted in commercial products and processes available in the marketplace5 the concern over whether atp supports projects that could reasonably attract private sector investment has been an issue throughout the life of the program in report examining award winners and near winners during the first four years of atp gao found the program funded both projects that would not have progressed without this federal support and those that would have been financed by the private sector6 half of the awardees stated that they would have continued without atp financing of the near winners 50 pursued their efforts in the absence of federal money but took longer to achieve their goals according to gao while 63 of the applicants did not look elsewhere for funds about half of the applicants who did were told by prospective funders that their projects were either too risky or precompetitive characteristics that fulfill the aims of atp funding respondents also noted that the program facilitated development of joint ventures to pursue atp activities study undertaken by the american enterprise institute concluded that atp has had only limited success in choosing projects that could not raise private sector funds according to the authors this has occurred because companies are not interested in pursuing rd that fails to complement work performed for profit in addition the atp selection criteria focus on commercial sales and job creation not on projects for which there are broad social benefits and insufficient private investment an april 2000 report by gao reinforced by may 26 2005 testimony noted that two inherent factors in atps current award selection process the need to guard against conflicts of interest and the need to protect proprietary information make it unlikely that atp can avoid funding research already being pursued by the private sector in the same time period7 issues and observations there have been efforts in the past several years to terminate the advanced technology program these actions along with additional attempts to withdraw government support for other technology development efforts appear to reflect philosophy that eschews direct federal financing of private sector rd efforts aimed at the commercialization of new technologies and production processes such activities are seen by opponents as industrial policy the means by which government rather than the marketplace picks winners and losers instead measures that would occasion better investment environment for industry to expand their innovationrelated efforts would proponents argue be preferable to government

governmentindustryuniversity interaction and practices to promote technology transfer direct measures involve among other things federal funding for atp and the small business innovation research program these costshared programs have been supported in part because of their potential contribution to the countrys national or economic security proposals to terminate or severely limit atp have renewed the debate over the role of the federal government in promoting commercial technology development in arguing for less direct federal involvement advocates believe that the market is superior to government in deciding technologies worthy of investment mechanisms that enhance the markets opportunities and abilities to make such choices are preferred it is suggested that agency discretion in selecting one technology over another can lead to political intrusion and industry dependency on the other hand supporters of direct methods argue that it is important to focus on those technologies that have the greatest promise as determined by industry and supported by matching funds from the private sector they assert that the government can serve as catalyst for cooperation technological progress is important to the nation because of its contribution to economic growth and high standard of living how best to achieve this continues to be debated critics viewed atp as means for federal agency to select commercial firms andor technologies for support they maintain that the absence of marketgenerated decisions will result in technologies that can not be utilized productively by participating companies such program encourages selection of wellwritten proposals rather than assistance for truly important technologies however proponents stressed that atp was market driven and that the technical areas for investment have been developed in conjunction with industry in addition companies were required to put up significant amounts of funding and survive rigorous business review procedures that made the advanced technology program different from other federal efforts replacing atp with the technology innovation program may be one response to criticism that large firms should not be the recipient of this form of federal research funding one that should be reserved for small and mediumsized companies that do not have access to the private capital available to major corporations for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9536
