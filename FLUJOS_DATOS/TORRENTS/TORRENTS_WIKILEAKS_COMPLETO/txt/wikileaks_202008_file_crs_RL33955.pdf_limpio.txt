to naval force planning in which capability requirements for warfighting and for maintaining daytoday naval forward deployments are calculated and then integrated the cnarecommended force parallels fairly closely navy thinking at the time on the size and composition of the fleet this is perhaps not surpri sing given that much of cnas analytical work is done at the navys request the oft study fundamentally challenges current navy thinking on the size and composition of the fleet and presents an ssentially cleansheet proposal for future navy that would be radically different from the currently planned fleet this is perhaps not surprising given both ofts institutional role within dod as leading promoter of military transformation and th views of retired navy admiral arthur

planned for procurement among the ei ght new ship designs were four types of large surface ships that would be bu ilt from common relatively inexpensive merchantlike hull design developed in 2004 for

of 30 joint strike fighters jsfs 6 mv22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles uavs the total of 36 manned aircraft is about half as many as in todays carrier air wings and the oft architecture envisaged substituting two of these new carriers for each of todays carriers this new ca rrier would also have support spaces for unmanned underwater vehicl uuvs unmanned surface vehicles usvs and mission modules for the 1000ton surface combatant described below missileandrocket ship that would be equipped with 360 vertical launch system vls missile tubes and 4 trainable rocket launchers additional spaces on this ship could be used to support uuvs usvs and mission modules for the 1000ton surface combatant alternatively these spaces could be used to provide limited stowage and working space for the 100t on surface combatant described below and mission modules for these 100ton ships an amphibious assault ship that would embark notional air wing of either 30 ch46 equivalent s or 6 jsfs 18 mv22s and 3 gyrocopter heavylift helicopters it would also have spaces for marine corps equipment unma nned vehicles and mission modules for the 1000ton surface combatant

undersea vehicles uuvs the aip submarines were substituted for virginia class ssns on cost basis of roughly four to one these submarines could be nuclearpowered if they are designed and built based upon competitive cost suppressing business model page 60 the strategy of transporting the aip submarines to the theater using transport ships is not mentioned in the report but was explained at february 18 2005 meeting betwee n crs and analysts who contributed to the oft reportaircraft is roughly oneeighth as ma ny as in todays carrier air wings and the oft architecture envisages substituting eight of these new carriers for each of todays carriers this new ship would have maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots 1000ton surface combatant with maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots and standard interfaces fo r accepting various modular mission packages these ships would selfdeploy to the theater and would be supported in theater by one or more of the 57000ton ships described above 100ton surface combatant with maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting various modular mission packages these ships would be transported to the theater by the 57000ton mother ship and would be supported in theater by that ship and possibly also the 57000ton missileandrocket ship nonnuclearpowered submarine equipped with an air independent propulsion aip system these aip submarines would be lowercost supplements to the navys nuclearpowered submarines ssns and would be transported from home port to the theater of operations by transpor t ships the oft architecture envisaged substituting four of these submarines for the ssn in each carrier strike group5 the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants would be built as relatively inexpensive sea frames like the littoral combat ship lcs the oft report combines these eight types of ships plus the navys currently planned taoeclass resupply ship into fleet that would include much larger total number of ships than planned by the navy about the same number of carrierbased aircraft as planned by the navy and larg numbers of unmanned systems the oft report presents three alternative versions of this fleet which the report called alternatives b and c the report calcu lates that each of these alternatives would be equal in cost to the quivalent parts of the navys 375ship proposal each of these alternative force structures like th equivalent parts of the navys 375ship proposal would be organized into 12 carri er strike groups csgs 12 expeditionary strike groups esgs and 9 surface strike gr oups ssgs the three

program for future seabasing platformsand technologies 12 the csba report raises seve ral questions about the na vys emerging sea basing concept for conducting expeditionary ope rations ashore the report states the work done thus far on sea basing is intriguing but neither the concept nor the supporting technologies appear sufficiently mature to justify any nearterm decisions such as canceling lpd17 procu rement in favor of mpff ships or removing the well deck from the big deck amphibious assault platforms both of which would severely curtail the fleet s ability to launch surface assaults over the longer term given these large uncertainties major moves toward the sea basing vision should be made without further exploring the sea basing concept itself and experimenting with different numbers and types of sea base platforms connectors and capabilities13 observations observations about the cna oft and csba reports can be made on several points including the following organizations and authors analytical approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs10 14 see csbas website httpwwwcsbaonlineorguse of prospective shipprocureme nt funding levels as force planning consideration fleet size and structure whether the recommended force qualifies as an alternative fleet architecture fleet capability transition risks and implications for the industrial base each of these is discussed

rotation may alter forcelevel requirements for maintaining daytoday forward deployments is somewh at detailed and may have been adapted from other work that cna has done on the topic for the navy oft report the oft report was prepared unde r the direction of retired navy admiral arthur cebrowski who was the director of oft from october 29 2001 until january 31 2005 and the president of the naval war college nwc from july 24 1998 to august 22 2001 during his time at nwc and oft cebrowski was leading proponent of network centric warfare and distri buted force architectures csba report the csba report was prepared by robert work csbas analyst for maritime issues csba describes itself as an independent policy research institute established to promot innovative thinking about defense planning and investment strategies for the 21st cen tury csbas analyticbased research makes clear the inextricable link between fense strategies and budgets in fostering more effective and efficient defense and the need to transform the us military in light of an emerging military revolution14 csbas executive director is dr andrew f krepinevich jr whose prev ious experience includes work in dods office of net assessment the office directed by andrew marshall krepinevich is generally considered major writer on defense transformation analytical approach cna report the cna report grounds its analysis in traditional dod force planning considerations nd campaign modeling the report cites past dod force planning studies that reflect similar approaches the implicit argument in the cna report is that its findings have weight in part because they reflect wellestablished and systematic approach to the problemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs11 15 oft report p 1 16 the principles are complexity smaller ships and improved payload fraction networkcentric warfare and modularity 17 these three things are 1 contribute to the global war on terrorism gwot 2 prepare for possible nucleararmed regional competitors and 3 hedge against the possibility of disruptive maritime competition with china 18 these four force elements are 1 seabased powerprojection and regional deterrence force 2 global patrol gwot and homeland defense force 3 force for prevailing over enemy antiaccessareadenial forces and 4 strategic deterrence and dissuasion force 19 cna report p 36oft report in contrast to the cna report the oft report calls into question the viability of the longstanding logic of naval force building15 the oft report grounds its analysis in four major forcedesign principles that the report identifies as responsive to future st rategic challenges and technological opportunities16 the report then seeks to design fleet that it is consistent with these principles and assesses that fleet using new set of metrics that the report believes to be consistent with these principles the implicit argument in the oft report is that its findings have weight in part because they reflect major forcedesign principles that respond to future strategic cha llenges and technological opportunities csba report the csba report employs an extensive historical analysis of the missions and structure of the us navy and other navies the report argues that the structure of the us navy has sh ifted over time in re sponse to changes in technology and us security challenges nd that us military forces have entered new security era which the report calls the joint expeditionary era during which the us navy will need to do three things17 to do these three things the report argues the navy should be struct ured to include four different force elements18 the report constructs these four fo rce elements and then combines them to arrive at an overall recommended navy force structure the implicit argument in the csba report is that its findings have weight in part because they reflect insights about future missions and force requireme nts gained through careful historical analysis of the missions and structure of the us navy and other navies prospective shippro curement funding levels as consideration cna report the cna report aimed at designing costeffective fleet it also mentions cost estimates relating to the option of homeporting additional attack submarines at guam19 prospective shipprocurement funding levels however are not prominently featured in the cna re port as forceplanning consideration oft report prospective shipprocurement funding levels are significant forceplanning consideration in the oft re port the report argues that an important metric for assessing proposed fleet archit ecture is the ease or difficulty with which it can be scaled up or down to adapt to ch anges in shipprocurement funding levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs12 20 additional points of comparis on the cna range of 256 to 380 ships overlaps with potential ranges of 290 to 375 ships 260 to 325 ships and 243 to 302 ships presented in the navys february 2005 testimony to congress the midpoint of the cnarecommended range 318 ships is similar in terms of total numbers of ships to the 310ship fleet from the 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr unlike the 2001 qdr fleet however the cnarecommended force includes several dozen littoral combat ships lcss and smaller numbers of other kinds of shipsthe oft report contains fairly tailed discussion of the navys budget situation that calls into question on veral grounds the navys prospective ability to afford its 375ship proposal the repor t concludes that funding for navy ship procurement in future years may fall as mu ch as 40 short of what would be needed to achieve the navys 375ship fleet propos if the shortfall is 40 the report estimates the navy could maintain for ce of 270 to 315 ships which is comparable in number to todays force of 282 ships except that the future force would include substantial number of rela tively inexpensive lcss if proportionate reductions are applied to the oft fleets shown in table 2 alternative would include 402 to 469 ships alternative b would include 557 to 650 ships and alternative c would include 609 to 711 ships again these totals would not include certain kinds of ships independently operating ssns etc that ar included in the total of 270 to 315 ships associated with the navys currently planned architecture csba report as with the oft report prospective shipprocurement funding levels are significant forceplanning consideration in the csba report the csba report estimates that in future years th navy may have an average of about 10 billion per year in shipacquisition funding the report then aims at designing force whose ships could be acquired for th is average annual amount of funding fleet size and structure cna report the 380ship fleet at the high end of the cna range is similar in size and composition to the navys 375 ship fleet proposal the 256ship fleet at the low end of the cna range is similar in size and composition to the navys 260 ship fleet for fy2035 except that the 260ship fleet has more lcss and fewer ships in the other ships category20 oft report the oftrecommended fleet would have much larger total number of ships than the navys planned fl eet the oft fleet would also feature much larger share of small combatants of the ships shown in table 2 the small combatants account for about 75 in alterna tive about 79 in alternative b and about 72 in alternative c adding into the mix ssns and other kinds of ships not shown in table 2 would reduce these percentages some what in the navys notional 260 and 325ship

general size range as the 100 and 10 00ton surface combatants in the oft architecture21 csba report the csba force would have about the same total number of ships as the navys 375ship fleet propos csbas subtotals for some ship categories are similar to subtotals in one or more of the other fleet proposals shown in table 1 significant differences between the csba proposal and the other fleet proposals shown in table 3 include the four mediumsized ai rcraft carriers cves the conversion of carrier into an afloat forward staging base the composition of the cruiserdestr oyer force which would include scxs rather than ddg1000s and cgxs the composition of the amphibi ous fleet which would have additional lpd17s in lieu of todays lsd4149s and the composition of the maritime prepositioning force which would continue to include for time at least todays mpf ships rather than the navys planned mpff ships does it qualify as an alternative force architecture cna report as mentioned earlier the cna report uses essentially the same kinds of ships and naval formations as thos planned by the navy if an alternative fleet platform architecture is defined as one that uses ship types or naval formations that differ in some significant way from those currently used or planned then the cnarecommended force arguably would not qualify as an alternative fleet platform architecture oft report since the oft report proposes building ships that are substantially different from those currently planned and combines them ships into formations which although s imilar in name to currently planned formations ie csgs esgs and ssgs might be viewed by some observers as substantially different in composition from the currently pl anned versions of these formations

planned by the navy oft report the 57000ton aircraft carrier in the oft report would be roughly the same size as the united king doms new aircraft carrier design and somewhat larger than the us na vys 40000ton lhalhdtype amphibious assault ships compared to the us na vys aircraft carrier s which displace 81000 to 102000 tons this ship could be considered mediumsize carrier the 57000ton missileandrocket ship in the oft report could be considered similar in some respects to the navy darpa arsenal ship concept of 19961997 which would have been large relativel simple surface ship equipped with about 500 vls tubes22 the 13500ton aircraft carrier in the oft report would be slightly larger than thailands aircraft carrier which was commissioned in 1997 and somewhat smaller than spains aircraft carrier which was based on us design and was commissioned in 1988 due to its sescatamaran hull design this 13500ton ship would be much faster than the thai and spanish carriers or any other aircraft carrier now in operation and might have larger flight deck th is ship could be considered small highspeed aircraft carrier the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants in the oft report could be viewed as similar to but smaller than the 2500 to 3000ton littoral combat ship lcs compared to the lcs they would be closer in size to the streetfighter concept precursor to the lcs that was proposed by retired admiral ce browski during his time at the naval war college the aip submarine in the oft report could be similar to aip submarines currently being devel oped and acquired by some

ranging from large highly developed competitors to small but determined asymmetric adversaries page 6 and be adaptable in dynamic and lesspredictable security environment to changing strategic or operational challenges be capable of both participating in joint expeditionary operations and maintaining the strategic advantage the navy has developed in the global continuedcsba report the proposal in the csba repor t for an afloat forward staging base afsb is similar to other proposal s for afsbs that have been reported in recent years though other proposals have suggested using commercial ships or military sealift ships rather than converted aircraft carriers as the basis for the afsb23 the cve in the csba report like the 57000ton carrier in the oft report can be viewed as mediumsized carrier with full load displacement of perhaps about 40000 t ons the cve would be somewhat smaller than the 57000ton carrier and consequently might embark smaller air wing the cve however would be based on the lhar amphibious ship design ra ther than merchantlike hull and consequently could incor porate more survivability features than the 57000ton carrier fleet capability cna report the cna report uses essentially the same kinds of ships and formations as planned by the navy and recommends generally the same numbers of ships as function of forceplanning variab such as use of crew rotation as consequence the cnarecommended force range would be roughly similar in overall capability to the navys planned architecture oft report the oft architecture differs so significantly from the navys planned architecture that assessing its capability relative to the navys planned architecture is not easy as general matter the oft report stresses overall fleet survivability more than individualship survivability and argues that fleet effectiveness can be enhanced by presenting the enemy with complex task of having to detect track and target large numbers of enemy ships the oft report argues that in addition to warfighting capability fleet can be judged in terms of its capability for adapting to changes in st rategic demands nd funding levels24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs16 24 continued commons avoiding need to choose between optimizing the fleet for performance against asymmetric challenges at the expense of its ability to confront potential adversary capable of traditional high intensity conflictsuch as china pages 1 and 2 pose significant challenges to adversaries seeking to counter us naval forces due to the large numbers of combat entities that the enemy must deal with great variety of platforms with which the enemy must contend speed different combinations of forces distribution of forces across large areas and adversary uncertainty as to the mission and capabilities of given platform page i permit more constant experimentation with new operational concepts and thereby achieve higher rates of learni ng about how to evolve the fleet over time and recognize potential future constraints on navy budgets and make the navy more smoothly scalable to various potential future resource levels by shifting from fleet composed of limited numbers of relatively expensive ships to one composed of larger numbers of less expensive shipsreaders who agree with most or all of these propositions might conclude that the oftrecommended architecture would be more capable than the navys planned architecture readers who disagree with most or all of these propositions might conclude that the oftrecommended architecture would be less capable than the navys planned architecture readers who agree with some of these propositions but not others or who agree with these pr opositions up to certain point but less fervently than oft might conclude that the oftrecommended architecture might be roughly equal in total capability to the navys planned architecture in addressing the question of fleet capability the oft report states alternative fleet formations consisting of small fast and relatively inexpensive craft combining knowledg and attaining flexibility through networking appear superior to the programmed fleet for nontraditional warfare in variety of settings this is due to increasing the complexity the enemy faces and increasing us fleet options that in turn reduce enemy options the speed and complexity of the alternative fleet s can provide them with the capability to complicate and possibly defeat the attempts of nontraditional adversaries to elude surveillance the enemy could have difficulty determining what to expect and how to defeat them all the superior speed and more numerous participants than in the programmed fleet provide stronger intelligence base and more numerous platforms from which to conduct strikes and interceptions this appears to be true even if the smaller craft are individually somewhat less capable and less able to sustain hit th an the larger ships in the programmed fleet if these circumstances are not achieved and the enemy can continue to elude and deceive the navys programme d fleet often is as good as the oft alternatives sometimes even better it is not necessarily better in cases in whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs17 25 oft report pp 7576 italics as in the originalindividual ship survivability dominates perhaps counterintuitive result until we realize that fleet survivability not individual ship survivability is what dominates an area in which programmed fleets might have an advantage would be when the long loiter time or deep r each of ctol conventional takeoff and landing aircraft on programmed bigd eck cvns nuclearpowered aircraft carriers is needed that said there ne ed be great sacrifice with airborne tanking the vstol very short takeoff nd landing aircraft in the alternatives could meet the deep strike and long iter demands also as mentioned earlier combination of advances in emals electromagnetic aircraft launch system and modifications to the jsf will make it possible to launch the jsf with only marginal rangepayload capability penalty moreover trends in technology are providing unmanned aircraft greater capability including greater loiter time and sensor capability25 csba report the csba report argues that its architecture would provide total capability equal to that of the navys planned architecture but at lower total cost because the csba architecture would employ new ship designs such the new undersea superiority system and the scx that because of th eir newer technologies would cost less than but be equal in capability to current designs such as the virginiaclass ssn and ddg1000 destroyer and make more use of the lpd17 hull design whose basic design costs have already been paid and whic h can be produced efficiently in large numbers and adapted economi cally to meet various mission requirements it is plausible that using newer tec hnologies would permit new reducedcost ship designs to be more capable than ch designs would have been in the past whether the increases in capability would ways be enough to permit these ships to be equal in capability to more expensive current designs is less clear the navy may be able to achieve this with new ssn design because several new submarine technologies have emerged since the virg iniaclass design wa s developed in the 1990s but achieving this with new larg surface combatant design could be more challenging because the ddg1000 design wa s developed within the last few years and few new surface combatant technologies may have emerged since that time if one or more of the reducedcost designs rn out to be less capable than current designs then the csba architecture would not generate as much total capability as the report projects the csba report also argues that its architecture would produce force with mix of capabilities that would better fit future strategic demands to achieve this the report recommends among other things reducing currently planned nearterm procurement of new destroyers and mpf f ships increasing currently planned procurement of new amphibious ships and changing the currently planned investment mix for aircraft carriershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs18 26 on the topic of transitioning to the pr oposed fleet architecture the report states implementation of the alternative fl eet architecture should start now and should target option generation shor t construction time and technology insertion the alternative further provid an opportunity to reinvigorate the shipbuilding industrial base the many smaller ships manned and unmanned in the alternative fleet architecture could be built in more shipyards and would be relevant to overseas markets the potential longevity of the existing fleet will sustain existing shipyards as they move into building smaller ships more rapidly in this broader market and more comp etitive environment the shipyards would develop competence broad relevance and operate in an environment driven by market imperatives instead of framework of laws that frustrates market forces as the new ships enter service and the fleet has the opportunity to experiment with new operational concepts expanded networkcentric warfare in particular existing ships can be retir ed sooner to capture operations savings at this point the sooner the existing fleet is retired the sooner the benefits of the alternative fleet architecture design will accrue page 3 additional general discussion of implem entation is found on pp 7677 of the reportreaders who agree with csbas descrip tion of future strategic demands and who agree that csbas recommended investment changes respond to those demands might conclude that the csbarecommended architecture would be better optimized than the navys planned architecture to meet future needs readers who disagree with one or both of these propositions mig ht conclude that the navys planned architecture might be better optimized or that neither architecture offers clear advantages in this regard implementation risks cna report implementation risks associated with the force recommended in the cna report include developing nd designing the various types of ships included in the plan including in par ticular the ddg1000 destroyer which is to incorporate number of new technologies and the issue of whether navy funding levels in coming years would be adequate to build and maintain the recommended fleet oft report the oft report does not include detailed plan for transitioning from todays fleet architecture to its proposed architecture26 but such plan could be developed as followon analysis the pl an could involve replacing existing ship designs and associated formations as th ey retire with ofts recommended new ship designs and associated formations implementation risks associated with the force recommended in the oft report include veloping and designing the eight new types of ships included in the plan includi ng the four types of large ships based on the 57000ton commerciallike hull the 13500 ton sescatamaran aircraft carrier since it would be much larger than other sescatamaran ships the aip submarine since the aip technology is relatively new and nonnuclearpowered submarine has not been designed and built for the us navy since the 1950s and the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants since new t echnologies are needed to achieve the increased payload fraction that these ships are to have the oftrecommendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs19 force could pose implementation risks due to the new kinds of naval formations that would be used which coul d require development of new doctrine concepts of operations and tactics csba report stated goal of the csba report is to pr ovide detailed practical transition road map for shifting from todays fleet structure to the reports recommended fleet structure the many specific recommendations made in the report could be viewed as forming such road map implementation risks associated with the force recommended in the csba report include devel oping and designing the reducedcost ssn and the reducedcost scx surface combatant particularly since these two new ship designs are to be equal in capability to the more expensive designs they would replace implications for industrial base cna report since the cna report uses esse ntially the same kinds of ships and naval formations as those in use t oday or planned by th navy and recommends similar numbers of ships the industrial base implications of the cnarecommended force would appear to be similar to those of the navys current plans oft report the oft report seeks to reduce unit shipbuilding costs and thereby permit an increase in total ship numbers by shifting the fleet away from complex highly integrated ship designs that are inherently expensive to build and toward lesscomplex merchantlike hulls and small sea frames that are inherently less expensive to build similarly the oft re port seeks to increase shipbuilding options for the navy by shifting the fleet away from complex highly integrated ship designs that can be built only by limited number of us shipyards and toward lesscomplex merchantlike hulls and small sea frames that can be built by broader array of shipyards the oft report also aims to make it easier and less expensive to modernize ships over their long lives and thereby take better advantage of rapid developments in technology by shifting from highly integrated ship designs to merchantlike hulls and sea frames as consequence of these objectives the oft report poses significant potential business challenge to the six shipyards that have built the navys major warships in recent years the repor ts discussion on implementing its proposed architecture states in part the shipbuilding industrial base would so need to start to retool to build different types of ships more rapidly smaller shipyards which presently do little or work for the navy could compet to build the sma ller ships thereby broadening the capabilities base of ship design and construction available to the navy the change to smaller lower it cost ships would also open up overseas markets with more shipyards able to build the ships and potential for broader overall market the us shipbuilding i ndustry would have the chance to expand its competence innovation and relevance taken together this would sharpen the industrys ability to compete and provide alternatives to ship procurementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs20 27 oft report p 76 28 oft report p 80 29 csba report slide 314 30 csba report slide 315 31 csba report slide 316 other steps reco mmended as part of the reports overall transition strategy see slides 124 and 125 include the following plan to fiscally prudent steadys tate shipbuilding budget of 10 billion per year maximize current capabilities and minimize nonrecurring engineering continuedsystem that is beset by laws and regulations that frustrate even pervert market forces27 the reports concluding secti on lists five dangers that risk the navys losing the way one of these the report states is shielding the shipbuilding industrial base from global competition which the re port states guarantees high cost limited innovation and long cycle times for building ships28 csba report the csba report similarly raised significant potential issues for the six shipyards that have built the navy s major warships in recent years the report states that rationalizing the defe nse industrial base is critical part of dons the department of the navys maritime competition st rategy and should be the subject of immediate consideration and deliberation by the congress dod and the don29 the report states numerous studies have indicated that the six tier i yards ie the six yards that have built the navys major warships in recent years have exorbitant excess capacities which contribute to the rising costs of navy warships primarily because of high industrial overhead costs these capacities are the result of cabotage laws and fluctuating national security acquisition policies that force shipbuilders of combatants to retain capacities to address required surges in coming years this last point is especially important the don contributes greatly to the problem of exorbitant capacities by its consistent tendency to portray overly optimistic ramp ups in ship production in budget out years30 the report recommends the following as pa rt of its overall transition strategy minimize production costs for more expensive warships defined in the report as ships costin g more than 14 billion each by consolidating production of each kind of such ship in single shipyard pursuing learning curve efficiencies and requesting use of multiyear procurement myp whenever possible minimize production costs for warshi ps and auxiliaries costing less than 14 billion each by emphasizing competition shifting production to smaller tier ii rds using large production runs and enforcing ruthless cost control31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs21 31 continued costs for new platforms by maintainin g and pursuing hulls in service in production or near production that ca n meet near to midterm gwot requirements and that are capable of operating in defendedaccess scenarios against nucleararmed regional adversaries identify and retain or build large numbers of common hulls that have alarge amount of internal reconfigurable volume or that can carry variety of modular payloads or that can be easily modified or adapted over time to new missions pursue increased integration of navy and marine warfighting capabilitiesand emphasize common systems to increase operational effectiveness and reduce operation and support costs focus research and development efforts on meeting future disruptivemaritime challenges particularly antiaccessareadenial networks composed of longrange systems and possibly weapons of mass destruction 32 csba report slides 317318 33 csba report slide 318 34 csba report slide 318 see also slide 298the report states that the strategy deve loped in this report suggests that navy planners might wish to maintain production of ai rcraft carriers at ngnn consolidate production of large surface combatants and amphibious ships at ngingalls and consolidate submarine building gdeb or with new singlesubmarine production company 32 the report states that the second of these possibilities is guided by the building sequence of lpd17s and scxs recommended in the report ngingalls ability to build wider variety of ships than gdbiw ngingalls surge capacity and the availability of space for expanding ngingalls if needed33 the report states that the third of these possibilities is guided by the low probability that procurement of virginiac lass submarines will increase to two per year the cost savings associated with consolidating submarine production at one yard gdebs past experience in building ssbns and ssns gdebs surge capacity and the fact that building submarines at gdeb would maintain two shipyards gdeb and ngnn capable of designing and building nuclearpowered combatants of some kind34 the report acknowledges that yard cons olidation would reduce the possibilities for using competition in shipbuilding in th near term and incr ease risks associated with an attack on the shipbuilding infrastructure but notes that dod consolidated construction of nuclearpowered carriers in single yard years ago and argues thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33955crs22 35 csba report slides 318319 36 csba report slide 319competition might be possible in the longer run if future aircraftcarrying ships the scx and the new undersea superiority sy stem could be built in tier ii yards35 the report states given their current small yearly build numbers consolidating construction of aircraft carriers surface combatants and submarines in one yard for each type makes sense however the same logic does not hold true for auxiliaries and smaller combatants these ships can norma lly be built at variety of tier i and tier ii yards competition can thus be maintained in reasonable and cost effective way for example competing auxiliaries and sea lift and maneuver sea base ships between nassco avondale and tier ii yards may help to keep the costs of these ships down building multiple classes of single ship type is another prudent way to enforce costs since the don can divert production of any ship class that exceeds its cost target to another companycla ss that does not simultaneously building both the lockheed and general dynami cs versions of the lcs and the northrop grumman national security cu tter medium ie the mediumsized deepwater cutter gives the don enduring capability to shift production to whatever ship stays within its cost target of course congress and the don may elect to retain industrial capacity and to pay the additional insurance premium associated with having excess shipbuilding capacity for example c ongress and the don might wish to retain two submarine yards until the undersea superiority system design is clear and wait to rationalize the submarine building base after potential undersea superiority system yearly production rates are clear in similar vein congress and the don might wish to retain two surface combatant yards until the design of the sc x is clear and wait to rationalize the surface combatant building base after pot ential scx yearly production rates are clear in this regard congress could c onsider authorizing modest additional number of aegis destroyers to keep both biw and ingalls hot until the scx is designed the key point is that the us shipbuildin g infrastructure must be rationally sized for expected future auster shipbuilding budgets and whatever fiscally prudent navy transition plan is fina lly developed by don planners36
