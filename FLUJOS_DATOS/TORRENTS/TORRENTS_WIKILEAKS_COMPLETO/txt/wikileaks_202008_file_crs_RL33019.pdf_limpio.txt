domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33019medicaid eligibility for adults and children summary medicaid is meanstested entitlement program that is largely designed and administered by states under br oad federal rules the pr ograms are jointly financed by federal and state funds federal contributions to each state are based on states willingness to finance covered medical services and matching formula the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the us department of health and human services hhs is re sponsible for federal oversight of the program in fy2003 prelimin ary federal and state spending on medicaid reached 2755 billion exceeding medicare payments net of premiums by over 15 billion medicaid coverage for nonelderly nondisa bled adults and children is provided to people who qualify through number of pathways some of which are required under federal law others are optional for states state programs are required to provide coverage to familie s based on welfare program rules in effect in 1996 coverage for children goes beyond those of ten very low financia l criteria through combination of other mandatory and op tional pathways low income pregnant women can also receive medicaid covera ge through both mandatory and optional pathways in addition number of other optional pathways exist for special groups of people who are not considered disabled because they do not have disability as defined under the supplemental security income ssi program rules some of those groups include for example certain wome n with breast or cervical cancer uninsured individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis people who become impoverished by their medical costs and certain immigrants variation across the statebased programs is the rule income eligibility levels and services covered vary and the meth od for and amount of reimbursement for services differ from state to state medicaid is targeted to individuals with low income but not all of the poor are eligible and not all of thos who are covered are poor for medicaidcovered children and families primary and acute care is often delivered through managed care organizations while elderly enrollees and those with disabilities more often obtain such care on feeforservice basis in recent years more and more states have implemented variety of major program changes using special waiver authority this report describes federal medicaid eligibility rules for children and adults but does not address eligibility pathways for individuals qualifying on the basis of having disability

requires all states and the district of columbia that participate in medicaid to cover them other groups are op tional that is federa l law allows states to choose to cover them1 categories of eligible populations are found primarily in section 1902a10 of the social security act prior to the 1980s medicaid eligibility was limited to poor families with dependent children poor elderly and individuals with disabilities receivi ng supplemental security income2 these groups are known as medicaids traditional categori cal groups and the medically needy almost all pathways were tied to the receipt of welfare payments but beginning in the 1980s additional eligibility pathways were added to the medicaid statute to provide for the coverage of additional lowincome child ren and pregnant women as well as other elderly and i ndividuals with disabilities most recently states were given options to provide medicaid to dditional select groups including certain women with breast or cervical cancer uninsur ed individuals with tuberculosis and working individuals with disabilities not all groups of medicaid beneficiaries receive the same set of bene fits to understand more about the benefits offered under medicaid see crs report rl32277 how medicaid works program basics by herz et medicaid programs have fe w federally required covera ge groups for adults who do not have disability groups that states must cover are very lowincome adults in families meeting welfare pr ogram rules in effect in 1996 and temporarily those whose earnings rise above those leve ls due to

through four major pathways all of which are described below in more detail the first two pathways section 1931 coverage and tr ansitional medical assistance are explicitly for families the remaining two pathways medically needy coverage and coverage under section 1115 research nd demonstration waivers can be applied by states to other groups in addition to families in addition there are veral other pathways covering smaller groups of mo stly children they are described below in the section other afdcrelated groups the four major path ways for families include section 1931 of the medi caid statute covers fa milies whose income and resources are low enough to have qua lified for cash welfare payments under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc program rules transitional medical assistance tma extends coverage on timelimitedbasis to families that would otherwise lose medicaid due to increased earnings or other income the optional medically needy program covers families andor individualswhose income is just above the s ection 1931 thresholds or whose medical expenses when subtracted from income impoverish them 5 and demonstration projects conducted by states

medicaid entitlement for individuals who meet the requirements of the former afdc programs that were in effect before welfare reform this eligib ility pathway was created as part of the reforms in 1996 before 1996 all recipients of the afdc pr ogram were automati cally eligible for medicaid coverage the 1996 reforms re placed the afdc program with new program temporary assistance for needy families tanf at the same time the section 1931 coverage group wa s established within medicaid to ensure that low income families would not lose medicaid as result of the reforms of the cash assistance programs under section 1931 states must ensure that at minimum income and resources standards and methodologies for lowin come families are more restrictive than those in effect in 1988 sp ecifically section 1931 allows states to 1 reduce income standards below those in ffect in 1996 but they cannot be lower than those used on may 1 1988 2 increase income and resource standards for any period after 1996 but by more than the pe rcentage increase in the consumer price index cpi for the same period and 3 use less restrictive methods for counting income and resources than those in ffect on july 16 1996 this last provision affords states the flexibility to make family coverage under section 1931 more generous by disregarding various amount s of income or types of assets when compared against the 1996 standards the afdc program in place in 1996 was similar to medicaid in that states administered the program unde r broad federal guidelin states determined eligibility and benefit levels based on need standards payment standards and maximum payments number of the rule s for counting income and resources for the former afdc program remain in effect in many states today for determining eligibility for medicaid under section 1931 some of those welfare program rules included when determining financial eligibility states were required to compare the familys income to gross income limit t at 185 of the states chosen need standard states were to disregard certain amount s of income standard allowance of 90 per month the first 30 of earni ngs during the first 12 months of enrollment and onethird of remaining earning during the first four months of enrollment when counting resources states were required to compare the value of allresources against federal upper limit of 1000 and states were to exclude the familys home and the equity value of car up to1500 or lower state limit table 2 displays the income standards used to determine financial eligibility for families under section 1931 expressed as percentage of 2002 poverty levels column 3 these percentages are compared with the percentages used for afdc eligibility in 1996 in column 2 these percentages serve as

forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33019crs5 families are shown in column 4 most states have extended the generosity of medicaids coverage of families since 1996 often using the 1931 pathway some states use other means to extend medicaids coverage for families there are few caveats that must be considered in evaluating the information in table 2 most states use complex comb ination of counting and disregarding various forms of income putting those amounts together to determine single income standard relative to poverty can in troduce some error this difference may result in percentages in two columns that are close to each other but actually reflect the same standards for example in alab ama the afdc standard relative to poverty was calculated to be at 15 in 1996 cu rrently crs calculates the 1931 standard to be at approximately 20 of poverty this five percen tage point difference may not reflect policy changes in the state of alabama increasing the level of generosity of the program but rather may be due to calculating errors introduced because of the complexity of states income counting rules table 2 afdc 1996 income standard section 1931 income ceiling in 2002 and higher

eligibility rules for families qualifying under section 1931 contribute to that impression as described above states have limited flexibility to reduce or increase income standards but they have considerably mo re flexibility in the way that countable income is defined by excluding certain types of income from their definitions of countable income states can effectively rais the generosity of the eligibility pathway without explicitly raisin g the income standards states are required to disregard certa in amounts and types of income when determining eligibility because those income disregards were part of the income counting methods in place in 1996 in almost all states that means that the first 50 of child support payments is disrega rded or not counted for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility in addition certain tions of familys earned income is not counted and the portion is disregarded in decreasing amounts over time during the first four months of em ployment 120 plus onethird of remaining earnings per month are not counted af ter four months of enrollment 120 per month of earnings are disregarded finally after family is on the program for 12 months 90 of earnings per month are disr egarded the earned income disregards are intended to lessen the immediate impact of the transition to work many states also disregard child care allowance of 175 per month per child over age two and 200 per month for children under age two in addition to these minimum income disregards many states have used the additional flexibility to define countable income to make this pathway considerably more generous than under the fo rmer afdc program rules table 3 shows the earned income disregards and the redete rmination periods fo r section 1931 families

research and policy for crs notes effective november 1 2003 b on july 1 2003 changes to six months contributing to the seeming impenetrability of the medicaid rules many states continue to count income using 1996 welfar program rules in addition to their new more generous income counting methods fictional example of this is the case of state state has new income coun ting rule under section 1931 that disregards all income between the former afdc vel and 100 of the federal poverty level but state continues to apply the 90 30onethird rule from the former afdc program along with the new rule that allo ws considerably greater amounts of income to be disregarded for the purposes of determining eligibility under section 1931 this illogical combination of income c ounting methods is conducted simply because it allows the state to prove to cms th at the section 1931 eligibility pathway is meeting the statutory purpose of ensuring that anyone who woul d have qualified for the former afdc program is still able to obtain medicaid the generosity of the new rules would most assuredly include at l east those qualifying under the old and less generous rules nonetheless some states are hesitant to abandon those calculations for fear of being found to be out of comp liance with requirements that ensure that those who were eligible under 1996 welfare program rule s would be eligible under section 1931 second example of how the rules of section 1931 contribute to administrative complexity without clearly be nefitting recipients is the fact that states generally conduct redeterminations for this popula tion on an annual basis so disregards intended for use after four and nine months of enrollment are rarely used except when an enrollee selfreports an income change triggeri ng redetermination before 12 months has elapsed counting assets under section 1931 states can apply an assets test as long as it is more restrictive than the test in effect in 1996 states can also under rule number three above use less restrictive thods for counting assets this has been interpreted in some states and by cms as allowing for assets test for the section 1931 eligibility pathway droppi ng assets tests has numbe r of major benefits for states and for enrollees it simplifies the onerous eligibility determination process considerably in addition it removes sign ificant barrier to access to health care for people at the bottom of the income scale in 2002 19 states had assets tests forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33019crs10 8alabama arkansas georgia idaho indian kentucky

seeking medicaid under section1931 some remain as vestiges of the afdc prog ram ended almost 10 years ago gross income standard about half of the states report imposing gross income standard this is an income test that is applied before any income is disregarded or alternativ methodologies for counting income are used it is the sum of the total countable gro ss monthly earned in come of all

percentage of the selected standard often between 133 and 185 of the federal poverty level 100hour work rule many states continue to require that employed parents in twoparent families wo rk fewer than 100hours pe r month to qualify under section 1931 this 100hour rule wa s originally established by the secretary as standard for determining whether family meets the deprivation requirement for the former afdc program in order for family to qualify for assistance under the old programs rules its children had to be deprived of parental suppor t or care due to the death absence incapacity or unemployment of parent twoparent families generally qualified only under the unemploymen t criterion which was narrowly defined in the afdc regulations fo rty one states responding to the crs funded rvey confirmed that they continue to impose 100hour limit on work hours for working families th rule remains popular even though regulations posted by cms in 1998 the n called the health care financing administration hcfa removed th is 100hour limitation the regulation allows states to dopt more flexib definitions of unemployment to align their tanf foster care and medicaid programs and to simplify administration under the revised rule states are not allowed to define unemployment in any way that is more restrictive than the definition of unemployment that existed when the rule was first published certain individuals qualifying under th section 1931 pathway may be denied medicaid coverage if they re fuse to cooperate with stat tanf work requirements states are permitted to deny

otherwise have lost such assistance due to increased work hours increased earnings of the caretaker relative or the loss of one of the timelimited earned income disregards there are several tma requirements in statute today the tma provision that is currently in effect requires states to provide an additional si x months of medicaid coverage to families who were receiving medicaid under secti on 1931 in at least three of the last six months should income rise for an of the above reasons in addition states are required to extend medi caid coverage for second six months to families who were cove red during the entire first sixmonth tma period and whose earnings are below 185 of poverty these tma provisions are due to sunset at the end of september 2005 although this date has been repeatedly extended if these provisions were to expire parate tma provisions would become effective under the older and permanent tma provisions medicaid would be required to be extended for families

meet the former welfare programs financial criteria but do not qualify as dependent child the ribicoff pathway named for the former senator who sponsored legisl ation authorizing this group applies to children under age 21 who do not meet th dependency require ment often because they do not live with their families in the past this pathway had been used for children residing in institutions or in statebased foster care or adoption assist ance programs but today most of those children can qualify under other povertyleve l eligibility pathways since those pathways do not include family dependency requirement ribicoff as result has little meaning for most children under the age of 19 for children who are 19 or 20 or are inpatients in psychiatric facilities on the other hand ribicoff may still be valuable pathway to medicaid older children cannot qualify under the other povertylevel groups because those pathways define eligible children to be under the age of 19 institutionalized children who are in families with income that exceeds the poverty level ceilings also cannot qualify as povertylevel children because their parents income is deemed to be available to children under

wide variation in state programs federal requirements and op tions combine with state choices and definitions to ensure wide variation in the characteristics of state medicaid programs this variation across state prog rams makes generalizations about medicaid eligibility policies difficult federal law describes more than 50 eligibility pathways some of those pathways describe mandatory coverage groups others are optional for states some of those coverage groups defined in fede ral law are described precisely such as women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer identified through the center for disease controls national breast and cervical cancer early detection programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33019crs27 2742 cfr section 43501other pathways are only gene rally described with the specifics left to states discretion where federal law identifie s optional coverage groups states have great deal of flexibility in defining and specifying the pathways they choose to implement as described above for exampl federal law provides an option for states to cover children who are between the ages of six and eight and whose family income is between 100 and 133 of the federal poverty level fpl states can choose any combination of income level and age within those parameters another example is an eligibility pathway referred to as ribicoff children this pathway allows states to identify reasonable classifications of children whose income is very low and who do not otherwise qualify under we lfarerelated pathways u nder that category states can define one two 10 or any number of cl asses of children to be offered medicaid coverage most states cover multiple classifications of ribicoff children for almost all medicaid eligibility groups mandatory and optional alike federal law also leaves the precise definitions of financial eligibility criteria countable income and resources up to states stat can define what counts as income and resources for most coverage groups few exceptions to this rule include individuals eligible for medicaid because of receipt of ssi payments or through ssi related eligibility pathways for those individuals definitions of income and resources come directly from ssi statute and regulations few other eligibility pathways place limits on states ability to defi ne income and resources for example medicaid regulation pertaining to optional families and children prohibits states from using any requirements for determining eligibility that are more restrictive than those used under the state af dc plan that existed in 1996 similarly states cannot use more restrictive definitions for opti onal aged blind and disabled individuals than those used under ssi27 and in the medicaid tradition there are exceptions to those rules as well all of this variation contributes to the overwhelming level of diversity and complexity of the states medicaid programs many people have said that if you know one medicaid program you know one medicaid program this is because every rule or definition that applies in one state could be quite different in another this immense variation also makes refo rming the medicaid program exceedingly difficult minor federal law change coul d have multiple ripple effects in each state retroactive eligibility under federal law persons who are determined to be eligible for medicaid must be provided with coverage for any care nd services under the plan during the three months before he or she made application if that person w ould have been eligible for such assistance during that time states are

general rules that apply to the benefits offered under state programs although the rule s are primarily about benef its they are important to consider for complete understanding of dicaid eligibility this is because these rules contribute to states complaints about the inflexibility of the medicaid program in addition it is often the effect of these rules on state programs that have encouraged the proliferation of waiver s and experimentation in pr oviding health benefits to selected medicaid enrollees in different ways the requirements are often waived as part of the research and dem onstration waivers described above amount duration and scope each covered service must be sufficient in amount duration and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose the state may not arbitrarily deny

statewide comparability the comparability rule requires that the benefits offered be the same for all individuals qualifying within each eligibility pathway this rule is often major source of states concerns regarding inflexibility it prohibits states from changing the benefits offered to individuals within one pathway as their family income rises it also prohibits states from offering some groups trimmed down benefit packages current eligibility issues medicaid eligibility rules and policies raise number of issues that generate both debate about the program as well as many questions for legislators first issue relates to achieving the optimum amount of program enrollment among those who are eligible ensuring that people who are eligible for medicaid enroll is important to those involved in medicaid policy issues for number of reasons reaching full enrollment is way to minimiz the number of people who are uninsured wit hout requiring additional programs or changing current program rules second important issue is how to acc ount for the countercyclical impact of the economy on medicaid eligibility and rollment that is when the economy improves medicaid benefits are needed by fewer individuals when the economy suffers medicaid benefits are needed by mo re people this countercyclical effect is consistent with the notion that medicaid is safety net for people losing jobs and financial security moreover when the economy suffers states revenues are impacted as is their ability to fund the program final issue the changing nature of medicaid enrollment describes the recent transformation of the progra m to cover new groups of individuals and to play greater role in addressing the needs of citizens with moderate incomes and who have stronger ties to the workforce these issues are discussed below managing and monitoring enrollment for number of years researchers have found that state medicaid programs do not enroll all of the eligible population most of the research related to the enrollment gap has focused on lowincome children and finds that between 65 and 80 of individuals eligible for medicaid enroll in the programs table 9 in 1998 seldon et found that childre n over age twelve had significantly lower rates of enrollment or takeup rates than those who were ounger the authors speculate that this could reflect continuous medicaid coverage for some children since birth it may also be related to need and use of health care services children under age 12 are known to have mo re medical encounters than those over age 12 in addition children who became ligible for medicaid because they were in families qualifying through welfarerelated pathway had higher takeup rates than those qualifying through the povertyle vel

of states are reported to be considering establishing such red tape barriers to deter rollment in response to budget pressures38 the impact of the economy on enrollment the nations economic condition during an given period has direct impact on states medicaid programs first when depressions or recessions occur citizens often lose jobs job loss can drive up dicaid enrollment for two reasons because people lose their jobbased income and b ecause people lose their jobbased health care coverage the number of people qualifyi ng on financial basis swells at the same time that the perceived need for medicaid to play its safetynet role swells the same forces that raise the number of low income people in need of medicaid benefits concomitantly reduce states ability to f und medicaid rising joblessness reduces states tax revenues federal statute provides states with c onsiderable flexibility to choose whether to cover certain eligibility gr oups and to define other ligibility groups in ways that would allow more or fewer individuals to qualify for benefits this means that eligibility policy could in theory be used as tool to reduce medicaid spending when states budgets are tight or to extend the generosity of the program in other times but this much control over the programs size and cost is often elusive for statelevel policy makers in stead medicaids size and sp ending levels are largely driven by the nations genera l economic fluctuations the size and needs of the states population and by other political concerns cutting eligibility to reduce costs is difficult but not impossible there are three reasons for this eligibility and enrollment trends are driven by economic conditions making the impact of any policy changes at the state level either dulled or accentuated by the changes driven by the economy for example if state eliminated coverage for medically needy people during time when incomes are generally high and fewer people are qualif ying for such coverage there is less objection but if the eligibility pathway we re eliminated during recession at just the time when large numbers of individuals and families are finding their income dipping into the range for medically needy coverage the cutback has considerably stronger impact this situation leads to the second problem with cutting eligibility eliminating individuals ability to rely on medicaid at exactly the time when such need for assistance is climbing may be politically unpopular many states seek to avoid this unappealing tool for fiscal restraint by instead restricting benefits reducing provider payments andor rais ing copayments for serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33019crs36 39for more complete description of this provision and the circumstances surrounding its passage see crs

medicaid and crs report rl31773 medicaid and the current state fiscal crisis by christine scottfinally there is cyclical problem with reducing the size of the medicaid program during recession when states budgets are flush with revenues improving access to medical care for those in need is very popular use of state funds during such periods many states add eligibility c overage groups to medicaid or modify the definitions of existing groups to include additional people thereby increasing the programs generosity such eligibility expansions raise the fiscal stress on the states during the next recession in the late 1990s the nations econom surged largely spurred on by the technology stock boom states revenues improved and medicaid programs in many states became more generous but durin g the next few years 2001 to 2003 states were unable to keep up with the programs ri sing costs in res ponse states appealed to the us congress for fiscal relief in 2003 states received that relief with provision passed as part of the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 108027 that temporarily raised the share of medicaid paid by the federal government39 beside fiscal relief there are few other proposals that directly provide additional funding for the program when the econom drives such periodic increases in eligibility and enrollment such proposals would modify the federalstate funding relationship to shift costs from states to the federal government in recessionary periods40 changing nature of medicaid enrollment medicaids target populations have unde rgone major changes over the years early in the programs histor eligibility for medicaid was tied to the receipt of cash assistance when enacted medicaid was offered only to families and individuals who qualified to receive paym ents under two programs th former afdc program which provided cash assistance to very lowincome families with children and the ssi program which provides cash assistance to very low income individuals who are aged or meet certain federally prescribed definitions of blindness or disability the programs close link to cash welfare progra ms began to erode when congress enacted series of eligibility expansions in the 1980s targeted primarily to children and pregnant women these new groups were in families whose income was too high to qualify for cash welfare payments but was still at or near poverty later changes in medicaid continued to move the program further from its cash assistance roots in 1996 the afdc progra m was replaced with program of grants to states for various lowincome assistan ce efforts the tanf program was passed as part of the personal responsibility nd work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 tanf pl 104193 with this change to

to allow states the flexibility to specify new rules as long as states continue to provide medicaid coverage to individuals who would have been eligible to receive afdc payments under old program rules41 the automatic eligibility for medicaid for recipients of ssi payments however has remained over the last decade many states have continued to make changes that move medicaid programs further away from its hist orical coverage groups states are able to apply to the secretary of hhs for waivers of certain federal medicaid rules these waivers authorized under section 1115 of th social security act allow states to conduct demonstrations the go als of which must be cons istent with the purpose of the medicaid statute unde r these demonstrations so states have extended coverage to higher income individuals nd to individuals who otherwise do not fit into medicaids traditional categorical cove rage groups the elderly blind and disabled individuals and members of families with dependent children42 the number of approved monstration waivers has increased over the last decade encouraged by both the clinton and gw bush administrations state officials have identified lack of flexibility in eligibility policies as one of the reasons waivers have such appeal notwithstanding the programs flexibility that allows states to choose which optional groups to cover and to define income and resources tests and methodolog ies for many groups other rules constrain states one program rule meant to achieve fairness within and across states is predominant issue for states this comparability43 rule states that all individuals within single eligibility category must be offered the same set of benefits for example poverty related child qualifying in marylands anne arundel c ounty must receive the same set of medicaid benefits as child qualifying for medicaid but residing in queen annes county this rule also prevents states from offering particular population trimmed down benefits package so for ex ample if state c hooses to cover all pregnant women who are in families with income below 185 of poverty the state could not offer reduced benefits to those w ith income over 150 or charge larger co pays to this somewhat higher income group than charged to those below 150 of poverty states argue that they must as consequence of this rule offer nothing to anyone in particular cove rage group or income range when they could otherwise offer some additional indivi duals limited set of benefits because of this all or nothing inflexibility some states claim they could be more generous to certain groups than they are today skeptics question whether states complain ts about lack of flexibility disguise less benevolent goals detractors of policies to enhance the states design flexibility worry that advocates of increasing flexibility are primarily those who would prefer to reduce medicaids assistance for poor people and are prevented from doing so because of existing mandates and the comparability rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33019crs38 putting arguments about what flexibility m eans aside medicaids role as insurer of last resort has undergone transition from covering only those eligible for cash assistance to having much larger role for broader range of lowincome uninsured individuals the debate bout medicaids role is likely to intensify as private insurance coverage continue s to decline and as aging baby boomers demand more longterm care services that are typically not covered under privat health insurance plans
