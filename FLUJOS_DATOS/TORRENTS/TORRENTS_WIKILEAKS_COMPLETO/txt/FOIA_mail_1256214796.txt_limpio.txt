not been peerreviewed we need to explain what this means for the maninthe street given the fact that this campaign is clearly not going to die down we now have silly attempt to escalate it locally dragging norfolks reputation thro the mud i have revised my view feel we do need to pursue the spectator more vigorously to it seems straightforward keith has been accused of fraud on an official

prof env summers brian mr reg preece alan mr mac subject fw climate research centre crisis spreads dear phil and keith marcus has just received this message below from the edp environment correspondent he is telling her he knows nothing about it true as he has just returned from china i have just dropped note to the solicitor asking if she sees any problem in our warning her to be very cautious in how anything is phrased and issuing statement along the following lines i think the last line would have to come directly from you keith for info still response from the spectator to the letter i have rung three times fist time pa told message had been opened and emailed solicitor is now looking closely at the piece in the spectator to judge whether to send solicitors letter best annie draft statement any implication that professor keith briffa deliberately selected treering data in order to manufacture evidence of recent dramatic warming in the yamal region of northern russia is completely false full rebuttal is published on the climatic research units website this stems from report on the climate audit blog site site for climate change sceptics the blogs editor steve mcintyre has produced an alternative history of treegrowth changes in the yamal region by substituting some of the data used in prof briffas published and peerreviewed analysis with recent data from more localised origin than the data analysed by prof briffa while mcintyres selection produces different result it cannot be considered to be more authoritative this appears to be an attempt to discredit the work of the intergovernmental panel of climate change in the runup to the copenhagen climate talks annie ogden head of communications university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj tel44

about this original message from david_robinson mailtodarobinnetcomukcouk sent 19 october 2009 2245 to newsdeskarchantcouk subject climate research centre crisis spreads sir i draw your attention to the growing international climate change scandal that is engulfing the cru and dragging the reputation of it and norfolk through the mud after several weeks of open criticism of the use of particular alledgedly flawed cru dataset there has been attempted rebuttle by the cru latest information suggests that dozens of peer reviewed scientific papers that relied on the same dataset are now similarly flawed and should be withdrawn this unfortunately draws into question fundamental part of the ipcc conclusion namely whether the recent global warming is in fact abnormal and hence attributable to man i think the continued silence by the cru on this subject profoundly worrying given the importance of the topic any light you can shed on this whole sorry story would be greatly in the public interest
