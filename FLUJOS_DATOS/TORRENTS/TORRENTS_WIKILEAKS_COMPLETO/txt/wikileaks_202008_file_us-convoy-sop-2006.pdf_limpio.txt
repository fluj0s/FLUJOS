vehicle doors will be locked to prevent unauthorized access 9 the roc will be contacted prior to departure and transponders must be working prior to departure 9 when the convoy is turning the trail vehicle will inform the lead vehicle when the turn is complete eg right turn complete 9 security vehicles are prepared to stop traffi c either in front or near the rear of the convoy in order for the other vehicles to go through intersections vehicles assume original convoy positions as soon as possible after the change 9 when traveling under bridgesoverpasses convoy vehicles should quickly but safely change lanes and vary speeds to avoid grenades and other objects that may be thrown or dropped from the overpass security vehicle occupants should keep eyes and weapons trained on the overpass for as long as possible 9 convoy vehicles should avoid all obsta cles and never int entionally run over anything in the roads 9 all vehicle occupants should stay alert for any thing out of the

accidents will be reported to the cmc security manger personnel involved will be assisted first aid given and information exchanged military qrf will be contact ed at the first possible op portunity and the roc will be notified immediately the only time this will not be followed is if the accident involves aif activity and the convoy co mmander determines the threat for lives of the principles is too great location descr iption of vehicle and the incident will still be reported to the first milit ary patrol or cp on route and the rest of the reporting procedures will be followed the only way to ensure vehicle is 100 free of explosive hazards is to xray the vehicle or check the vehicle with an explosive detec tion dog since the xray technology is not available and impractical and we have explosive detection dogs in country yet the on site security manager will make the decision to burn or not to burn vehicle caveat dont burn vehicles viscerally recovering down vehicle is of the utmost importance and it is the last resort lives in danger to burn andor abandon any vehicle special convoys notes on class v convoys class v convoy teams will develop and have an approved class v so p during convoy in this cl assification there will be class v explosives stored on one or more vehicles in the convoy in the event the vehicle or vehicles are disabled by complex attack saf ied etc the

contractor personnel at any given time any ctor may be required to drive one of the vehicles in convoy all personnel but in particular vehicle drivers must be able to identify threat and r eact instantaneously to any situation that endangers the lives of fellow passengers inaction or freezing c an be prevented by repetitive training to build muscle memory when conducting iads when potentially hazardous situation arises the convoy commander will take charge and issue orders as to which iads to initiate these directives will be followed without question as general rule convoy mbers should stay off the radio unless their particular vehicle is attacked or di sabled however all vehicle occupants should be looking for potentially dangerous si tuations or suspicious individuals and pass this information to security personnel in the vehicle in the event that they have not detected the threat the following are list of iads that all personnel should be familiar with and r ehearse as often as possible 1 react to contact all security personnel identify the threat using the 3 ds description direction and distance b this is echoed inside the vehicle by all security personnel and transmitted once over the internal co mmunications to all other vehicles 2 break contact contact is ma and all vehicles are capable of being driven out of the kill zone the number one priority is to extract all us pers onnel from the kill zone b all nonshooters will seek whatever cover they can within the vehicle and make lanes for shooters to utilize c all drivers will drive t heir vehicles away from the threat in the most expeditious manner possible d all shooters will seek to return fire with well aimed shots at enemy personnel only personnel will stop and attemp t to engage the enemy in firefight 3 break contact contact is ma and one or more vehicles cannot be driven out of the kill zone all vehicles and security personnel will establish security perimeter b security will be the first priority if security cannot be established near the vehicles security personnel will move all personnel to the nearest defensible position c the next priority will be extracting personnel from the disabled vehicle to functional vehicles and remove them from the enemy line of fire if 13 possible security position will be established that can lay down an accurate wellaimed base of fire to suppress the enemy at this point recovery vehicle will hastily pick up the personnel from the disabled vehicles this will be done as quickly as possible 4 lost vehicle procedures after an attack traili ng vehicles become separated from lead vehicles during enemy contact every effort will be made to maintain radio communications until contact is reestablished b if radio communications are maintained directions from the convoy commander will dictate actions until vehicle contact can be re established c if unable to make radio contact with separated vehicl the lead vehicles will assume that the missi ng vehicles are unable to move or talk and are stuck in the kill zo ne at the point of contact all convoy vehicles will then return togeth er to the point of contact and render assistance d if contact is still not restored the next prees tablished rendezvous point rp in the route will become active 5 lost vehicle procedures with enem contact trailing vehicles become separated from lead vehicles with enemy contact every effort will be made to maintain radio communications until contact is reestablished b if radio contact is made between s eparated vehicles dire ctions from the convoy commander will dictate actions c if radio contact is not reest ablished between separated vehicles the lead vehicles will continue to move slowly along the planned route toward the rp the missing vehicl will rapidly continue along the route as planned to the rp d if contact is not restored by the time one of the elements reaches the rp the rp will become activated and actions at an activated rp will be followed 6 actions at an activated rp nemy contact may or may not have been made there has been break in contact and an rp has been activated all elements will try to estab lish radio communications between separated vehicles and notify hom station of the situation b all elements will move to the active rp the first element to the rp will establish security perimeter and start countdown from 30 minutes c all elements will wait at the rp fo r 30 minutes if contact is not re established the mission will be abor ted and the element at the rp will move to the nearest friendly location and await further instructions 14 7 dead driver drill following enemy contact vehicle driver is dead or incapacitated but the vehi cle is still functional the front seat passenger will become the driver b personnel in the rear seats will attemp t to move the incapacitated driver out of the way either to the rear seats or to the front passenger door side c the vehicle will be driven away from the threat to safe area before halt is called if the si tuation allows during the movement to safe area first aid will be perform ed on the incapacitated driver 8 disabled vehicle cross load proc edures following enemy contact vehicle is too damaged to continue th reat still exists but the convoy is not taking fire and must relocate all wounded personnel will be loaded on the nearest appropriate vehicle b all remaining personnel will be loaded on other available vehicles c all sensitive items will be re moved from the damaged vehicle d all nonrecoverable equipment will be left and the vehicle will be destroyed using one thermite grenade if available however time will be lost in an attempt to set the vehicle on fire in the event that t here is inadequate room in convoy vehicles iraqi civilian vehicles will be commandeered every effort will be made to retain the driver flex cuffed and gagged with the vehicl so that the vehicle may be easily returned the dr iver should also be paid for the use of his vehicle 9 an ied is encountered duri ng recovery from an ambush either during the course of sc heduled rest stop or during recovery operations following an ambus h an ied is encountered b the first step upon discovery of an ie d is to clear the immediate area of all friendly personnel c with the armed assets availa ble the area should be cordoned off and secured as much as possible d using armed security personnel only the area should be controlled concurrent with the steps above notification should be made to the area battle captain and militar explosive ordnance disposal personnel should be requested f attempt will be made by convoy personnel to neutralize the ied only in extreme em ergencies and only if absolutely necessary should exper ienced uxo contractor personnel in the convoy attempt to render safe the device 15 annex c vehicle checklist prior to convoy departure the following items will be checked this will cover accountability and serviceability of all equi pment accompanying the convoy prior to departure from site and prior to return to site vehicle preoperational checks vehicle inventory to ensure all essent ial items are present and communications checks pace primary alternate contingency and emergency the inspections will as minimum consist of the following 1 vehicle inspection full tank of fuel diesel or mogas five good tires all fluids are full oil wiper transmission coolant vehicle temperature is good armor in place if applicable appropriate glint tape markings 2 vehicle packing list extra batteries extra ammunition smoke grenades if available thermite grenades if available maps gps and compass vs17 panel one case of mres one case of water nineline

body armor with ballistic plates knife gloves hearing protection ballistic eye protection cold hot weather gear as appropriate 2 weapons primary and condary if authorized clean functions check basic load of ammunition 17 annex employment of m249 squad automatic weapon saw in convoy operations the m249 squad automatic weapon saw is intended to provide additional firepower for contractor convoys though not crew served weapon it does meet the mnci intent of providing sufficient security for the transport of usaesch iraq material the m249 can be used inside of vehicle or from protected position in the bed of pickup truck on normal administr ative convoy operations one saw would be carried in the lead vehicle and second saw would be in the trail vehicle if there are five or more vehicles in the convoy then an additional saw would be placed somewhere in the middle of the conv oy with any increase in the size of the convoys there should also be co mmensurate increase in the number of m249s employed as an example for ever two to three vehicle increase one more saw should be added to one of the vehi cles not necessarily security vehicle in high threat areas or during heightened curity consideration should be given to equipping each vehicle in the convoy with saw when escorting usaesch iraq material all security vehicles should carry at least one saw due to the extremely high risk nature of the mission as well as the convoys slow movement each saw should be employed with at least three 200 r ound assault magazines the weapon should be inspected prior to departure and test fired at least monthly in order to ensure serviceability docu mentation on service and test firing will be kept on site for referenc and for security audits 18 annex f admininistrative convoy plan purpose this plan establishes practi ces and procedures that shall be employed by all usaesch iraq ements participating in the usaesch iraqs clearance usaesch iraq pr ogram in iraq risk management approach is described whose goal is to expose the minimum number of personnel to the minimum danger fo r the least amount of time definitions secure area areas that are under the co mplete control of coalition military forces or iraqi security forces entry into these areas requires verification of identity search of v ehicles and valid purpose for being there iraqi employees and visitors are not allowed free movement and are under continuous observation by security forces unsecure areas any area that is accessible to the general iraqi population is considered to be unsecured administrative convoys all land movements of usaesch iraq employees and noniraqi subcontractor personnel that involve transit of unsecured areas when the purpose of that movement is not directly related to work generally all personnel movem ents other than thos between usaesch iraq life support areas lsa and wo rk sites and movements that do not involve the transport of usaesch iraq are administrative examples include transporting personnel to airports fo r home leave and visiting aafes or mwr facilities at other military bases enforcement failure to adhere to these and other protective practices established by usaesch iraq the corp s of engineers and the multinational corpsiraq mnci not only endangers liv and property but also causes otherwise avoidable exposure of personnel who may be called upon to rescue or recover those involved therefore flagrant violation of these procedures shall be grounds for termination supervisory pers onnel are responsible for ensuring that all subordinates are aware of and comply with the provisions of this plan mandatory practices exceptions to the below list of practices will be made by the usaesch iraq site m anager on casebycase basis when movement involves emergency leave or medical necessity and compliance cannot be achieved however in case will the three security vehicle with 4 armed escort per minimu m requirement be waived all usaesch iraq convoys will be endorsed by the respec tive usaesch iraq site manager and approved by the coe contracting officer 19 1 administrative convoys will t be conducted for the benefit of one or two personnel instead tr ips through unsecured areas shall be consolidated unit personnel shall be advised of sc heduled convoy days sufficiently far in advance so that they can make appr opriate air travel arrangements 2 administrative convoys will t be conducted more than once week 3 administrative convoy will depart without receiving an update from the nearest us army unit or fob s2 on t he current road status as well as the current road conditions movement of administrative convoys 1 composition the minimum requirement is three 3 vehicles for movement with at least two 2 armed secu rity personnel per security vehicle armored vehicles are to be used whenever po ssible in convoy with more than three vehicles the vehicle order is dependent upon the number and type of vehicles general convoy co mposition guidelines are the security team leader is the convoy commander b security vehicles are the first tw vehicles and the last vehicle in the convoy c whenever possible leapfroggi ng advance security element will lead out the convoy to clear and hold danger areas and choke points until the convoy passes through d if more than three security vehi cles are available then the other security vehicles are intermixed within the convoy andor used as advance vehicles in nonsecurity vehicles secu rity personnel will be seated shotgun or behind the driver security s hould provide the driver whenever possible with the exception of pls f one 1 convoy emergency medica l technician emt will ride in security vehicle if there is more than one emt they will ride in separate vehicles 2 communications vehicles in the convoy have redundant communications with each other 3 basic convoy procedures see basic sop general 4 convoy briefings see basic sop convoy briefing 20 basic tactics and procedures the tactics and procedures detailed below are general in nature and are provided as guidelines for all security operations as threats situations locations and mission parameters change on almost daily basis in country the us aesch iraq security manager will be responsible for implementing additional tactics and changes to procedures as the situation dictates 1 for tactical planning purposes usaesch iraq considers all vehicle transportation movements as tactical convoys and each movement will be treated as highthreat conv oy operation regardless of distance size or scope 2 vehicle spacing and speed is terrain daynight tactical situation and environment dependent 3 fields of fire general fiel ds of fire will encompass 360degree area of defense and coverage at all times specific fields of fire are determined by weapons personnel threat and terrain 4 rally points are to be used wh exiting kill zones to obtain accountability of all personnel treat the wounded and repair damage on vehicles there will be 1000 meter floating rally points used by all convoys 90 909090 90 90180 180 21 weapons fields of fire convoy example 4 evasive maneuvers dependent upon the threat or attack evasive maneuvers will generally fall under the ta ctic of avoidance defend and retreat here are the primary objectives of tact ical convoy during highthreat activities threat detection and avoidance evasive maneuvers to ensure contact with known or suspected threats b defend against known threat if avoidance is longer viable then direct firepower assault in conjunction with evasive maneuvers is the first strike policy c retreat from the threat the pr imary purpose of tactical convoy operations is to avoid assaults and th reats if threat or attack is detected then retreat reversal or alternate route to rally point is executed whenever possible if in the kill zone then the only alternative is to fight through it frontal attack manuever 5 side ambush maneuver many of the attacks in this region have originated from either the left or right side position and at the middle section of the convoy the primary objective of the convoy is to move out of the kill zone as fast as possible while maintaining convoy integrity target identificati on of the enemy and engage b rapid forward movement thru kill zone c convoy integrity and head count d alternate route back to base camp or to destination if past the point of return report contact and call for fire or qrf if needed 22 annex g mnd rules of engagement 23 24 25 26 27
