amendment issues september 15 1999 tj halstead legislative attorney american law division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report discusses the fourth amendment as it relates to vehicular searches and traffic detentions conducted by law enforcement officers an overview of exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements prescribed under the constitution is provided outlining the range of permissible police activity in this area particular emphasis is placed on recent supreme court decisions including the validity of pretextual stops and consent based searches which illustrate the balancing approach used by the court to weigh personal privacy interests against the legitimate safety and investigatory needs of law enforcement and serve to clarify the extent of police power in the vehicular context search and seizure in the vehicular context fourth amendment issues summary the fourth amendment to the constitution of the united states provides that the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized the supreme court has interpreted this language as imposing presumptive warrant requirement on all searches and seizures predicated upon governmental authority and has ruled that any violations of this standard will result in the suppression of any material or information derived therefrom however the court has also recognized that certain circumstances render the obtainment of warrant impractical or unnecessary and accordingly has crafted exceptions to an otherwise inflexible constitutional standard among the various exceptions established by the court are warrantless searches based on exigent circumstances plain view seizures searches incident to valid arrest and searches where law enforcement needs surpass the warrant requirement some of the most pervasive and controversial exceptions recognized by the court have centered on law enforcement authority to conduct warrantless searches and investigatory detentions in the vehicular context recent court decisions in this area have imbued law enforcement officers with greater authority to act without warrant during traffic stops based upon the previously established automobile exception and the need for adequate protective measures to ensure police safety this apparent expansion of police power has led many commentators to assert that fourth amendment protections have been essentially eviscerated in the automobile and traffic stop setting upon examining the scope of law enforcement authority subsequent to these decisions however it appears that basic fourth amendment privacy strictures still pertain to traffic detentions with the recent court rulings simply applying previously established rationales to new factual scenarios contents introduction 1 the fourth amendment 1 the automobile exception 2 investigatory detentions 3 pretextual stops 4 poststop conduct 7 protective searches 7 seizure of items in plain view 11 consent searches 11 search incident to arrest 13 conclusion 14 search and seizure in the vehicular context fourth amendment issues introduction in its past few terms the supreme court of the united states has exhibited renewed interest in fourth amendment issues surrounding law enforcement practices in the traffic detention search and seizure contexts in the majority of these cases the court has determined that the state action at issue is either presumptively valid or that the public interest in the deterrence and detection of criminal activity outweighs any potential intrusion upon asserted personal liberty and privacy interests this paper addresses the dynamics and scope of law enforcement authority in the traffic detention context in light of these recent decisions with an analytical focus on the extent to which they impact fundamental fourth amendment principles the fourth amendment the fourth amendment to the constitution of the united states establishes that search or seizure conducted by governmental agent must be reasonable and that probable cause support any judicially granted warrant1 originally the supreme court interpreted this provision as imposing presumptive warrant requirement declaring that searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge or magistrate are per unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to few specifically established and well delineated exceptions2 the court has eschewed this approach at times determining that warrant is not required to establish the reasonableness of all government searches and when warrant is not requiredprobable cause is not invariably required either3 in the criminal setting 1 us const amend iv in full the fourth amendment provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized the probable cause standard for valid governmental search has been interpreted by the supreme court as fair probability that contraband or evidence of crime will be found in particular placeillinois v gates 462 us 213 238 1983 in the arrest context probable cause to obtain warrant to arrest or to effectuate warrantless arrest requires that the authorities have at the moment of arrest knowledge of facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant reasonable belief that an offense has been or is being committed see wong sun v united states 371 us 471 479 1963 2 katz v united states 389 us 347 357 1967 3 vernonia school district 47j v acton 515 us 646 653 1995 this standards has generally been applied to administrative searches but has been used in the criminal context continued crs2 however this warrant requirement traditionally has been viewed as protective mechanism placing the authority to determine probable cause in the hands of neutral magistrate as opposed to law enforcement authorities who are engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime4 in instances where the interests of the public outweigh those of private individuals however the court has recognized specifically established exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment5 indeed such exceptions have been recognized for searches incident to valid arrest plain view seizures vehicle searches investigatory detentions and exigent circumstances among others6 the automobile exception in carroll v united states the supreme court determined that automobiles are inherently mobile creating exigent circumstances which render the obtainment of warrant impractical7 specifically the court found it significant that unlike building or house vehicle and any contraband therein could be readily removed from jurisdiction pending the issuance of warrant8 as such the court held that law enforcement authorities need not obtain warrant to search an automobile when there is probable cause indicating illegal activity9 the supreme court has further buttressed the automobile exception by declaring that there is reduced expectation in the privacy of automobiles given that they are rarely used as repository for personal effects their occupants and contents are generally in plain view and are subject to extensive state regulation10 regarding the proper scope of searches conducted pursuant to the automobile exception the supreme court has held that when police have probable cause to believe that vehicle contains contraband they may conduct thorough warrantless search including any containers which may conceal the object of the search11 3 continued see illinois v rodriguez 497 us 177 1990 4 johnson v united states 333 us 10 1314 1948 5 camara v municipal court 387 us 523 539540 1967 6 for thorough exposition of

10 united states v chadwick 433 us 1 1213 1977 similarly the court has pointed to public operation and servicing as factors which further diminish the expectation of privacy in an automobile see california v carney 471 us 386 392 1985 11 united states v ross 456 us 798 825 1982 in ross the court declared that search under the automobile exception may extend as far as magistrate could legitimately continued crs3 the supreme court recently clarified the extent to which police officers may search belongings in vehicle in wyoming v houghton12 there the court held that police officers with probable cause to search car may inspect passengers personal belongings inside the vehicle in instances where those items are capable of concealing the object of the search irrespective of whether the passenger is under suspicion13 in reaching this conclusion the court pointed to several factors first the court noted that there was strong body of law empowering government agents with probable cause to conduct warrantless searches of vessels for contraband including the automobile exception as delineated in carroll and clarified in ross14 also the court found that none of these cases indicated that the scope of such searches rested upon distinction among packages or containers based on ownership15 balancing the relative governmental interests against individual privacy in this scenario the court determined that passengers have reduced expectation of privacy in property transported in automobiles and that search of such property is minimally intrusive conversely the court found that the governmental interests at stake were substantial specifically the court held that law enforcement efforts would be impaired if authorities were unable to search passengers belongings when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal wrongdoing is hidden in the car given that the mobility of an automobile creates risk that evidence will be lost while warrant is obtained16 also the court found it significant that car passengers will often be engaged in common enterprise with the driver and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing17 in view of these factors the court ruled that such searches were permissible investigatory detentions in terry v ohio the supreme court held that police officer may stop and question an individual who is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity as well as perform limited frisk to ascertain whether the individual in question is armed18 specifically the court addressed factual scenario where an officer lacking both warrant and probable cause detained three individuals after observing them loitering near store in suspicious manner the officer stopped the individuals in order to ascertain their identities and fearing that they might be armed patted down the outside of their clothing this frisk resulted in the discovery of two revolvers 11 continued

passenger surreptitiously and that passenger confederates could simply claim all belongings in the car as their own 18 392 us 1 2224 1968 crs4 noting that the state action at issue was governed by the fourth amendment the court stated that the constitutional validity of stop and frisk hinged upon reasonableness inquiry as opposed to probable cause analysis19 as such the court determined it necessary to balance the need to search or seize against the invasion which the search or seizure entails20 accordingly the court identified two factors which it deemed essential to valid investigative detention first law enforcement officers may initiate an investigative detention only when there is reasonable articulable suspicion criminal activity thus for stop to be valid law enforcement officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant that intrusion21 second the scope of law enforcement activity resulting from an investigative detention must be reasonably related to the circumstances supporting the initial stop if these factors are present according to the court brief investigative detention may be justified in light of significant governmental interests even where probable cause is lacking this analysis has been applied in the vehicular context as well specifically while the supreme court has ruled that even brief traffic detention constitutes seizure under the fourth amendment the court has also determined that traffic stops are less onerous than formal custodial detentions22 as such traffic stops are equivalent to traditional terry stops requiring that law enforcement action be predicated upon reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal conduct and that ensuing police activity be reasonably related in scope to the initial basis of the stop23 pretextual stops whereas the stop and frisk rationale delineated in terry can be of great utility to police in the traffic detention context it must be remembered that an officer must have reasonable articulable suspicion of illegal activity to justify an initial stop to surmount this potential impediment law enforcement authorities have engaged in the controversial practice of stopping individuals for minor offenses as pretext to search for evidence of other criminal wrongdoing generally speaking pretextual traffic stop occurs when police effectuate stop based on probable cause that violation has occurred while in actuality the primary motivation for the detention is to 19 id at 20 specifically the court explained that stop and frisk encounter involves an entire rubric of police conductnecessarily swift action predicated upon the onthespot observations of the officer on the beatwhich historically has not been and as practical matter could not be subjected to the warrant procedure instead the conduct in this case must be tested by the fourth amendments general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures id at 20 20 id at 21 21 id at 21 accordingly inarticulable hunches or generalized suspicions cannot serve as the basis for an investigative detention id at 22 22 berkemer v mccarty 468 us 420 439 1984 23 see united states v sharpe 470 us 675 682 1985 delaware v prouse 440 us 648 6611979 crs5 investigate the possibility that more egregious criminal activity is being committed24 in united states v whren the supreme court considered the constitutionality of this practice in whren two plainclothes vice officers of the district of columbia metropolitan police department were patrolling an area of high drug activity in an unmarked car the officers passed dark nissan sentra pathfinder with temporary license plates occupied by two young males and observed that the driver of the vehicle was looking toward the lap of the passenger the officers noticed that the vehicle had paused at stop sign for an abnormal period of time as the officers executed uturn towards the vehicle the nissan made sudden right turn without signaling and accelerated from the intersection at an unreasonable speed the officers subsequently stopped the vehicle and observed two large bags of crack cocaine in the defendants hands the defendants were arrested and an ensuing search resulted in the discovery of other illegal drugs the defendants were indicted on four counts of federal drug law violations the defendants moved to suppress the evidence maintaining that the traffic stop was not predicated on probable cause or reasonable suspicion and as such was violative of the fourth amendment the district court denied the motion stating that the stop conformed with normal traffic enforcement procedures the defendants were ultimately convicted and the disposition of their case was affirmed by the court of appeals for the district of columbia in regards to the suppression argument the court of appeals held that regardless of whether police officer subjectively believes that the occupants of an automobile may be engaging in some other illegal behavior traffic stop is permissible as long as reasonable officer in the same circumstances could have stopped the car for the suspected traffic violation in its subsequent consideration of the case unanimous supreme court adopted an objective test declaring that the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that traffic violation has occurred25 in reaching this conclusion the court rejected the contention that prior precedent established that law enforcement should not be permitted to use valid bases of action against citizens as pretexts for pursuing other investigatory agendas26 specifically the court noted that the cases in question dealt with searches in the administrative and inventory contexts which were conducted without probable cause accordingly the court determined that such decisions gave support to the principle that ulterior motives can invalidate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of probable cause to believe that violation of law has occurred27 further clarifying this point the court stated not only have we never held outside the context of inventory search or administrative inspection that an officers motive 24 thus under this definition pretextual stop is an objectively reasonable and valid exercise of police power as opposed to the notion that an officer may simply fabricate an underlying justification for stop see united states v whren 517 us 806 812 1996 25 517 us at 810 26 id at 811 27 id at 811 crs6 invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the fourth amendment but we have repeatedly held and asserted the contrary28 in view of this case law the court held that there was constitutional basis for hinging the validity of traffic stop on the actual motivations of the officers involved indeed the court went on to state that adoption of subjective test would require casebycase assessment of particular police actions at particular times compromising the invariable nature of fourth amendment search and seizure protections29 addressing the argument that pretextual stops might be employed in an intentionally discriminatory fashion by authorities the supreme court noted that it is well settled that the constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race the court declared however that the proper constitutional basis for such biased police action is the equal protection clause as opposed to the fourth amendment the court concluded its consideration of the issue by declaring that subjective intentions play role in ordinary probablecause fourth amendment analysis30 many commentators have decried the whren decision arguing that the court has essentially bestowed unbridled authority on law enforcement officers to detain any individual upon the merest of suspicions31 in particular it has been argued that given the pervasive and arcane nature of traffic laws police officer will invariably be able to effectuate an investigatory stop upon an inarticulable hunch as opposed to valid reasonable suspicion as such these commentators maintain the supreme court has departed from the spirit if not the letter of the terry standard while whren indeed imbues officers with yet another tool with which they may investigate individuals of whom they are suspicious strong case can be made that the courts decision does not reflect substantial change in fourth amendment precepts specifically it is important to note that officers conducting stop under the whren standard must still possess probable cause to initially stop vehicle which necessarily requires that valid traffic law has been violated furthermore the whren decision does not abrogate fourth amendment strictures which limit police power after an initial stop indeed officers must still satisfy probable cause and reasonable suspicion standards before 28 id at 812 see united states v villamontemarquez 462 us 579 584 n3 1983 customs service officers warrantless boarding of vessel not rendered invalid by underlying suspicion that

128 138 1978 subjective intent standing alone does not render otherwise lawful conduct illegal or unconstitutional 29 id at 815 specifically the court stated police enforcement practices even if they could be practicably assessed by judge vary from place to place and from time to time we cannot accept that the search and seizure protections of the fourth amendment are so variable 30 id at 813 31 see david harris driving while black and all other traffic offenses the supreme court and pretextual traffic stops 87 j crim l criminology 544 545546 1997 chris k visser without warrant probable cause or reasonable suspicion is there any meaning to the fourth amendment while driving car 35 hous l rev 1683 17081709 1999 crs7 impinging upon detainees rights beyond the scope of the original objective purpose for the stop furthermore the court recognized the potential that pretextual traffic stops could be made in an intentionally discriminatory fashion and ruled that the proper remedy for such an offense would be an equal protection claim this holding is consistent with supreme court precedent which mandates that objectively reasonable enforcement measures should not be prohibited due to the possibility of unconstitutional application rather the proper remedy in such circumstance is for the aggrieved party to file suit accordingly it seems that while the whren decision sanctions objective reasonable police action based upon underlying motivations the ruling comports with traditional constitutional principles fashioned by the court having established the main avenues by which law enforcement officers may conduct valid vehicular seizure or investigatory detention it is now necessary to ascertain the scope of and nature of permissible police activity subsequent to traffic stop poststop conduct as noted above the reasonableness clause of the fourth amendment as interpreted in terry requires that any search or seizure subsequent to traffic stop be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place32 however employing the officer safety rationale which supported the stop and frisk at issue in terry the court has expanded the range of protective measures officers may take in the traffic stop context recognizing that investigative detentions involving suspects in vehicles are especially fraught with danger the court has ruled that law enforcement officers may order individuals to exit vehicle search passenger compartments and frisk individuals for weapons in certain circumstances33 protective searches in pennsylvania v mimms the supreme court held that law enforcement officers may order driver to exit an automobile during traffic stop and may conduct frisk if there is reasonable belief that the detained individual is armed34 in mimms two police officers observed the defendant driving with an expired license plate upon stopping the vehicle one of the officers directed the defendant to exit the vehicle and produce his license and registration as the defendant exited the vehicle one of the officers noticed large bulge under the defendants clothing fearing that the bulge could be weapon the officer frisked the defendant and discovered loaded 38 caliber pistol passenger was subsequently discovered to be in possession of 32 caliber pistol the defendant was arrested and later convicted of unlawful possession of firearm35 32 sharpe 470 us at 682 quoting terry 392 us at 20 33 see michigan v long 463 us 1032 10471048 1983 34 434 us 106 110 1977 35 id at 107 crs8 analyzing the constitutionality of the order requiring the defendant to exit the vehicle the court noted that there is an inordinate risk confronting an officer as he approaches person seated in an automobile and that significant portion of police shootings involve suspects seated in automobiles36 furthermore the court determined that asking driver to exit vehicle could also lessen the danger posed by nearby moving traffic balancing these factors with the intrusiveness of an exit request the court found that ordering an individual from vehicle subsequent to lawful stop constitutes minimis imposition on personal liberty in particular the court explained that after being initially detained the additional requirement that driver exit vehicle exposes little more of his person than is already exposed and does not constitute serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person37 in light of this minimal intrusion the court declared that mere inconvenience cannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for officer safety38 accordingly the court held that law enforcement officers may order driver to exit his vehicle pursuant to lawful traffic detention39 the court also determined that the frisk at issue was constitutionally valid in reaching this determination the court explained that pursuant to terry the bulge observed under the defendants jacket provided sufficient basis to suspect the presence of firearm as such the court deemed the ensuing frisk to be reasonable action to ensure officer safety40 recently in maryland v wilson the supreme court extended upon its ruling in mimms declaring that law enforcement officers could order passengers as well as drivers to exit vehicle detained in valid traffic stop41 in wilson police officer pulled over vehicle in which three persons were traveling upon noticing that the front seat passenger was sweating and appeared extremely nervous the officer ordered him out of the car when the passenger exited the vehicle crack cocaine fell to the ground the passenger was arrested and subsequently convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute addressing the issue of whether passengers could be subjected to such police action pursuant to traffic detention the court pointed to the same officer safety factors considered dispositive in mimms42 while acknowledging that in the case of passengers the danger posed by incoming traffic would be lessened the court determined that the presence of multiple occupants increased the danger posed to an officer43 the court noted that passengers possessed slightly stronger personal liberty interest during stop than does driver in that while probable cause may exist 36 id at 109110 37 id at 111 38 id at 111 39 id at 111 40 id at 112 41 519 us 408 415 1997 42 id at 413 43 id at 413 crs9 to detain driver there is generally justifiable cause to stop or detain passengers noting that as practical matter passengers were already stopped as result of the vehicle detention the court determined that an exit order constituted minor intrusion as it would simply place passenger outside of vehicle which was already detained pursuant to this characterization the court determined that the safety concerns at issue prevailed since passengers ordered out of vehicle would be denied access to weapons concealed in the interior of the passenger compartment this factor was deemed especially pertinent by the court which surmised that potential violent encounter would not stem from the traffic stop itself but rather from more sinister criminal activity which might be uncovered by such detention44 having determined that the danger posed to an officer during traffic stop is greater when passengers are present the court held that an exit order constituted minimal intrusion allowing officers conducting such stops to order passengers from vehicles pending completion of the detention45 the wilson decision has also been criticized as an unreasonable extension of police authority by potentially increasing the impact of the plain view exception and encouraging arbitrary police action indeed it has even been argued that the wilson decision will ultimately lead to the court sanctioned detention of individuals upon general traffic stop46 while the decision does indeed increase police authority in this context it is not apparent that any substantial fourth amendment rights have been impinged indeed the court noted that the intrusion of an exit order appears minimal when compared to concerns of officer safety47 also it does not seem that the notion that wilson will expand the plain view doctrine is of any substantial significance in search and seizure analysis given that by its nature the plain view exception is outside the purview of the fourth amendment48 rather in the doctrinal sense it seems that wilson like whren serves mainly to illustrate the courts preference for objective fourth amendment standards furthermore given the courts matteroffact analysis wilson could be regarded merely as the application of preexisting constitutional standards to new factual scenario the supreme court has also extended the terry standard to permit protective searches of the interior of an automobile in certain instances in michigan v long for instance the court held that limited protective searches are permissible in circumstances where an officer reasonably believes that there may be safety risk from weapons potentially located within the vehicle and accessible by the detainee in long two police officers observed car which was traveling erratically and at excessive speed as the officers observed the vehicle turn down side road it swerved off into ditch upon stopping to investigate the officers were met by long the only occupant at the rear of the vehicle the vehicle was projecting from the ditch onto the road and the drivers side door of the vehicle was open long failed 44 id at 414 45 id at 414415 46 see visser supra n 28 at

his registration long again failed to respond after the officers made another production request long whom the officers now suspected of being under the influence turned away from the officers and began to walk toward the open door of the vehicle the officers followed long and observed large knife on the floorboard of the drivers side of the vehicle the officers stopped long from approaching the car and conducted terry frisk which revealed weapons one of the officers stood with long as the other visually inspected the interior of the vehicle for other weapons upon noticing an item protruding from under the armrest of the front seat the officer knelt in the vehicle and lifted the armrest the item under the armrest was an open pouch and upon flashing light into the pouch the officer determined that it contained marijuana long was then arrested subsequent search of the vehicles trunk revealed approximately 75 pounds of marijuana considering the question of whether the safety considerations of terry search extended to search of the passenger compartment of vehicle pursuant to lawful investigatory stop the supreme court held that police protection principles compelled the conclusion that such search is permissible if the police officer possesses reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which taken together with the rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons49 in reaching this determination the court reiterated its holdings in mimms and other cases which established that officers could conduct constitutional stop and frisk if reasonable suspicion of potential danger existed given this standard the court concluded that the same safety considerations adhered to interior areas of vehicle which might harbor weapons50 the court also made it clear that such search was justified even though the suspect was ostensibly under the control of the officers at the time of the protective search specifically the court explained that during the course of any investigative detention suspect is under police control only in the sense that he may be briefly detained against his will51 as such the court explained that detained individual may still produce weapon from his clothing or may break away from police control long enough to retrieve weapon from the interior of an automobile furthermore the court noted that detained individual could have access to weapons inside car after the investigate stop is completed absent protective sweep of the interior52 in light of these factors the court again emphasized that safety considerations outweighed any potential fourth amendment considerations stemming from such sweep 49 id at 1049 quoting terry 392 us at 21 50 id at 1051 furthermore the court stated that any contraband discovered in the course of protective search of an automobiles interior would be subject to seizure id at 1050 51 id at 1051 quoting terry 392 us at 34 52 id at 10511052 crs11 seizure of items in plain view another well established exception to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment dictates that an officer acting pursuant to constitutional authority may seize contraband or other evidence of criminal activity which is in plain view53 this exception applies not only to the seizure of items in plain view but also provides that the mere observation of an object without its seizure may contribute to the probable or reasonable suspicion necessary to seize the object54 also it has been determined that items exposed to plain view are not within the ambit of fourth amendment protection as such upon the inadvertent discovery of contraband pursuant to the plain view exception warrant requirement adheres to its ensuing seizure55 given this dynamic the impact of this exception in the traffic detention context is substantial the discovery of contraband in such fashion imbues law enforcement officers with the authority to effectuate seizure and may also provide probable cause for warrantless search56 furthermore this exception has also been adapted to allow for plain touch and plain smell seizures when illegality is immediately apparent57 consent searches law enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless search after obtaining voluntary consent irrespective of probable cause or reasonable suspicion58 consent so obtained may be either express or implied and does not necessarily have to be knowing and intelligent59 pursuant to this standard the supreme court has ruled that an officer is not required to inform lawfully detained driver that he is free to leave prior to requesting permission to search60 in ohio v robinette police officer stopped vehicle for exceeding the speed limit during the course of the stop the officer requested that the driver exit the vehicle whereupon the driver was given warning and his license and registration were returned after this exchange the officer asked the detainee if there was any illegal contraband in the vehicle the officer then explicitly requested permission to search and received consent upon conducting search of the vehicle the officer 53 coolidge v new hampshire 403 us 443 1971 54 texas v brown 460 us 730 738 1983 55 id at 740 see also katz v united

1996 crs12 discovered illegal narcotics the driver was subsequently arrested and charged with possession of controlled substance61 the supreme court of ohio had ruled that the search was violative of the fourth amendment in particular the ohio court determined that the legitimate traffic stop concluded upon the issuance of the warning and return of the drivers license and registration rendering any further detention illegal62 the ohio supreme court found that the subsequent search request could not be construed as consensual encounter since most individuals believe they are still in custody as long as the officer continues to interrogate them63 accordingly ohio established bright line rule stating that when the purpose of an initial stop is completed the officer involved must inform the individual that he or she is legally free to go64 the supreme court of the united states reversed declaring that law enforcement officials do not have constitutional duty under the fourth amendment to inform individuals as to whether particular police encounter is consensual specifically the court explained that the central focus of any inquiry into such an encounter must center on reasonableness measured in objective terms by examining the totality of the circumstances65 furthermore the court stressed that it eschewed brightline rules of the sort proposed by ohio finding it more appropriate to focus on the fact specific nature of reasonableness inquiry in the fourth amendment context66 illustrating this approach the court discussed schneckloth v bustamonte where it held that the validity of an individuals consent to vehicle search did not require that the defendant know of his right to refuse such request specifically the court stated that while knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor to be taken into account the government need not establish such knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective consent67 the court further explained that it would be thoroughly impractical to impose on the normal consent search the detailed requirements of an effective warning68 applying this rationale to the case at hand the court in robinette declared that it would be unrealistic to require police officers to always inform detainees that they are free to go before consent to search may be deemed voluntary69 the court concluded its discussion by stressing again that the fourth 61 id at 3536 62 state v robinette 653 ne2d 695 697 ohio 1995 revd 519 us 33 1996 63 state v robinette 653 ne2d at 698699 64 state v robinette 653 ne2d at 699 65 ohio v robinette 519 us 33

search consent is whether such consent was voluntary as determined by factual inquiry focusing on totality of the circumstances70 search incident to arrest the supreme court has also established that subsequent to lawful custodial arrest police may conduct warrantless search of an arrestee irrespective of probable cause and reasonable suspicion to indicate the presence of either weapons or evidence71 unlike the limited focus of terry stop and frisk police may make full search for weapons and evidence in search conducted incident to valid arrest72 furthermore in chimel v california the supreme court ruled that police could also search the area within the immediate control of an arrestee explaining that the scope of such search was necessary to ensure officer safety and maintain evidence integrity73 in new york v belton the court extended the scope of its ruling in chimel holding that custodial arrest imbued police with the power to conduct search of the passenger compartment of an automobile specifically the court declared that authorities may search the passenger compartment and any containers located therein even after establishing exclusive custody over the vehicle and arrestee74 from the aforementioned cases it is evident that the supreme court has placed significant weight on officer safety considerations in delineating the scope of police power to conduct searches and seizures in the traffic stop context as noted these decisions have led many legal scholars to the conclusion that the court has established strong law enforcement preference in fourth amendment issues impinging upon personal liberty interests guaranteed under the constitution while these may be valid concerns it is important to note that the court continues to operate within traditional fourth amendment parameters this is illustrated in the search incident to arrest context in the recent case of knowles v iowa75 in knowles v iowa the united states supreme court overturned ruling from the supreme court of iowa which had validated police officers warrantless search of an automobile stopped for traffic violation even though the driver was not arrested for the offense but rather had merely been issued citation the iowa supreme court validated the search on the basis that so long as the arresting officer had probable cause to make custodial arrest there need not in fact have been 70 id 71 new york v belton 453 us 454 1981 united states v robinson 414 us 218 1973 72 see robinson 414 us at 229 73 395 us 752 763 1969 74 belton 453 us at 460 according to the court the term container refers to any object capable of holding another object including closed or open glove compartments consoles or other receptacles located anywhere within the passenger compartment as well as luggage boxes bags clothing and the like id the court clarified the scope of its holding noting that authority to search did not extend to the trunk of an automobile id however search of the hatch area of an automobile has been upheld due to the accessibility of such an area from the passenger area see united states v doward 41 f3d 789 794 1st cir 1994 75 119 sct 484 1998 crs14 custodial arrest76 the supreme court of the united states noting that none of the justifications supporting searches incident to arrest adhere to typical traffic stop held that the police action was violative of the fourth amendment specifically the court explained that the officer safety rationale was not applicable in that the threat posed by the issuance of traffic citation is substantially less than in the custodial arrest context which is of special concern given the extended exposure which follows the taking of suspect into custody and transporting him to the police station77 clarifying this point the court stated that while safety concerns are present in routine traffic stop they do not justify the significant intrusion effected by full search rather the court found it significant that officers possess other means by which they may protect themselves such as ordering individuals to exit vehicles and to conduct terry frisks and searches where justified78 furthermore the court declared that search incident to citation exception to the fourth amendment could not be justified by need to preserve evidence since once an individual is stopped and issued citation all evidence necessary to prosecute that offense has been obtained79 the court also declared that such search could not be justified on the basis that an individual stopped for traffic offense might destroy evidence of another crime noting that the possibility of discovering evidence unrelated to traffic offense was too remote80 conclusion in light of the aforementioned cases it is evident that the supreme court has crafted significant exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment in the traffic detention context as has been shown recent decisions in particular have arguably expanded the scope of law enforcement power leading some commentators to declare that the fourth amendment has been all but abrogated in the vehicular context however while cases such as whren and wilson show that the court has indeed clarified and sanctioned greater protective and investigative police authority in the traffic context it is important to remember that these rulings have been predicated upon well settled constitutional principles furthermore the courts decision in knowles establishes that the same rationales supporting extensions of law enforcement authority also serve to circumscribe police power as such it seems that while police officers do indeed possess broad authority under these decisions the courts rulings have adhered to the basic principles which fostered the initial development of the exceptions discussed above as such rather than forging new doctrinal interpretations of fourth amendment boundaries and exceptions it appears that the court has applied settled constitutional principles to previously unencountered factual scenarios expanding police power in certain respects while restricting it in others 76 id at 487 77 id
