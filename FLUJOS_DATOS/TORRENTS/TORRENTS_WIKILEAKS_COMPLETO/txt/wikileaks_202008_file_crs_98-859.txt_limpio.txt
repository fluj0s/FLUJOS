clusters october 21 1998 wendy h schacht specialist in science and technology science technology and medicine division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report provides framework for exploring the feasibility of generating high tech clusters in states where they currently do not exist or are not easily identifiable the information may be used to provide common frame of reference for key decisionmakers as they examine the possibility of creating clusters the reasons for such actions are presented here as are the characteristics typically associated with high growth entrepreneurial regions summary of the lessons learned by the successes and failures of other jurisdictions may provide guide for additional discussion also offered are selected options for further consideration in designing next steps for the community the report will be updated if events warrant such action state technology development strategies the role of high tech clusters summary there has been increasing congressional interest in efforts across the country to generate expanded regional economic growth through technological development and the creation of new firms concurrently and often in conjunction with ongoing federal programs state activities to promote an environment conducive to technological innovation have expanded typically focusing on the development of concentrations of high tech firms in specific localities these clusters are groups of interrelated firms and institutions including suppliers service providers universities and trade associations located in specific area that cooperate as well as compete as such clusters provide the opportunity for ongoing innovation to meet new demands for products and processes generated by the dynamic relationships among the players technological advancement is key element of economic growth experts widely accept that technical progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living entrepreneurial firms often play an important role in technological progress it usually is through these companies that the results of research and development rd are commercialized and brought to the marketplace they are also instrumental in allowing economic benefits to remain within region such firms create wealth through value added jobs that are longterm and require highly skilled employees that subsequently generate additional income spending and growth as well as more jobs states are attempting to fashion an entrepreneurial climate by undertaking variety of programs to assist existing technologyrelated businesses to promote the development of new companies and to facilitate the application of technologies and techniques in all industries while it often takes long periods of time to establish regional clusters with the attendant risks and uncertainties several characteristics are common to entrepreneurial areas these regions typically have knowledge source generally university that can provide supply of ideas and employees and ongoing rd venture capital is available as is skilled labor clusters or agglomerations of similar entrepreneurial firms exist as do opportunities for generating new businesses through science parks or incubators good transportation and high standard of living

advancement is key element of economic growth experts widely accept that technical progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living historically industrial expansion was based on the use of technology to exploit natural resources today such growth tends to be founded on scientific discoveries and engineering knowledge eg electronics biomedical applications and is even more dependent than before on the development and use of technology technological advance can drive the economy because it contributes to the creation of new goods and services new industries new jobs and new capital it can expand the range of services offered and extend the geographic distribution of those services the application of technology also can contribute to the resolution of those national problems that are amenable to technological solutions 1 for detailed discussion see congressional research service

technological advancement debate over government policy crs issue brief 91132 updated regularly crs2 technological progress is achieved through innovation the process that provides new and improved products manufacturing processes and services it is an activity that may involve among other things idea origination research development engineering commercialization and diffusion throughout the marketplace concept can become an innovation without evolving through those separate steps an invention becomes an innovation when it has been integrated into the economy such that the knowledge created is applied in production to increase productivity and quality or results in new or improved product or service that can be sold in the marketplace it is only then that significant stimulus to economic growth occurs entrepreneurial firms often play an important role in technological advancement and economic growth it usually is through these companies that the results of research and development are commercialized and brought to the marketplace thus the current interest in creating an environment to facilitate the development of indigenous talent and to attract outside players while the manufacturing facilities of high technology companies can bring an infusion of new jobs to region studies have shown that branch plants do not provide much additional high technology development3 such businesses tend to move when it is cheaper to manufacture elsewhere even though they utilize skilled workforce in contrast the rd facilities of high tech companies generate higher value added jobs it might be possible to devise mechanisms to use the location of production plant to stimulate involvement of the rd sectors of the relevant corporation however concentrating on branch plants poses problems in that the stifling effects of branch plant economy on entrepreneurship are great and cannot easily be overcome by policies to locate government research facilities in backward regions in the hope of generating spinoffs4 economic benefits remain within region through the creation of new firms5 these companies create wealth through value added jobs that are long term and require highly skilled employees that generate additional income spending and growth as well as more jobs the regions that display an active entrepreneurial environment embody distinctive and similar characteristics these areas typically have knowledge source generally university that can provide supply of ideas and employees and ongoing rd venture capital is available as is skilled labor there are clusters or agglomerations of similar entrepreneurial firms and opportunities for generating new businesses through science parks or incubators good transportation and high standard of living are also complementary to entrepreneurial activity 3 amy glasmeier hightech policy hightech realities the spatial distribution of high tech industry in america in growth policy in the age of

high technology companies is necessary to sustain indigenous economic growth an existing agglomeration cluster of firms in similar or related sectors is principal determinant of both birth rates and the distribution of small technologybased firms6 clusters are groups of interrelated companies and institutions including suppliers service providers universities and trade associations etc located in specific area that cooperate as well as compete7 as such clusters provide the opportunity for ongoing innovation to meet new demands for products and processes generated by the dynamic relationships among the players diversity within the types and sizes of businesses contributes to good entrepreneurial environment8 varied educated and skilled workforce also contributes to the technological advancement in and around the cluster clusters are important not primarily because of production but because of the opportunities for knowledge spillovers9 innovative activity is more likely to occur within close geographic proximity to the source of knowledge be it university research laboratory the research and development department of corporation or exposure to the knowledge embodied in skilled worker10 innovation tends to cluster around industries where knowledge plays an important role11 as evidenced by the biotechnology computer advanced materials and telecommunications sectors among others lessons from the past in the quest for regional growth state economic development strategies are based upon expansion of indigenous innovation and adaptation of technology in the private sector efforts are focused on the creation of high technology firms and the use of advanced technologies in the traditional manufacturing and service sectors states are attempting to fashion an entrepreneurial climate by undertaking variety of programs to assist existing technologyrelated businesses to promote the development of new companies and to facilitate the application of technologies and techniques in all industries these endeavors vary by state and often several approaches are supported simultaneously what they all have in common however is the potential to generate large number of new high value added jobs 6 patricia m flynn technology life cycles and state economic development strategies federal reserve bank of boston new england economic review mayjune 1994 24 7 michael

economic distress brought about by the decline of traditional industries in the 1970s and 1980s and the subsequent loss of thousands of jobs helped spur the formulation of many of todays state programs12 the conditions precipitated shift away from state policies to promote smokestack chasing attracting large manufacturing firms away from other areas toward assistance to high technology companies in the areas of research development commercialization technology transfer and capital formation among others many of these efforts have crystalized into state industrial policies under which particular businesses or industrial sectors are selected as the nexus of state investment endeavors the activist nature of these state ventures has foundation in their responsibilities to promote the economic viability within their jurisdictions state involvement initially developed based on the idea that these nonnational governments must take action in areas where the private sector was unwilling to play role thus the government was not seen as replacing the business community in the decisionmaking process but as filling void left by inaction13 in filling this void the states saw an opportunity to attract or develop high technology firms which contribute to the areas economic growth through highwage employment low environmental costs high rates of expansion longterm growth potential clustering of other similar firms and suppliers export orientation and prestige14 over the years planned coordinated efforts have been undertaken by states and localities to facilitate technological advancement and generate economic growth several have been highly successful others have failed in order to provide framework for decisions in particular area it might be helpful to analyze efforts by several other regions and identify activities which might parallel the current situation under discussion the study of austin texas cape canaveral florida research triangle park north carolina phoenix arizona and lowell massachusetts may offer insights into what activities might be appropriate to areas of the country with few existing or identified clusters the focus of this section is on early efforts by several communities because of perceived parallels with the current situation in many regions critical to local technology development is strong technological infrastructure and an entrepreneurial network15 this presents opportunities for state and local governments in pursuit of their responsibilities to promote economic development however it is important to keep in mind that some argue government policies are limited in what they can do to create entrepreneurs policy does not create entrepreneurs but can encourage them to stay in location there is general finding that due to the complexity of the firm formulation process it is hard for policies 12 matthew i slavin and sy adler legislative constraints on gubernatorial capacity for state

to entrepreneurial activities into favourable sic one16 by identifying what worked in other areas decisionmakers can identify what resources their individual state or locality has to offer the entrepreneur and what might be done to augment this foundation the history of the austin area provides an interesting study for decisionmakers in regions with federal facilities several of the factors necessary for strong technological infrastructure were already in place others needed to be developed federal facilities played role in generating the critical mass required for the effort in austin to succeed bergstrom air force base employed large number of trained individuals and placed government funds into the local economy balcones research park was created in the early 1940s when the federal government provided land to the university of texas and funded research tied to world war ii17 the federal government has continued to facilitate development in the area by ongoing funding for rd the contribution of strong academic institution in generating entrepreneurship and technological development is underscored by the role of the university of texas ut in the austin area the university has been the source for the development of numerous indigenous firms over half of the small and medium sized companies existing in the locality during 1986 were spunoff from ut the potential for on going interaction with the university was part of the decision for entrepreneurs to remain in austin18 tracor corporation fortune 500 company in the mid1980s exemplified the generation of new entrepreneurial growth through research university created by ut graduate over 16 companies had spunout of the original firm employing almost 5500 people in 1985 these spinoffs also spawned additional new companies this growth would not have occurred without the existence of the university of texas19 the depth of higher education within texas also played an important role in the 1983 decision by the microelectronics and computer technology corporation joint rd venture supported by various companies to locate in austin between 1970 and the early 1980s texas undertook planned program to improve the state university system and 800 new chairs were endowed at ut20 this was accompanied by local level promotion of technology development that resulted in various public private initiatives study of the reasons for the location decision by the microelectronics and computer technology corporation identified as significant the coordinated and cooperative effort by academic

support for education at the university of texas and texas am university21 similarly the primary reason given for the decision by sematech consortium of semiconductor manufacturing firms to locate in austin was the support and cooperation of state and local public and private agencies22 the chamber of commerce provided information to and support of high tech companies while local groups brought together key individuals and organizations in strategic approach to meeting their goals23 efforts to develop viable high tech industrial expansion in florida coalesced around the federal facilities in cape canaveral24 large aerospace and defense contractors were able to induce high tech growth through the recruitment of skilled workers and the training of local employees the state also made commitment to the pursuit of technological advancement to ensure that the opportunities presented were not lost the areas infrastructure particularly transportation was strengthened academic resources were considered inferior and concerted effort was made to improve the system at all levels including precollege through graduate school as well as vocational education educational programs were designed to meet industry needs and state funding was provided for engineering and science programs in the universities and for community and vocational schools by 1987 there were over 400 specialized academic research programs of interest to industry in the state another region which focused on improvements in the educational establishment was research triangle park north carolina there are three research universities in the area including the university of north carolina north carolina state university and duke university in 1959 research triangle park rtp was created as university affiliated research campus the objectives of the park were the diversification of the economy the augmentation of high value added jobs and additional employment opportunities for university graduates25 although the state provided direct funding it built the necessary roads for the park26 and donated the land for the research triangle institute27 the institute offers research and development staff and facilities to companies 21 raymond w smilor george kozmetsky and david v gibson eds creating the technopolis cambridge ballinger 1988 174175 22 gibson and smilor in growth policy 385 23 smilor

attracting the rd facilities of large established companies28 the area developed slowly until ibm moved in and the national institute of environmental health science national institutes of health located in the park partly as result of political influence by the us secretary of commerce luther hodges the former governor of north carolina and then governor terry sanford numerous other rd organizations have set up facilities in the park since that time among the reasons for the decision to relocate were the prestige of being associated with the park the ability to interact with professionals in other organizations and access to entry level graduates for recruiting purposes29 the ability for an area to develop viable and prosperous research park is dependent on several factors although all need not be present for success an existing rd infrastructure and ongoing research activity is one potential element the availability of local research universities engineering schools or medical schools also plays role along with good air transportation as well as technical and businesses services leadership is important and should include representatives from the political academic and business communities30 the focus on recruiting existing firms has resulted in slower growth for the park as other areas across the nation have been successful in developing additional resources through the early 1990s there were few efforts within research triangle park to generate new startup hightech companies and it was often too costly for small firms to locate within its confines31 however there were other efforts outside of rtp to facilitate new firm growth the state concentrated on improving the educational system to mold indigenous scientific and technical talent and developed job training programs through an extensive number of community colleges to attract new industries32 educational opportunities also played significant role in high tech development around phoenix arizona one 1987 study funded by the national science foundation found that 70 of microelectronics firms attributed their decision to locate in phoenix to the proximity of arizona state university33 the state had made coordinated effort to strengthen and expand the undergraduate and graduate engineering programs at the university in 1979 50 member council was formed to review engineering education representatives from industry academia state government and faculty developed plan to strengthen the universitys educational programs as well as its research capabilities as result the engineering curriculum was augmented centers of excellence were created and facilities for 28 ibid63 29 luger and goldstein garden 8587 30 ibid 175 31 ibid 78 32 ibid 173 188 33 gibson and

attributed to the mix and diversity of industry in the area relocation of high technology firms to the region was one factor in its economic growth however concerns were raised as to the reliance on branch plants35 in the early 1980s the state made clear statement of commitment to the expansion of local businesses and the encouragement of entrepreneurial startup firms as part of its strategic plan36 high tech growth in the region has been due to the expansion of existing firms relocation of national corporations spinoffs or new startups37 firms are attracted to phoenix or decide to remain because of the availability of trained work force and ongoing rd38 other lessons might be learned from the experience of lowell massachusetts in the mid1980s lowell had become high tech success after having experienced economic decline with the deterioration of traditional manufacturing in the area39 this success was based on attracting one major computer company wang laboratories and the subsequent location of several other similar firms in the region the factors which contributed to the growing economy were familiar entrepreneurial and skilled workers local competitive advantage in high technology public and private financial resources and effective local leadership however this did not last the economic decline in the united states and particularly in the northeast regional banking crisis caused by too many high risk loans to small and medium sized companies the effects of development lifecycles in the computer industry and an overreliance on one industrial sector and on one firm all combined to negate the prior economic growth this situation highlights the importance of diversifying the industrial and employment base and providing the skills necessary to support various sectors sustained growth requires ongoing investment in rd and innovation and the support of entrepreneurs in numerous types of businesses as discussed above certain characteristics are found in entrepreneurial areas including knowledge source ongoing rd skilled workforce clusters of high tech firms and good transportation commonalities associated with successful programs designed to encourage entrepreneurship include ongoing leadership either by state or local officials or representatives of the private sector strategic studies that identify the strengths and weaknesses of the area increase the visibility of the effort expand awareness of the process and develop support are often important 34 ibid 389390 35 smilor kozmetsky and gibson creating 201 36 peter k eisinger the

programs aims at developing the critical mass necessary for innovative activity publicprivate cooperation is also necessary for developing commitment by all involved parties particularly when such efforts tend to require patience41 ideas for consideration in employing the high tech cluster concept it should be recognized that the development of regional research and development and scientific complexes takes long periods of time and economic effects such as the generation of new local industries are highly unpredictable42 it might be helpful to states interested in using high tech clusters to stimulate economic growth to identify local resources including universities technical and vocational colleges industrial facilities small businesses federal institutions and federal laboratories also of importance is information on research and development expenditures in the state what is the percent of rd as portion of gross domestic product in the state what is the role of federal funding
