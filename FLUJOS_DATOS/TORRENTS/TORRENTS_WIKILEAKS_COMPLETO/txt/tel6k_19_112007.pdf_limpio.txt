the increased competition in the telecommunications landscape together with telkoms commitment to reducing the cost of telecommunications services through price reductions and significant value propositions to our customers telkom has embarked on its mobile review strategy in order to drive the value of converged services offering through the ngn for the benefit of the south african and

the group ebitda margin decreased to 375 as at september 30 2007 compared to 407 at september 30 2006 mainly due to higher fixedline operating expenditure which decreased the fixedline ebitda margin

services environment that is fast becoming global best practice and particularly so for the incumbent fixedline operators the competitive landscape has changed radically over the last few years with the mobile operators internet service providers and value added network service providers increasingly entering what has traditionally been the fixedline domain neotel is also building its network and services capabilities albeit slower than initially anticipated and the regulatory environment is geared to generate competition in the fixedline environment as result we are seeing fixedline revenue being eroded through both competition and price reductions which are necessary to defend and grow revenue also benefiting of the south african consumer through lower telecommunication service costs in order to counteract this negative revenue trend telkom is developing the capabilities to offer the full suite of converged services that encompass fixed mobile data and multimedia services our investment in our next generation network ngn will allow us to offer these products and services and will provide us with the ability to offer premium customer service through the intelligence and speed of this internet protocol based network telkom believes that these new products and services will compete effectively and provide us with the ability to counteract price reductions the ngn is also vital to ensuring south africas ability to communicate with global operators utilising similar technology and to provide the speeds functionality and reach to service south african companies expanding beyond our borders telkoms pursuit of an integrated business model to deliver converged services has led to the review of our mobile strategy announced at the annual results presentation for the year ended march 31 2007 held on june 13 2007 subsequent to this announcement telkom released cautionary announcement on september 3 2007 advising shareholders that it had entered into discussions

revenue from local calls decreased by 96 to r2125 million affected primarily by the loss of dialup minutes due to our adsl rollout and cannibalisation by our bundled products and mobile services revenue from long distance calls decreased by 149 to r1219 million primarily as result of 10 tariff decrease on august 1 2006 and 10 decrease on august 1 2007 these tariff decreases were partly offset by 22 increase in volumes revenue from fixed to mobile calls increased by 02 to r3794 million primarily as result of increased volumes of 39 tariffs on international calls were reduced by an average

exception of certain financial instruments and sharebased payments which are measured at fair value the results of the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year and these reviewed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended march 31 2007 the preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that the group may undertake in the future actual results may differ from those estimates significant accounting policies the groups significant accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent with those applied in the previous financial year except for the following the group has adopted circular 82007 ifrs7 ifric8 ifric9 ifric10 and ifric11 2 basis of preparation and accounting policies

segment reporting basis the principal effects of these changes are discussed below circular 82007 headline earnings the circular was issued by the south african institute of chartered accountants and is applicable for financial periods ending on or after august 31 2007 circular 82007 supercedes circular 72002 and it defines rules for calculating headline earnings per share which is an additional

beginning on april 1 2007 and the impact is disclosed in the financial statements of the group amendment to ias1 presentation of financial statements as result of the development of ifrs7 financial instruments disclosures ias1 has been amended to require the disclosure of the entitys objective policies and processes for managing capital quantitative data about what the entity regards as capital whether the entity has complied with any capital requirements and if it has not complied the consequences of such noncompliance the effect of this amendment will be included in the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended march 31 2008 since the disclosure of the consolidated interim financial statements is condensed ifrs7 financial instruments disclosures an entity shall apply this standard for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2007 ifrs7 adds certain new disclosures to those currently required by ias32 it also replaces the disclosure currently required by ias32 all financial instruments disclosures will now be provided in terms of ifrs7 the remaining parts of ias32 now only deal with the classification and presentation of financial instruments one of the main disclosure requirements added by ifrs7 is that an entity must group its financial instruments into classes of similar instruments and when disclosures are required make disclosures by class ifrs7 also requires information about the significance of financial instruments and information about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments the impact of this standard will be to expand on certain disclosures relating to financial instruments and will require additional disclosures not currently disclosed the effect of this standard will be included in the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ending march 31 2008 since the disclosure of the consolidated interim financial statements is condensed ifric8 scope of ifrs2 the interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after may 1 2006 ifric8 clarifies that ifrs2 applies to transactions in which an entity receives goods or services as consideration for equity instruments of the entity this includes transactions in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received the impact of this interpretation on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is not material since the group has not transacted with third parties using equity as purchase consideration for the kappsdpsedgartelkomtel6k112907ex992txt 11292007 114508 page 59page transaction other than those paid to employees in sharebased payment transactions ifric9 reassessment of embedded derivatives the interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after june 1 2006 ifric9 clarifies that an entity is required to separate an embedded derivative from the host contract and account for it as derivative when the entity first becomes party to the contract it further clarifies that reassessment is only allowed when there is change in the terms of the contract which significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required under the contract the impact of this interpretation on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is not material 2 basis of preparation and accounting policies continued significant accounting policies continued ifric10 interim financial reporting and impairment the interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after november 1 2006 ifric10 clarifies that an entity should not reverse an impairment loss recognised in previous interim period in respect of goodwill or an investment in either an equity instrument classified as available for sale or financial asset carried at cost the impact of this interpretation on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is not material ifric11 ifrs2 group and treasury share transactions the interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after march 1 2007 the ifric clarifies that regardless of whether the entity chooses or is required to buy equity instruments from another party to satisfy its obligations to its employees under the sharebased payment arrangement by delivery of its own shares the transaction should be accounted for as equity settled this interpretation also applies regardless of whether the employees rights to the equity instruments were granted by the entity itself or by its shareholders or was settled by the entity itself or its shareholders sharebased payments involving the groups own equity instruments in which the group chooses or is required to buy its own equity instruments to settle the sharebased payment obligation are currently accounted for

without revenue generating activity on the vodacom network eg making or receiving call sending or receiving an sms or transmitting data network activities relating kappsdpsedgartelkomtel6k112907ex994txt 11292007 114508 page 144page to call forwarding to voicemail are classified as revenue generating activities since implementing this rule prepaid sim cards remaining in an active state on the network with only call forwarding to voicemail and other revenue generating activities increased significantly it has therefore been decided to implement supplementary disconnection rule that will disconnect inactive prepaid sim cards after 13 months of being kept in an active state by call forwarding to voicemail only and not having had any other revenue generating activity on vodacoms network the implementation of the supplementary disconnection rule has led to the disconnection of an additional 29 million prepaid sim cards in september 2007 increasing churn on the prepaid customer base to 519 for the period under review this rule change is expected to increase prepaid churn but provides better reflection of active prepaid sim cards on the network and hence results in higher average revenue per user arpu the implementation of this supplementary rule has impact on the financial performance of vodacom south africa contract gross
