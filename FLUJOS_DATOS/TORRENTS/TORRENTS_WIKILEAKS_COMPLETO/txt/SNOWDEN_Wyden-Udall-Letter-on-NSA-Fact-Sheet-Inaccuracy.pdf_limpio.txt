general keith alexander director national security agency fort meade md 20755 dear general alexander united totes senate washington dc 20510 june 24 2013 the nsa recenlly released fact sheet on surveillance authorities that contains in formation about both section 702 of the foreign imelligence surveillance act flsa and section 215 of the usa patriot ct as you know section 215 of the patriot act is the basis for the nsa s bulk phone records collection program while section 702 of fisa governs the collection of phone and internet communications and involves the prism compmer system we were disappointed to sec that this fact sheet contains an inaccurate statement about how the section 702 amhority has been interpreted by tht us government in our judgment this inaccuracy is significant as it portrays protections for americans privacy as being significantly stronger than they actually arc we have identified this inaccurate statement in the classified attachment to this letter we urge you to conect this statement as soon as possible 1s you have seen when the nsa makes inaccurate statements about government surveillance and fails to correct the public record it can decrease public confidence in the nsa s openness and its commitment to protecting americans constitutional rights rebuilding this confidence will require willingness to correct misstatements and willingness to make reforms where appropriate separately we note that this same fact sheet states that under section 702 any inadvertently acquired commw1ication of or concerning us person must be promptly destroyed if it is neither relevant to the authorized purpose nor evidence of crime we believe that this statement is somewhat misleading in that it implies that the nsa has the ability to determine how many american communications it has collected under section 702 or that the law does not allow the nsa to deliberately search for the records olpanicular americans ln fact the intelligence community has told us repeatedly that it is not reasonably possible to identify the number of people located in the united states whose communications may have been reviewed under the authority of the fisa amendments act we appreciate your attention to this matter we believe that the us government should have broad autl10ritics to investigate terrorism and espionage and that it is possible to aggressively pursue terrorists without compromising the constitutional rights of ordinary americans achieving this goal depends not just on secret courts and secret congressional hearings but on informed public debate as well we look forward to your response ijdenudall leifer to general alexander page 2 june 21 20 i 3 sincerely
