division june 6 2007 abstract debate has begun about what statutory and regulatory framework is most likely to foster innovation and investment both in physical broadband networks and in the applications that ride over those networks perhaps the most contentious element in that debate is whether competitive marketplace forces are suï¬ƒcient to constrain the broadband network providers from restricting independent applications providers access to their networks in fashion that would harm consumers and innovation or is government intervention needed in the form of what has been referred to as network neutrality unfair competitive practices or other nondiscrimination rules placed on the network providers this debate has been stimulated by some fundamental changes in the telecommunications market environment several technologydriven several marketdriven and one regulatorydrivenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496 order code rl33496 access to broadband networks updated june

debate has begun about what statutory and regulatory framework is most likely to foster innovation and investment both in physical broadband networks and in the applications that ride over those networks perhaps the most contentious element in that debate is whether competitive marketpl ace forces are sufficien t to constrain the broadband network providers from restricting independent applications providers access to their networks in fashion th at would harm consumers and innovation the telephone and cable companies are deploying wireline broadband networks with unique architectures for example ve rizon is deploying optical fiber all the way to the customer premise while att is deploying fiber to node and then using dsl over existing copper lines to r each the customer premise and comcast and other cable companies are deploying hybrid fibercoaxial cable network but in each case their broadband networks have the same basic structure with three primary components the broadband last mil grid to enduser customers the companys proprietary ip network and the companys facilities in what has traditionally been called the internet backbone and is often referred to as the public internet this report analyzes these th ree components to identify the parameters that network providers have within their control such as their choices about network architecture overall bandwidth capacity bandwidth reserved for their own use traffic prioritization the rms and rates for access to th eir networks and for their retail services that can affect how end us ers and independent pplications providers can access their networks how those parameters contribute to the management and operation of the network and how those meters might be used strategically to harm competition for and consumers of voice over internet protocol voip video and other applications that ride over broadband networks the report then reviews the one b ill introduced to date in the 110th congress s 215 with provisions relating to access to broadband access networks as well as number of bills that were intr oduced but not enacted in the 109th congress to assess their potential impact on broadband network providers ability to manage their networks and to practice anticompetitive strategic beha vior these bills took number of policy approaches specifying pa rticular consumer rights to broadband access proposing variations on network neutrality rules that had provisions affecting the access of independent applica tions providers as well as consumers to broadband networks and pr oposing modification of existing competition law involving antitrust and unfair methods of competition to explicitly address broadband access issues this report will be updated as warranted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496contents introduction 1 what do wireline broadband networks look like 7 t h b r d b n d l s t m i l 9 b r d b n d n t w r k p r v i d r s p r p r i t

broadband network providers from restricting independent applications providers access to their networks in fashion that would harm consumers and innovation or is government intervention needed in the form of what has been referred to as network neutrality unfair competitive pr actices or other nondi scrimination rules placed on the network providers this debate has been stimulated by some funda mental changes in the telecommunications market environment several technolog ydriven several marketdriven and one regulatorydriven digital technology has reduced the co sts for those firms that already have singleuse for example voice or video networks to upgrade their networks in order to offer multiple services over their single platform the cost for these prev iously singleservice providers to enter new service markets has been significantly reduced1 inducing market convergence most notab ly cable companies are upgrading their networks to offer voice and da ta services as well as video services and telephone companies are upgrading their networks to offer video and data services as well as voice services despite these lower entry costs however wireline broadband networks require huge sunk upfr ont fixed capital expenditures this may limit the number of efficient broadband networks that can be deployed in any market to two the cable provider and the wireline telephone company unle ss lower cost alternative becomes available using wireless or some other new technology2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs2 2 continued direction in the us in december 2005 197 million

internet network that must be ma to deliver the packets since there can be congestion at each handoff point and voice todata conversion congestion that delays the transmission of packets can cause several problems the following is distillation of description for lay readers presented by ed felten in httpwwwfreedomto tinkercomp983 and http www freedomtotinkercomp986 both viewed on december 13 2006 in effect the internet or proprietary ip network is as set of routers connected by links packets of data ge t passed from one router to another via links packet is forwarded from router to router until it arrives at its destination typically each router has several incoming links on which packets arrive and several outgoing links on which it can send packets when packet shows up on an incoming link the router will figure out on which outgoing link the packet should be forwarded if that outgoing link is free the packet can be sent out on it imme diately but if the outgoing link is busy transmitting another packet the newly arrived packet will have to wait it will be buffered in the routers memory waiting its turn until the outgoing link is free buffering lets the router deal with temporary surges in traffic the router will be programmed to determine which packets should be delayed and also when the link is available which buffered packet should be transmitted that is packet prioritization scheme is devised this could be simple firstin firstout sche or favorapplicationssensitivetopacket delay scheme or payforpriority scheme or something else but if packets keep showing up faster than they can be sent out on some outgoing link the number of buffered packets continuedalthough wireless technology may provide third or even fourth alternative it is not likely to be ubiquitous option anytime soon3 the commercial mobile wireless cellphone wifi and wimax technologies still require significan t further technical developments before they will be able to provide comparable service and operate at the necessary scale moreover spectrum is just being made available for these technologies nd in many cases parties currently using that spectrum must be moved to other spectrum the new broadband networks are ab to deliver potentially highly valued services such as voice ove r internet protocol voip and video over internet protocol ip video that are qualitatively different than most of the services that have been provided over the internet in the past where services such as email and website searches are not sensitive to lat ency the amount of time it takes packet of data to travel from source to destination these new services are sensitive to delays in the delivery of packets of bits due to congestion or other problems4 as result the traditional internethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs3 4 continued will grow and grow and eventually the router will run out of buffer memory at that point if one more packet shows up the router has c hoice but to discard packet it can discard the newly arriving packet or it can make room for the new packet by discarding something else but something has to be discarded the router will be programmed to determine which packets should be dropped thus creating sec ond packet prioritization scheme again this could be simple firstin firstout scheme or favorapplicationssensitivetodropped packets scheme or payforpriority scheme or something else dropped packets can be retransmitted but for those applications such as voice that require the packets to arrive and be reassembled within short period of time such packet recovery might not occur in the timely fashion needed to retain service quality with such congestion at least two problems may occur one problem is dropped packets some applications are more sensitive than others to dropped packets second problem is jitter caused by the delay of certain packets internet traffic is usually bur sty with periods of relatively low activity punctuated by occasional bursts of packets for example browsing the web generates little or traffic while reading the page but burst of traffic when the browser needs to fetch new page even if the router is progra mmed to minimize delay by only delaying low priority packets when congestion absolutely requi res such delay if the highpriority traffic is bursty then lowpriority traffic will usua lly move through the network with little delay but will experience noticeable delay whenever ther is burst of highpriority traffic this onagain offagain delay is called jitter jitter has affect when downloading big file for which ones concern is the average packet arrival rate rather than arrival time of particular packet but the quality of applica tions like voice conferencing or voip which rely on steady streaming of interactive rea ltime communication can suffer lot if there is jitter 5 for simplification of exposition this report will refer to those applications that are sensitive to dropped packets or to jitter or any other congestionrelated transmission problem as latencysensitive applicationsbest effort standard that does not guarantee that delays will not occur may be insufficient to meet customers service quality requirements for these new latencysensitive services5 m r intensive network management may be needed to meet these quality of service packet delivery requirements equipment is being deployed in the broadband networks that can identify both the source of individua l packets and the application to which individual packets are being put with this equipment network providers can give some pack ets higher priority than others which can ensure that specific quality of service requirements are being met but also could be abused to discriminate for or against particular applications or applications providers some new applications place very substantial bandwidth demands on the public internet and proprietary ip networks for example one industry analyst estimated that one particular appli cation bittorrent software that uses filesharing technology to download movies and other content accounted for as much as 30 of all internet traffic at the end of 2004 and that peertopeer p2p applications in generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs4 6 p2p in 2005 presentation by andrew pa rker cofounder and chief technology officer cachelogic in more

discussion below in the section entitled what do wireline broadband networks look like 9 customer churn is the number of custom ers who discontinue purchasing service from provider within period of

legitimate purposes and for the illegal downloading of copyrighted materials but has now been accepted by some mainstream content providers fo r example warner brothers has announced plans to make hundreds of movies and television shows available for purchase over the internet using bittorrent software7 other major industry players ch as microsoft and sony have introduced movie download servi ces that use p2p technology although the telephone and cable co mpanies are deploying different network architectures8 they are pursuing business plans and regulatory strategies with the same key elements they expect latencysensitive video and voice services to be the killer applications that will generate the revenues needed to justify upgrade and buildout of their physical broadband networks to minimize customer churn9 and to gain an advantage over providers of single services they market bundles of voice data and video services with discounts that are greater the greater the number of services purchased it is expected by many that this tripleplay bundle will be expanded to quadrupleplay bundle with the addition of mobile wireless service the set of services the telephone and cable companies plan to offer over their networks spite having interactive components follow the model of the customer being primarily recipient of information not transmitter of information therefore the broadband network architecture they all are deploying is asymmetric with significantly greater bandwidth available from th broadband provider to the customer than in the reverse directionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs5 10 in the matter of inquiry concerning highspe ed access to the internet over cable and other facilities internet over cable claratory ruling appropriate regulatory treatment for broadband access to the internet over cable facilities 17 fcc rcd 4798 4799 march 15 2002 in this decision the fcc concluded that the telecommunications functionality in cable modem service is integral to the service and not transparent to the consumer and therefore cable modem service should be treated as pure information service and not subject to the requirements imposed on telecommunications services under title ii of the communications act 47 usc 151 et seq 11 national cable telecommuni cations association v brand x internet services 125 sct 2688 2005 12 in the matter of appropriate framewor k for broadband access to the internet over wireline facilities report and order and notice of proposed rulemaking 20 fcc rcd 14853 september 23 2005 the fcc used the sa argument to support its dsl decision as it used in its cable modem decision t surprisingly the united power line council then petitioned the fcc to issue declaratory ruling that broadband over power lines is an information service akin to cable modem and dsl service in the matter of the petition of the united power line council for declar atory ruling regarding the classification of broadband over power line internet access service as an information service petition for declaratory ruling filed december 23 2005 av ailable at httpwwwuplcutcorgfile_ depot0100000000100007966conmanpetitionfo

2006the video and voice services they offer as well as other end toend services they plan to offer in the future require quality of service assurances that they claim are not available on the public internet but can be provided on their proprietary ip networks in order to assure the quality of service of their own offerings the broadband network providers all seek to manage bandwidth usage on their propr ietary broadband networks by reserving significant proportion of their network capacity for their own applications and by controlling the access that independent applications provi ders have to those networks through variety of means including charges for priority access the federal communications commission fcc or commission ruled in 2002 that cable modem service offered by cable companies despite having telecommunications component is an information service and therefore not subject to the common carrier regulations imposed on telecommunications services in title ii of the communications act10 the fcc decision was upheld by the supreme court in june 200511 subsequently the fcc ruled that dsl service offered by cable companies also is an information service12 as result neither cable modem service nor dsl service is subject to the interconnection nondiscrimination and access requirements of title iihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs6 13 for example at the november 10 2005 panel of academics at the peripheral visionaries voip communications policy mmit conference sponsored by pulvercom susan crawford of cardozo law school argued that it is unlikely to be possible to craft legislative language that broadband network providers could not get around in the name of network management and that instead the public policy focus should be on the real problem of lack of competitive alternatives to the cable and telephone networks 14 to further complicate the debate there is growing economic literature on twosided markets in which network provider has two di stinct sets of customers to whom it provides service and sets terms conditions and rates for network access end users who seek access to the network to receive services and applications services providers who seek access to the network in order to reach those nd users according to that literature while additional access networks will increase the comp etitive options available to end users they may not improve the market of independent pplications providers that do not have the option of choosing among access networks for the best deal but rather must connect to all of the access networks in order to reach their customers see for example jeancharles rochet and jean tirole platform competition in twosided markets journal of the european economic association june 2003 vol 1 issue 4 pp 9901029

rand journal of economics 2006 forthcoming independent applications providers have voiced concern that the broadband network providers could abuse that cont rol over network access to constrain or entirely exclude them from competing in the provision of applications thereby undermining their ability to bring innovativ applications to consumers some applications providers theref ore have proposed enactment of statutory and regulatory requirements such as nondiscriminatory access to broadband netw orks or network neutrality requirements othe rs have been less confiden t about the ability to craft effective nondiscrimination or neutra lity rules they have suggested that government policy that promotes entry by broadband network providers that do not share the business plans of the cable and telephone companies might be more effective way to foster innovation and inve stment in applications13 this might include prohibiting restrictions on municipal deployment of broadband networks expediting the availability of spectrum for wireless broadband networks and limiting the amount of such spectrum that can be acquired by companies owned by or in other ways affiliated with the wireline broadband providers current broadband network providers respond that given existing market forces they have neither the incentive nor the ability to constrain independent applications providers that constraining their ability to manage their networks would discourage their investment in broadband networks and that municipa l networks enjoy an unfair advantage in capital markets14 to date the debate has proceeded on an abstract level the purpose of this report is to provide more concrete discussion of access to wireline broadband networks to that end th is report provides discussi on of what broadband networks look like how both consumers and independe nt applications providers gain accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs7 to these networks and the parameters ava ilable to network providers such as their choices about network architecture overa ll bandwidth capacity bandwidth reserved for their own use traffic prioritizati on the terms and rates for access to their networks and for their retail services th at can affect end users and independent applications providers access to those networks what do wireline broadband networks look like the cable and telephone comp anies networks are not static they continue to be upgraded the various network providers are in different stages of deploying digital ip technology they are each employing unique network architectures that build off their legacy networks andor reflect their perceptions of the most cost effective networks to deploy despite these differences however each of the networks has three primary components as shown in figure 1 schematic representation of wireline ip broadband network these three components are the broadband last mile grid out to enduser customers the companys proprietary ip network with servers for the various appli cations feeding into service router that controls the flow of traffic all the way to the customer premise and the companys facilities in what has traditionally been called the internet backbone and is sometimes referred to as the public internet the tter connects to independent applications providers though it is also possible for independent applications providers to connect directly to br oadband network provid ers proprietary ip network as shown in figure 1 many independent appli cations providers also have substantial internet facilities for example in order to minimize the number of times their content must be handed off from one internet backbone provider to another when responding to an enduser query these applications providers cache their content close to their customers by main taining multiple server s scattered around the country in which they maintain frequently updated databases since it is possible that congestion could cause delay at any of those handoff points caching data at multiple servers reduces the risk of service degradation the schematic representation in figure 1 may help elucidate number of policyrelated discussions for example it may help discussants visualize where and how end users and independent applications providers gain access to the broadband network where and how congestion occurs that threatens the quality of latency sensitive services and how network provi ders capacity architect ure prioritization and service offering decisi ons could affect independent applications providershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496 crs8 source crs from multiple sources figure 1 schematic representation of wireline ip broadband networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs9 15 att has indicated that as it builds out its lightspeed network it may serve those customers in new housing developments under c onstruction by deploying optical fiber all the way to their premises these may repr esent as many as 5 of att customers 16 the actual amount of bandwidth provided by fiber fibercopper or hfc will depend on number of factors including how much of the optical fiber is lit by electronics and the type of modems usedthe broadband last mile wireline broadband netw ork provider can choose among various network architectures for its last mile grid telephone company can choose to deploy optical fiber from its end office switch all the way to the home or to the curb or to neighborhood node if it brings the fiber to the curb or to node it can then complete the connection to the customer premise by attaching digital subscriber line dsl modems to the existing copper line r unning into the premise for example verizons fios service deploys optical fiber all the way to the customer premise while atts project lightspeed depl oys fiber to neighborhood node and then uses existing copper lines and dsl modems to reach the customer15 cable companies most often use hybrid fibercoa xial cable hfc technology deploying optical fiber from the cable companys head end facility to node and using coaxial cable from the node to the enduser premis the fiber to th home architecture is much more costly to deploy but can provi substantially more bandwidth than can be provided over fiberdsl or hfc last mile16 and can have its bandwidth expanded more cheaply and easily as demand grows if broadband network provider intends to offer multiple channel video service it can choose between an archit ecture that broadcas ts the signals of all the channels to the enduser premise the cable company and verizon approach and an architecture that transmits to the end user only the particular video channel selected by the customer using her ip settop box the callup approach used by att the broadcast approach requires more bandwidth network providers have di scretion over several other network parameters for example both the telephone and the cable companies have chosen to deploy asymmetric broadband networks that have far more bandwidth for the download of information to enduser customer premises than for the upload of information from end users this architecture favors the velopment of applications that are oneto many or clientserver in desi gn applications that woul d require enduser customers to deliver content as quickly as they r eceive it are limited by as ymmetric bandwidth asymmetric network architecture supports the cable and telephone companies triple play business plans which focus on end user s as receivers rather than transmitters of information this is almost certainly consistent with current demands of most customers if customer demand were to move toward appli cations and services requiring more symmetric downloading and uploading capability perhaps as result of heightened popularity for interac tive games or peertopeer distribution of videos and other files the current asy mmetric architecture might constrain the growth of these applications but it also might create market forces for entry of third broadband provider with more symmetric network or for the incumbents to modify their networks to meet the new demandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs10 17 verizons videoondemand service is provided separately from the rest of its multi channel video service offering because videoondemand requires communication between the end user and the videoondemand server in verizons proprietary ip network to call up the specific program from the thousands of programs available whereas the multichannel video service simply broadcasts all the channels in the service to the enduser premise with need for prior communication from the end user 18 these were the service options listed on verizons website on december 13 2006 for those residential households located in fairfax county va for which verizons fios service was available the pricing of these options is discussed below in the section entitled how might strategic broadband network pr ovider behavior harm consumersa network provider can make other deci sions about its last mile network that will affect the bandwidth available to end users whether its last mile architecture is all fiber fiber and copper or fibe r and coaxial cable it can choose to deploy electronics that determine the bandwidth capacity of the line into the enduser premise in addition it can partition the ba ndwidth capacity of the line into the end user premise reserving some portion or portions of the total bandwidth for specific applications for example provider mig ht reserve portion of the bandwidth for its own applications or for those of an independent applicati ons provider that pays for priority access to the end user each network provider can make its own decisions about these technical parameters subject to market constraints though currently not subject to regulatory constraints for example verizons fi bertothehome last mile architecture could potentially provide almost limitless bandwidth if all the fiber strands were lit but demand cannot justify the depl oyment of the electronics needed for such unlimited capacity as currently configured verizon s fios offering lights just three of the many fiber strands in the optical fiber that comes to the customer premise these lit strands are called lasers one of these lasers is reserved for the broadcast downloading of all the vide channels offered in veri zons video service the second laser brings 100 megabits per sec ond mbps of bandwidth into the customer premise for downloading packets of all other incoming traffic incoming web pages emails and other data received as part of internet access service incoming voice packets incoming videoondemand programming17 and incoming special services the third laser is used for uploading packets of all outgoing traffic associated with these internet access voice videoondemand and special virtual private network services verizon end user does not purchase or use the full 100 mbps of bandwidth in the download laser though that much ba ndwidth comes into her premise on that laser nor does she purchase or use all of the bandwidth in the upload laser rather she purchases specific services that use up to ceiling level of bandwidth in those lasers for example an end user can c hoose internet access service options with 5 15 or 30 mbps of downstream bandwidth and with 2 or 5 mbps of upstream bandwidth18 the end user also can purchas verizons video ondemand service andor verizons voice service and have these delivered over the download and upload lasers or she can purchase an inde pendent applications providers videoon demand andor voice services and have these delivered over the download and upload laser the remainder of the bandwidth on those lasers typically 70 mbps ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs11 bandwidth on the download laser and subs tantial bandwidth on the upload laser are available for special serv ices for that end user but the end user cannot directly purchase that bandwidth for its own use ra ther an independent applications provider that would like to offer special service to the end user would purchase the bandwidth from verizon and then recover its costs in its charges to the end user for the service provided over that bandwidth more specifically verizon would require the independent applications provider to purchase an endtoend connection from its location to the enduser premise verizon has characterized these as virtual private network vpnlike services that allow the independent applications provider to avoid congestion in the public internet and provide guaranteed quality of service this endtoend connection is shown in figure 1 by the link that goes directly from the independent applications provider to the service router in the broadband network providers pr oprietary ip cloud and then th rough the broadband last mile to the end user although this vpnlike serv ice shares the download and upload lasers with internet access and other services verizon is able to manage the traffic on the lasers to assure that the quality of service for that special service is not degraded by other traffic on those lasers and as will be discussed below the special service packets are accorded priority as they ar transmitted across servers and links within verizons proprietary ip netw ork special services that might be provided over such vpnlike link could range from home monito ring of medical patients by physicians to high definition video streaming with respect to the services that verizon itself offers over the three lasers currently video voice video ondemand and internet access services customers can choose to purchase one or more of the services discounts are provided for purchasing multiple services but fios customer who does not receive any special vpnlike services could not use the extra bandwidth on the download and upload lasers for its ow n purposes such as extra bandwidth for internet access nor could an end user who does not purchase verizons video service purchase the bandwidth on th video laser for other purposes att will be serving most of its project lightspeed enduser customers with its last mile network compri sed of fiber to the node nd dsl link to the customer premise the link can provide up to 25 mbps of bandwidth into the premise of that bandwidth 19 mbps currently are reserved for atts video service of the remaining 6 mbps of bandwidth the custom er can purchase 15 mbps service 3 mbps service or 6 mbps service for internet access and voice services atts proprietary ethernet ip network controls the bandwidth to each premise based on the level of bandwidth the end user has purchased at ts network is capable of reassigning some of the 19 mbps currently reserved fo r the proprietary video service to other uses it would be technically possible for customer to order additional bandwidth on demand for example 10 mbps of ba ndwidth for three hours for particular application this capability is called turbocharging but att is concerned that last mile congestion that harms service qua lity could occur if household attempted to use atts video service and also an in ternet application requiring more than 6 mbps of bandwidth at the same time therefore att does not currently offer turbocharge bandwidth ondemand service according to cablelabs the industry re search consortium th at has developed the data over cable service interface specifications docsis that define interface standards for cable modems and supporting equipment typically few hundred cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs12 19 see docsis project primer document prepared by the cablelabs

video servers are each shown in the diagram with only link to the service rout er but each of these applications servers will also have other links to the sources of voice data and video information transmitted for continuedenduser subscribers get internet access by sharing 6 megahertz mhz downstream channel from the cable network to the cust omer and one or mo re upstream channels from the customer to the cable network19 the downstream channel occupies the space of single television transmission channel in the cable operators channel lineup and can provide up to 40 mbps of bandwidth the cable modems that are most widely deployed in cable networ ks today which meet docsis 10 and 11 specifications allow upstream channels to deliver up to 10 mbps of bandwidth cable companies are now deploying cable modems that meet docsis 20 standards that allow upstream channels to deliver up to 30 mbps docsis 30 currently in the late stages of development will allow several downstream and several upstream channels to be bonded together to multiply the bandwidth delivered to each customer comcast has announced that it is rolling out free feature called powerboost that will give end users temporar turbocharge doubling speeds for many downloads20 comcast currently has one servi ce offering of 6 mbps downstream384 kbps upstream and second offering of 8 mbps downstream768 kbps upstream for internet access and voice service with th powerboost feature customers of these offerings would be able to enjoy dow nstream speed bursts of 12 and 16 mbps respectively the remainder of the bandwidth capacity of the hybrid fibercoaxial cable lines into their premises would tinue to be reserved for video channels comcast does not guarantee these speeds for its internet access service since many customers share single channel the actual speed available to an individual customer at any specific point in time will depe nd on the level of usage by neighboring customers who share the channel broadband network providers proprietary ip networks as shown in figure 1 independent applications providers can access broadband network either th rough the internet backbone or through direct connection to service router in the ne twork providers proprie tary ip network the broadband network providers are cons tructing proprietary ip networks that have the intelligence needed to manage overall traffic flow in their networks as well as the flow of traffic to individual end us ers typically the network providers are deploying these ip networks in each of the metropolitan areas in which they offer service as shown in figure 1 traffic will arrive at the service router from number of sources from the internet backbone di rectly from an inde pendent applications provider or from the network providers own video voice or data server21 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs13 21 continued example the video server will be connected by satellite terrestrial and broadcast connections to the sources of the video programming provided by the network provider similarly since lots of voice traffic conti nues to flow over the traditional public switched telephone network pstn there will continue to be traffic that comes from the pstn directly into the telephone companys end office in analog format but that traffic may then be digitized and routed by the telephone companys proprietary ip network 22 prioritization may play an important network management role as peertopeer p2p applications become more common one characte ristic of p2p networking is to distribute files as broadly through the network as possibl rather than mainta ining files at central servers so that files can be obtained quickly nd with less risk from failure at single mode many p2p applications are constructed to identify all the places where particular file is located identify which of those places are serv ed by significant uploading bandwidth and then obtain the file from those locations th applications tend to place burden on last mile networks and proprietary ip networks with large upload capacity but increasing bandwidth capacity at those locations where p2p applications are creating congestion only creates the feedback effect of making those locations even more attractive for p2p applications one solution that has been pr oposed by broadband network providers is for the network manager to be able to employ pr ioritization in fashion that slows down p2p packets in order to allow other traffic to fl ow at these p2pcreated congestion points and to discourage the cycle of increases in upload bandwidth intended to reduce congestion automatically attracting additional p2p traffic that creates new congestion this would help broadband providers manage their networks but it might diminish efficiencies of p2p networking such prioritization is inconsis tent with one of the fundamental principles articulated by most proponents of network ne utrality that all packets should be treated the same or that at the least all packets asso ciated with the same type of application should continuedservice router communicating with other tions of the proprie tary ip network is programmed to determine the route the inco ming traffic will take to reach the end user and to prioritize traffic in order to determine which packets may be delayed or dropped during periods of congestion th is task includes setting the priority algorithm employed at the router to dete rmine which packets are delayed or dropped when congestion occurs it is possible that prioritization algorithm could reserve certain links for particular prioritized packets such that even if there is bandwidth available on those links for nonprioritized packets such nonprioritized packets cannot be transmitted over those links for example as discussed earlier verizon has indicated that as part of its fios serv ice customer can purchase path or laser that would be dedicated to delivery of vpntype endtoend service such as medical monitoring service verizon has not clarified whether some of the links or at least some partitioned portion of the bandwidth in those links would be entirely reserved for such vpn service denying any other packets access to that bandwidth or if the packets associated with the vpn service simply would be given the highest priority at the service router with the bandwidth in those links used for lower priority packets when there are vpn packets the proprietary ip network also manages and controls the traffic flow through the broadband last mile to the end user it has the intelligence to among other things partition the last mile make available to the end user only the bandwidth purchased by that end user slow down traffic that may be moving too fast for the bandwidth capability of the last mile and prioritize traffic moving onto the last mile22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs14 22 continued be treated the same 23 not every proprietary ip network will necessarily have these capabi lities but announcements by the various broadband network providers suggest that such capabilities are technically possible 24 see for example richard s whitt horizontal leap forward formulating new communications public policy framewor k based on the network layers model 56 federal communications law journal 587 2004 25 see louis trager isps accuse veriz on of doublecross on fios wholesaling communications daily november 3 2005 26 untitled article communications daily november 8 2005 at p 8 embedded in the proprietary ip network also is the capability to temporarily turbocharge end user lines to accommodate bandwidthintensive applications or to allow for flexible partitioning of the last mile so that bandwidth that is normally partitioned and reserved for specific us might be made available to accommodate different use23 these proprietary ip networks consis t of physical transmission network layer logical layer usually the transmission control protocolinternet protocol suite of protocols often referred to as tcpip which itself consists of several layers an applications layer and content layer24 it is technically possible for an independent applications provider to gain access to broadband network at various layers with that provider providing more or less of its own intelligence depending on the layer at which access occurs some independent applications providers have alleged that they have been denied access at layer that would allow them to use their own ip capabilities to differentiate th eir products from those of the network provider for example to offer unique filtering services that might be desired by families who want more restrictive program filters than those offered by the broadband network or to offer robustly secure internet service w ith special intrusion detectors capable of stopping dos attacks that the broadba nd network provider might not offer25 these independent providers claim that instead they were given access only in fashion that would allow them to resell verizon s fios product offering verizon responds that with the advent of its video service it had to direct data associated with the video service separately from data associated with info rmation service provider isp service and this required change in the way it provided independent isps access to its network26 the independent isps question whether such change was really needed to upgrade the network or whethe r it was strategic decision that undermines their ability to differentiate their applications from verizons the internet backbone as explained in footnote 4 the internet largely consists of number of routers with links leading into and out of those r outers traditionally traffic has traversed the internet based on best effort standard in which packets are not prioritized although routers do need some basis for termining which packets to delay or to drop during periods of congestionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs15 the two largest telephone companies att and verizon are among the largest providers of internet backbone facilities other companie s with substantial internet backbone companies include sprintnex tel level3 and qwest the cable companies have very limited in ternet backbone facilities there is some question as to whether the telephone companies consider their internet backbone fac ilities to be part of their propr ietary networks in which they would program their routers to prioritize packets referring again to figure 1 att and verizon have made it clear that they intend to program the service routers in their proprietary ip networks to prioritize incoming packets but att and verizon own routers and links in the inte rnet backbone as well and they have not clarified whether they intend to program those routers to prioritize packets too this distinction could ve important public policy implications if the telephone companies were to in effect extend their proprie tary ip network into the traditional internet backbone by programming prioritization into their routers in the internet backbone then if and when c ongestion occurred at any of the telephone companies internet backbone routers nonprioritized packets might be delayed or even dropped if it were possible and rela tively inexpensive to identify the telephone companies as the source of these delayed or dropped packets and to route traffic away from those prioritizing routers nontele phone company internet backbone providers might be able to expand their capacity and attract customers and traffic away from the telephone companies intern et backbone facilities but these efforts if doable would not be costless so independent pplications providers and their customers could well be harmed by degraded service it also is possible that the cable companies to the extent they use the public internet to offer their applications could be harmed since they do not have their own internet backbone facilities if on the other hand the telephone comp anies only prioritized packets once those packets were at the service routers in the tele phone companies private ip networks then such prioritization is unlik ely to degrade the quality of service within the internet backbone itself even if th telephone companies chose to focus their investments on their proprieta ry networks and chose not to upgrade their internet backbone facilities as long as there tinued to be demand fo r transport over the public internet then the ma ny nontelephone comp any providers of internet backbone facilities would still have the incentive to expand and upgrade their internet backbone facilities parameters available to broadband network providers that can affect end users and independent applications providers access to these networks broadband network providers have many parameters within their control that can affect end users and independent applications providers access to these networks these includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs16 the choice of the lastmile network architecture fiber to the home fiber to the curb or node hybrid fiberdsl or hybrid fibercoaxial cable the choice between broadband lastmile architecture that transmits all the multiple channel video signals all the way to the enduser premise and callup architecture that only transmits to the enduser premise the particular video channel selected by the customer at the settop box the choice between more or less symmetry in the network in terms of bandwidth capacity for an end user to download receive file transmitted over the network vs bandwidth capacity to upload send file transmitted over the network the choice between deploying ne twork with very great bandwidth and limited ability to manage traffi c congestion presumably because the bandwidth will be sufficien t to minimize congestion and deploying network with less bandwidth but greater need and ability to manage traffic through prioritization and other capabilities the choice of electronics deployed in the network to turn potential bandwidth capacity into actual available capacity this includes choices about both the op tical fiber strands lasers to light and the capability and number of cable or dsl modems deployed the choice of whether and how to partition the bandwidth in both the lastmile connections nd the links in the proprietary ip network this includes choices about how much bandwidth to partition for particular prioritized uses what those prioritized uses are and whether the partitioning is flexible ie able to be changed when actual usage patterns result in unus ed bandwidth in partitioned portion of link reserved for prioritized packets while congestion is creating delay or ot her latency problem for the nonprioritized packets using the nonpartiti oned portion of the link the choice of where and how to prioritize packets this includes choices about whether to prio ritize packets only within the broadband network providers pr oprietary broa dband network or also at routers in the internet backbone what basis to use for delaying individual packets when th ere is congestion and what basis to use for dropping individual pack ets when routers memory is full the choice of what to include in specific service offerings and the prices for those serv ice offerings this involves both service offerings to end users and rvice offerings to independent applications providers it include s choices about how many services to bundle together whether to make services available only as part of bundle whether to offer differe nt bandwidth options what thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs17 bandwidth options are what the pr ices are for each service offering and option whether to charge end users or independe nt applications providers for bandwidth the price to end users ndor independent applications providers for bandwidth relative to the price of the network providers enduser service offerings any usage restrictions in the service offerings for either end users or independent applications providers the tier or level in the ip network at which independent applications providers gain access the extent to which an independent applications provider can employ its own ip capability as well as the ip capa bility in the broadband network to offer service and the quality of service guarantees in service offerings for independent applications providers these parameters are interactive for example the greater the bandwidth capacity of the network the less the need for partitioning or prioritizing traffic or for imposing any use restrictions the specific choices that broadband ne twork providers make about these parameters will be driven by several forces the relative costs of the network architecture options the actual and perceived demand for and price sensitivity of the various service offerings the actual and potential competition for the provision of both broadband network services and applications statutory or regulatory constraints if any and to the extent the network providers enjoy some degree of market power strategic considerations how might strategic broadband network provider behavior harm consumers generally broadband network providers will not want to take actions that restrict the availability or quality of applications that end users can obtain over their networks such restrictiv behavior would reduce ove rall demand for the broadband network and also increase incentives for competitive entry at the same time to the extent that the broadband network providers seek to maximize their revenues for what they perceive as the killer broadband applications voice and video service today perhaps interactive games or other applications in the future they will have an incentive to build operate and manage their broadband network in fashion that favors their own applications over competitors applications with only limited alternatives to the cable and telephone broadba nd duopoly for the foreseeable future and with the cable and tele phone companies both pursuing largely the same business plan the broadband providers might have both the incentive and the ability to exploit their control over access to end users to restrict competition and the innovation it might bring and harm consumers this strategic behavior could occur in several ways given its control over the bandwidth capacity of its network and the partitioning of that bandwidth if the ne twork provider were to reserv substantial portion of the bandwidth in the lastmile network as we ll as in the links of its proprietary ip network for its own latencysensitive services in order to assure particular qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs18 27 but this does highlight how partitioning places constraints on the end users ability to receive multiple hdtv programs simultaneously from one or more independent applications providers even if that end us er has purchased bundled service offering with total bandwidth capable of providing multiple hdtv programs simultaneously 28 these were the service and price options listed on verizons website on december 13 2006 for those residential households located in fairfax county va for which verizons continuedof service for those services that might leave too little bandwidth available for independent applications to assure an equal quality of service for those independent applications or there might not be sufficient bandwidth available for multiple independent applications provi ders to simultaneously serve single premise or for the provision of certain bandwidthint ensive applicati ons from independent providers for example streaming high defin ition television hdtv channel currently requires approximately 20 mbps of bandw idth though advances in compression technology are likely to reduce the required ba ndwidth to 10 mbps in the near future if broadband network provide r reserved most of the bandwidth into customers premise for its own video service leaving at most 6 mbps available for the internet access needed to receive independent pplications competitive provision of hdtv would be curtailed this might or might not represent anticompetitive strategic behavior if the broadband provider has deployed fiber to the home bringing 100 mbps to the end user premise and then limits its internet access service offering to 6 mbps while providing multiple hdtv channels over its own video service this might suggest an anticompetitive strategic partitioning decision on the other hand if the broadband provider has deployed fi berdsl hybrid network that only brings 25 mbps to the premise and its own partitioned video service does not offer hdtv capability or only limited hdtv capability then if its internet access service is only 6 mbps this might reflect network limitations rather than or as well as strategic behavior in either situation however if it were techni cally and economically feasible to partition the bandwidth flexibly so customer could use 10 mbps of the bandwidth coming to its premise for either the broadband networks hdtv service offering or an independe nt application providers hdtv service offering the consumer is likely to enjoy greater choice in applications but even this result is not unambiguous in household with multiple high definition television sets if that household were simultaneous ly streaming multiple hdtv programs from both the network provider and from an independent provider flexible partitioning might allow all the programs to be viewed but not be able to ensure the maintenance of hdtv quality for either program27 given that the broadband network providers are pr oviders of both end user services and input network access rvices required by their independent applications competitors they may have the opportunity to set prices for their network access and applications services in strategic fashion consider for example the prices that verizon currently charges its fios customers for internet access verizon offers three options up to 5 mbps download speed and 2 mbps upstream speed for 3495 up to 15 mbps download and 2 mbps upload for 4995 and up to 30 mbps download and 5 mbps upload for 1799528 there are severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs19 28 continued fios service was available possible explanations for the huge jump in price for the 30 mbps service one explanation might be that verizon would ve to incur substantial costs increasing the capacity of its last mile network and perhaps its proprietary ip network to handle those bandwidthintensive appli cations that would require 30 mbps of download bandwidth in this case the high price would accurately reflect actual underlying costs second possible explan ation might be that the customers with such substantial bandwidth needs tend to be insensitive to price and thus will pay very high prices or are part of categor of customers such as business customers who have traditionally been charged higher rates then the high price would represent way to perform efficient price discrimination to recover fixed network costs third possible explanation might be that verizon faces potentially strong competition from independent applications providers for the provision of bandwidth intensive applications such as hdtv and by pricing the 30 mbps of internet access service needed for those rvices at 17995 while charging lower prices for its own hdtv or other bandwidthintensive pplications it could practice strategic behavior that places its competitors in an anticompetitive price squeeze more generally access to the bandwidth provided by broadband networks is necessary input into the provision of broadband applications the broadband providers have announced that they seek compensation for such broadband access in two ways in charges to end users fo r specific quantities of bandwidth access and in charges to independent applications providers for prioritized access to the broadband network intended to guarantee service quality typically comparable to the quality the broadband network providers provide themselves for their own applications for particul ar application if the differen ce between the price that the network provider charges end users for its own application service and the imputed cost of access to the broadband network th at it would have to pay if it were an independent applications provi der offering that applicati on that is the charges that the network provider imposes on end users and independent app lications providers for the bandwidth needed to offer that pplication is less than the nonbandwidth related costs for the network provider to offer that application then the network provider is placing the independent applications provider in price squeeze because even if that independent pr ovider were just as efficien t as the network provider it would be placed at competitive disadvant age simply due to the network providers pricing decisions this would allow the network provider to succeed in the applications market despite being less efficient provider legislative proposal in the 110th congress relating to access to broadband networks to date only one bill s 215 has been introduced in the 110th congress that has provisions relating to access to broadband networks under s 215 each broadband service provider would have the duty tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs20 enable any content application or service made available via the internet to be offered provided or posted on basis that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory in cluding with respect to quality of service access speed and bandwidth b is at least equivalent to the access speed quality of service and bandwidth that such broadband service provider offers to affiliated content applications or services made available via the public internet into the network of such broadband service provi der and c does not impose charge on the basis of the type of content applications or services made available via the internet in to the network of such broadband service provider only prioritize content applicati ons or services accessed by user that is made available via the internet within the network of such broadband service provider base d on the type of content applications or services and the level of service purchased by the user without charge for such prioritization and not install or utilize network feat ures functions or capabilities that impede or hinder compliance with this section s 215 is identical to bill s 2917 that had been introduced in the 109th congress for simplicity of presentation and to provide context and facilitate comparison of alternative proposals more detailed discussion of s 215 is presented in the next section of this report which compares the provisions of number of bills relating to access to broadband networks that had been introduced though none were enacted in the 109th congress since s 215 would im pose certain require ments on broadband access network providers that are gene rically known as network neutrality requirements the bill is discussed along with other legislative proposals with network neutrality requirements legislative proposals in the109th congress none of which were enacted relating to access to broadband networks in addition to s 2917 there were num ber of bills introduced in the 109th congress that included provisions relatin g to access to broadband networks none of these bills was enacted the fcc broadband policy statement hr 5252 which was passed by the full house would have explicitly authorized the fcc at sec 201 to enfo rce the broadband policy statement and the principles incorporated therein that th commission adopted as general principles on august 5 2005 these principles are consumers are entitled to access the wful internet content of their choice consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of theirchoice subject to the needs of law enforcementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs21 consumers are entitled to connect th eir choice of legal devices that do not harm the network consumers are entitled to competition among network providersapplication and service provi ders and content providers hr 5252 would have explicitly prohibite d the fcc from adopting or implementing rules or regulations regarding enforcement of the broadband policy statement except to adopt procedures for the adjudication of complaints these principles are quite general and susceptible to alternative interpretations they would prohibit broadband networ k provider from entirely blocking particular application such as comp etitors voip service they would not explicitly prohibit broadband network provider from prioritizing packets or reserving significant portions of bandwidth for its own applications or for the applications of preferred independent provider even if such behavior harmed the quality of service of one or more independent applications providers or effectively precluded independent appli cations providers from the market nor would they explicitly prohibit broadband network provider from setting charges for network access in fashion that would place inde pendent applications providers in an anticompetitive price squeeze arguably the fourth principle consumer entitlement to competition among application and service providers could be the basis for complaint against such behavi or standards we re provided however for determining what level of competition consumer is entitled to for example the fcc might view the duopoly provision of applications by the telephone and cable companies as providing sufficient competition to meet this principle even if independent applications pr oviders were harmed or ev excluded from the market by the behavior internet consumer bill of rights the internet consumer bill of rights incorporated in section 903 of hr 5252 as amended by the senate commerce committee originally introduced as s 2686 would have required each internet servi ce provider to allow each subscriber to access and post any lawful content of that subscribers choosing access any web page of that subscribers choosing access and run any voice application software or service of that subscribers choosing access and run any video applicati on software or service of that subscribers choosing access and run any search engine of that subscribers choosing access and run any other applicati on software or service of that subscribers choosing connect any legal device of that s ubscribers choosing to the internet access equipment of that subscriber if such device does not harm the network of the internet service provider and receive clear and conspicuous info rmation in plain language about the estimated speeds capabilities limitations and pr icing of any internet service offered to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs22 this bill of rights addresse s only consumer access to thos applications services or devices that independent provi ders are able to offer if as result of network providers prioritization pa rtitioning andor pricing decisions an independent applications provider were not able to offer an application or could only offer an application that is inferior in quality or higher in price than the competing service offered by the broadband netw ork provider the independe nt applications provider would have recourse the consumer would not have been denied access to an offered application arguably under the internet consumer bill of rights consumer who because of partitioning c ould not purchase sufficient bandwidth to support the bandwidthintensive offering of an independent applications provider but could purchase from her broadband netw ork provider competing bandwidth intensive service offering could bring complaint that she has been denied access to an application of her choosing bu t unlike the fcc principles the internet consumer bill of rights does not include consumer right to competitive options and thus would not address anticompetitive behavior or unfair practices on the part of broadband network provider network neutrality network neutrality has been buzzphrase in the ongoing debates though there is not single agreedupon definition of network neutrality i ndeed there continue to be questions about what constitutes n eutrality and to which networks such neutrality would apply for most proponent s network neutrality requires all packets to be treated the same way or at the least all packets providing particular application such as voice or video to be treated the same way some proponents who would allow for prioritization among applications nonethel ess would not allow broadband network provide rs to charge independent pplications providers for such prioritization netw ork neutrality proposals include provisions relating to consumer access similar to those found in the fcc prin ciples and internet bill of rights but in addition have provisions relating to nondiscrimin atory or neutral access to broadband networks or the in ternet by independent app lications providers three such proposals were incorporated in legislation introduced in the 109th congress the network neutrality act of 2006 hr 5273 the inte rnet nondiscrimination act of 2006 s 2360 and the internet fr eedom preservation act s 2917 s 2917 was reintroduced in the 110th congress as s 215 under hr 5273 each broadband network provider would have had the duty to offer upon reasonable request to any person broadband service for use by such person to offer or access unaff iliated content applications and services not discriminate in favor of itself in the allocation use or quality of broadband services or interc onnection with other broadband networks offer service such that content applications or service providers can offer unaffiliated content applications or services in manner that is at least equal in the speed and quality of service that the operators content applications or service is accessed and offeredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs23 and without interference or surcharg on the basis of such content applications or services if the broadband network provider prioritizes or offers enhancedquality of service to data of pa rticular type prioritize or offer enhanced quality of service to all data of that type regardless of the origin of such data without imposing surcharge or other consideration for such prioritization or quality of service and not install network features functions or capabilities that thwart orfrustrate compliance with the requirements of objectives of this section under s 2360 network operator would have had the duty to not discriminate in favor of itself or any other person including any affiliate or company with which such operator has business relationship in allocating bandwidth and b transmitting content or applications or services to or from subscriber in the provision of communications not assess charge to any applica tion or service provider not on the network of such operator for the livery of traffic to any subscriber to the

network operator is accessed and offered without in terference or surcharges treat all data traveling over or on communications in nondiscriminatory way offer just reasonable and nondisc riminatory rates terms and conditions on the offering or provi sion of any service by another person using the transmission co mponent of communications and provide nondiscriminator access and service to each subscriber under s 2917 s 215 in the 110th congress each broadband service provider would have the duty to enable any content application or service made available via the internet to be offered provided or posted on basis that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory in cluding with respect to quality of service access speed and bandwidth b is at least equivalent to the access speed quality of service and bandwidth that such broadband service provider offers to affiliated content applications or services made available via the public internet into the network of such broadband service provi der and c does not impose charge on the basis of the type of content applications or services made available via the internet in to the network of such broadband service provider only prioritize content applicati ons or services accessed by user that is made available via the internet within the network of such broadband service provider ba sed on the type of contenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs24 29 that appears to be the implication of th requirement that network operator shall not discriminate in favor of itself or any other person including any affiliate or company with which such operator has business re lationship in allocating bandwidthapplications or services and the level of service purchased by the user without charge for such prioritization and not install or utilize network feat ures functions or capabilities that impede or hinder compliance with this section these three network neutrality proposals had similarities nd differences s 2360 appeared to be the most restrictive it would have prohibited network provider from prioritizing traffic thus the service router could not be programmed to favor the packets of latencysensitive applications such as voice or video service the proposal also would have prohibite d network provider from charging an independent applications provi der for the delivery of traffic all such charges would have to be imposed directly on end users it also appeared to prohibit network provider from reserving bandwidth fo r its own or any other providers applications29 referring to figure 1 under s 2360 an independent applications provider could still choose to purchase direct connection to the service router in the network providers propr ietary ip network rather than routing its traffic through the internet backbone but at that service rout er all packets would ve to be given the exact same priority whatever the particular type of service that packet was providing and whether that packet was carrying bits from the network providers own application bits from the application of an independent appli cations provider that had direct connection to the service r outer or bits from the application of an independent service provider that had transmitted those bits through the internet backbone in addition neither the links transmitting the packets from the service router to the broadband providers end offi ceheadend nor the last mile connection to the enduser premise could be partitioned in fashion that would favor the broadband networks applications for example by limiting the amount of bandwidth available for independent applications in way that would not ensure the same quality of service for independent pplications and the broadba nd providers applications hr 5273 and s 2917 s 215 in the 110th congress appeared to be less restrictive they would have allowed the network provider to pr ioritize traffic under hr 5273 prioritization could ta ke the form of offering enhanced quality of service to data of particular type under s 2917 s 215 in the 110th congress prioritization could be based on the type of content applications or services and the level of service purchased by the user but all traffic for given application would have to be assigned the same priority and there could be surcharge imposed for prioritization referring to figure 1 an independent applications provider could still choose to purchase direct connection to th service router in the network providers proprietary ip network rather than routing its traffic through the internet backbone at that service router prioritization could occur to reduce the risk of delay in packets for latencysensitive applications but all packets with bits for particular type of service for example video rvice would have to be gi ven the exact same priority whether those packets were carrying bits from the network providers own video service bits from the video service of an independent applicati ons provider that had direct connection to the service router or bits from the video service of anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs25 independent applications provider that had transmitted those bits through the internet backbone like s 2360 under hr 5273 neith er the links transmitting the packets from the service router to the broadband providers end officeheadend nor the last mile connection to the enduser premise could be partitione d in fashion that would favor the broadband network s applications for example by limiting the amount of bandwidth available for indepe ndent applications in way that would not ensure the same quality of service for independent applications and the broadband providers applications depending on interpretation of the bills language this might or might not be the case under s 2917 s 215 in the 110th congress the current network configurations nd service offerings of verizon att and comcast would not appear to meet the requirements in s 2360 and hr 5273 because they all reserve significant bandwidth for their own video services and do not appear to make an equal amount of ba ndwidth available for other applications providers also to the extent that thes broadband networks incorporate partitioning and prioritization and charge accordingly they do not conform w ith all the network neutrality requirements but partitioning and prioritization need not have discriminatory or anticompetitive consequences for example the current fios offering which brings 100 mbps of bandwidth to customer pre mise on download laser and offers up to 30 mbps of that bandwidth for downloading any service appears to make available enough bandwidth for independent applications providers to be able to compete with verizons applications in the provision of even bandwidthintensive applications it is not clear how the network neutrality conditions in any of these bills would have addressed price squeeze on one hand the prohibition on surcharges for prioritization or for network access would appear to constr ain the ability of network provider to use charges imposed on independe nt applications providers to create price squeeze on the other hand there doe s not appear to be any constraint on the price that end users could be charged for internet access and if the price of the network providers applications did not c over the imputed cost of such access plus the other costs of offering the servi ce the network provider could create an anticompetitive price squeeze s 2917 s 215 in the 110th congress appeared to ve an additional point of departure that might have resulted in virt ually restrictions on broadband providers the duties of broadband service providers outlined in sections 12a4 and 5 applied to service made available via the internet without further delineation but there may be differences of opinion about wh ich services are offe red via the internet consider for example the vpnlike services available as part of verizons fios offering discussed earlier those serv ices would be provi ded by independent applications providers that would purchas the bandwidth from verizon in order to have an endtoend connec tion with the end user th independent applications provider who purchases that bandwidth woul d be compensated by charging the end user for the service provided this endtoend connection is shown in figure 1 by the link that goes directly from the indepe ndent applications pr ovider to the service router in the broadband networ k providers proprietary ip cloud and then through the broadband last mile to the end user arguably since the traffic transported over this vpn service never touches th public internet but rather goes from an independenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33496crs26 applications provider directly to verizons proprietary ip network over private line connection it is not service made available via the internet with that interpretation services offe red over this vpn path would not be subject to the nondiscrimination provisions re lating to prioritization pa rtitioning and charges in sections 12a4 and 5 perhaps more significantly as shown in figure 1 the broadband network providers video services do not use the public internet they receive satellite terrestrial or broadcast feeds into their video server and then route those signals through the service router in their proprieta ry ip networks and then through their last mile networks to subscribers the nondi scriminatory bandwidth and prioritization provisions in section 12a4 and 5 theref ore might not have pplied to the network providers video services or any other app lications that were not delivered through the public internet antitrust and unfair methods of competition laws in the 109th congress several b ills were introduced to have allegations of anticompetitive broadband network access behavior scrutin ized through application of existing or modified antitrust and competition laws rather than regulatory rules the internet freedom and nondiscr imination act of 2006 hr 5417 which was to be reported out of the house judiciary committee would have amended the clayton act by inserting new secti on 28 making it unlawful for any broadband network provider to fail to provide its broadband network services on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions such that any person can offer or provide content applica tions or services to or over the network in manner that is at least equal to the manner in which the provider or its affiliates offer content applications and services free of any surcharge on the basis of th content application or service to refuse to interconnect its facilities with the facilities of another provider of broadband network services on reasonable and nondiscriminatory term s and conditions to block to impair to discriminate against or to interfere with the ability of any person to use br oadband network service to access to use to send to receive or to ffer lawful content applications or services over the internet to impose an additional charge to avoid any conduct that is prohibited by this subsection to prohibit user from attaching or using device on the providers network that does not physically dama ge or materially degrade other users utilization of the network or to fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose to users in plain language accurate information cerning any terms conditions or limitations on the broadband network service in addition under hr 5417 if

data without imposing surcharge or other consideration for such prioritization or enhanced quality of service since enforcement of the clayton act is solely within the jurisdiction of either the federal trade commission ftc or the antitrust division of the department of justice doj the general thrust of hr 5417 was to implement the network neutrality provisions in hr 5273 but to move enforcement responsibility from the fcc to the antitrust agencies which specialize in competition analysis and in the case of the ftc consumer protection analysis the ftc has indicated that it believes it already possesses sufficient authority to adequately address the competition and consumer protection issues of concern to network neutrality proponents30 but any new legislation should cl early preserve the ftcs existing authority over activities curren tly within its jurisdiction31 hr 5417 also would have had the effect of creating private right of action by aggrieved applications providers although hr 5417 contained explicit language to that effect sec tion 4a of the clayton act32 authorizes trebledamage suits in appropriate district courts by any person who sha ll be injured

digital age communications act daca project of the pr ogress and freedom foundation33 would have replaced the current regulatory framework with framework based on the federal trade commission act 15

except that the fcc could have declared an act or practice unlawful if the fcc determines based on showing of clear and convincing evidence presented in rulemaking proceeding that i marketplace compe

selves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to c onsumers or to competition the fcc would have had authority to hear complaints from any party injured by violation of the prohi bitions established and to award damages to such injured party if the fcc determined that violation had occurred although these provisions lacked specificity as to what types of behavior would have represented unfair methods of compe tition or unfair or deceptive practices and in particular did not provide any specific ity about discriminatory practices they did potentially provide procedure for indepe ndent applications providers to file complaints about the terms conditions nd prices under which they had access to broadband providers network the effectiv eness of such complaint procedure however would depend on the standard used in determining whether particular act or practice represente d legal violation on may 10 2006 in response to questions after his keynote speech at an american enterprise institute conference on key issues in telecommunications policy alfred kahn who was daca project advisory committee member commented on the daca proposal incorporated in s 211334 he stated that he agreed with the overall framework but that he believed the proposed standard for finding violation was set too high he ggested the standard for finding of unfair methods of competition or unfair competitiv practices should be based solely on demonstrated harm to consumers he voiced concern with the methodology frequently employed in antitrust analysis today that assumes that intervention is needed if it can be shown that each 1 loss in consumer surplus is matched by 1 gain in producer surplus he argued that unfair practices laws are intended to protect consumers even if there might be some negative impact on producer efficiency he therefore would want unfair methods of competition to be close to per illegal
