of the explosion power of the nagasaki plutonium atomic bomb1 us intelligence agencies estimated that north korea has about 50 kilograms of nuclear weapons grade plutonium that it extracted from its operating five megawatt nuclear reactor at yongbyon using six kilograms per weapon this would be enough for six to eight atomic bombs2 on june 26 2008 the north korean government and the bush administration took measures to implement nuclear agreement that they originally negotiated throughout 2007 first in the form of six party accord of february 2007 and then in another six party accord of october 2007 the details were finalized in april 2008 at meeting of the chief us and north korean negotiators in singapore the agreement consists of two obligations each for north korea and the united states to fulfill north korea is to allow process of disablement of its plutonium nuclear facilities at yongbyon between early 2003 and the summer of 2007 the yongbyon facilities produced weapons grade plutonium which north korea reportedly used to produce number of atomic bombs the disablement process began in october 2007 the bush administration claims that 8 of 11 components of the disablement process have been completed and that close to 50 of nuclear fuel rods in the yongbyon nuclear reactor have been removed3 administration officials have stated that disablement of the yongbyon installations would be extensive enough so that it would take north korea about year to restart them 4 north koreas second obligation is to provide the united states and other members of the six party talks with complete and correct declaration of nuclear programs the declaration reportedly includes statement that north koreas stockpile of plutonium amounts to 37 kilograms however other components of north koreas plutonium program reportedly are omitted from the declaration these include the number of atomic bombs north korea possesses and information about the facilities where north korea produces and tests atomic bombs the declaration also reportedly contains information about north koreas highly enriched uranium program or north koreas reported nuclear collaboration activities with iran and syria according to bush administration officials the uranium enrichment and syria issues are addressed in confidential minute 5 they have said nothing about iran however in the confidential minute north korea reportedly does not admit to uranium enrichment or proliferation activities with syria it merely acknowledges us concerns that north korea has engaged in these activities in the past6 the two us obligations under the agreement are to remove north korea from the sanctions provisions of the us trading with the enemy act and from the us list of state sponsors

twoyear program negotiated in early 2006 to feed small children and young women is much more limited in scope moreover apparently influenced by north koreas nuclear and missile tests country donations to the wfp for north korea aid declined from 2006 to the present 20 however as north korea and the bush administration neared completion of their nuclear agreement in 2008 the bush administration committed 500000 tons of new food aid to north korea most of the food aid will go through the wfp the wfp announced in june 2008 that it had signed new agreement with north korea to expand its food aid program based on the us contribution and that north korea had agreed to allow the wfp to expand its mechanisms to monitor the distribution of food21 from 1995 through 2004 the united states

monitors access to the food distribution system but it professes that most of its food aid reaches needy people several private aid groups however withdrew from rth korea because of such restrictions and suspicions that the north korean regime was diverting food aid to the military or the communist elite living mainly in the capital of pyongyang in march 2008 the united nations human rights monitor for north korea criticized the great disparity between access by the elite to food and the rest of the population on march 20 2008 the south korean newspaper chosun ilbo published photographs taken by the south korean military on the demilitarized zone dmz showing north korean soldiers on the other side of the dmz loading rice sacks with the south korean red cross symbol aboard military trucks and moving rice sacks to military posts the chosun ilbo report claimed that since 2003 the south korean military had seen the north korean military divert more than 400 sacks of apparent south korean rice over ten occasions to soldiers in frontline units 23 some experts also believe that north korean officials divert some food aid for sale on the extensive black market the regime has spent little of several billion dollars in foreign exchange earnings since 1998 to import food or medicines the regime has not adopted agricultural reforms similar to those of fellow communist countries china and vietnam including dismantling of sovietstyle collective farms estimates of the number of north koreans who die of malnutrition or related causes range widely from 600000 to three million24

manchuria region began in the mid1990s as the result of the dire food situation in north korea generally china tacitly accepted the refugees so long as their presence was not highly visible china also allowed foreign private ngos including south korean ngos to provide aid to the refugees again so long as their activities were not highly visible china barred any official international aid presence in refugee areas including any role for the united nations high commission for refugees it instituted periodic crackdowns that included police sweeps of refugee populated areas rounding up of refugees and repatriation to north korea since early 2002 china allowed refugees who had gained asylum in foreign diplomatic missions to emigrate to south korea china tries to prevent any scenario that would lead to collapse of the pyongyang regime its longstanding ally chinese officials fear that too much visibility of the refugees and especially any presence could spark an escalation of th refugee outflow and lead to north korean regime crisis and possible collapse chinas crackdowns are sometimes reaction to increased visibility of the refugee issue chinas interests in buttressing north korea also have made china susceptible to north korean pressure to crack down on the refugees and return them reports since 2002 described steppedup security on both sides of the chinanorth korea border to

allows them entrance into south korea and it negotiated with china over how to deal with these refugees25 however south korea too opposes encouragement of refugee exodus from north korea groups that aid north korean refugees apparently operate an underground railroad that transports refugees through china into countries on chinas southern border including thailand vietnam laos and cambodia several hundred refugees at time reportedly are in these countries awaiting repatriation to south korea or other countries in early 2008 the number in thailand was estimated at about 1200 26 most observers including refugee and human rights groups believe that the bush administration gave the refugee issue low priority the administration requested that china allow assistance to the refugees but asserted that south korea should lead diplomatically with china it has not raised the issue in the six party talks the issue has been aired in congressional hearings the north korean human rights act pl 108333 passed by congress in october 2004 provided for the admittance of north korean refugees into the united states in early 2006 key members of congress criticized the bush administ ration for failing to implement this provision and the administration admitted the first group of six refugees assistant secretary of state christopher hill told the senate foreign relations committee on february 6 2008 that the united states had admitted 37 north korean refugees the refugee issue led to increased outside attentio n to human rights conditions in north korea reports assert that refugees forcibly returned from china have been imprisoned and tortured in an extensive apparatus of north korean concentration camps modeled after the gulag labor camp system in the soviet union under stalin 27 reports by amnesty international the us state department and most recently the us committee for human rights in north korea have described this system as holding up to 250000 people the united states and the european union have secured resolutions from the human rights commission expressing concern over human rights violations in north korea including concentration camps and forced labor the north korean human rights act requires the us executive branch adopt number of measures aimed at furthering human rights in north korea including financial support of nongovernmental human rights groups increased radio broadcasts into north korea sending of radios into north korea and demand for more effective monitoring of food aid however the bush administration has refrained from raising human rights with north korea in the six party nuclear talks assistant secretary of state christopher hill has said that the united states would normalize relations with north korea when north korea dismantles its nuclear programs but he also has stated that human rights will be on the agenda of normalization 28 for complete analysis of the refugee and human rights issues see crs

these policies under peace and prosperity policy which his government described as seeking reconciliation cooperation and the establishment of peace with north korea south korean officials also held that these policies will encourage positive internal change within north korea key principles of this conciliation policy were the extension of south korean economic and humanitarian aid to north korea the promotion of northsouth economic relations separating economic initiatives from political and military issues expectation of strict north korean reciprocity for south korean conciliation measures avoidance of south korean government public criticisms of north korea over military and human rights issues and settlement of security issues with north korea including the nuclear issue

on june 30 2007 the united states and south korea signed free trade agreement korus fta if approved the agreement would be the largest fta that south korea has signed to date and would be the second largest next to the north american free trade agreementnafta in which the united states participates south korea is the seventhlargest trading partner of the united states total trade in 2007 was close to 80 billion various studies conclude that the agreement would increase bilatera l trade and investment flows the proposed korus fta covers wide range of trade and investment issues and therefore could have wide economic implications for the united states and south korea it includes provisions for the elimination of tariffs on trade in most manufactured goods and partial liberalization of the services trade the agreement also includes provisions on number of sensitive issues such as autos agriculture and trade remedies on which agreement was reached only during the final hours of negotiations to enter into force the fta would need congressional approval in the form of implementation legislation the negotiations were conducted under the trade promotion authority also called fast track authority that congress granted the president under the bipartisan trade promotion act of 2002 pl 107210 the authority allows the president to enter into trade agreements that receive expedited congressional consideration with amendments and limited debate the white house has not indicated when it will send the draft implementing legislation to congress the trade promotion authority sets deadline for the president to do this there is vocal support for the korus fta in both the united states and south korea us supporters view passage as important to secure new opportunities for us business in the south korean market other supporters argue that the fta will strengthen the ussouth korean alliance as whole although other observers ca ution that the fta should be supported on the basis of economic benefits and not linked to the military alliance the south korean national assembly will have to ratify the fta and the assembly reportedly is divided closely in the united states auto nd steel manufacturers and their labor unions oppose the agreement on the grounds that it would reduce barriers to the import of south korean steel and automobiles and would not open the south korean market sufficiently for us autos the us agricultural community and some members of congress have withheld support for the fta because of south koreas restrictions on imports of us beef differences between the bush administration and the democratic leadership in congress and leading democratic presidential candidates have made congressional approval of the fta unlikely in

and south korean negotiators reached agreement that would end south koreas ban on imports of us beef since 2003 because of fears over mad cow disease the agreement allowed for imports of all cuts of us boneless and bonein beef and other beef products from cattle irrespective of age as long as specified risk materials known to transmit mad cow disease are removed and other conditions are met however korean television coverage of the issue internetspread rumors of poor safety of us beef and mobilization activities of south korean leftist groups resulted in the outbreak of massive public demonstrations of tens of thousands of people against the agreement and the lee government in response the bush and lee administrations revised the agreement in late june 2008 to limit sales of us beef from cattle less than 30 months old us beef began to be sold at retail outlets in seoul in july 2008 and the public demonstrations began to wane see crs report rl34528 ussouth korea beef dispute

us alliance with south korea is undergoing fundamental changes that are affecting the alliance structure and the us military presence in south korea four factors influenced the initiation of this process in 2003 one was the demonstration of antiamerican sentiment in south korea in 2002 particularly against the us military presence in south korea sparked by the accidental killing of two south korean schoolgirls by us military vehicle mass demonstrations against the united states ensued throughout south korea over the us military commands usfk handling of the incident south korean attitudes critical of the united states are especially pronounced among south koreans below the age of 50 while older south koreans remain substantially prous south korean polls indicated that antiamerican sentiment declined after 2005 but the antius beef protests of 2008 indicated that there is significant antiamerican sentiment under the surface secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and the pentagon launched program of change in the us military presence in 2003 which they said was partly in response to the antius protests second factor was the policies of president roh moohyun elected in 2002 who sought changes in the alliance structure to give south korea more equality and independence from the united states roh made important proposals for changing the alliance structure which secretary rumsfeld accepted third factor was plans for restructuring of us forces in the western pacific that the pentagon and the us pacific command began to develop in the late 1990s coupled with the need for more us troops for the war in iraq fourth contributing factor was the gradual recognition that the capabilities of north korean conventional military forces have deteriorated substantially as result of the collapse of the soviet union north koreas main supplier of arms and the collapse of north koreas economy in the 1990s the main elements of the rumsfeld program including his responses to

the drawdown would halt at 28500 and it indicated that level of troop strength would be maintained indefinitely 41 the relocations of the second division and yongson garrison to pyongtaek have been postponed from 2008 to 2013 because of south ko rean protests of financial difficulties in paying its share of the relocation costs in june 2008 sources in south koreas defense ministry began talking of postponement to 201642 the pentagon also announced that us military personnel can bring families to south korea this will enlarge considerably the us military community in south korea and will

minefield in rokus negotiations43 before the announcement on us military families the estimated cost of the pyongtaek relocations was 107 billion44 another potential challenge to the rumsfeld program lies in the misgivings expressed by the new south korean government and president lee myungbaks grand national party over the opcon agreement this sentiment is that the opcon agreement should be postponed or canceled the pentagon and the us military command in korea usfk assert that implementation should proceed 45 their commitment to the opcon agreement would be tested within the next two years if official south korean sentiment against it continues to build with the election of president lee myungbak there has been talk in south korea and the united states about broadening the alliance beyond the korean peninsula the alliance operates on very limited basis outside the korean peninsula president roh moohyun sent 3600 rok troops to iraq in 2004 the third largest contribution

allies to send ground combat troops to afghanistan to help deal with the resurgent taliban in contrast to the absence of south korean commitment of troops to afghanistan eight other us allies have each contributed over 1000 troops and another five allies have each contributed over 500 troops 47 in 2007 it appears that the south korean government paid sizeable ransom to the taliban to secure the release of kidnapped south korean christian missionaries reported by one taliban official to be 20 million48 in response to question us ambassadordesignate to south korea kathleen stephens stated that the us and south korean governments should discuss how south korea could contribute to the war in afghanistan the south korean newspaper korea herald reported that us secretary of defense robert gates asked south korean representative chong mongjoon of the grand national party for the deployment of troops to afghanistan to train afghan military and police personnel49 in view of president lees political weakness in the wake of the antius beef protests he likely would have difficulty in securing public support and political support in the korean national assembly for any proposal to send

korea was governed by authoritarian leaders rhee syngman park chunghee and c hun doohwan park and chun were military leaders who took power through coup detats except for several years in the 1960s the governments under these leaders followed policies that highly restricted political and civil liberties however the park chunghee government 19631979 orchestrated the korean economic miracle which turned south korea from poor agriculturalbased country into the modern industrial and high technology country it is today in 1987 massive prodemocracy demonstrations and behindthescenes american pressure forced chun to allow the drafting of new constitution and the holding of free presidential elections the constitution established president elected for single five year term since 1987 five presidents have been elected to office national assembly of 299 members elected to fouryear terms received expanded powers to legislate laws and to conduct oversight and investigations over the executive branch courts were given greater independence from south korean presidents municipal and provincial governments were given new powers independent of the central government the developments

were weak and unstable under the authoritarian regimes and they have retained many of those characteristics despite their growing importance in the national assembly and at the local level political parties generally have been the appendages of powerful political leaders they often have been based in different regions of south korea members have viewed their loyalty as di rected to the leader rather than to party as an institution they have viewed the political parties as means of acquiring power and position parties thus have been unstable often lasting only for short periods before breaking up the latest example is the disintegration of the uri party in 2007 the uri party was led by president roh moohyun who was elected in december 2002 it was the largest party in the national assembly with 139 seats however with polls showing r ohs public approval extremely low and the uri partys prospects in the december 2007 president election as very poor defections began from the party in 2007 uris strength in the national assembly fell to 110 and remaining party leaders created new party the united democratic party nevertheless the united democratic party entered the presidential race in 2007 in weakened condition its candidate lost badly to the candidate of the opposition grand national party gnp former mayor of seoul lee myungbak in december 2007 lee who won nearly 49 of the vote ran on probusiness platform pledging to relax government regulations over domestic and foreign business and cut the corporation tax in order to restore the high level of south korean economic growth that had persisted from the late 1960s until the late 1990s and create up to 600000 new jobs annually he said he would create 40 billion investment fund to develop north korea toward raising its per capita income from an estimated 500 to 3000 54 lees grand national party won 153 of 299 national assembly seats in the election of april 9 200855 two other parties perceived as conservative won 32 seats and one of them subsequently merged with the grand national party giving it parliamentary majority of 171 seats former president rohs united democratic party won only 81 seats nevertheless president lee has been weakened by the antius beef protests and widespread criticisms of several of his other policies the antius beef protests corresponded with sharp decline in lees approval ratings to the 2030 range lee appears to have backed off from several of his policy initiatives including plan to construct canal across south korea and the privatization of state enterprises political parties and political institutions that have arisen since 1987 have demonstrated sharper ideological positions especially on issues like relations with north korea and the united states ideological divisions on these issues have had strong generational element in them older south koreans have attitudes more favorable to the united states and are anticommunist younger south koreans are more supportive of conciliatio n with north korea and are critical of key elements of the south koreanus alliance an array of nongovernmental groups influence the government on key policy issues such as the role of labor unions environmental policies government support of farmers womens issu and consumer issues the press includes number of newspapers but also extensive newsoriented computer
