plaintext version 10 17 september 1999 to the reader scientology is religious philosophy containing pastoral counseling procedures intended to assist an individual to gain greater knowledge of self the mission of the church of scientology is simple one to help the individual acheive greater selfconfidence personal integrity thereby enabling him to really trust and respect himself and his fellow man the attainment of the benefits and goals of scientology requires each individuals positive participation as only through his own efforts can he achieve these this is part of the religious literature and works of the founder of scientology l ron hubbard it is presented to the reader as part of the record of his personal research into life and should be construed only as written report of such research and not as statement of claims made by the church or the author scientology and its substudy dianetics as practiced by the church address only the spiritual side of man although the church as are all churches is free to engage in spiritual healing it does not as its primary goal is increased knowledge and personal integrity for all for this reason the church does not wish to accept individuals who desire treatment of physical illness or insanity but refers these to qualified specialists in other organizations who deal in these matters the hubbard electrometer is religious artifact used in the church confessional it in itself does nothing and is used by ministers only to assist parishioners in locating areas of spiritual distress or travail we hope the reading of this book is only the first stage of personal voyage of discovery into the positive and effective religion of scientology the board of directors church of scientology this book belongs to _____ date _____

manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 26 august ad9 cenocon excerpt promotional functions of dept of accts accounts is commonly so snowed under with bookkeeping and prop income that it doesnt think of itself as promotional unit but it is snappy and accurate accounting quick and accurate and even tough rendering of statements is all promotion of sort we are accustomed to thinking of an accts dept as being figurefigure nonreach sort of department but this is far from true thats figurefigure accounts is promotional just by rendering bills properly and on schedule and theyre promotional by making sure the public contributes to the organization in money by thoroughly backing up the prr accounts does lot of promotion further there is another thing that an accounts dept can do in the promotion line we are usually undermanned in the accounts dept and seldom realize that lack of people in it is one of the most foolish economies we can make its lack of people in the accounts dept rather than lack of willingness that keeps our accounts in turmoil there should be one person on statements one person on current bills book and one person on prop income breakdown even if one or two of these people are parttime if there are three and there should be part of the work of each would be promotion as follows statements noticing that credit is good on some person in the statements book should write and tell the person so and give list of such people to the dir of prr current bills who should handle purchasing and filing too probably has public relations function in handling the merchants with whom we deal and getting them interested in what we are doing rather than allowing purely trade relationship to exist prop income who also usually does the invoicing has promotion function in making sure that the receipts get back to the payee along with some kind of pat on the back for helping scientology along money is the attention unit of this society lot of scientologists say how mercenary when i start talking about money they dont believe in it to the degree that they dont want to attract any attention personally and thats the crude truth weve got to get over that attitude the commonest sense tells us that if we had enough money we could advertise and build and hire our way straight up the line ten times as fast as we are doing well one of the ways we fail is to fail to use money as promotion factor and to fail to fully utilize commercial transactions and monetary exchanges as promotional avenues think that over and buy the dir of materiel the new building he wants and see how they start crowding in the dept of accounts is our most neglected promotional sphere and this we must overcome l ron hubbard lrhbrbrd copyright c 1959 by l ron

central organization dept of material headed by the director of material dir mat the dept of material owns every mest object including pieces of paper in the entire organization and is responsible for its inventory existence and good repair and usage material sets up and clears away rooms keeps the place clean maintains everything orders and supervises construction and even procures new office or auditing space if its mest take it up with material if its service or significance or personnel take it up elsewhere material does all purchasing for the organization purchasing can be done only after dept head and assn sec approval on purchase order matter how small the item the greatest single threat to organization survival has been purchasing by material without proper judgement and authorization by purchase order both washington and london have been all but crushed by this function done wrongly johannesburg purchasing with bad judgement wound up with very little material despite huge bills purchasing is fine art and in central orgs primary threat if done too abundantly or wrong purchasing can be so bad that the organization can go broke while acquiring nothing further enough money to pay its bills and have things is better index for necessary income than the unit if the disbursement fund is kept more than adequate the unit will also be high financial management includes what is to be bought when its okayed by the assn sec material can buy it but if material in liaison with accounts sees danger in buying material must take it up with the assn sec with more figures even if the assn sec has already okayed it the biggest potential upset next to purchasing is job completion an organization can be torn apart if each job started is not finished before new jobs are begun unfinished jobs can upset everything they must be avoided material should be given proper schedules of activities so that rooms can be set up or auditoriums procured well ahead of schedule cleanliness of quarters is public point of acceptance of scientology dir mat is highly responsible job it can make or break an organization dept of accounts headed by the director of accounts the dept of accounts receives safeguards and expends funds in the organization other person can expend money though others can receive it if it is promptly handed to accounts scientology orgs had trouble with accounts until special accounting system for central orgs was developed that system is of vital nature to the accounts dept and must be followed without additives ponderous ledgers peculiar subsystems or deletions scientology accounts system is simple it works it consists of writing an 11 invoice on fourcopy machine for everything received and disbursement voucher on four copy disbursement machine for everything expended even petty cash with completed statement of what accounts knows of the expenditure the system consists of four files one with file for every creditor one with file for every debtor one with complete file for every bank account and one with file for every weekly breakdown envelope board with nails on it for pinning up invoices for every category on the breakdown sheet and book to put income sheets in plus an adding machine and cabinets completes the entire system then if accounts will file every piece of paper letter invoice voucher and receipt that comes in in these files properly anybody can summarize them and financial management becomes possible monthly on mimeo sheet that bears the name of every creditor all bills are listed from the creditor file not from bills mailed in by firms added up and presented to the assn sec with bank statements for his directions as to payment owe us similar mimeo sheet is made up of debtors each month and the amounts they pay is paid not by cheque but in cash by the signature of the staff member on disbursement voucher that tells the whole tangled story staff members each have folder in the creditor file at the back in which copies of the voucher are filed chartered or certified accountant can always do quarterly balance sheet for the central org rapidly from these files if they are kept up and are as designated we dont copy figures from figures into vast piles of day books ledgers statements and other mysteries unknown the files are these books the law demands records everywhere these are the records we want when people pay on their bills invoice it send them the white with their next statement and file it in their file folder our weekly breakdown sheet showing gross and units amounts deposited to salary sum disbursement account building fund must be displayed to the staff each week on staff bulletin board we are interested in complete orderly files and their individual summation thats accounting in scientology if the accounts department is doing something else theyre still in the 19th century when accounting was vast mystery and managers went broke we have had good accounts and an easy life for dir accounts everywhere the moment this whole system went in even governments were satisfied admin report forms only one report and its income sheet is permitted per department per week except in prr where each of its two sections report we dont allow random report forms to develop in central organization everything anybody wants to know is on depts single report sheet for the week hco ww

division performs the following actions folder is made for every organization or person who pays the org money this includes hco ww and other scientology orgs if applicable and all these income accounts are kept in other place nor by any other person the income division sees that statements preaddressed by addresso on proper envelopes go out to each foldered person or organization once each month this statement is thermofax copy of the summary sheet in each folder stuffed in these pre addressed envelopes new addresses for this list are routinely forwarded to addresso dept to be added to the monthly list old addresses withdrawn are also routinely passed to addresso to be deleted from the plates or stencils ledgers are kept by the income division notebooks or journals are kept all data

goes to department concerned and thence to cf next copy goes to basket for income summary and when summaried is filed in folders final machine copy is retained as income summary not torn but kept consecutive on monday following week the basket copies are sorted into boxes processing training etc each box is totalled and given an adding machine tape which is marked processing training etc the

routinely to date as continuing activity not in monthly rush folder statements sheets not up to date one month as to debit and credit will be up to date the next the folder statements sheets are mimeoed in general and lettered in particular ie they can be mimeoed in quantity in generalized form but they must be filled in in detail make sure that the mimeo ink and the ink or type used is capable of being copied on the thermofax machine as this machine will not copy water based inks on invoicing books if this is done by income division this is the first operation of the day the invoices go at once by hand to shipping so books may be mailed same day this is rush invoice item folders are filed alphabetically by class which is to say other orgs form group individuals form group bookstores form group etc it is the responsibility of the income division to know what the org is owed and to see that it is collected if disbursement vouchers bank slips etc are sent by debtors they are never entered on the statements sheets they are kept in the folders for information only only money received in the bank is entered the income report from the income section also includes the amount shown on the last statement for each bank account there is further attempt to balance cash deposited but not shown on statement or cheques issued but not cashed in by the person or firm who received them this weekly report is the money on hand report it goes to the assoc sec and the hco sec it is then filed with the weeks income report it is compiled and despatched when all statements for the week are in it is not attached to the income report but is separate in practice if convenient it could be so attached the income division retains and has all invoicing machines but disbursement machine the income division makes all deposits of cash and cheques into the bank 14 disbursement division the disbursement division has the responsibility of correctly disbursing the money of the org such as bills wages mortgage payments etc each creditor including staff members has red folder each folder has statements sheet in it whenever cheque is disbursed or wage or cash is paid out disbursement voucher must be written giving all particulars the white voucher top copy is sent or given to the creditor the next copy is filed in the statements folders the next copy goes to central files if applicable the machine copy is retained unseparated and filed in an envelope dated as of the week disbursed in block the copy of the disbursement voucher for filing is placed in basket for filing and then is filed without entering it at that time on the statements sheet in the folder of the firm or person disbursed to all incoming bills are placed in basket along with the

brought up to date before the monthly report is made this report totals all bills owing when executive directions are given on them cheques are issued as directed against this monthly report there are other reports except when requested for some firm summary the disbursement division makes income reports on reconciliation of bank statements the income division makes reports on disbursement every quarter an accountant audits the books and submits quarterly report in summation form he does not make books the law requires records to be kept we keep records actually we keep books as above but their pages are folders history the bugbear of accounting is the failure to record all one knows about each transaction an executive is later expected to remember it all and spend two or three weeks going over tangled accounts with each audit this is circumvented by writing all you know about the transaction on the disbursement voucher or on the invoice we are at this writing being lot too brief on our history if you know something about the transaction related to what its for and why or whats odd about it put it on the invoice or disbursement machine not in dispatch or in memory example joyce bibbin orders œ2 worth of books but sends œ3100 she wants us to retain œ1100 for future purchase make out one invoice for œ200 and one for œ1100 but say on each what and why and that it came out of œ3100 also if you know purchase was for some particular purpose or department of the organization put it on the disbursement voucher when the bill is paid this way well not be racking our brains and can have an audit without the place being torn down the person doing the audit should do it on the spot on our premises do not part with folders and records all correspondence relating to firm or person and all data on that person is kept in the same folder there are business files l ron hubbard lrhesccden copyright c 1961 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 16 hubbard communications office

files and all correspondence of business nature 17 with that creditor whether concerned with money or not comes to the disbursement files there must be separate business files only the disbursement files the only exception is debtor correspondence about money owed us in the income files it is mandatory that other business file exists in the organization disbursement never pays from received bill alone all bills received are first filed in the disbursement files then the file is reviewed as whole when the time comes to pay bills it is forbidden to short circuit this line and pay bills just as they drop into the in basket they are filed then all files are reviewed once month summated and the result entered in statement sheet in the file folder and on bills summary sheet this bills summary sheet is prepared on the 10th of each month and submitted with or without folders as requested to the executive director or treasurer along with summary of the amounts in each bank account when thereafter requested to do so the disbursement section makes out the cheques as indicated or readies the cash these cheques are then given to the treasurer or in other orgs to the financial manager to sign and when signed are mailed or given to the creditors the weekly payroll cheque is drawn for signature and given to the treasurer or the financial manager on wednesday of each week and the cash received from the bank on thursday the payroll is made up and paid on friday noon not before any bonuses are given at this time the only exception is friday holiday all disbursements whether by cash or cheque or petty cash are vouchered on the disbursement machine of the debtor company payment of any kind may be made without voucher the voucher must clearly state what the payment was for purchase orders must accompany every order to purchasing before the fact and must come to disbursement before bill can be paid purchases made for company without prior purchase order render the employee ordering to payment of the account from his own salary all contracts drawn must priorly be validated by purchase order signed by the treasurer or in other orgs to the financial manager this applies to service contracts contractors and all such utilities escape purchase orders by necessity but fuel oil etc do not domestic expenses minor charge accounts such as gas are by quota not purchase order and are exempt so long as they remain in quota such quotas are set by the executive director or the treasurer or in other orgs by the financial manager the disbursement section posts all vouchers in ledgers for the companies concerned with an appropriate breakdown of the amounts for each activity to assist in financial management posting is done in separate ledgers for different companies posting is done in periods of one week ending 200 pm thursday to agree with the income period to facilitate this disbursement voucher copies are filed as made in trays of the separate divisions of posting disbursement vouchers are handled as follows the original to the person or firm being paid copy to that person or companys folder copy to the posting trays and copy to the weekly income report envelope the last copies being carefully kept in numerical sequence the gross amount of money in each bank account without any adjustments for cheques outstanding is made up from the bank statements weekly and enclosed in the income envelope roughly for the week in question all bank statements are kept by and all statementcheque reconciliations done by the disbursement section the disbursement section in england and commonwealth countries may not overdraw bank account without specific permission where the permission is given let us say to œ700 overdraft the disbursement section may then not exceed that figure without new permission in the united states overdrafts are permitted the good credit of the companies involved or the person for whom disbursement is being made is the full responsibility of the disbursement section bills should not be carelessly left outstanding such bills must be called to the treasurers or in other orgs 18 to the financial managers attention and note made on the bills summary sheet of how long it is overdue when it is not in the same month that the bills summary sheet is for bank accounts may not be overdrafted antagonizing bank managers and causing endless correspondence the moment things appear critical and margins small the matter must promptly be brought to the attention of the treasurer or in other orgs to the attention of the financial manager under the heading of good credit comes remarks or comments on company affairs that threaten its credit reputation all such observations should be made to the treasurer in good time when money is advanced to anyone above their wage the matter of its collection out of wage remains the concern of the disbursement section if money is advanced to anyone or any firm disbursement passes the matter to the income division for its collection activities when the matter falls due summary procuring money is the main function of the income section not merely recording it safeguarding credit and solvency is the main function of the disbursement section not merely spending it both the income and disbursement sections must keep the treasurer and the executive director fully informed of the facts of procurement of money and the credit and solvency of the companies financial emergencies occur only when both sections have failed to do their jobs in keeping management advised for management can always promote income or adjust expenditures easily if given enough warning it takes about half year for competent management to recover from bad imbalance of income and outgo it takes as long as year and half for competent management to recover from real financial emergency solvency is only that condition where income exceeds outgo insolvency is only that condition where outgo exceeds income with the income section making sure the income is coming in and the disbursement section making sure that it isnt going out faster than it is coming in and with both sections keeping management advised of fluctuations solvency becomes possible and jobs for people exist only where solvency is maintained note the treasurer or the executive director may as in london which is near to hand direct that all an organizations cheques be signed only by the treasurer at saint hill especially in cases where insolvency seems chronic and not mending regardless of distance or inconvenience envisioned the treasurer may direct that cheques may be signed except by the treasurer and all other cheque signatories dropped from the account in such cases all the above actions are still undertaken and the nominated financial manager in the organization receives all the reports and forwards only those portions required to the treasurer with the cheques ready for signature in ample time to be airmailed in return this action has uniformly resulted in returned solvency for the organization such an action changes none of the above except as noted here lrh note in small organizations both income and disbursement sections are handled by one person but if so each section has its complete files and functions just as above lrh l ron hubbard lrhdrcden copyright c 1964 by

be consulted in doing an audit and are illegal in scientology company anyway 2 all sums received from any source must be legibly invoiced and banked they may not be spent before banking not even penny matter the emergency 3 all sums disbursed must be disbursed by cheque even petty cash and salary sums must be drawn by cheque before being disbursed 4 all sums disbursed must also be disbursed by

his papers contract debts to org and voucher showing each amount received are filed weekly there is peg board system of separating the weekly invoices and vouchers into categories of income and expense this refinement is described in earlier policy if you have any other accounting system in operation it is contrary to company policy which is based on the above only as executive director will not sign any balance sheet or return not taken from the original records balance sheets or statements of affairs based on secondary ledgers and journals or double entry systems or punched card computer systems or any books the law requires that accurate records be kept this does not mean ledgers and double entry and such are not required by law anywhere in the world accounting is mystery when it becomes so by complex systems executives cannot manage their companies and they go broke the introduction of complex accounting contrary to policy is suppressive act on laymen scientologists with little or accounting experience can run the above system and interpret it easily the decline of more than one scientology organization can be traced to violations of the above accounting policies executives could not manage the company when intimidated by mysterious complex accounting accounting cost more than the company could afford the field arc broke on being billed erroneously accounts collections were neglected and staggering sums went uncollected because they werent billed or poorly billed due to violations of the above this system is very simple one and good one designed for

financial history in washington and london must bear comment in 1950 and 1951 i did not have financial control of dianetics and scientology organizations i was administratively figurehead in less than one year from start the early hdrfs were crowded into financial difficulties and went broke in early 1952 i started the first organizations i controlled the office of l ron hubbard and the has impeded badly by the hdrf credit history i nevertheless was able to build the has and its successor the hasi into 6 12 million dollar organization fully solvent now in the past few months i gave check signing and financial concerns over to others in washington for the fcdc and for the past two years to london for the hasi london in these few months fcdc went 19000 into the red from total pay up as of january 1 1959 when i gave over to go 19000 into the red and to show every sign of going deeper while business volume remained fairly usual took some hard work on somebodys part in hasi london the organization in two years of noncontrol went œ18000 into the red i am now busy making fcdc solvent and am sending nibs over to see to it i have already cut the hasi london bills payable from œ18000 to œ7000 in the past 90 days and this without even having an accounts department to help ive also made hasi london pay back œ2000 of the money it has owed personally for six years in other words we dont have many people who can handle finance smartly that this sag was not accompanied by other slackening or increasing activities is quite comment beside myself only jack parkhouse and julia lewis salmen amongst all of us have proven record of good financing it might interest you how i do this trick i disseminate like mad to lots of people and get in lots of money i dont run up bills if i dont have money i spend money freely only when it has been made and is in the bank i dont worry about wasting money if i have made the money first i never plan for emergencies i just make lots of money for the organization to any financial problem i answer by making money to any crucial organizational problem i answer by disseminating like mad improving service and getting in lots of money i answer money problems with lots of money not with worry or sadness or impractical hope i never count on any one source i always plan to get the total sum of all the money i need from each one of 3 or 4 ways or sources 27 but most important i dont run up bills if i dont have the cash in sight to pay i am not parasitic on the organization i always make many times the amount i may spend on hybrid horned toads with pink ribbons for the front hall i do now and then throw money away when its been made and isnt needed now ive taught you many things let also teach you to make tons of money for the organization its the one thing staffs do poorlythe making and spending of money they can evidently spend it they dont well make it so let teach you this disseminate like mad and make tons of money please by the way both dc and london went completely sour in only two functions the buying of printing and the failure to send their magazine once month to everybody in cf in other words hco printing hat and the department of materiel hats were to blame for the sag ruin faces us im still here still working hard still communicating but by golly you better learn to do this one for yourselves disseminate like mad and make money dont incur single bill until you have the cash to pay it already in the bank ive put dc and london on tight budgets for current expenses and have other ways to float their barks if need be ill pay the bills out of my own pocket which would be unjust since i didnt incur in any way the more serious debts and repayments to in both cases summed only fraction of their total so get smart about money its only money its made and if you make it you can have some if you dont you cant it wont be there to be had l ron hubbard lrhghoden 28 hubbard communications office 37 fitzroy street london w 1 hco policy letter of 3 june 1959 cenocon financial management the financial management hat of scientology organizations has assumed great importance now financial management is ordinarily done by the assoc sec the org sec or the treasurer and possibly in some cases the director of accounts but is always under the direct responsibility of the assoc sec matter who wears the hat it is the purpose of the hat to ensure solvency of the organization and its divisions this hat would be worn both in the service organization and hco andor in some cases for both the service organization and the hco the basic principle of financial management is simple one income must be greater than outgo amongst the principles of financial management are these one cannot spend money unless he has it never contract bills or debts unless the money is immediately in sight to pay for them calculate all predictions necessary to security disseminate like mad and make money rapidly every organization should be on contract and purchase budget certain amount of money is laid aside every week to pay salaries and current operating expenses and debts are incurred until the money is there to pay for them or can be predicted to be there to pay for them any money left over is used to pay past bills and handle special projects the calculation of the budget is very simple it is done as follows 1 take dozen of the lowest weeks in the past year ignore the high weeks add up these 12 weekly incomes and then divide by 12 this gives you an average low week of income this is then obviously fairly safe figure on which to base budget 2 from this average low income week deduct 10 to hco from this 90 subtract 45 of it not of the gross from this 45 deduct 8 of the 90 figure this gives you the amount of money now available for operating expenses of the organization rents utilities supplies equipment and other expenditures including advertising example average low week less hco 10 90 balance 45 exp and bldg f 180 _08 spec fund 1440 we can see from this that our total available budget must now cover rents purchases time payments hirepurchase utilities supplies equipment paper printing the whole works total available for budget œ6612 per week in calculating the 10 for hco and exp and bldg f special fund œ200 20 180 45 900 720 8100 144 œ66 6 29 the 8 for the special fund one takes these of course from the actual gross the figures above show the portion which comes from the budget figure in order to establish the budget after the budget is once calculated it is adhered to the œ66 above is the actual figure it is not recalculated it is spent for all expenses hco 10 salary sum 8 for special fund ail come out of the actual weekly income entire and are transferred at once to proper accounts the way hasi london got into trouble was to have an authorized buying and contracting at every hand without regard to income and the way it tried to stay out of trouble rather laughably but serious enough in the long run was to only pay as many bills as they had money in the expense sum this of course was an idiotic procedure the control point must be on purchasing and contracting not on paying bills as result of this policy when i returned to financial management overall at board level and put financial management hat into the organization we had œ18000 of unpaid bills which were so secret that record was even kept of them by the accounts department they were evidently wastebasketed one of the methods used to follow the comm lines was after purchase was made the goods delivered purchase order would be hastily made out so as to make the records complete accounts not being able to pay the bill would then file it carefully in some mousehole and not advise anybody about it the point of entrance of financial management then is the regulation of purchase and contract and the severe calculation of and precise ordering of all supplies and the careful calculation of future rents here we are not fooling we must run within our income or we wont have any organization at all what happens to the money which is left after we have spent our budget we can do several things with it but the best thing is to take this money periodically and bring the organization up to snuff with equipment and supplies to the degree that we have actual cash with which to pay for them and not to buy one more paperclip than we can buy with cash furthermore this money can be utilized for wide advertising programs and other things which we so desperately need but unless we budget ourselves within an income and only spend money that we have and not contract for expenditures of money that we do not have and cannot expect to have we wont survive very long therefore the fundamental of financial management is guaranteeing the survival of the organization within the economic framework of the society however financial management must also be real if it has œ6600 week budget for the expenditure of the organization on current bills rents etc it must spend it and not try to chip down on its actual budget it counts on high weeks to simply provide extra funds which will be needed probably semiannually to buy the things the organization has been out of for long time or to engage in special projects desperately needed for dissemination running 8c on money is very difficult to do i am told i personally have never found it so but many people have if the organization is only permitted to spend certain amount of money it has prediction and there is question about it salary sum varies all other sums for transfers of course come out of the main account but the budget sum must cover all the expenses rents equipment and other things of the organization it is up to financial manager to be very very very tough and to learn how to say in fact it would be very good thing if he stood in front of mirror for ten or fifteen minutes day saying this would be an excellent drill it is very important to this hat to be handled at once and it would be enforced ruthlessly otherwise we are going to continue to run into financial jams and never have enough money to do any broad advertising in the london times and saturday evening post or anything else besides which we wont even be there to do it the budget of washington and london have already been set by sec ed and is not to be changed other organizations should set up their own budget as above lrhmprd 4th jun 59 l ron hubbard 30 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter

regulations where the 10 of the gross income may not be paid to the international area weekly by reason of local currency regulations an additional bank account must be set up locally to receive them and the 10 must be paid weekly into that account this account is to be called the hasi international administrative account only international board members may be signatories on the hasi international administrative account funds so deposited may be handled in any way the international board chooses and are in way the property of the local area organization this policy also applies to franchise holders any inability to transfer funds to the international organization by reason of currency restrictions are handled in the above fashion always demands for funds as in my experience an organization always spends all it makes financial management on an international level consists not of carefully balancing income above outgo in an effort to save surplus in am organization but of preventing an org from spending more than it makes and b setting aside enough money from its income to care for salvage operations and salvage expenses part is done by good financial supervision part b is done on an international level without any regard whatever for the protests and financial necessities of the org in question an organization whether standard oil or any other will always spend all it makes and try to spend more the task is on the one hand to keep it from spending more than it makes and on the other to make some of its expenditures recoverable in cash never on an international basis be so fatuous as to believe an organization will continue to have the difference between its income and its outgo it will never have that it will spend it in some way an avalanche of reasons it must not save money or same thing why it must spend it is routine and is to be expected the government will tax it we cant get auditing rooms and thousand other reasons may be advanced as to why the org must spend all its money truth told i could run any org we have on only 25 percent of the income i would promote for it and pay high wages i have done so repeatedly but i do it by making the org apparently spend all it makes while actually spending the surplus in recoverable fashion this is the only way i have ever achieved surplus for an org in actual practice accountants deal in figures i deal in people some championship chess players liken life to chess and yet cant make go of it in life in life the pieces think they have impulses so chess rules like accountants rules dont apply collectivethink is always closer to bankthink than individual reasoning thats because the bank is the one constant people have in common and its crazy so almost any individual alive can plan better than group will execute and certainly better than group cam plan scientology groups are far superior to human groups but the rule still applies that collectivethink is always less sane than the thinking of an individual 33 in finance which is pretty weird to begin with collectivethink is always less wise than individual reason so group is quite certain to behave contrary to good sense in financial matters this factor far more than accounts balance sheets must be given attention group poorly supervised as in government will usually try to spend more than it makes heavy supervision and economy can prevent this only the physical removal of money can achieve surplus income potential the income potential of any usual group is established by the demand for income not by any other important factor in financial supervision on an international basis this is the only factor one works with while it is reasonable to suppose that income will occur for other reasons and can be achieved in other ways the actual fact is that only demand by the group produces any income at all you can for use in financial supervision make the requirement almost anything you like and so long as group believes it is spending all it makes and needs more you will have adequate income for practical purposes other rules apply scientology orgs have always spent all i would make for them they have adjusted their need to how much could be made in supervision of their finance it is only necessary to reverse this and they adjust their income to their needs when surplus is made part of the need by disguised outgo surplus occurs only then will it occur it will not happen otherwise you can waste 15 of an organizations income to obtain 5 surplus and it will be wise action if you seek surplus by trying to save the 15 instead in visible way you will not only lose the 15 but the 5 also you can only attain financial cushion in an org by removing it out of reach so that it appears to be spent then producing it when the org overspends or gets in trouble orgs like children are fantastically improvident and group to work must believe it is spending all it makes money to begin with is only an abstract idea therefore it is the victim of all manner of thoughts and opinions all we want out of an org is for it to stay there and continue to do that we have to have financial ideas that work incredible as it may seem the above are the only practical financial ideas which have worked and which have produced surpluses and guaranteed org continuation add to these good promotion and excellent technical and you have the reasons we are becoming strong all over the world financial management is not accountancy its people as head of an org if you can think your way around collectivethink you can become solvent and even have surplus maybe it shouldnt be that way but it is local finance when local finance is poor dont ever look at anything or any one but the association or organization secretary this being can either think his way around collectivethink or he cant if he can hes got solvent org if he cant hell go broke an org that runs only on collectivethink will go broke the only symptoms of approaching insolvency in an org one needs to look for are demands by it for money belonging to the international org or myself or b consistent low income 34 in either case the remedy is to get somebody in charge who doesnt demand monies belonging to the international org or myself and who gets higher income coming in for the org an assnorg sec who cant do this is the effect of the collectivethink in his org and is not the org leader or the dominant planner of the org at continental or international level one must never seek for the reason why international or lrh monies must be used by the org or why income is consistently low you can get reasoned to death if these two facts exist then theres so much else wrong one would go mad tabulating it the steps to take are remove the assnorg sec 2 put somebody in who can handle collectivethink 3 use any local surplus to carry the org during the upsets of transition experience has taught that distant efforts to right local extreme wrongs are usually disastrous you can right small wrongs show the way and so on thats only normal leadership but when an org begins to skid financially or get upset over its money being used internationally you dont fool about you just act the longer you put off acting the more local people get hurt because behind those facts of poor finance are some very ugly other abuses always i dont want any orgs in games condition with the international org for this is only symptom of the imminent collapse of the local org anyway it goes into games condition only after its overts stretch from to zed you dont see the overts from distance you do see financial conditions and demands it would be impossible today for cleanly run onpolicy uptech org not to own its area totally in 10 years financial insolvency what nonsense so financial policy is based on good individual ability heading up each org and is not based on either accounting or collectivethink neither one will build any future for mankind the reasons behind the building fund account have been set forth above in full good local leadership always results in good local financial credit and strength weak local leadership has always resulted in financial insolvency and trouble broad general supervision of orgs uses financial protests and upsets and trouble to detect weak leadership without adequate and sensible leaders orgs would slump into collectivethink in their planning spend more than was made and cease to exist we want orgs to be successful to stay there and continue that requires sensible financial provisions and management stable data 1 an org will try to spend more than it makes 2 economy is aimed at preventing it from spending more than it makes 3 surplus is achieved only by making it part of what an org spends 4 an orgs expenditures are not regulated by what the org needs in order to do business but by what an org thinks it has available for expenditure 5 financial management can not achieve financial surplus by economy alone 35 6 surplus to be achieved must be made part of what an org thinks it spends income is regulated by what an org thinks it has to have to operate 8 income is never regulated in usual org by desires for surplus 9 to achieve surplus it must be masked as necessary expenditure 10 economy to achieve surplus does not include saving on expenses it includes only adding an expense that becomes surplus 11 to achieve surplus one must add an expense that can then thereafter convert to surplus one can waste up to 50 of an orgs income to achieve 10 surplus in some cases this is the only way surplus can be achieved why see 1 and 2 above 12 an individual is always more sensible than group 13 when am org is losing ground financially it is being run by someone who is only the effect of the group and cannot act as an individual in planning or control the group 14 the only possible board action when an org is not making its way financially is to remove the association or organization secretary the incumbent is only the effect of the group and is not planning or controlling 15 the earlier one detects bad assnorg sec and replaces him the better it is for the people in that area 16 the ways to detect bad assnorg sec are their games condition by any part of the org with the board b their desires to be financed by the board or use the boards or my income to run on c generally low income d protests against the board using their money under these or any of them will be found an org out of control and messing people up therefore the quicker the board acts to replace the assnorg sec the easier the situation will be to handle and the faster the org will recover 17 board efforts to straighten up am area without replacing the local head have never been successful in 14 years if let go too long under incompetent management an orgs recovery requires heroic efforts and vast financial expenditure by the international org 18 bad local publicity and trouble always follows after 16 to the degree that the board d d not act 19 financial management as contained in this policy letter closely followed will prevent almost all trouble and org upsets not

international board action 37 summary greatly increased local income makes it possible to return to the original plan and use of the building fund account it should be realized that this account was made available to the local organizations some years ago to bridge the research gap now traversed the actual action here is simply restoring some of the status quo extant few years ago signalizing the end of an emergency assistance period as early as 1957 orgs commonly had surpluses while paying 25 of their income into separate account and this money was never touched for local activities i permitted after this rents to be paid from the building fund and some other expenses to expedite org growth and to ease the research gap until processes stabilized it should also be noted that the above arrangements permit an org to catch up on past debts for 10s books tapes but not saint hill student enrollment or expenses owing to the international org starting the account most such accounts are already started for new org to start one it is only necessary to obtain the usual papers and cards from nearby bank and send them to saint hill the treasurer at saint hill completes them and returns them direct to the bank and also informs the org of the fact cheque book must be requested of and received from the bank by saint hill all relevant papers and the cheque book are made part of the treasurers files such accounts do not become the concern of either the international org sec or the saint hill accounts unit accounting deposit slips noting deposits into the building fund account of local org are sent to the board treasurer at saint hill directly along with weekly reports these slips are not invoiced by saint hill accounts as the monies are not actually received at saint hill they are invoiced by the treasurer on separate machine and the white is returned to the org by usual channels all bank statements on such local accounts are directed to be sent only to the treasurer the treasurers files contain then file book for each org with its sections chronologically marked into which the basic papers the bank statements the copies of the invoices the cheque book and all correspondence and activities relating to that account are carefully kept in order and up to date at the org routine file for the white slips and deposit slip copies is kept into this file the local accounts unit also places its disbursement voucher for each deposit into the building fund account note that the local org makes out disbursement voucher for all deposits into the building fund account treating the money as expended copy of this voucher accompanies the deposit slip to saint hill all correspondence with an org relating to the building fund account goes only to the treasurer

act foolishly with customs dues etc it had confidence in that government and the currency of that government went to pieces on the world market money is basically matter of confidence so is credit an accounts unit that handles money poorly wrecks the orgs credit rating insolvency is much less often the source of poor credit than just poor money handling almost all our orgs have good credit but where they dont it is money handling not the amount of money available that wrecks credit an assnorg sec who handles bills in certain way has good org credit one who doesnt has bad credit to try to assign credit to the amount of money available is completely false you can have lots of money and horrible credit you can have little money and excellent credit so saying our income has been poor so our credit is bad is lie the business world judges scientology not on its scientific validity but on its financial credit rating if the orgs credit is good then scientology is okay if your credit is bad scientology is racket in business general opinion melbournes financial credit went bad before its general repute earned it an enquiry good credit is primary dissemination line it breeds confidence you cant have bad credit and still be thought of as valid science so financial management must help general dissemination by maintaining good credit bad credit rating comes from negligence in accounts not from the lack of industry of the registrar to begin with an org has business spending more than it makes to do so shows stupidity in management and accounts lack of purchase order system and general beatnik state of organization make all the money you can spend less than that thats the simple abc of financial control make sure all the income is accounted for and banked make sure unauthorized purchases can be made by executives or staff by requiring an authority to purchase or contract from the head of the org before any purchase can be made or contract signed sure thats slow who wants it fast the slower it is the less you spend you want speed on the income line the disbursement line is something else so never listen to somebody saying but it takes so long to get purchase order that i just bought it yawn and say you bought it without authorization you can pay for it personally never let your purchase order system break down if you do you will soon be spending more than you make fact exceptions 39 company to most people is something to bleed they never realize that company can only spend what it makes and that what it has is made by individuals so if you have somebody around who is always saying the org will pay or should pay point out that the org is its staffs collective pocket book and that that pocket book has bottom solvency you sometimes hear around an org wave of were broke when spending is restrained this hurts credit for its not true economy is not sign of being broke its sign of increasing prosperity without curtailed and watched spending you never have prosperity so dont tell everybody we cant buy it because were broke thats lazy dull reason better one is we cant buy it because we dont need it and is usually the truth we have po system because we want to prosper is the real reason you have one make lots of money spend it frugally so it gives tax problem so what your accountants should be capable of avoiding tax problems whether you do or dont have money you will always have tax problem because governments are crazy the way to solve tax problems is to have money not to be broke taxes exist only to destroy businesses be impudent get rich and to hell with them governments are just reactive bank we have to live with for while learn to handle them but not by refusing to make money or have it but solvency depends on how you handle things not on how much you have micawber in david copperfield said that if you had twentyone shillings and spent pound you had happiness but that if you had nineteen shillings and spent pound you had misery pound being twenty shillings thats all there is to solvency if you have to spend million dollars then you better make one million one hundred thousand first and then make sure you dont spend one million two hundred thousand the secret of solvency is make lot of money the way to do that in scientology is covered in hco policy letter of january 21 1965 promotion and organization 2 spend less than you make thats covered by having good po system and alert financial management 3 make it before you have to spend it 4 gather bit by bit cushion of cash to fall back on and dont ever fall back on it 5 keep your credit excellent as second cushion 6 refuse to spend reserves make more money to meet the emergency instead its usually quicker to make it than to dig it out of old hiding places never borrow to pay bills its less trouble just to make the money 7 realize that collectivethought regarding finance is just bank and that bank is dead against the creation of anything good and all for eating up everything that exists thus financial planning and control is an individual job is often contrary to group demands and succeeds only when the individual handling it can rise superior to the group tame dog financial manager trailing along behind the group yessing everything will always make the group insolvent the person you put in charge of financial management should be able to say matter how popular silly yes would be the financial manager is not there to buy his own popularity with org funds in the early years of scientology my whole answer to org solvency was just to make lot more money than people could waste its good answer lacking all others when i finally attained control of orgs i was able also to curtail the waste while making lots of money and weve been pretty solvent ever since the principles i used to achieve and continue this state of solvency are accurately and completely listed in 1 to 7 above credit when you realize financial credit is vital in dissemination you become very interested in what it is as i said above this is confidence given some degree of solvency you still do not have good credit rating that is achieved by how you pay bills 40 this is the one big point that is vital to know thoroughly in this policy letter if an association or organization secretary and the accounts assistant does not know exactly this data the org will have bad credit and financial trouble matter how much they make there is an exact way to pay bills this is to pay the bills up to certain date always it is called paying by dateline never pay little bit on each bill to save money or help cover lean period that will never help on the contrary it advertises your lean period and hurts your credit instead always lean or fat pay all the bills behind certain date and none closer to pt than that date thats why we have the type of disbursement system we have so you can do this trick if your disbursement system and its files are not up to the mark and are sloppy you will always have bad credit because they cant then do this trick of dateline paying look to the inefficient accounts unit and the lack of this billpaying system if your local credit is poor dont go off into incomeoutgo just demand that our general accounts system be followed and that disbursement files are up to date if you find an accounts personnel giving financial management the razzmatazz about why it cant have good disbursement files and if this billspaying schedule is always being violated assume at once that that personnel is overtly wrecking the orgs credit and get him or her away from that post and get somebody in who will follow our system accurately and help pay bills only by dateline you can have six months worth of unpaid bills in some areas of the world and still have good credit rating providing you do not have one bill that is ten months unpaid never pay bills any old way financial manager should always refuse to pay bills one at time on different days or when accounts submits check tell accounts give every bill we owe prior to august three months ago add these up lets say the amount exceeds our cash cut it back one month order write cheques for every bill up to july 1 thats four months back that we can cover fully with cash we pay all bills up to july 1 we demand of accounts are you very very very very sure that bills dated prior to july 1 now exist if the answer is none exist okay but if we find out next week that one existed for april 1 that wasnt included we overhaul the unit as destructive of credit business men handle their books by bills owed month by month not by total sums owed when check comes in paying his july 1 bill then its plain youre paying your bills if you send small sum hopefully to stave them off they cant dismiss any one statement with it and so get panicky it looks like you arent paying your bills after youve paid all bills older than 4 months get busy and make money in 30 days request of accounts all bills up to 15 august lets say we find that we have cash to cover we say pay all bills up to august 15 now were only 3 12 months behind month hence we pay all bills up to oct l now were only 3 months behind if you get some eager beaver into finance who doesnt use or understand how to do this you can suddenly look up and find that you thought you were doing all right but youre broke the eager beaver paid randomly anything in the files he or she came across in order to pay our bills we arent interested in bills as bills were interested in all bills earlier than given date you can go pretty smash on an eagerbeaver billspaying spree with regard to the age of each bill only pay by this system pay everything up to date always and further and get new accounts unit if disbursement files arent accurately kept so financial management can do this exceptions government tax bills water bills occasionally rent or phone are sometimes accompanied by threats of vast action unless the whole bill is paid instantly still try to 41 use the above system but if you cant pay it and retard other bills accordingly and thereafter dont pay that outfits bill on any other terms than threatened trouble if tradesman despite the use of the above system demands further payment or threatens suit caution him that if he carries on this way youll deal elsewhere and carry out the threat never continue to use private business firm after they become obnoxious about bills trade elsewhere and say why if youre using the above dateline system and tradesman gets upset then he is gypping you or he has too little finance to handle your account so stop trading with him always make that an ironbound policy be very proud and haughty about bills never propitiate so the points here that are important are 1 pay by dateline only and pay all up to that dateline put the dateline far enough back so you can pay all up to that date 2 have an accounts unit that can do this and change one that flunks it and that handles the whole of credit rating simple our system the other day two highgeared chartered accountants were giving lot of stuff about how i needed double entry system and that the existing system was wrong they said we can tell you 21 days after the 30th of the month where you stood in that past month using our double entry system i said the system we have to have must tell us four days after the past week exactly where i stand we operate in the 20th century not the 19th they said but your system is wrong i said in double entry system you need each bit we have dont you invoice all the money bank it reconcile the deposits with the slips and statements file all the bills verify them pay them by cheque and voucher and keep all records they looked at each other and were very quiet yes thats correct they said i said all right thats our system now you can do anything you like with that system from there on so long as you dont prevent us from knowing where we stand four days after the past week and dont bar out nonaccountant from discovering whats what in the accounts unit now go ahead and on our system erect any system you like government requires anyone to have books they only require records but books if they help should also be kept made up from our records they agreed so if you are getting propaganda about how our system is inadequate as reason not to operate and have accounts get somebody in who can make it work for our system is the basis of every other system and if its in order and done you can have books if it isnt in order books can be kept by any system so we dont care what accountants do with our basic system so long as we still at least have that on that any type of books can be erected or any balance sheet made if you have the basic data you can add it up if your accounts unit cant add up whatever you need then our system is not kept up and system would work in that unit where there is accounts trouble there is 1 noncomprehension of our basic system as the basic of any accounts system 2 nothing being done get our system in so you know where you are with cash and bills manage by paying all bills up to specific dateline only advance the dateline as you can cover all with your cash and make lots of money so you can advance it further toward pt practise economy so you can advance it even closer continue to do that and youll always have good credit rating we have lot of fine accounts units they do good job they can handle this if they understand it its your job now to get it understood and done lrhjwrd copyright c 1965 by l ron hubbard all

there is nothing wrong with backing up the dateline but there is everything wrong with having œ5000 more bills than you bargained for its nasty shock and oversets all financial planning and estimates of the state of the org the way this can happen is that two or three companies have never submitted statements for work done and accounts didnt see the bills were missing then said companies submit bills and bang there goes financial management we care nothing for the interest the money would draw if we didnt pay until statement was sent we do owe the money and it is better to pay it that they

out thus removing it from the general accounts and estimates of financial position of an org questioned bills anytime bill is in question it is not paid to the creditor until fully settled however dateline paying becomes very disrupted by such sums and the actual financial position of the org becomes difficult to estimate while such sums remain in its regular accounts when past bill prior to

verified or corrected the amount owing to you will be paid to you from this account the transfer voucher is clearly marked blitz co reserved payment account transfer for march bill being checked such vouchers accompany other cheques being presented to the signatories of accounts when the actual sum is verified that amount is then paid the creditor by cheque from the reserved payment account for any money not paid it is eventually returned to the regular accounts at times when the books are being closed for the period just past any excess money in the reserved payment account is returned to the regular accounts as transfer or left as saving for future purchases as directed by financial management taxation all taxation monies which are owed governments but are not yet paid are deposited in the reserved payment account and eventually paid to the government as owed this means that where an org must pay withholding tax paye and other such sums two salary cheques are drawn each week one for the staff one for the government the government cheque is deposited to the reserved payment account once month or as wise the government is paid off to date with reserved payment account cheque or cheques amounting to the sum owed in cases of org income tax payments any sum estimated can be placed in the reserved payment account as seems prudent fitting the conditions of the area outstanding purchase orders where on preparing monthly bills summary for dateline paying large pos for which statements are not yet received incurred prior to the dateline must have their amounts deposited in the reserved payment account or liberal estimate of the amount such large pos must not remain undetected and must be part of the dateline payment system if large po exists for august but the creditor has sent statement and the dateline being paid to is september 1 then the amount of the large po is deposited in the reserved payment 44 account when the other bills are paid there it remains until statement is submitted by the creditor savings when the org desires to buy something big or expensive it should not use time payments hire purchase or mortgages it should start putting money into its reserved payment account and when the full sum is there buy the item for cash using the fact to obtain good big discount while the building fund on building purchases is also intended to help buy buildings outright there is nothing wrong with also depositing available amounts of the disbursement sum in the reserved payment account to help out all monies transferred to the reserved payment account are made the subject of disbursement voucher which clearly states why and for what the payment is being reserved for of course when any amount is paid from the reserved payment account another voucher is written referring to the first one regarding the original transfer so it is necessary that when one makes disbursement voucher for transfer into the reserved payment account copy of that voucher is spindled or put into handy single file otherwise one wont be able to recall why the reserved payment account has money in it and so may let it be used for something else as an apparent overflowmuch to everyones eventual embarrassment when the x bill gets straightened out and wants money to pay it the reserved payment account is an easy system people often handle their own personal money this way 20 aside for new jacket 515 for this weeks share of the rent when it falls due add to this 1250 for the money bill says i borrowed and he has to find the note for and put it all in the broken teapot on the top shelf and youve got the purpose and action of the account you can object to it on the grounds that it ties up capital on which we pay interest in another account etc but frankly such small interest bits are little to pay for the security of knowing you can meet your obligations to juggle with already committed funds is financial brinkmanship you see by just an orderly scheduling of payments as per dateline paying and being prudent in setting big amounts owing but not paid aside an org can move up to present time i know other way of getting an orgs finance or pc to

the org is doing all right and accounts personnel falsely uses an emergency formula to turn down pos the org can be thrown into an urgency condition since poverty wrongly announced brings poverty and frantic promotion becomes necessary to save credit in the emergency formula the first action is promote this applies to the money section of the org as well while they dont have to write letters to new applicants they do have to promote the orgs credit standing both to staff and tradesmen accounts and finance promotion in time of emergency is to bolster confidence in the orgs credit by putting good face on things and encourage the staff to make more money for example politician recently destroyed his countrys credit abroad by howling economic money crisis instead of promoting england saying to somebody you cannot have this purchase order because were broke is sometimes social falsehood told to escape having to tell the applicant that the purchase order is silly one doesnt downgrade the orgs credit to make an extravagant staff member stop blowing our money one says maybe if your department made more money you could have this until your department does you cant its really matter of they are broke not the org if the department is doing well and still submits wasteful purchase order just say so say we arent making money to be silly with it we need what we make to expand not to buy whatever the po calls for the criterion of all pos is is this po for something that will increase our ability to expand or is it just somebodys gottohave thats the judgement in signing purchase order as ok some items actually retard expansion consuming more time to us than they save in the case of tradesman demanding for bill only slightly overdue you will usually find they have done poor work or slow work if youre at all solvent and paying your bills dont say were too poor and we can only send you little but we will try if you do and anybody hears of it in the org it may become the subject of discipline if not committee of evidence say properly i dont see that your bill is much overdue it takes bit of time to pay bill you know i will check over your account and see if it is all right and by the way people who dun us either have insufficient finance to handle our business or something is wrong with their bill i am setting your bill aside for audit and if you call again about it we will sever the account be tough theyre probably gyp outfit anyway ive never found otherwise for bill in actual question say the amount of your bill is deposited to our reserve payment account and will be freed when we have finished an audit on your statement and tell them how they can help 46 if the org has foolishly let itself get deep in debt and there is little money the surest way to make tradesmen demand full payment is to tell them how poor you are they will instantly rush to serve you with suits just say to tradesmen who dun oh really well send you cheque never say how much and stay steady with dateline paying and youll make it your casual air is itself promotion if personnel has money trouble of his own he thinks everybody else must have that is not true very few people have real money problems so dont sell money problems thats not promotion thats sabotage sell good sense and sound finance and good credit downgrading scientology credit rating by careless or false statements concerning its financial condition is very very serious and should be regarded as such we control an awful lot of money in scientology we are as rich as we promote and deliver and handle our money sensibly to say scientology is broke is very very much suppressive act bolster credit in emergencies thats the promotion action for accounts i never write letter that concerns money without promoting our credit standing never i always promote our credit dear bank manager our expansion is going so rapidly that or dear blitz and co demands for scientology are such that our org wishes to buy new blitzet providing we dont have to wait on delivery we cant etc promote the orgs credit public confidence in scientology depends on our promoting and maintaining excellent credit everywhere and even when youre on the ropes in emergencies still promote our good credit after all well be around for the next trillion or more why not have good credit standing while we work credit is just an idea

executive division org division financial planning the financial planning hat is worn by the advisory council financial planning meanshow to handle the money and assets of an org so as to maintain outgo below income the actions of financial planning are as follows 1 directing the payment of bills as designated by the ad council 2 directing any necessary delay in the payment of certain bills 3 handling finances in accordance with dateline paying as covered in an early policy letter 4 setting limits on the purchase orders that may be signed 5 preventing divisions or departments in emergency from buying any but essential promotional supplies or postage 6 adjusting payrolls 7 setting limits on pay overtime or bonuses and all authorizations for pay overtime or bonuses 8 fixing prices 9 directing any transfers of funds 10 deciding upon any large purchases 11 authorizing the sale of any equipment or property 12 passing upon prices offered for any equipment or property any matter affecting the financial health of the organization has to be passed upon or planned by the advisory council lrh office of lrh financial planning authority can set aside advisory council decisions in any financial planning matter whether referred to him or not only large transactions or important long range decisions should be referred to the office of lrh and then only when the advisory council is divided disbursement section the disbursement section furnishes the data without which financial planning is impossible short summary of the data required for financial planning is as follows the disbursement section files every bill received in the disbursement files those bills that are repetitive are filed in folders under the company name the one time bills are filed in loose folder for single month the disbursement section has made up mimeographed form this is the monthly bills summary this form has the name of each company with which the org does business plus adequate blanks after each alphabet letter for new companies to be added this form has four columns the first column is the company owed the second column is the grand total of money owed that company the third column is the amount that is past due the fourth column is the month since when the bill has been past due all bills are filed on arrival they are not kept out and entered they are filed in the folders this is important one must pay bills just taken from the post and save up they are promptly filed then one takes the folders one by one and makes up the monthly bills summary as each folder is taken up the bills are examined for correctness straightened up and entered in the monthly bills summary 48 the way the system breaks down is to make up too many folders only repeating creditor rates folder one the org does business with routinely like the light company the landlord the paper company etc the occasional bills go into the folder for the month each time monthly bills summary is made up the occasional folders for past months containing unpaid bills are gone through again and added to the statement the statement for one month complete then tells one the total monies owed by the org for that month thus there is statement for each month the monthly bills summary is due in the hands of the ad council on the second tuesday of each month bank reconciliation section the bank reconciliation section of the dept of records assets and material makes up the latest bank records of monies on deposit concurrent with the monthly bills summary this section once each month concurrent with the monthly bills summary reconciles all bank statements tapes all cancelled cheques on their counterfoils and in short makes certain there are bank errors or omissions monthly accounts summary is then prepared showing the amount in each bank account this too is mimeographed form showing the names of the bank used cheques outstanding etc it also carries total sum of monies in the bank this form also carries section devoted to loans outstanding that the org must pay this form made out is submitted to the ad council on the 2nd tuesday of each month income note collections summary the collections section the collections section of the department of income submits to the ad council form called the income note collections summary this form carries an amount for cash collectible from notes possible to collect and cash collectible from notes past due and the amount of notes that are apparently uncollectible the total is added into grand total of credit advanced it gives the total of payments received during the month past the 1st to the last day of the month it gives the number of statements mailed in the month just past it gives the number of persons with overdue notes who have been handed over to the director of clearing and passed on to field staff members it gives the number of notes to date given to lawyers for collection that remain uncollected this income note collections summary is placed in the hands of the advisory council on the 2nd tuesday of each month advisory council action the first action of the advisory council is to prepare and get mimeographed the three forms described herein the second action of the advisory council is to make sure the org division is so organized as to be able to make out the forms provided easily that their files are so arranged as to do so and that personnel exists to do them the third action of the advisory council is to make sure the persons making up the forms know this and other pertinent policy letters the fourth action of the advisory council is to make sure that it receives the proper forms on the second tuesday of each month ready for use in financial planning the fifth and continuing action of the advisory council is to make sure routinely the forms are accurate and actual and not generalized or roughly estimated the sixth and most important action each month is to plan financially on the basis of the three reports and set limits or restraints on pos or personnel numbers or whatever is necessary to achieve outgo less than income and get or keep the org solvent 49 income the advisory councils actions of assigning conditions to divisions on the basis of the gross divisional statistic and actions in straightening up divisions in emergency and pushing standard promotion as per hco policy letter 22nd november 1965 will keep income up it is more vital to pressure income up than to save money by financial planning restrictions the emergency formula places rightly economy after promotion promotion comes first but economy is also vital it is handled in relation to income when income is far down the advisory council simply shuts off all but promotionally vital pos where division is in emergency the ad council shuts off all pos except those vital to promotion in that division the tendency of division in emergency is sometimes to demand extravagant or unwise purchases cheque signing the cheque signing line contains all three of the above reports as of the last time they were prepared and tape of all cheques paid since cheque signing policy as already released thus requires the other two monthly reports as well as the other items specified to that policy also add that cheque signer must to sign cheque also have before him the last issued orders of financial planning it is very easy to confuse cheque signing line with financial planning line they are however completely different one signs any cheque only after financial planning has been done and with the total reports of financial planning and decisions taken before one cheque signing is secondary action and is the result of financial planning decisions one pays only what financial planning has okayed to be paid and how disbursement action when financial planning indicates what to pay or not to pay disbursement makes up the cheques and sends the lot to cheque signers cheques signed during the period are signed as authorized by financial planning each week such as franking machine fsm commissions and petty cash up to may be paid in the coming month this part of the financial planning minutes of each meeting is the guide by which weekly cheques are made up submitted to signers signed and sent summary unless all these actions are done an org cannot in fact prosper has poor credit and is generally upset one has to get in the income that is done by making divisions do their proper promotions and keep their statistics up the mechanism is gross divisional statistics assignment of conditions and investigating and putting right divisions in emergency by ad council personal inspection sometimes where divisional emergency is continued too long the ad council has to order an emeter and case survey of its personnel as an sp is surely about in financial planning one safeguards what one gets in as described above cheque signers and po signers are not necessarily ad council members but whether they are or not are governed entirely by the last ad council financial planning directive the financial planning directive of the month is issued promptly after the second tuesday meeting of the month as an exec division admin letter with the month and financial planning of it in caps such as financial planning for march this is the second part of the ad council assignment of conditions to divisions long range planning also appears on this directive this long range financial planning is not binding and is often changed in view of current happenings it is guide by which other executives can tentatively plan lrhepcard l ron hubbard copyright c 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 50 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 21 december 1965 6 copies to each org master files org exec sec hat hco exec sec hat org sec hat dir dept s lrh communicator lrh financial relationships to orgs after careful review of various tax situations in orgs i have come to the following conclusion 1 that understanding is given by tax officials when the relationships of lrh an individual to organizations has been handled on very charitable basis by lrh an individual 2 that when lrh an individual does not precisely bill and demand payment of debts by orgs to lrh an individual the tax authorities twist the matter to our discredit 3 that leniency where financial relationships between lrh an individual and any org rebounds to our discredit tax wise 4 that when sums owing by an org to lrh an individual are not fully accounted for in the books and balance sheets of an org as due and owing to lrh an individual tax problems arise for the org and for lrh an individual 5 that tax problems stem from the leniency in this relationship for fifteen years i have personally paid for research have loaned and advanced orgs money have guaranteed their overdrafts have given them the benefit of my personal credit rating which is high i have not sought for reimbursement i have not collected adequate pay or given orgs bills for what they owe the 10 sent by orgs is fully consumed by administrative service and much more than 10 and is routinely invoiced to the managing organization and spent by it or is sometimes held by lrh as trustee it is not given to lrh an individual as records prove without exception all this for 15 years has been an effort on my part to help our organizations but it is interpreted in other ways by tax officials winds orgs up with what it owes lrh an individual showing as profit and upsets lrh an individuals personal tax picture thus i have had to conclude that the majority of tax troubles stems from orgs not keeping proper record of monies owed to lrh an individual b lrh an individual not regularly billing orgs for monies owed c lrh an individual not exacting proper salary payment and reimbursement in 1966 we will begin to set this right recapitulation will have to be made and records corrected although it is not easy to imagine that benign attitude on the part of lrh an individual is incomprehensible to tax officials it is easy to realize that tax persons are unused to dealing with unselfish acts and suspect anyone so engaging therefore the following policies are laid down every org must carefully record and keep in record all sums owing to lrh an individual b all sums owing to lrh an individual must be reflected on yearly balance sheets c adequate salary and compensation must be allowed for lrh an individual by all orgs d the office of lrh must also keep record the office of lrh must bill the orgs routinely f sums so owing must be paid g every effort must be made to set the earlier records in order h the current indebtedness must be carefully accounted for 1 the lrh communicator is responsible for the lrh an individual financial sums 51 appearing in the balance sheets of the org and that routine bills are rendered note these policies stem from us internal revenue actions by which the founding church of washington dc is under threat of large tax bills it does not owe and the tiny amount reimbursed to lrh an individual for actual outlays on behalf of that org are under challenge and actual sums owing to lrh an individual are not properly recorded or taken into account all the trouble stems from the lack of to i policies immediately above definitions lrh an individual means l ron hubbard private person as distinct from trustee director or staff member lrh an individual often advances goods or sums without reimbursement has borne the whole cost of research of scientology and used his own money to found organizations lrh trustee this is l ron hubbard in the capacity of trustee as distinct from director or individual or staff member lrh trustee holds money for corporations or persons or holds property for them lrh trustee for transfer for some years the commonwealth overseas not us interests belonging to the hubbard association of scientologists international incorporated in arizona have been held by lrh trustee for transfer as the overseas interests were worthless to the us corporation in the us hasi arizona due to currency exchange laws and was costing it money the board of hasi arizona appointed lrh trustee for transfer for all commonwealth corporation property or interests with orders to hand it over to uk corporation as arizona law forbids giving the assets to any but non profit corporation nonprofit uk and commonwealth corporations had to be formed the uk tax authorities make company operate for year before declaring it nonprofit so far commonwealth company has been granted tax exemption for companies lrh attempted to form hasi ltd was such an effort non profit status was refused it but progress is now being made in another direction so these assets can be delivered eventually to uk and commonwealth companies lrh director is director on the board of directors of several companies salary may be paid for this post lrh staff member works on staffs as case consultant training officer lecturer design and planning consultant promotions adviser and department head of the office of lrh and as such should receive compensation as staff member his expenses are paid by orgs the predianetic salary level of lrh an employee was several times that given by orgs subsequently 10 royalty lrh an individual owns since he paid for the original research as well as later research and never received salary for doing it all copyrights registered marks and trade marks and rights of dianetics and scientology orgs send 10 to saint hill and this is used by hasi to administer orgs paying for communication costs administration bulletins etc etc it is invoiced to the saint hill org and has never been given to lrh an individual matter of record some us 10s have been held by lrh trustee and returned in legal in loans and other official matters to orgs in the us therefore the 10 royalty owed for use of name materials and research by orgs has never in fact been paid the franchise 10 is similarly used up by saint hill in giving service org or field auditor or franchise holder has ever paid for its use of name copyrights material writing and research salary lrh an individual has received salary from time to time always less than that given to comparable positions in other orgs it is currently œ25 week advance i have tried to put as little financial strain as possible on scientology orgs this is not understood and we are penalized for it therefore we must bring earlier arrangements up to date and keep current this does not mean i want money i spend my money on behalf of scientology one way or another anyway it does mean that to stay away from tax trouble in the future we must understand and put my relationships to orgs on sound current footing financially and keep scrupulous records of it lrhmlrd l ron hubbard copyright c 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 52 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 4 january 1966 issue vi gen nonremimeo lrh communicator hat hco area sec hat exec sec hats org secs hats lrh relationships to orgs i have several posts and relationships to orgs which make up several identities unless these are understood many errors can occur not the least of which are tax errors and not the least dangerous power pushes and upsets for instance there are two offices of lrh at saint hill and one more for every other org this is familiar situation it has happened in phoenix dc and londonl always specially work with the org where i am situated as well as continue to handle all other orgs on an international basis and remain the chief executive of each org elsewhere an org where i am making more than other orgs always bears the expense of international activities in this case here at saint hill the org also shares international income and so its cost is light thus i have several hats and resultant comm lines here at saint hill and at least one more in each org these can be described as identities and posts as follows lrh an individual this is lrh private person this identity is the one who is entitled to any royalties and leases copyrights and trademarks and technology for use by scientology organizations this identity paid for and did the research organized the organizations this is the identity that loans orgs money or guarantees their bank accounts etc and on death is private trust for my family lrh trustee this identity is trustee who holds in trust properties and money for scientology and since 1957 has held uk and commonwealth corporations in trust for the original us company until these assets can be transferred to uk nonprofit corporation as uk tax people will not okay such nonprofit status until after year of operation we have formed other corporations in the uk and commonwealth time and again only to have them refused nonprofit status the laws of arizona prevent transfer of hasi assets abroad to any but corporation with nonprofit status this leaves as trustee of all assets outside the us until they can be transferred but even after transfer i will still be trustee for scientology corporations all money sent to lrh an individual is received by lrh trustee or corporation and is seldom paid to lrh an individual but turned over to companies without being given to lrh an individual this is vital point often missed even by accountants who then get us involved if the money were 1 received by lrh an individual and then 2 turned over to lrh trustee andor 3 received and used by company it would hang lrh an individual for huge tax sums for money he has never really received or used and indeed wont ever get example mr x sends 20 franchise pay to l ron hubbard this is always invoiced by an org as franchise payment therefore one concludes that lrh in that case is lrh trustee if one erred and said it was the income of lrh an individual that identity never seeing the money would yet owe tax on it which is unfair all 53 incoming 10s to lrh mean lrh trustee and are used in company expenses or are put away to be in general defense the point of confusion is that lrh an individual is actually owed those 1 10s as royalties to support research etc but the companies receive and use the money and it doesnt even go through the hands of lrh an individual lrh an individual has not cancelled monies owed to him he has not received them lrh trustee seldom gives lrh an individual any scientology money tax authorities are astounded at this believing the worst of everyone but those on our accounts lines know it is so this is lrh trustee trustee is an identity and activity almost all movements churches and benevolent associations have and in each case the trustee does just what lrh trustee is doing safeguarding property and assets of an association its very usual role lrh board member this is an unpaid identity on several boards it is entitled only to outofpocket expenses and almost never puts in for any this is member of board of directors these must be paid salary in nonprofit corporation only expenses chairman comes under this also president lrh executive director this is better understood as general manager as it isnt as member of the board that it is held but as manager this is paid post in any corporation or association there are numerous lrh exec dir titles and identities for this title repeats in each area and org and in the international division it means highest executive of the organization third member of the advisory council head of the department called the office of lrh therefore there is one of these titles for each org we have and for the international exec division as well perth for instance has an lrh executive director perth has lrh executive director etc then there is lrh executive director ww the identity of the lrh communicator in the org or activity gives clue to this each lrh executive director title has an lrh communicator there are two lrh communicators at saint hill lrh communicator ww who attends to each org for lrh executive director ww via each orgs lrh communicator and lrh communicator sh who handles the traffic both of lrh executive director ww as sent to it from the lrh communicator ww and for lrh executive director sh this is only possible as the orgs are all similarly engaged hco area secs filled this role for years and still do where there is lrh communicator hco area secs still have duties for the executive director regardless of the lrh communicator as old policy letters show sec ed issue is one of these proper routing from an org is through the lrh comm of that org to lrh executive director of that org and forwarded on to lrh comm ww who sees that lrh exec dir that org receives it in absence lrh exec dir ww may issue blanket order concerning it but it is usually answered by lrh exec dir that org the advisory council of any org operates without its third member lrh exec dir of that org but in case of disputes or errors finds lrh exec dir that org taking it up lrh staff member in addition to all these other identities and titles there is that of lrh staff member as such i give staff lectures in the org where i am assist where i can crack cases and train students as coordinator of research meaning application of 54 research write magazines take pictures act as routing expert listen to problems and do lot of other things i am chiefly staff member of the org where i am located but am also staff member of each org complexity necessarily one person can hold all these posts and identites but at the same time over the years i have found they are the minimum number i must give attention to to handle this complexity i have many persons assisting i expect them to act with initiative i expect them to carry out the purposes i have regarding orgs and scientology so as to keep things expanding and the lines clean and flowing and keep from getting so involved on just one point i cant do the rest of my jobs for quite in addition to these posts i have my research hat our most important hat and an organizing hat and promotion hat and public relations hat my writingbooks hat should absorb most of my time with research complete but not wholly published thus i expect people to do their jobs so i can then do my job and dont like people to flub theirs and require special attention on it only this holds us back because i then cant do my jobs which eventually breaks down our expansion and dissemination other arrangements many other arrangements have been tried fewer identities less traffic for but each time some catastrophe has occurred this then required more work than wearing that hat in the first place the early dianetic corporative catastrophes occurred because i did not have or wear all my exec director hats and had legal control of the orgs since i began to wear these and took responsibility things have been much better indeed so i cant shed them so these identities are minimum by trial and error and by success summary anyone on high executive and accounts lines should understand these things thoroughly and lrh communicators should point them out only when these relationships are misunderstood do we get in trouble our growth depends on our staying out of trouble getting our lines in and keeping corporate structure straight and understanding these separate identities or titles and functions and using them it is doubtful if this situation will change as orgs grow my assistants grow also and become more competent and refer less to and work on delegated authority my work is lighter the bigger we get so eventually i will hold only titles with actions or duties this can be continued easily and so there is need to reduce identities to simplify lines and there wouldnt even be need to reorganize if i wasnt there in the flesh at all all i need to do is work out succession of assistants to make the activities continue there is succession of myself to be worked out in any identity regardless of what happens to simply because i did the original work and as it is done there is reason to have succession for it as it is itself 55 my identities are therefore woven in to the pattern so they dont have to be altered to keep things going lrh an individual becomes an estate the rest is by appointment from lrh executive director with that title activated by the int adcouncil or board but still used as title but not of person the office of lrh is part of org structure and before long even lrh board member will be needless to be filled in the flesh by delegated signature of lrh this is not only today then but tomorrow as well and the above identities are firm as identities whether i am here or not even today 99 of my functions are done by delegated authority the 1 left is heavy enough for 20 men but it is getting lighter each year and so can be seen to be only post in few years and so it can continue trying to fill up the post is all that would cause war so leave it activated as itself none assigned to it assistance to it by established formula we wont vanish if i as person vanish and these identities never were anyway so they can survive it is part of basic org structure my post title is used ten thousand times day on matters i never will hear of so why should i hear of any in the long run as only the delegation of authority is in action anyway so whatever happens to as person leave these lrh identities on the org board unfilled and all will be well if you try to fill them catastrophe will result only how authority is delegated by lrh executive director in my absence needs to be worked out and that will be published somebody some day will say this is illegal by then be sure the orgs say what is legal or not l ron hubbard lrhmlrd copyright c 1966 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 56 hubbard

obtained from the office of the treasurer ww this policy letter does not interrupt or cancel any obligation of the org to account to governments for the year 1965 the earliest reports to be done by the treasurer will be 1966 all orgs must adhere severely to the 20th century accounting systems of scientology without variation and may not revert in any way to older accounting methods as these obscure from executives of the org their true financial position and delay knowledge of affairs the office of the treasurer is formed to make the burden of accounting easier and to regularize the

hill manor east grinstead sussex remimeo ad council members hco policy letter of 15 december 1966 financial planning set of proportionate figures recently compiled on financial planning at saint hill are of general interest to ad council members the period chosen was fairly average one for income covering the three months 12 weeks late august sept october 1966 four sums of monies actually disbursed were obtained these were 1 total salaries paid 2 total gross of building pos would constitute maintenance expenses and rent 3 total gross org expenses 4 total fsm commissions the total gross income of the period was added up 10 was deducted from it for research adding up to admin 10 of most orgs 10 of the gross was taken to operate as reserve or to catch up errors and overages in planning and in case income went down in the next quarter the remaining 80 was then proportioned amongst 1 to 4 above the percentage results were as follows 1 total salaries pd government payroll deductions 2 total building 3 total org expenses 4 fsm commissions 10 admin or research 10 leeway or reserve this gives some sort of guide 31 4 17 21 7 80 10 10 100 during this period the org was being pulled up from high bills low cash ratio so the expense sum is perhaps trifle high and it had building programme going so building pos may be trifle high its leeway or reserve simply paid off back bills however the fact remains that this was period of gain of org financial affairs and being at the end of summer and into autumn not period of extraordinary income which occurs just before summer at saint hill so it is felt that these percentages are safe the way one could use this table would be to calculate the past quarter of the years gross income when the new quarter begins and then allocate these percentages each month for the next quarter 61 the percentages took 12 weeks quarter but expenses were also for 12 weeks so they are just percentages and so are valid for 13 week quarter let us say income janfebmar 13 weeks was q dollars one could then divide q by 13 and get an estimated future weekly gross figure we will call this w meaning gross income for week one could then divide q by 312 and get an estimated future monthly gross income average we could call this m therefore to set ceiling on all expenses for the coming 13 weeks for each week we would have 31 x w weekly salaries 04 x w weekly tax pd by company or personnel 17 x w building and rent ceiling 21 x w weekly org expense ceiling 07 x w fsm commission estimate 10 x w admin or research 10 10 x w leeway or reserve 10 then we would also have our figures as an estimate ofmonthly expenses where financial planning is done monthly 31 x m salariesmonth 04 x m company pd salary tax 17 x m bldg and rent ceiling 21 x m org exp ceiling 07 x m fsm commission estimate 10 x m monthly admin or research 10 10 x m leeway or reserve 10 org exp includes all utilities bills services the lot by keeping to or under these figures one could then be considered to be planning safely by getting departments and divisions to turn in their estimated pos before the beginning of the month for the next month one could plan successfully remembering their pos dont include utilities and many routine bills which must be deducted from the org expense amount before one signs any pos it is realized that where one is on 55 of 90 proportionate pay plan the above indicated safe salary sum is greatly exceeded which is on in all 35 of 80 this may be why orgs tend to develop high billslow cash ratio lack of stability poor financial picture and expense money may reflect back on the gross income tending to depress it and thus really reduce wages despite the 55 of 90 proportionate wage allocation the staff might make more and have more future if their pay was only 31 of 80 with 4 of 80 for tax certainly staff at saint hill makes more than staff in other orgs and has consistently even in low income years anyway there are some figures on which financial planning can be based l ron hubbard founder lrhjprd copyright c 1966 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 62 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 25 june 1967 all executives of all orgs all accountants lrh finance comm ot central committee guardian ww treasurer ww scientology orgs tax and balance sheets there is confusion on the subject of tax and balance sheets as they involve or concern monies owed on balance sheets extraordinary solutions are being advanced and the matter should be reviewed there are certain principles involved here which vitally affect scientology companies as companies and indeed are basic in any business 1 if you acquire the profit of an asset without paying for it all monies received become false profit and taxable 2 if you invoice money as your own that is in fact owed to someone else you wind up with false profit and get taxed for it 3 there are certain principles of business having to do with income and debts which cannot be thrown aside even by tax department 4 the moment you vary from the exact truth of any transaction you involve yourself in potential confusion that requires extraordinary solutions 5 when you find yourself being asked for extraordinary solutions you have departed from the truth of the transaction as tax departments have never to my knowledge accepted without question the years return or balance sheet of any corporation efforts to get such departments to accept return or balance sheet by putting in wild solutions avail nothing the tax people arent going to accept anything at all anyway ever without challenge if you are challenged you better have the real facts right there this doesnt mean one should tell them all the truth in geyser and gush the real stable datum in handling tax people is never volunteer any information it does mean one must not tell them or give them false data it only means that when you give them data you cant back up or report profit you didnt make you will get into severe trouble the basic errors of scientology corporations in accounting and tax matters lie in 1 to 5 above under 1 all existing companies have acquired assets from without paying for them and therefore show false profit they sell books they do not own the copyrights for acquire technology they never paid for and in the case of saint hill acquired business worth upwards of two million pounds and an estate worth œ80000 without ever showing any debt so the profits then look very large in any scientology company and this involves them with tax because the government accuses them of paying which they dont they think it must be crime to pay anything and so are pushed into profit situation because they have never paid for their main assets of course tax department wants to see them with big profit which can be taxed and so blocks the truthful fact that the companies owe money 63 recently law in england passed by the boilermakers playing politician threatened to call any company close company which owed any money to an individual and put close company tax at 67 well the loophole is that if they dont owe it to an individual theyd pay tax anyway at high percent and if they did owe it theyd have profit and 67 of nothing is exactly nothing so using the close company law to say i cant be owed anything is just bad thinking and it leaves sh with œ2m of profit that can be taxed which it doesnt really own as profit at all under 2 above whenever you invoice money as your own income that is owed to somebody else you wind up with false profit on which you will then have to pay tax you dont owe let us take an advanced clinical course i have given i paid my fare often the bulk of expenses and took fee the acc was invoiced in as org income yet it wasnt it was my income yet the org not only invoiced it in it didnt even note on its balance sheets it owed it to and so wound up with taxable profit take the book dianetics modern science of mental health as property i bought it back from the publishers in new york for 15000 of my cash i turned it over to the distribution center inc in dc which then sold tons of copies of it invoiced each one as its own income and never paid any royalty at all further it never noted on its balance sheets it owed for it and soon had us tax bills against it for its profit in addition to all that dc london and notably saint hill have taken over bank accounts of mine have invoiced royalties owed to only for movies and books even my veterans cheques and yet never noted in any balance sheet or return that it owed it so it wound up with taxable sum of course the government tax offices will say not to put down your debts as then they have profit to tax under 3 governments can pass all the legislation they want but certain business actions remain themselves one buys one sells one collects one owes the government would like to upset all this but truth is government really can not even in russia as they are flying in the teeth of the fundamentals of commercial interchange if one acquires 10 dress for nothing one now has 10 worth more than one had before if one paid 10 out and took 10 dress in the books balance thief must be in continual trouble in economics and with tax agencies as he acquires without spending which leaves him heavily asseted without debt and so taxable to the hilt under 4 above the moment you depart from the truth of records with explanations or gimmicks you cannot substantiate your statements the records longer line up so you have to destroy the accounts system or muck it up so it cant be read and promptly you are in real trouble you can assign new values to some data you can honestly reassess the meaning of your figures such as advanced payments are not income but note you are going in the direction of more truth the truth of scientology orgs is that i built them with my own money which they didnt record and made them affluent where they are without pay i gave them technology they did not nuance books on which they pay royalty and cash they forgot to mark down the result is that they show profit which does not exist in fact as the wherewithal by which the money was made was not ever reimbursed not only were assets acquired which had not been paid for but additional monies were invoiced they did not have coming the result is an apparent profit and of course trouble with the tax people 64 under 5 when you depart from facts and basic planning you then have to have very extraordinary solutions and when you seem to have to have extraordinary solutions you have departed from basics and fact right now there is lot of tax yap and it is being set up to clobber scientology with huge tax bills in england and the us this isnt because people are mad at scientology its because scientology orgs have given themselves huge swollen profit by not keeping good records and by not letting the real debts be debts every sp on the lines is of course frantic at the thought of ron getting hold of any money what will ron do with it more research more orgs more scn more freedom the record clearly states this is the case when i draw 10000 as repayment of debt which it was i promptly expand scn to make it another 100000 so it goes sometimes in development some money gets wasted but it always comes back 10 for 1 in the long run so of course an sp tries anything or says anything to prevent my getting hold of any more money than i have and all sorts of weird laws and opinions are dug up to show that i cant be paid the last phoney was that if money owed was shown on current balance sheets then all past years of all orgs would have to be redone not so its up to the government to demand that and in that case it would all be corrected anyway so its argument and wouldnt even happen in past orgs i had control i longer have it so its natural that the investment had to be added up and paid back debt is debt newly discovered debts are common in any accounting system so what does one do report it all as profit arid get taxed out of existence and help it happen by telling liethat it owes money as for the sale of sh to c of s of calif the tax on any sum paid is on not the org so it is not the orgs business it is the orgs business to be sitting there with the full income of several million all invoiced as profit that is the road to ruin taxwise there are lot of people around who know best this best usually winds us up in the soup my orders on this stand and are not open to opinion and these orders are 1 record in balance sheets as owed proper payment for any property or business acquired from 2 record all sums invoiced into an org that were really mine as still owed to 3 carry on with standard incomeoutgo recordings and business procedures regardless of law 4 tell and record the exact truth of all transactions past and present 5 put into effect the basic solutions i have written out in full for the handling of monies and debts dont be dismayed because somebody in panic says one must do something odd to stay within the law they probably dont realize how lawful our conduct of business really is and scientology orgs if they record their debts owed for assets and their incorrect invoicing of my money as their own and report what is really owed on their balance sheets will come out straight on tax the governments are in the business of falsifying other peoples records so as to collect more tax if you report bad debt they say its good debt if you report debt you owe they say it isnt debt they can be counted on absolutely to assign significances to figures to increase tax but even the craziest pervert in the tax office 65 cant argue down actual records so your only defense is actual records when you fall for the gag that you must falsify your records to satisfy some law or some cookey official stick you are just playing into their hands further some accountants paint black pictures of the government to cow their clients and ask them to falsify records by omitting actual facts or demanding weird solutions the thing to do is stick with the truth and the real invoices doggedly now as to tax why this is mainly anybodys game of what is profit the thing to do is to assign significance to the figures before the government can the whole thing is mess only because arithmetic figures are symbols open to any significance so i normally think of better significance than the government can i always put enough errors on return to satisfy their bloodsucking appetite and still come out zero the game of accounting is just game of assigning significances to figures the man with the most imagination wins but there must be correct figures and there must not be gross misassignment of debts as profits or the whole thing wont hang together income tax is suppressive effort to crush individuals and businesses and deprive the state of national gross product since none can expand the thing which baffles any suppressive is truth its the only thing that works significances one assigns figures are neither true nor false but always must be reasonable and defendable and the figures themselves must always check out income does not mean profit one can and should make all the income one possibly can always the only crime really is to be broke but when one makes income be sure it is accounted for as to its source and that one covers it with expenses and debts handling taxation is as simple as that scientology income is high in most orgs but it is high due to the investment of time and money in earlier years so if the balance sheets omit all the money that was invested and show only the money that was made they are false balance sheets and that is what the government wants us to turn in false balance sheet that shows all income as profit with repayment ot retirement of debt yesterdays unreported debts became invested money for expansion the debts of 1950 have not been lost at all where they remain unpaid but show up as developed business when the debt was not paid that sum was used to expand so the debt is still there and todays profit in small way can be traced to the orgs not having to pay instead the money was used to develop the org and area the income from that development is still there thus the debt must be there must be shown on the balance sheets and books or it will involve the org eventually in tax trouble l ron hubbard founder lrhjpcden copyright c 1967 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 66 hubbard

decisions can mess up the pro of whole area unpaid bills can ruin your pro in whole town so there is lot of pro connected with accounts actions repairing the damages done by not submitting correct accounts to customers or failing to pay commercial bills or rents or utilities is pro action and requires sane thought and careful handling so as to restore the orgs pro the biggest crime one can commit in this modern society is to be without money even in supersocialism this is crime for an org not to have and make lots of money is stupid given potentially remunerative activity only thoroughly lousy service and horribly bad handling of promotion or criminal carelessness in accounts can leave an org without money doing standard org actions giving excellent service and adequate promotion brings m plenty of money the outnesses which prevent income or waste outgo have to be truly glaring and goofy to leave an org without money the way to have pro is to have money at all lack of money or wild outnesses in handling money can practically destroy an orgs pro credit as quality is sort of god in western society if your credit is bad that finishes you to one and all it is statement far worse than mere murderer it must be since psychiatry murders daily but is well thought of in governments so you get the extreme value of good credit dateline paying and other accounts policies prevent bad credit but when it has gone bad it takes making money and brilliant pro actions to restore good credit image and it must be restored money as total motivation for an action is not high grade motivation in espionage services the man who works for money only is expected to turn his coat and allegiance and is regarded with contempt but money is basic point of judgement on which higher levels of motivation can be built in wog world it is pro to the commercial world which has real dedications so billing debtors and paying creditors have high pro value to an org all this can become strange cycle the org mucks up its area let us say by bad 71 or indifferent service promotion then is unreal so the org pro with customers collapses these dont buy service the org runs out of money its bills mount up and its commercial community pro collapses so it has public credit there goes the org accounts is the area hit and will go on being hit until it begins to insist on good service the repair of all bad service good real promotion and finds money to spend on promotion then money will come in accounts actions must now pro the commercial field get that handled with good pro accompanied by money on dateline payments and sound arrangements further money is spent on more promotion former bad service is handled credit is reestablished in the area any accounts trouble with customers is cleared up the org is fully there again i there is substitute in accounts pro for knowing ones finance policy and following it sloppy accounts files financial planning purchase order system ignorance of finance policy as in the finance checksheet can lead an org directly into losing its community pro regardless of service quality or promotion so just as accounts can be mucked up by lack of money coming from bad service or bad promotion it also happens that accounts all by itself can wreck an orgs community pro therefore it is vital to pro that an org 1 has its accounts personnel have their accounts hats on and finance policy being closely followed that financial planning is real and income remains greater than outgo 3 that adequate funds are available for promotion and that org funds do not get all soaked up by the hco and oes divisions on film cabinets and new roofing paper 4 that the pcs and students customers of the org are handled to generate high pro on their accounts contacts 5 that the commercial connections of the org in the community the orgs creditors are smoothly handled to generate high pro 6 that any adverse reactions along accounts lines are instantly handled to restore good pro these can include covert operation to ones creditors by some enemy which is handled by proving the falsity of the accusation they can include wrong change failure to refund reluctant or inaccurate or failed payment to field staff members these and any other adverse accounts action must be pushed back to good pro fast lack of money comes from slow or bad service and failure to go flat out to remedy it or from or poor or unreal promotion or money can stem directly from offpolicy or messy handling of accounts and org finances in the final analysis its pro world and high pro cannot be effected for an org if there is anything wrong in its accounts lines thus pro is affected strongly by accounts and finance actions our orgs do not go into debt do not finance themselves by borrowings our orgs make their own way that is why they are still our orgs and accounts pro has lot to do with it l ron hubbard founder lrhrscden copyright c 1969 by l ron hubbard all

bills files have prices but many items are infrequently purchased and have price on file or easily accessible or vital dissem mailing may lack the 3 required quotes when fp is held this leaves fp members with 3 choices 1 delay the whole fp to obtain the missing prices 2 delete the unpriced items ignoring need 3 accept pos which although apparently valid are actually guess and which get the

red po approval and only at the po authorized cost or less never more fp action date and time of fp meeting published in orders of the day or by staff notice board sets the deadline for submission of newly prepared epos and red pos for the coming week or month the primary requirement is coverage of all necessities fp members take up epos and red pos in meeting against the gross amount established as available for pt expenditure at the moment when pos and estimated pos thus presented reach the established sum the epo and po signing is stopped further pos are acceptable except those subsequently raised against the approved epos as pos and epos presented often exceed the allocated sum prior to fp meeting the first action of the meeting is adjustment or elimination to meet the allowed total before any epos or pos may be signed fp approval authority should require rejected pos and epos submitted by separate folder with completed fp for check of items rejected any real essential found rejected in favor of items less vital to function and promotion causes fp to be reconvened or is adjusted by the fp authority himself department of disbursements dept 8 receives from fp approved red

the appropriate company ships being mobile and having many creditors normally file pos and bills by month instead bills arriving then match up with the red pos already in the bills file and are subject to payment by dateline po signers po signing and fp approval is by fbo or agf dgf or ag if held from above where there is one so units and ships having fbo send fps and red pos to the area fbo

is neither fbo nor agf or ag occurs at exec sec level any exec dir may add himself as mandatory signer if he considers org financial position warrants it signature of red po exceeding the epo amount would be occasional and would be only on receipt of factual advice by dept 8 that there exists sufficient overage on other epos to compensate there is obligation to sign he may require the epo held for next fp and the shortage made up by second epo at that time epo and red po matching epos and red pos usually match up oneforone but not always 1 an item too costly for allocation by one fp meeting may hold aside epos of partial cost until accumulated epos reach the total cost this would give several epos against one final red po for actual purchase thus purchase of large item can be covered by several months epos for it accumulated from fps granting it 2 sometimes single epo may also accumulate red pos against it routine org supply items for february could be div 3 epo against which there could be red po for dispatch paper one for carbon one for pens etc maybe more is needed few weeks later and theres second red po for dispatch paper ships never know exact agent fees until arrival in port and sometimes not even then thus there is an epo for agents fees for january against which red pos for actual agent bills accumulate such an epo is good until its total value has been used up by red pos it is then removed from epo file as expired red pos raised against this type are in duplicate so that the original can go to bills file leaving copy attached to the still valid epo to indicate partial use of the total amount the most usual type of epo is oneforone and expires on use of single red po 76 to match iteven when there is money left over due to actual cost being less than estimate how to activate this policy letter 1 have adequate copies of the attached epo form mimeoed off and distributed to div secs 2 have this policy checked out on all div secs and staff and particularly on execs 3 require that the necessities of each division are represented by red pos or epos at the time of regular fp meeting 4 see that epos do represent divisional needs and allow change or swap of epos after fp meeting epos do not represent divisional allocation subject to change of amount or use an epo for light bulbs cannot become something else its light bulbs or nothing epos do not substitute for planning they only make it smoother and more real 5 enforce it if necessary by assignment of pay loss to any division or staff member neglecting vital needs or requesting other items at the expense of real necessities 6 groove your div 3 in thoroughly on epo and po handling as in this pl 7 refine it by preparation and use of divisional checklists of materiel needs required to effectively promote and deliver 8 refine it further by organizing 5th disbursement voucher copy for routing of vouchers to the div sec concerned so that divisional cost reference file builds up 9 apply the use of epos to improvement of fp ease and effectiveness an epo system properly applied and supplementary to the existing purchase order system which is unchanged gives the margin that allows simple and effective fp action without which the untended materiel needs of division or org can suddenly leap up as real emergency 10 recognize any other use of this system as misapplication to be reported to ethics and to result in starrate checkout of the offender on this policy letter and personal payment for any unauthorized or illegal purchase or expense to the org in excess of authorized

1971 remimeo add finance checksheet all fp members financial planning tips fp need not be burden at all if these five conditions exist then fp is very easy 1 produce as an activity look over what your products should be particularly your valuable final products and then begin to get those products somehow anyhow this and only this is the shining reason why you can have decent allocation if it is then denied you you can howl and be sure of redress cap in hand with product is sure route to chopped fp example an org with half million collectable on its books but which didnt even send out statements had an awful time with fp asking for allocations that were really handouts neither its fp body nor its fbo fully understood why but it just seemed unreal to give it money it was asking for money it wasnt requesting the return to it of money it had made and was entitled to it did not make other value so could not justify value therefore it sort of looked odd to finance even finance did not know why the wildest example of this was the 1950 foundation which under us navy exrear admiral wanted 47000 week to subsidize foundation potentially making 80000 week but he closed its doors and wouldnt run it until he could get legal and subsidized another one is ok 1969 wanting flag to pay it 3000 week to keep it going when it wasnt even sending out letters and did not even own typewriter yet was accidentally making 5500 week average there are tons of such examples activities go on to government appropriation think instead of promote sell collect and deliver and wind up with pay food uniforms and fp troubles and conflicts you wouldnt believe possible 2 know your finance pack when members of fp bodies have not done their finance pack they get into total confusion further any finance authority gets disgusted with their admin irregularities and wont regard their propositions or troubles with any seriousness failure to do refusal to do finance pack which only takes couple part time study days can give an fp body bad name with finance people simply because their ignorance is mistaken for foolish proposals 3 separate out different types of expenditure an early fo on title of various items helps clarify find out and get it agreed to what is covered under title permanent title b valuable nonexpendable and title c issuable or usable and get finance to agree to what is which and exactly what one is doing fp on and the tangle becomes easier to undo what is permanent fixture does one fp for new ships new buildings vital repairs vital spares actually but it has to be covered in general finance is one fping for gimmicks and oddities and possibly useful things title b or is one fping for expendables wages food fuel papers title c maybe one fps for all three but in the category of necessities to operate and would be nice and future hopes necessary spare parts for title that would break everything down are of course necessities so probably should pass without question whereas finance people often dont see them that way wages food uniforms fuel are subject to cutbacks where an activity is not able to demonstrate production good idea title b usually comes in for purchase when the activity is really making the money and otherwise are yawn future hopes depend totally upon ones profitable use of what one has once you get all this agreed to with finance people they cant change the rules on you every fp and lot of the strain goes out of it fo or pl could easily set up exact rules for every type of activity there is essentially it would be what is agreed upon between the finance people and the fp body the finance people want to get cash to reserves and they resent justly freeloader activity that has subsidize or unwise think they want to give an activity x beans money and get back x beans plus when they give out x beans and get back beans they are hard to live with even ship that produces money directly still sells org help events and trained experienced so members for beans from orgs any org would give it good hard beans for real help and trained experienced so members if aola could buy all the 79 excellent so members it wanted and needed from the station ship it would be delirious with joy but if the ss has not been making them it has hatinhand aspect to finance people finance people then shift the rules around to try to get out of giving any money at all naturally while this is covered in 1 above it also affects 3 this one everything is considered title c even the ship and subject to total reduction as it does not increase finance peoples viability so the rules get shifted on the fp body if it isnt making valuable final product that can be changed for cash with something that has cash i above and if it doesnt know general finance rules as in 2 above and if it has solid agreement with the finance authority on title b and c then of course fp is nightmare for everyone concerned 4 neglecting necessities when an fp body is not aware of the necessities of its operation and neglects to fp for them finance people bureau three treasury and fbos have to do it for them this causes lot of bad feeling from finance people new drinking fountain or trampoline mat for staff and postage fped for is sure to cause lasting engram an fp body should have list of vital necessities by division and fp for those first before it begins to wonder strangely pay food uniforms are not considered necessities they do not directly influence an activitys income necessity is what it takes to make products and valuable final products in capinhand activity food is qualified as some food oatmeal maybe pay becomes maybe but bonuses ever uniforms become none recruiting posters yes fuel becomes economical amounts carefully used training materials becomes yes so whats necessity necessity is what it takes to make the valuable final product not individual survival but group survival so an fp body doing individuated think can get in severe fp trouble just by the nature of economics 5 using fp to neglect duty it is shame but true that people will excuse lack of vital action by blaming fp the building burned up because we couldnt get fire hoses through fp the main engine broke down because fp rejected actual tracing of such statements usually discloses the item was never fped for at all even to the fp body or that fp was used as means of escaping the work if you buy all this blame of fp you will think fp and finance people villainous actually fp is often whipping boy to excuse not doing the job or to delay it failure to handle and saying it was fp when it wasnt is comm ev stuff so dont let fp get bad name unjustly its grim enough even when done right the future of any activity depends upon these five factors above it is an economic world in which we live regardless of isms like capitalism or communism or socialism if you have these five things cared for you can do fp quite merrily the essence of getting money is making money in the first place fp is the second step of what do we do with the money we make it will never solve neglecting to make it you always have trouble with money if you dont make any c hope this helps lead sane finance bodies out of the jungle into the sun l ron hubbard founder lrhsbrd copyright c 1971 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 80 hubbard communications office

complaints in such circumstances severe disciplinary action may be taken against the auditor concerned the central organization should take steps to ensure that all field and franchise auditors in its

demonstrate to others what it can do or because of importance as person the auditing of someone just because the result would prove something or other or because the person has money or power and might donate by firm policy since 1950 has been relegated to the circular file the waste basket giving auditing away to such persons or their friends or children or psychotic brother in the asylum is in fact forbidden giving preference in scheduling to such persons is governed when for pay entirely by the scale of preference such bids are snare and delusion it sounds good it doesnt work out mr big takes his place in line with mr little and the scale of preference alone applies the person who has to be audited at once for desperate reasons is also governed only by the scale of preference the person who will only be audited by certain or special auditor is also governed entirely by the scale of preference see scale of preference assignment of auditor and preferential scheduling is governed as follows best available auditors earliest possible commencement g pcs paying full rate cash in advance with the longest consecutive auditing period purchased where two pcs have to be chosen between for the best auditor the one who has purchased the most auditing in consecutive periods is given the best auditor at the earliest moment it is obvious that to get special auditor one should pay full public rate in cash even when entitled to professional rate otherwise there may be pc requested auditor assignments buying additional auditing or offering specified donation in addition to the full rate as per can also influence the assignment of requested auditor the auditor does not have to accept b skilled auditor but not specially requested auditor early commencement full rate pass whose

scheduling convenient to org professional rate requiring credit any student any scheduling convenient to org total credit at any rate credit unknown h students who need practice cases not supervised except for student check sheet in examinations scheduled randomly or by waiting list charity or pcs on full credit of pcs unknown nature 86 in scheduling there is also the problem of matching interne auditors in pairs so they can crack their own cases this is normally done by case parity cases more or less the same in state of case should be matched up auditors who goof seriously in handling specially assigned processes in hgcs or case cracking sections and are removed from active auditing because of it as dangerous are normally paired with the last one who goofed and they are assigned as coaudit team and they are permitted to slug it out getting better reality on goofs and their cases in shape as well this is not disciplinary assignment it is prevention of case damage to others both by giving them reality and by advancing their cases their folders are carefully watched by auditing supervisors for false entries on auditing reports the whole theory of the above is not cash it will be found that those who will pay were the most able to begin with and have the greatest value to others their worth as persons is greater thus good swift auditing brings up even this value i have never thanked myself for giving any concessions on fees or scheduling not based on the above i can say with complete case histories that giving free service to those who demanded it or sought it has never resulted in any useful gain for scientology on the contrary some of our biggest headaches administrationally come from those who continually sought free courses and free auditing in the case of award auditing or training it is different matter here it was worked for and deserved before the fact the registrar is never faced with such persons as awards are given staff and staff has staff staff auditors the the world owes living preclear or student is candidate for the better dead club there were two branches of this club by the waybetter dead for their own sakes and better dead for the sake of others demands by individuals for free service on any pretext should be given light airy laugh it doesnt do anybody any good often not even the person who received it real charity cases who never pay are actually hard to find in charity auditing one must always give them chance to pay registrars matter of fact attitude about paying for auditing or training is valuable asset giving the person problem about how and what theyll pay is poor registraring dont make them choose about paying in full or not paying in full just tell them go to the accounts cashier an evil laugh when they advance the idea of some tiny down payment on auditing and remark well that would put you on the waiting list and give you new student might be very effective printing up the above preference scale for presentation to falterers on payment might be effective accounts must always give scheduling personnel copy of the invoice accounts must mark the invoice clearly as per the above preference scale scheduling may only be done by scheduling personnel and must be done in accordance with the above scale of preference and the prospective preclear already in the office not on promotion lines should

price engram its an awful good thing i found the engram in organizations before we released the new pattern of orgs and began to expand prices had i not found it we would have expanded to insolvency few suppressive persons with their everybody and they have here and there over the years set up price ridge between orgs and public you charge too much money prices too high combined with everybody thinks and other generalities have made executives believe that the public wont pay not detecting the true reason for this attack the executive swallowed it whole the true reason is suppressive reasonif we dont charge we will vanish guilt complex i wont use scientology term on anything so low arose about money accommodatingly around the world org scientologists tended to cease to exist financially all to please jojo the famous loop of capetown or tootoo the famous paranoid of sydney or gutgrowl the renowned psychotic of washington or ohno the wildly celebrated pervert of angeles or sinangulp the loudest mouth in johannesburg these arc break specialists howled so loud their minority was overlooked they wanted us gone we helped people dastardly act to prove it sinangulp tried to give away johannesburgs buildings and stole hasis equipment and tapes and recorders staffs resenting these attacks resisted but gradually succumbed covertly prices were lowered very covertly while still reporting and advertising high prices some orgs were charging very small its case of how crazy can one get its one thing to advertise the discounted price its quite another to only advertise the high price while secretly selling at ridiculously low price the tendency then against which we must guard is covert lowering of prices once set the prices given last year for use in computing discount programme were in some orgs higher than the actual price taken by the org therefore when we went on the early 1965 programme the lie about former prices made it appear to the public in some areas that we had raised prices from 400 to 1000 hence business and the janfeb slump its good this happened while we were still small in orgs for had we expanded without discovering this the tendency of secretly lowering prices would have wrecked us the bigger we got the broker we would have been and the poorer the staff i now know why staffs got higher than average units on proportionate pay when i managed an org personally i just didnt cutrate things and the public paid happily the lesson we have learned and which we must never lose sight of is that secret price cuts by separate orgs and discounts can undermine all financial planning and lay in an engram that can destroy all expansion 91 hardly one price actually collected in the world was the authorized price or the advertised price and when the false data was used for planning the public was confronted with huge increase even in the discounted price which was based on reports that made the discounted price equal to the advertised 1964 price but that reported 1964 price was not the price received for service i personally am of the opinion that even top executives in orgs did not know what their staffs were charging by the org what it amounts to is that big false report by orgs lay behind the 1965 janfeb slump they did not report their actual low prices only their advertised prices therefore we can draw up some policies on prices 1 the advertised and reported price of anything sold by an org must be the actual price received by the org for that item 2 there may be hidden discounts trick reductions whims or favours given in pricing 3 merchandising by advertising that prices are going up soon is forbidden 4 anyone covertly reducing prices is guilty of suppressing an org which is high crime 5 any price passed upon at saint hill by myself may not be changed for anything by anyone else in any org and finally 6 efforts to reduce prices below set scale will be considered suppressive acts i can easily handle situation when i have all the data it was easy to reshuffle programmes to get us again into an income range where orgs and staffs will prosper and which pleases the public but it was lot of worry until i got the real story we have learned some valuable lessons by the janfeb 1965 slump and we were saved by the bell we didnt have public book pouring in people and we didnt set up the orgs to boom had these two things been done without my establishing programme which started the rabbits out of the brush and into view we would have been wiped out by boom now we can plan with better reality and set up the org and release some popular books and boom the only other datum on this also teaches us lesson earlier in 1964 query to all orgs about their prices elicited good response i several times asked for those despatches to be collected in folder and given to and it was not done in the press of things i didnt notice i was getting noncompliance here and so never saw them until last week however those price reports too were not correct and i did have other data given later in the year of 1964 on prices and national councils did inspect the raises without comment theres mystery left about this the price data given by most orgs for planning were not the prices actually paid by the public and orgs sold things for far less in most cases than what they said they did and the 64 discount complexity was greater than the 65 the engram was that prices were covertly reduced and the new prices of 1965 were thus many times the old dont listen to suppressives turn them in to hco and hold the prices set and

scientologists may now have membership free and all prices and sign up procedures revert to 1964 levels and conditions we are retaining all that was good of the programme such as obtaining funds and heavily advertising books we are only cutting out discount puzzles and raised prices i have answered your request that we do so by streamlining orgs and i have returned you to the 1964 arrangements that you did like and wanted we can do this because of costing lowered by our new organizational pattern all international memberships recently purchased will be extended 6 months free the professional auditors bulletins the pabs will longer be shortened and will be restored to their old format and are to be sent to all international members regularly they will contain the tremendous backlog of invaluable data of hco bulletins of 1964 hcobs printed in it will come on up to present time and will continue to be issued as pabs as before the higher prices and discount plan of early 1965 are rendered unnecessary because of technical and organizational advances lower levels the technical advances which came from the level above clear when i contacted it opened not only the top but the bottom of the levels and i found many new subzero levels and developed many of the processes that go with them this lets us undercut the toughest cases weve ever seen in the fastest possible time dissemination formula also i have discovered and developed the long awaited dissemination formula which makes it walk in the park to easily present scientology to even the roughest objector much less decent people its drills just need to be written up in bulletin form and they will be part of the pabs in due course you will get the pabs with your international membership field staff member with the field staff member programme and lots of book auditors we dont want complicated price programme to stand in anyones way now field auditor prices all field auditors and centres are now being required to return to the 1964 price level of their continental organization and may not charge more or less than those prices 93 such auditing is not supervised from saint hill only hgc and academy auditing and training is supervised by to charge fee an auditor must be classified up to the level being run for fee org pattern the new org pattern makes for somewhat less costly org per person trained or processed so the prices can be dropped back also volume will be rising new books i am holding up new books here until orgs are better able to care for very heavy traffic flows the new books will increase the volume again before we start pouring new public in we want to clean up all our old clearing contracts and our existing field auditors and scientologists this should take about year after all they have first call on org services and wed better not start such heavy flood of business that the old timer will be crowded out before his case and training are up planning ive been working to remove any obstacles in the way of the training or processing of any old time scientologist if we can get all our present people well up while we still have breathing space their help will be invaluable as we spread out therefore consider the 1965 discount programme run out and erased we dont need it and you found it hard to understand things are as they were in 1964 same prices same services same courses same people but the orgs with new streamlined pattern based on technology taken from the high levels above clear im glad to be able to give you this break and im going to need every last scientologist in the world as highly trained and processed as possible and so i have swept aside all the blocks 1 could we must we can get the show on the road in time so lets get the show

member to give each staff member 1 12 times the average pay of comparable post to his own in an outside business firm staff of 20 would have to sign up 5 students or pcs per week on courses above the level of has or 25 hour intensives to do that and it was common at comparable prices to those arranged for in these formula policies in washington or london in 1956 to sign up more than that with

this includes uses of cars apartments or receiving expenses as well as other favours franchise and field activities 36 franchise and field auditors are influenced in prices in that they must not charge less than but may charge more than the auditing and training prices above the level of has for their continent but they may credit the facts of international and lifetime memberships discounts even though they should not sell them intensives of more than 25 hours 37 additional sliding scale discounts may be given when pcs or students buy more than one intensive or course at the same time

or other service or materials are purchased however reasonable deposit covering the actual cost of the service or material must be procured in all cases where credit is extended on future credits after january 1 1965 penalty clauses should exist on new credit notes signed and these are hereby cancelled for new notes interest must not be lower than the highest permitted by law in the area or 10

of september 23 1964 and exec ltr of october 5 1964 recognition of the field and franchise auditor as pc and student source that must be encouraged recognition of how units and staff members and businessdone balance up new books new type congresses my general planning on your promotion lines and your increasing activity and alertness combined with expected case gains the new book of remedies these things and others combine to guarantee an increasingly busy future with considerable rise in personal income and general financial health you realize of course that as you increase students you dont increase instructors to that degree and staff auditors pay for themselves as added and that great deal more income lies in salvaging all old cases and increasing the potential to earn in all new ones all this requires lot of snap pop and hard work but it can be done and you can be paid better for doing it in the business of fast plainly spiritual healing you will also increase your activity and income beyond expected average advertising actions are arranged for in the above nobody expects magazines to cost any more than they have previously magazine cost and postage is dropped from org expenses note also that under this plan the most neglected action in producing income in any area book advertisement the 1 magic formula of dissemination is pushed into being by restricting the expenditure of memberships and other hco book account monies until to get rid of the surplus book advertisements nationally and locally on large scale would have to be placed constantly with quantities of book ads income from students and pcs as well as books will flood in it always has this is the basic formula of the coming boom because they cost the org money it could spend and needed elsewhere the number of national magazines printed was curtailed and book ads were dropped out and that has been the chief cause of any financial difficulty in any org as local offices and franchise centres become truly active they will cease to drain off the old timers from the central org and stir up more local business of which the central org gets its part in courses and pcs this all looks pretty favourable to i hope it does to you lrhjwcden copyright c 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved important see also hco pl 18 april 1965 page 93 l ron hubbard note in 34 staff regulations

dont let any parts of how were doing it go awry in your org if all steps are taken and continue in force the boom will be on in your area for some years we have had policy of mailing lists should be sent or issued to the field that policy is now relaxed only so far as the following 1 franchise holders in good standing may be issued certain type of list 3 5 2 the list may only be issued by being addressed on address envelopes for brochure as follows and may not be in tape roll or card form and plates may be given to franchise holders list of persons actively in communication with the central org may be released and such persons may not be part of any list issued 4 franchise holder may receive lists only for the area in which he is actually operating list issued becomes anyones exclusive property and lists may be duplicated where areas are the same or overlap two types of address files central org or city office with address equipment and files normally carries and preserves all addresses ever collected in practice certain plates are retired to storage when the name has not been actively in communication with the central org for some time this period has varied but was usually 3 years in short if someone was out of comm with central org for 3 years the address plate was retired to dead files if this procedure has not been followed then this action will have to be done all invoices ever written by the org will have to be exhumed from accounts and whole new address plate file made from the start of the org up to its present active plate files if the plates have been kept this is simple matter one simply regards inactive address plates as franchise files the two types of address files are then as follows file active address files of the central organization file f franchise file all files are by districts as postal authorities usually require it for mail packaging if they arent then file f must be broken down into states or counties or some such geographical area population density not square miles is the best criteria so you may have 3 districts for greater new york and one for arizona new mexico and wyoming brochure for franchise special brochure for the franchise holder must be made up and printed by the central org this should consist of the 17 basic definitions and what franchise auditor can do and what training he can give franchised auditor should be defined an invitation to communicate should be given space for franchised auditor to write print or stamp his name or the name of his centre must be left on the brochure the brochure is provided with proper mailing envelopes 102 brochure drill on payment for certain number of brochure copies 500 1000 to cover printing addressing and posting the carton to him franchise auditor in good standing may receive addressed brochures from central orgs not saint hill address addresses the envelopes up to the number of addresses available for that district only file f above is used address does not stuff the addressed envelopes in one bundle of the carton and the brochures in another part of the same carton are shipped off to the franchise auditor any part of the ordered brochure envelopes remaining when the number of plates for that area are exhausted are sent blank for the franchise auditor to put his own addresses on the franchise auditor receives the carton addresses the envelopes left blank as he wishes has printer run off his name and address on all the brochures or stamps them or writes his name and address on them and paying the postage mails them out to his area people finding service close to hand will often break silence and correspond or call groups will form personal contact will revive now that we have why people dropped out definitions not understood in older subjects or in scientology fact which can be mentioned in the brochure we can get them back facts about the field it is hard for franchise auditor to get in touch with people people when they know he is there will wake up and go to him when they never would come into the org central org which does not cultivate auditors in the field does badly central org has been known to misguidedly suppress field competition survey of pcs some time ago showed the majority originally had been sent in to the hgc by the field fact central orgs sometimes overlook the franchise auditor delivering service as well trained professional is nobody for an org to deter but encourage only bad experiences with squirrel badly trained or untrained persons in the field lead orgs to withhold from them these experiences seldom if ever occur with franchise auditors it would be dull to release the total active list to the field it would be dull indeed to release file f to anybody and everybody competent and incompetent alike it would be equally dull not to forward the programme covered in this policy letter new promotion the above project should be undertaken quickly the sooner it is undertaken the higher the general activities of scientology will increase the line must be grooved in now while it can be the brochure must be prepared and printed special help must organize the separation of files and f and in at least one case file f will have to be put on plates all over again the reason this will have to be done quickly is because there wont be any spare motion later with which to do it new promotion is so rigged that city offices will be putting out vast amounts of advertising of books locally and central orgs nationally these new book buyers have been missing in our planning for years for reasons of false economy now we are going to start them rolling in new promotion and new bookswill send orgs into state of such activity that they might flub the drill of franchise brochures if begun later so start it now and you will have it grooved in when things really start you will soon have more addresses than you know what to do with 103 handling new addresses in central orgs and offices starting right away this is the drill for new book buyers this drill also will be kept in and followed after advertising begins 1 person buys book personally or by mail for the first time 2 the invoice is made out with the name and address bright and clear on all copies 3 one copy goes to shipping or books whether mailed or just handed out 4 one copy goes to own address this is true of all orgs including city offices whatever is done with remaining invoice copies is according to standard accounts procedure 5 address cuts plate or stencil and puts date on it and designation like bb 3365 meaning the person bought book on 3365 6 this plate is put in file and receives whatever goes out to file for 3 or 4 months 7 any new invoice indeed all invoices go to address if bb in file buys more books or training or processing address obliterates the bb 3365 on the plate or stencil either by just flattening it on metal plate or cutting new stencil in case of less durable stencils 8at the end of each quarter mar 31 june 30 sept 30 dec 31 all approximate address removes all bb plates older than 3 months 9 these plates are now placed in file f with its geographical mates 10 franchise holders are informed they should buy new brochure sets and these should be addressed from file f using all plates in it old or new franchise obligation to procure set of addressed brochures franchise holder must pay cash to the org and must specify how many addresses for what districts and how many envelopes are to be left blank on receipt of the carton the franchise holder is obliged to mail at least the addressed envelopes containing the brochure furnished and any piece of his own additional literature providing only that it mirrors games condition with other auditors or the org and contains claims contrary to standard policy regarding healing the insane etc as contained in hco pol ltr of oct 27 1964 or as amended from time to time the franchise holder is obligated to turn in to saint hill at the end of each year complete list of the names and addresses of persons who have bought things from him books auditing processing courses so that these people can be sent copy of an international magazine failure to carry out these above named obligations would result in cancellation of the privilege of receiving mailing lists if not of franchise city offices city office must forward copies of its new book buyer list to its central organization the moment it becomes file f it must be plainly marked file f and include only file f names as above the city office may keep its book buyers who then buy more books training or processing its file however to get its people sent magazine it should routinely send envelopes pre addressed by the city office to the central org if city office finds this arduous it may simply send all its invoices to the central org for the central orgs complete address and file file f handling city office may then keep its own address unit going or b count on the central org doing it all for them either one or the other must be selected and followed where city office fails to keep its address unit cracking the central org must demand the address unit copy be sent to the central org when the invoice is written up 104 by the city office just as though the address unit of the central org was part of the city office city office may not retain the address invoice copy if it is not maintaining an address unit even if it plans to but must send the copy to the central org not save it it can note down and record its active customers in book and still send the invoice copy to the central org the names and addresses of city offices must be carried in each issue of every magazine mailed by scientology orgs city office may also buy its areas brochure but in this case should add to the envelope sheet of its own stating it is city office and defining central org city office franchise holder and field auditor as to their relative status and seniority in scientology this should be done without arc breaking central orgs franchise holders or field auditors but should also emphasize the virtues of city office as the responsible representatives for scientology in the area design for the boom you see the promotion pattern emerge now first get the org streamlined with tech high second the pricing policy letter of oct 19 1964 now the using of names to the fullest extent the hco pol ltr of oct 19 1964 is going to force city and national book advertising into existence this is done by building an account up hco book account that has only one real outletbook advertising i intend to get each orgs hco book account into very swollen condition and get it spent on book advertising as the only possible value that saves it from the tax man into this channel new effective books will be poured into the publics hands the ensuing prosperity will come first to central orgs and city offices and then to franchise holders out of this prosperity the hco book account is going to fatten up alarmingly and have to be spent prodigiously on advertising books given only effective training and processing in accordance to current design and supported by our now existing technology this cycle can continue over and over the hco book account in each central org and city office will swell up by reason of processing and training discounts and book sales and can only be lowered greatly by new book ads the book buyers will be channeled to franchise holders as above these to cope and because org income is spectacular will become city offices and coming under the rule of the hco book account and now able to sell membership and higher level courses will pour new advertising out in their areas and new franchise auditors will come into existence and in their turn well you get the pattern there are those who dread boom they think if it can all be kept small enough it can be handled easily but we dont happen to have easy handling of things as our main purpose so i trust such wont be too spun about by the rush the truth is things are only hard to handle when you havent got any volume right so let it boom i said i was kicking the door open that pop you just heard was the top hinge lrhjwrd copyright c 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved l ron hubbard important see also hco pl 18

lifetime membership gives 10 making the total of 20 old lifetime memberships bought prior to november 15 1964 give 20 discount on books meters and tapes which will be honoured but in this case an international membership discount is not also added memberships non refundable membership monies are ever refundable even for portion of year since the purchaser of one usually receives many times its value in discounts within few days or months membership prices an international membership is necessary to keep certificate in force lifetime membership costs œ25 sterling or 375 an international membership costs œ10 sterling per year or 30 franchise not bound by discounts franchise holders do not have to give discounts because their book buyers pcs or has students have memberships but they may do so if they wish to bona fide members they do not however receive membership monies but if any is offered as above they should send it at once to the central org franchise holder may persuade the student or pc to send the membership fees to the central org and then grant the discount as this all helps only dissemination and boom after all franchise holder may not grant membership discounts to nonmembers franchise processing fees franchise holders must keep to the scale of processing fees announced by central orgs for each year these are precisely calculated however he can charge more than this amount if he wishes increase of fees central org or city office can also charge more for special auditors or considerations and for courses of higher levels above hpa in fact any demand by pc for special or particular auditor or class of auditing should be cared for by an increase in fee for that particular person or level of service otherwise it could not be delivered r6 auditing should be double or treble any usual fee with discounts allowed on the higher fee in november of this year 1964 and september of future years all association or organization secretaries meet under the continental director to set the auditing and training fees for the coming year other prices has etc are set by the continental director of the zone book prices book tape and meter prices are not uniform continental zone to continental zone us and uk prices are on parity of one pound equals three dollars for easy computation and to make up for exchange delays and fees other continental zone book prices are computed on the cost of books generally in the area plus handling and shipping charges these prices are published from time to time in the auditor 107 central org and city office discounts are included in hco pol ltr of oct 19 64 franchise book discounts franchise book discount is 33 13 percent now whether the book is bought from saint hill washington dc city office or central org but this discount may not be given unless 25 or more books are bought at the same time otherwise only any membership discounts to which he is entitled apply to the franchise holder book handling charges all shipping and handling charges are contained in the price of single book sale from saint hill or washington on the new price list effective jan 1 1965 this is absorbed by saint hill or washington central orgs city offices and franchise centres may still charge postage as is customary in mailing in the past also on lots of more than one book ordered from saint hill or washington postage and handling are added to the price of the order but if from central org or city office the payment is received with the order in cash saint hill and washington will waive postage and handling they will ship at the airmail price or the surface price as requested and in accordance with the proper amount received central org city office and franchise centres receive all their discounts on the book prices published in the auditor they need to pay for air shipment on quantities only the air mail price quoted if cash accompanies order by cash payment at the surface price they may add the actual air cost but will find it amounts to the same thing central orgs and city offices may have books on credit where their payments are not far behind already but must pay the postage and handling fees in addition as we cannot carry these on credit being due and owing at once from us by the shipping companies and agents credit credit is not extended at saint hill or washington to franchise holders or members on books tapes or meters as it makes too much accounting shsbc discount membership discounts are given at saint hill on the saint hill special briefing course as membership money comes to saint hill membership not part of 10 10 administrative percentage is to be sent to saint hill on memberships sold it all goes into the hco book account in the area where the membership is bought and is not part of the organizations weekly gross income membership monies go to dissemination saint hill discounts to members saint hill however grants the standard membership discounts as above on all books tapes meters and insignia etc franchise discounts limited franchise holders may not have membership discounts in addition to their 33 13 discount on lots of 25 or more books there is discount other than membership to franchise holders on tapes meters insignia etc but the membership discount is granted where their memberships are in force l ron hubbard lrhjwcden copyright c 1964

nonremimeo pricing meetings final policy on the basis of cables and minutes from various continents and accepting various recommendations fully explained or implied the formulas and policy letters of recent weeks are confirmed by adjusting the average weekly pay given in cables and minutes i was able to honour most recommendations concerning what prices should be by reworking basic promotion and using what had proven successful in the past i therefore amended pricing policy slightly as follows and with mary sues help recalculated the sum known as the average weekly wage to mean what sum did we have to charge to get staff the reported average weekly wage in an area none by the way mentioned staff or pay in recommendations at the various meetings i just wanted to be sure that we didnt set price that impoverished staffs these reported sums were then computed and ratified on the following basis we took the average weekly wage reported as the required average wage of staff auditor this was multiplied by two to allow for one administrative staff per staff auditor this sum was then considered to be 45 of the required gross then examining recommendations for some reduction we recalculated the figures for the various areas they are very close to figures recommended by the committees in those areas all things considered the us requested sliding training fee and this was met by giving has official academy day course status as well as retaining it as an evening course united states average income figure reported 100 per week figure recalculated to meet requests for lower prices 8333 giving potential staff average pay of 100 full price of hqs hca hpa or 25 hour intensive 1000 making 20 800 30 700 50 500 this is reduction for us prices has as cheap academy i month course provides sliding scale free pe cautioned to be well done if retained london average national income reported œ15 per week meeting in london recommended œ12100 figure allowed for publication based on œ1134 per week this gives full price of hqs hca hpa or 25 hour intensive as œ134 20 œ1074 0 30 œ93160 50 œ6700 this is very small increase but larger one considering initial outlay of memberships it is not sufficiently great to cause many balks as some of the membership fee may be paid at has level on students and pcs can see advantage of discounts melbourne average weekly income reported for australian middle class workers was astonishingly high showing inflated condition of australian pound and high local prices prevailing it was œ25 australian the committee asked for changes in the number of weeks to be used but as one else had this was overruled and instead the weekly pay calculation figure was based on an average lowered similar amount to the weeks they wanted lessened they wanted 2 months average pay for training and 212 months for processing accordingly the rough figure œ18 australian was authorized as this gives about œ25 australian as the potential average staff member pay full fee for an hqs hca hpa or 25 hour intensive œ216 20 œ172160 30 œ15140 50 œ108 all pounds australian new zealand running with different currency and economic conditions new zealand reported œ20 new zealand as the average weekly income using this for staff member pay the figure œ15 new zealand was authorized this gives full fee for hqs hca hpa or 25 hour intensive as

but only directly for local issue these remaining policies in this policy letter are however binding on south africa as these hold majority opinion amongst committees has course the sliding scale of courses already working well in the us is retained not by lowering the hqs course but by formalizing the has course as an academy course 109 the price of this course is set by the continental director who may wish to reset the price he first recommended in view of this change of status the has course will be one month long is to teach only data and listen style has as its training goal scientology vocabulary and knowledge of scientology philosophy and as its auditing goal feeling free to talk to anyone this course also can be taught evenings as set by previous policy this gives gradient of payment for courses it also guarantees missed words has is requisite for hqs has is not classified there is final examination certificate is given at course end and may be denied only be repeated tardiness or nonattendance neither made up by the student you must realize in costing for the hqs course that it is the old 1956 hcahpa course not light course easily taught therefore to reduce its price would be to invite reduction of quality the earliest successful procurement was cheap data course well taught followed by tough auditing course we have never reached the percentage of enrollment from that early data course to the tougher course since pc course in the gradation programme we have pcs being taught this continues but dont confuse this pc training with any has course or any academy course all pc training is done by the pcs auditor and that auditors text assignments course makes pc the has course is data course teaching the basic fundamentals of scientology as vocabulary and philosophy it has bearing at all on pc training classification student is given his certificate when he completes any courses months training without final examination however to enroll in the next course the student takes his classification examination this is just good comprehensive examination of the exact course he has completed earlier it is in theory practical and auditing it takes about 3 hours if the student flunks his classification examination he is enrolled in the next course anyway he is not however classified this rule then is made auditor may accept pay or fees for administering processes for level higher than that for which he has been classified example jb is class i hqs he takes pica on seeking to enter hpa he flunks his classification exam he is permitted to take his hpa and at its end is again examined for class 11 if he still flunks he can only accept fees for class i processing in the upper grades he is only coauditor we have pro class i with an hpa certificate he is grades ii and iii coauditor only pro in class 1 violations of this policy must go before committee of evidence as the policy will be known to pcs in the pc log book now under completion and from the magazines we can force status over to classification thus we end most sloppy field auditing and where we have classified auditors auditing we will get proper results in pcs in the field where there are bad field results we will be able to take action for it will uniformly be violations of classification we are that good at training now coauditing is knowingly done at risk pro field auditing that is bad is direct betrayal of us these policies keep auditors progressing at minimum public risk coaudit courses you see how we have handled the coaudit course mentioned in earlier policy letters coauditor is just somebody who never does get classified flunks exams for classification doesnt turn up for them he goes on getting trained course after course but he isnt classified auditor hes coauditor he cant audit for fee 110 this then is your answer to but why take course i dont want to be professional you say but my dear fellow whos trying to make you professional we just know you wont succeed in using scientology unless you can audit and when the ama starts to scream your people arent qualified we look stern and say these fast courses are for the public our professionals really have to study more than yours with your six hours of lecture to make an md into psychoquack so this also has good propaganda value immediate examination it will be found occasionally that an auditor is anxious for his classification in order to audit pcs at once on his return home at that level professionally for fee in such cases our policy is that we favour the professionally inclined auditor in all training we will grant an immediate after course classification exam if the auditors class record warrants it if this class record does not warrant it or if this professionally inclined auditor fails his classification exam given at course end rather than the beginning of the next course on which exam failures this section does not apply to anyone we will permit the professionally inclined auditor only one repeat of the course he or she has taken repeating the exact same course but only its one month before reexamining we will only do this once for one course paid for we will not require further fee but hco may charge the equivalent of one weeks average national pay for having to give two examinations one of which failed this favour is not accorded auditors not interested in fee auditing if the professionally inclined auditor still fails the second exam he is yet awarded an in training classification for the level just above the one he is already classed for or in the case of an hqs an in training class i with this he may audit for fee providing he informs his pcs of the facts of his classification an in training classification expires without further notice one year from date of issue at that time or before he can enter the next higher course take an examination for the level he had in training classification for and if passed may receive it permanently as classification he may also repeat the actions allowed to the professionally inclined auditor in this section at the conclusion of his next course this is favour not right he has the favour is extended only by the orgassn sec all an org makes out of this is better trained professional in the field but at time may an organization sell the same course twice to any person or refuse certificate for the course taken except on grounds of continual tardiness or nonattendance not made up husbandwife teams entering academies husbandwife teams should not be forbidden but in all cases where husband and wife are trained to coaudit each other they must mail their auditors reports routinely to the d of p for which they will be charged nominal but real fee for case supervision professional auditors or coauditors who use auditing in or out of an academy to estrange husbands and wives are subject to committee of evidence at their nearest hco on complaint from either party husband or wife and penalty up to suspension of certificate and 500 hours of hgc auditing at their own expense may be sentenced the offender if proven guilty during training it is against policy to team husbands and wives together for practice drills or actual academy auditing even when they will be coauditing after leaving class where possible husbands and wives should however be persuaded to bring another couple to be trained rather than coaudit and it should be arranged that the wife audits the other wife and the husband the other husband after training in this case it is all right to team them in any pairing under training for drills and actual class auditing discounts discounts may be granted without full payment of fee for training or auditing but realistic arrangement of payment must be made and the first deposit must cover actual cost of the service the interest charged on notes should be the maximum interest rate allowable for the zone or state or 12 percent where there is limit legal aspects of sign ups persons may be admitted to an academy or hgc who have not signed waivers release forms of the old type 111 all such waivers must include statement that the person is there on his or her own determinism and that the person has record of being committed in an institution or has criminal record for felony persons with such commitments or records should be referred to field auditor near their home and refused training or processing at the organization persons suspected of purely medical illness should be referred to doctor for competent treatment if such doctor or treatment exists minors must have their parents or guardians sign the waiver and any note for time payments known trouble sources as per recent hco policy letter all of which remains in force should be required to straighten up their lives before enrolling or signing up for processing or should be forthrightly refused they may however be referred to field auditor near their home anyone objecting to an emeter check should be refused entrance thus by keeping the legal aspects straight you will be able to help the many and not be messed up by few for very few such people 21 to be exact were the sole sources of grief in the 1950 boom to have boom you have to keep your nose clean legally or you can be stopped by the enturbulence generated both in the org and the public such enturbulence is all that shortens your lines or overworks staff news policies our news policies have not changed just kick reporters down stairs every time it has been relaxed we have not profited at all pledging codes applications for certificate must be made by every student for each course taken during the course this should give how they want their name on the certificate address and the routing of the student out of the org cf routing and all that this application must also carry pledge stating that the applicant subscribes to and promises to uphold the auditors code the code of scientologist and it must state he is informed of and will follow the policies relating to gradation and classification memberships members enrolling must be furnished their cards at once however this is also done by application form and on that form the person signing must pledge himself to abide by the rules codes and policies of the organization and that he understands there is refund of membership and that he does not belong to or work for any hostile organization or group or any group undisclosed to us that is dedicated to the harming of mankind every registrar must be or have near to hand in the organization such as the receptionist person with notary powers or where that is not available by reason of state restrictions must accomplish the same purpose otherwise so that the member swears to his membership statement its pledge and denial under oath to the end that anyone falsely signing may be prosecuted for perjury or false swearing in the case of mailin memberships the same statement must be sworn to on the application by the person filling it out this is done by the person going to notary pins wherever possible make it easy for persons to obtain and wear scientology pins the s and double triangle such pin as available should be given new members pins should be purchasable for small sum along with books in the reception office policy as to who wears scientology pin is governed only by their being member and subscribing to the membership application statement however there is penalty for non members wearing general pins that do not bear notation of class for grade or state of case higher class auditing dc applying for auditing higher than his grade should be smoothly put into the 112 pcs who are not brought up through grades have many sessiondisabilities which if not handled in the lower grades make the pc very serious problem to the hgc or the auditing section of the academy in the upper grades technically it is foolish to be persuaded to let pc jump grades pcs who demand to are always the roughest pcs and simply have some necessity for status rather than wish to improve to handle this it is always permissible to charge more than going rate for special consideration and this can be made so high the pc accepts the proper grade at normal cost the higher rates are never quoted in the hope they will be paid but in the certainty they wont be demands for special or certain auditors are similarly handled by increased fee but in this case the fee can be quite real and is quoted to compensate for the trouble caused and it is expected it will be accepted example i only want saint hill graduate correct response very good there is one here the fee is exactly double normal fees but discounts still apply you will of course be audited by him in your correct grade example i must be cleared at once and can only be audited by saint hill graduate on grade iv materials correct response to grade i pc very well the fee for that is five times the normal fee naturally he takes grade i auditing tape plays orgs can hold all the tape plays they want but only for fee and not in lieu of taking courses special courses are now forbidden as the materials are fitted to their levels and the courses for each level should be routine however if higher classed auditor wishes the right to listen to tapes he or she should be charged an annual fee for the privilege of coming into an org and putting on the headphones but the favour should not be available below class iv and it should not cost less than 30 year tapes may not be removed from the org or microphone copied notes of tapes may not be published by individuals as it is an infringement of copyright r6 course permission to teach an r6 course will not necessarily be given to an org in 1968 the permission depends on an orgs academy excellence and volume reviewed between now and 1968 and rereviewed in 1968 saint hill training will not cease as permission has been granted by the government for extensive new buildings an org should therefore build its future on grades 0 to iv and stress clearing as the highest offered goal with public mention of ot or even grade v keep it this lifetime and clear all problems of training and processing now being cracked for easy training and processing up to grade iv grades v and vi training and processing problems are all cracked but they arent easy and nobody expects them to be easy ever so new publications will slant at grades 0 to iv pe course where you cant guarantee an excellent free pe it is better to use only the new has sign up for fee as the students entrance gate in that way they wont drift off in fog they stay because theyve paid and we get chance to straighten them out with heavy book sales you will have trouble filling up an has course for fee with free introduction free pe is allowed only where it is very high calibre and very text book otherwise it is abolished and has courses for immediate fee only are offered thats firm policy scholarships scholarships are now allowed field auditor price regulation all regulation of field auditor prices is abolished field auditors may charge whatever they please for auditing course fees standardized any course taught in continental zone must conform to that zones course fees 113 outside courses an academy may send an instructor to teach group formed for the purpose up to required course levels the fee in such case may not be less than the full zonal fee for the course per student the fee must be paid in full in advance to the registrar of the org the group also pays for all facilities the org sending the instructor pays his or her expenses while instructing that group any such outside course conducted by an academy shall be conducted as day academy course tightly scheduled and precisely conducted it may not be instructed as night course or part time course in event of the group requiring classification examination first it may be given by the instructor on arrival in cases where fastest available transport fee exceeds 100 round trip the group must also pay the instructors travel fare and travel expenses the 100 is not deductible from these to receive an instructor the group must have less than 10 enrolling students this applies to all organizations and areas of the world trips for translation and dictionary purposes may be arranged otherwise but in that case where the above group instruction conditions are not met course of any kind may be taught stress on training it will now be seen that an organization potentially will make larger staff unit from training than processing due to the lesser number of technical staff members required this is purposely designed boom depends on training not processing the high auditing fee is maintained to deter pcs while shunting them into the academy high processing fee in the hgc then permits higher training fees and keeps the org solvent when our academies did less business and orgs concentrated on hgcs gross income declined the boom the whole forward thrust of the boom depends upon 1 getting books to orgs 2 heavily even extravagantly advertising books and filling the orders 3 running an excellent academy getting books to orgs depends on on saint hill and upon orgs making sure theyre ordered and paid for if we take care to do just those things well see 1 above hugely successful advertising books depends on intelligent adherence to the pricemembership scheme the registrar pushing the advantage of membership with every breath the assnorg sec and hco sec are in the best position to see this doesnt choke off hence their bonuses it will cost them money personally not to plaster the place with book ads and drive memberships home they are given bonus on net only gross they get paid bonus from the book account based on volume not its profit the department heads and staff get their bonus indirectly by an org driving in heavy volume through ads and books and the alertness of the orgassn sec and the hco sec continental also has vested interest in books flowing and is paid for it thus this point is cared for as for the academy it may not at first be visible why this has dissemination value about 150 times that of an hgc the following are long established data students disseminate pcs dont b high income in orgs has always occurred when the academy was good and when the academy really did its job the income was continued hgcs can receive good income from the public bad or good but the flow of income suddenly shuts off when processing has been poor for six months there is 6 months lag and then depression caused by poor hgc the lag is about one week on sour academy i never have fathomed how the public finds out so fast about bad academy beyond knowing students disseminate and pcs dont c the only thing which ever gets us into public trouble is an hgc if we had hgcs we would almost never have ripple of discontent from the powers that be 114 why because an hgc brings us the failed cases of the amabma psychoquacks thus we gather the lunatic fringe around orgs one can never really discover the bad cases until theyre processed and then its too late the characteristic of lunatic is onewayhelp inflow they dont want to help anyone they only want to be helped the moment you insist they help others they either vanish or b do so and get well fast the dear laughable old buffoons the psychiatrists shut the door on their own boom with insisting on 12 years of training in meat carving to make psychiatrist they made patients into patients forever and trained their students forever we were well on the way to doing that in april this year when i took the helm again you must let people help or you condemn them utterly d the original plan 1950 was to train people on short courses let them go out and get some experience and then let them come back and be trained by 1959 only i was doing this with accs we had too few courses we now have remedy for this with lots of 1 month courses and examination after experience registrars must push courses the fairest cheapest way to get auditing is to get trained and then coaudit an hgc doing its job well is really public service unit more i will not run down hgcs we do great job but the moment when we can train outside auditors to do that great job were longer interested in an hgc as such but only in its income its money we dont need and its very expensive money stress must be on get trained thats the pat answer to any questions about the cost of auditing or how to get audited hgc auditors and ds of p bless them have alone held high auditing standards all these years that was why they were there but wouldnt it be nicer to have those staff auditors running the orgs coaudits and classes training groups in far places handling the correspondence courses well still have hgcs but we must not count on them for income for more than another two years the time it will take to get really rolling on the boom instead enroll pcs in the academy whenever possible by 1 sell them auditing and also an has course it will make you progress so much faster mr jones short of that sell the auditing and also basic book and demand the pc do chapter each evening during his intensive put ceiling stated to the pc on how much auditing you sell them before they take an has and insist on an has before you exceed that limit of number of weeks set even when you accept them back in the hgc afterwards 3 use the hgc to feed the academy and not the academy to feed the hgc 4 count on academy income only 5 use the hgc to square up field arc breaks to promote to set an example to pick up dropped balls not to make income sell training hard assnorg sec must push academy the state of the academy should be the first thought every morning of the assnorg sec not the despatch pile how is that academy doing better look in ah floor dirty one minute past schedule and the sessions not running rave an instructor explaining confusedly offtext new janitor make an academy taut ship every halyard humming in the wind and suddenly it will be full suddenly things get solvent suddenly the income soars we start to go matter how many students there are make it tremendous academy if there are 2 or 2000 make it streamlined piece of glittering efficiency short of instructors coolly take the best auditors in the hgc that makes the hgc short of auditors so what enroll the pcs teach scientology in central org or city office dont try to process the world to enlightenment make it process itself in that direction otherwise youll never make it at all the assnorg sec must promote academy hard and see of course we have good hgc because its model you know income think academy 115 promotion many people want to know about scientology but dont want to be an auditor you know youll have to break that attitude honestly how can person use scientology who cant audit how can an executive use it in his business if he hasnt been trained well he cant thats the reality you must put across dont say if you want happy home get audited for that may or may not be true there may be so much messy environment and so little auditing time that theres win say instead the bald truth as you and i know it if you want better environment become an auditor thank the hgc for what they do demand the academy perform only miracles the progress of the boom person sees an ad buys book b gets interested writes in c gets told he should be trained to has to get the full benefit of it d person says thats cheap i will person really gets trained words misunderstood really gets it in sparkling academy f person makes big case gain in finding he can talk to anyone freely g decides at home wants his wife audited and writes in h is told to bring his wife to the has while he takes the hqs course etc the pcs now what about the pcs who want to be pcs dont be hoggish let the field auditor live pcs who are only pcs can be salvaged too but being pcs they dont write in when they read book so send people who havent corresponded as name lists to field auditors who are franchise holders field auditors make people trainable people come in for courses eventually field auditors get fat everybody happy the field auditor you are only rival of the field auditor if you are hungry for pc income the field auditor actually has sent orgs the bulk of the org business in the past so dont count on hgc income count on the much greater academy income and earn and guarantee its continuance with fine training encourage the field auditor to succeed make him take out franchise use successful franchise holders as success stories use them as procurement agencies for more auditors let them have their groups and pcs keep them as friends sell them the next course they should take make millions of field auditors summary these then are the designs and policies which have shaped up all earlier policies in this boom series stand it may seem odd to base staff member income on hgc pcs and then tell you you must not count on the hgc but this boom is just beginning your economy depends in large measure on your hgc it will have to go on pulling its load for while and youll always have and there is another factor i dont intend for staff member to draw only an average national wage and the ratio of 1 admin staff to 1 staff auditor is quite low as you get to swinging along it may become one technical staff member to more than 1 admin personnel even when you have huge academy for dissemination takes lot of admin as you expand youll get tech thin so tech personnel have to be freed up by assistance from admin as you expand so its more that i want to be sure you still charge enough to be able to eat than that i expect you to go on with only hgc income thats the design if it needs improvement well improve it right now lets make it work ive got to go off and get the books written you get your end of it done too okay lrhjwrd copyright c 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved l ron hubbard important see also hco pl 18 april 1965 page 93 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 23 december 1964 gen nonremimeo franchise bpi field and public programming since april 1964 we nave been busy with organizational reorganization public and field programming all armed at the realization of boom all levels and technology from hubbard apprentice scientologist level 0 to hubbard senior scientologist level vi are complete and being taught we have our boom already under way six scientology organizations across the world have done more business in december than in any previous month this year at saint hill as result of planning and new programmed mail volume rises daily and is entering boom proportions in the midst of all this change we have had to grope our way and things are now being smoothed out this is the design of the boom books we are about to broadly advertise books as never before and use all book and membership income to push book ads i am publishing several new books with public appeal franchise holders may also sell books book prices pricing has done bit of wobble and is being corrected publishing costs have risen enormously in the past few years but we are countering this books being offered to the public in ads will be at cheap prices more advanced books will be more in keeping with what the books cost to publish discounts people are expected to become both life members and international members the cost is œ10 sterling per year for international membership or 30 this gives 10 discount on books 30 discount on training and processing an international membership is membership in the main international organization lifetime membership costs œ25 sterling or 75 this gives 10 discount on books added to the international 10 making 20 if one holds both memberships it gives 20 discount on training and processing this adds to the international 30 making it possible by holding both types of membership to obtain 50 discount on training and processing the old life membership bought prior to nov 15 1964 still gives 20 on books and 20 on training and processing but on books only this does not also add an international discount 20 is the maximum book discount obtainable for 117 individual scientologists lifetime membership means membership in that continental zone organizations anyone can be an international member and lifetime member providing only that they are on our side all membership monies go into supporting the advertising and sale of books so its in good cause training and processing fees each continental area has now fixed its training and processing fees for its own the increase discounts considered is very slight most places and on training and processing fees 50 discount is obtainable by being both types of member so everyone gets break as the membership costs less than what one saves with his first intensive or level i academy course and the discount is still valid afterwards only the international membership has to be renewed yearly and this is far less than what one saves in books or congresses or training or processing so there is great deal of incentive to own both memberships and the membership money goes to make boom by advertising books and therefore expanding scientology field auditor fees field auditors can now charge whatever they please for processing processing fees are longer regulated for them this applies also to franchise holders some field auditors have not understood this they can charge now as much or as little as they please many charge more than orgs however field auditor or franchise holder must now be classified for any level he receives fee for if he or she is only classified for level ii and yet seeks to collect money for doing level iii processes he or she will be subject to committee of evidence this is public protection as the field auditor should not use processes he or she is not trained to use processing is very workable today why spoil it by poor application and field auditor seeking to run level vi while classified only for level iv on pc who isnt up to grade i on his own case is going to injure somebody so this is frowned upon todays processes are very powerful only the worst cases insist on upgrading their processes anyway by which is meant demanding to be processed over their heads they are bit suicidal it seems courses all courses are now exactly one month long these include has courses at the end of the course one gets his certificate without examination but before taking the next level course students must be examined for classification even if they fail the classification exam they can go on and take their next course but they can only process people as high as their own actual classification duly awarded by hubbard communications office examiner pc grades pcs can be run on any process the auditor is classified to run all processes now belong in one level or another pcs are not limited nor do they have to be trained before being processed 118 for their own good pcs should 1 make sure their auditor is classified in the level being audited and 2 move up through the pc grades 0 i ii iii iv and vi in an orderly fashion so they dont get in over their heads pe courses pe courses will still be taught by field auditors and franchise holders they may cease to be taught in some orgs has courses hubbard apprentice scientologist courses are now academy type courses less costly than others but equally precise and are 160 class hours in length whether taught daytime evening or weekend some very fine new processes and full curriculum now exist for this level 0 course hqs course until jan 1 1966 some franchise holders can teach hubbard qualified scientologist courses mainly it is taught to certificate in city office and central org academies to give some idea of where we have gone technically present has level 0 and hqs level i course data formerly was taught as hpa in the commonwealth and hca in the us we have gone very high above these levels and so have to have new courses to teach the material further we cant keep holding people in an academy for year at crack and at the same time we can guarantee an auditors skill by requiring he be classified in order to charge fee so the new has and hqs courses embrace everything academies used to teach and above that level by level the new materials are laid out each level has definite finite end product attainable by an auditor if trained and by pc if run up through the levels one by one summary we are grooving in the policies developed for the boom be patient with the rough spots old timer part of our programing is to coax field auditors over to franchise holders and franchise holders by helping them with mailing lists for their areas are going to be coaxed up to city office status and some city offices are going to become central organizations in their own right with teamwork hard work and patience we will climb the hill rather easily in april i started to work on orgs through the summer and autumn i also developed the lower levels to good effectiveness here in december i have just begun to receive org reports on the telex which speak of greatly increased volume as direct result of all our hard work shortly we will really begin to enter the boom we are just on its fringes now whenever lines become more active their weak spots show up its our job right now to locate and fix those up this boom will be an orderly one the objective is extremely worth while for all of us and i myself am pretty cheered up in april 64 i plan boom in december it starts to happen there are rough spots in it that cant be fixed up so lets get the show on the road lrhjwrd copyright c 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved l ron hubbard important see also hco pl 18 april 1965 page 93 119 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 15 march 1965 issue ii remimeo only accounts talks money scientology organizations are service organizations now it goes without saying that service costs money so please dont equate service with the idea that it is all give away people expect to pay for good service and they do pay for good service unless you barrier the line or by some foolish handling convince them otherwise it is the job of the registrar whether it is letter registrar or body registrar to find people to communicate to to communicate with people to promote whether by mail phone or in personal interview service and to help people arrive at and attain whichever scientology service best suits their needs and goals so the registrar does take responsibility for them listens to their problems and aspirations becomes friend and advisor to them and channels them to the proper service and checks to see if they got that service routes them back to the department for completion if they didnt and bridges to further future service if they did now registrar knowing about the road to truth hence knowing an infinity more about the person usually than he or she knows himself or herself must take responsibility for this and channel them and keep them on the road until the person cognites and reaches for the rest of the road himself even then the registrar must work to keep them on the road and keep them from falling into pitholes side paths etc that the confusions and randomities and distractions of life present but none of this has anything to do with money except that such services are expected to be paid for money is an accounting function when money is concern of the registrar and how is he going to pay for this and we have got to keep our units up gads i have got to write up note form now thats going to cost him too much the guy has walked in and wants 75 hours of processing and 3 courses before going to saint hillwhen the registrars concern is all about money money money money money she gets all inverted into what are we going to get out of it instead of what the person is going to get out of it in all his years of auditing which exceed anything any of the rest of us have even dreamed about ron has never talked to the guy who wanted some auditing or whatever about money yes it was understood it was going to cost something and what it would cost but that was the end of it rons concern was for the guy and getting him better and he was not even remotely worried about the money and the money rolled in because he got the guy better oh yes sometimes he was paid in eggs or cheese but the guy was wanting to pay because he got service he never had problem about money and he never talked about money registrars concern on money barriers the line for someone coming in and thats an overt any scientologist recognizes to barrier the line of someone coming into scientology here is an example person who has been out of contact with scientology for about 9 years writes in and says to the effect of are you there i need auditing send details including costs and was written back by the fcdc registrar winter 1965 regarding processing the original cost is 1000 for 25 hours of auditing 25 hours constitutes what we call an intensive we do have two memberships and there is good discount on each of these the first is the international membership 30 on which the discount is 30 making therefore auditing 5700 the second membership is the lifetime membership 75 making discount of 20 which would mean auditing would be 800 if perchance you have both memberships the discount would then be 500 50 you can have more than one intensive should you so desire in fact i believe you can have up to 250 hours at any one time the person writing in said i need auditing they were saying help and the answer was analogous to throwing bunch of confetti in their face just when they needed stable datum the answer was confusion and that confusion is barrier the answer to help is help not confusions and if the registrars concern is on money instead of help then her communications are going to communicate confusion and barrier the line it amounts to an alteris so registrars are forbidden to talk write or think anything about money 120 well how about money then how does this get handled simple money is an accounting function it is the proper concern of accounts accounts in the past has had difficulty collecting in some cases where credit was extended registrars in the past had been on the money line and were busy issuing credit and the line to accounts was poor or nonexistent for checking to see if the person was good credit risk or not well that is thing of the past with money totally in accounts where it belongs and the following into operation 1 three fliers printed handouts are to be made as follows international membership flier hasi international annual membership the cash discount membership the hasi international membership is open to anyone of whatever race colour or creed who is not hostile to scientology it is an annual membership and the yearly fee is 2500 œ1000 apply to your currency it must be renewed yearly the hasi international annual member enjoys 50 discount off the public price when training and processing is paid for in full at the time it is taken the hasi international member enjoys the privilege of buying the books tapes and meters and insignia of scientology which are offered to members only at 50 discount of the local price when paid for in full with the order the international membership is the annual 50 cash discount membership its holder gets 50 discount on everything and as many as he wants of anything the person applying for membership signs pledge to abide by the rules codes and disciplines of the organization and that he understands there is refund of membership and that he does not belong to or work for any hostile organization or group or any group undisclosed to us that is dedicated to the harming of mankind the pledge signing must be notarized the international member is member of the brotherhood of scientologists which span this planet he or she receives numbered membership card and scientology pin only issued once those who already have an international annual membership in force may have 50 discount until its expiry date if they have signed their pledge the card is annual and new card is issued with renewal hasi international annual membership brings all issues of put your continental magazine name and the professional auditors bulletins which is the oldest continuous scientology publication and is direct from l ron hubbard to the professional field in scientology hasi international annual membership is necessary to keep classification in force membership may be applied for from the following hubbard communications offices put offices and addresses of all the hcos of city offices and central orgs coming under one continental office b hasi lifetime membership flier hasi lifetime membership the scientology credit member this is the scientology wide open credit

is open to anyone of whatever race colour or creed who is not hostile to scientology and who is not in default on any credit extended to him or her by any scientology organization it is lifetime

as agreed to results in loss of membership without refund fulfilling of payments within 12 months or before when credit has been 121 extended results in gold star credit rating for that year credit may be extended only on one course one intensive through one pc grade 1 of each book payment for which must be fully discharged before further credit may be extended on that type of item and the further credit again may be on only one thing of that type the credit may be up to 100 credit extended and the one thing it may be extended for include one course one intensive through one pc grade one of each book one meter one tape one insignia in other words one of kind only memberships may never be purchased on credit the hasi lifetime member when using his credit privilege enjoys 25 discount off the regular price on courses intensives books tapes meters insignia etc if the person is going to pay in full it is conceived that he would take out hasi international membership and enjoy the 50 discount loss of membership through default in payment may be regained by payment in full of the amount owed plus penalty fee of 25 of the amount owed in full at the time of default plus the purchase price of the hasi lifetime membership fee until the above is done the person may not have hasi lifetime membership this however does not affect their international annual membership if held the person applying for hasi lifetime membership signs pledge to abide by the rules codes and disciplines of the organization and that he understands there is refund of membership and that he will fulfil the obligations within one year or before on any credit extended to him and that he understands that failure to do so will immediately result in his loss of membership and that in order to

does not belong to or work for any hostile organization or group or any group undisclosed to us that is dedicated to the harming of mankind the hasi lifetime member is issued numbered membership card with years blocked in on the reverse side for impressing of the gold star credit rating when achieved extant hasi lifetime members are granted the above credit if they sign the new declaration for membership and are not indebted to scientology organization otherwise they still get only 20 discount hasi lifetime membership may be applied for at the following hubbard communications office list offices and addresses services offered academy courses has level 0 hqs level 1 hca level 2 hpa level 3 etc scientology processing 12 12 hr intensive 12 week or weekend 25 hour intensive 1 week leading

advertised pricecredit price annual 25 off member cash 50 off titles of books tapes meters materials badges etc but not pins which are now free _ so now you have these two fliers and this rate card now the registrar in response to queries on prices and otherwise in correspondence talking phoning etc supplies only these three things does not otherwise discuss money in any way shape or form now what happens when person comes in wanting to sign up he or she doesnt sign up at all the person is routed by reception to accounts for an accounts clearance in accounts the cashier is at post preferably in wicket this is exactly like theater ticket front complete with the glasses window with the hole small and awkward in it to talk through and the hole at the bottom to slide money through any accounts office door if up front in the org can be fixed with half door to look like this it would not at all be out of place for the cashier to wear green eyeshade and have very detached attitude about anything except money or money matters very businesslike the person coming in is routed to this cashier posted on the outside of the wicket or immediately in the area on display signs is exactly the same data contained in the above fliers and rate card if the cashier is asked for data he points to the proper sign the cashiers actions otherwise are 1 he checks the membership if none he collects the money if the person is seeking the hasi lifetime membership the cashier must check his defaulted list to make sure the person is not on it this tells you immediately that the defaulted list must be kept up to date daily and defaulted lists circulated between orgs on fast comm line for immediate posting show is made to keep defaulted list confidential it must be posted in accounts after collecting the money for the membership he invoices it marks the membership number in the invoice issues the white copy as an accounts clearance slip for whatever kind of membership it is and the person is routed to hco to sign his membership pledge and receive his card which is issued on the spot by hco in log book it is accounts that keeps and assigns the numbers of members these are coded lm area code letter such as for melbourne 15 scientology year number in sequence for the area international is im area code letters scientology year number in sequence hco gets copy of the invoice which bears the persons name address and number 2 if the person already had membership or now having one per above remember if the person had lifetime membership and is seeking credit the cashier must also check the defaulted list the cashier does the following 1 if the service or material is being paid for in full he collects the money and invoices and issues an accounts clearance slip for whatever the service is and the person is then routed directly by reception to the service section division 2 directly into testing to the d of 1 or d of p and thence into class or processing in the event the person is not acceptable for processing by the d of p who so marks the accounts clearance slip the person is routed back to accounts who immediately returns the money and voids the invoice upon having the slip turned in to him or destroys the payment pledge the routing slip for processing must say name of person cleared by accounts for processing in whatever amount this slip does not constitute an acceptance by the hgc for processing but is an accounts clearance only 123 2 if the person is seeking credit which he may have unquestioned providing he has hasi lifetime membership and is not on defaulted list but may have it for one item only and further credit may be extended on that type of item until this item course pc grade another copy of same book is paid for in full on schedule then the cashier invoices the course intensive books or whatever ie john jones address i hca course s 1000 lt discount 250 charged to account c 750 lt membership lmdc 15459 john jones signed the cashier must have the person sign the invoice with carbons so that the signature goes through on all copies the white copy is given to the person and he is issued an accounts clearance slip the accounts clearance slip which says john jones has been cleared by accounts for 1 hca course april 25 1965 signature in full of cashier remember the slip for processing must say this slip does not constitute an acceptance for processing but is an accounts clearance only rubber stamp for this may be made and used the customer is led to look on these as monthly bills not time payment or hire purchase there are notes contracts there is interest this is simply credit sale this is maximum protection for us the statements are arranged for 1 academy bill 2 processing bill and 3 books and materials if the 1 account is unpaid more credit courses until it is if 2 account is unpaid more credit processing until it is if 3 is large and unpaid more books tapes etc if nothing is paid in year on any one of the three more membership accounts in billing for amounts owed just issues routine monthly statement if payment has been made on the account then that of course is posted and the next monthly statement reflects only the amount now due 3 scientology materials any person off the street public etc who comes in wanting information on scientology etc is only told by reception to get book in the reception office are placed books for sale one section contains books for the public marked basic scientology books and posters around saying the way into scientology is to start at the beginning and dont ask someone to explain scientology to you get your own reality read book then take course and the data in scientology spans the totality of existence which may seem to be an enticing mystery to you but if you want to understand the totality of existence the mystery will only unravel by increasing your reality otherwise the mystery deepens begin here with an arrow pointing to the basic books the other books and materials of scientology are in divided section marked for hasi members only when the person has selected the book or books he or she wants the cashier collects the money and reception delivers the book or books if the person is hasi member he gets 50 discount on the books m the basic section or the international membership price if paying cash for materials for members only must have 124 international membership or if seeking credit must have the hasi lifetime membership with the same checks on default as in services applying and the rule of one of each item applying if the person is new and wishes membership to get the 50 discount or to buy books from the membership section he or she is handled exactly as in 1 above he or she is not then prevented from buying higher level books but the signs still warn the person to start at the beginning reception looks after books and their cases reception is to have nothing to do with money as she is division 1 personnel and is not division 3 if person comes into the org not knowing what he wants but presents only his or her problem and wants help he or she is routed to hco to the registrar who channels them according to their needs but who does not talk money the registrar may and must if pressed by the incoming person for information about costs say only accounts can talk to you about money i am here to help you find what you need in the way of service and when the person is routed by reception to accounts it is all on the signs which the cashier merely shows them or hands them the two fliers and rate card the registrar is forbidden to hand them to body callers accounts is admonished not to mention credit also accounts has interest in credit rating before it is defaulted let the person ask about it it was found many years ago that most people walked into the org with the money for the service on them if the registrar in those days she was handling the money asked will this be cash or credit the person with this invitation inevitably said oh can i get some credit well lets see id like to pay so and so and get the rest on credit and they would walk out of the registrars office with the rest of the money still in their pocket the registrars question should have been are you paying this by cash or check and if there is question of credit let them bring it up as an origination but today the registrar mustnt talk money at all think of the most exclusive restaurant that you know of get the idea of going in there and ordering meal without any money or credit card you cringe well create that same kind of atmosphere and attitude for the org all service today is travel now pay later this must pay because everyone selling service that way is rich and powerful the public does pay its bills your prices are now rigged to absorb the 33 13 loss we have due to bad credit the prices are 33 13 higher than cash interest or notes or trouble train now pay later get grade 0 now 2 or 3 intensives and pay later if they dont pay then worry dont worry everyone because 13 are dead beats create the attitude that persons credit card is extremely valuable and must be kept in good standing at all costs it is practically moral code in the society today use it but it will not prevail with sloppy handling of accounts breaking the rule for friend just letting this one go by it will be strict and unbreakable 8c on the line heartless maybe but not any more heartless than low below living unit checknot any more heartless than the guy who doesnt get into scientology next year because there werent enough funds to disseminate because the guy last year didnt pay for what he got well what about the guy who got poor service gains arc breaks instead of training well accounts has control line on that too it is accounts who issues the free week of processing or who can send student back for free retraining not next course up retraining on the course that was flubbed on and its the whole org who is to scream when people start defaulting too many defaulters tells you theres bad tech going on so it is an indicator and youd better start screaming because people wont pay if theres delivery theyll say to heck with it the same way you would if you had diners credit card and every restaurant you used it in served you soup with flies in it you found finger nail clippings in the mashed potatoes and the steak was green on the underside youd tear up your credit card walk out without paying and probably go see your lawyer you have the total tools for delivery today so deliver count on good delivery to collect the credit issued not on lawyers or complicated registration reception only routes she does not answer questions except with oh where you want to go is to accounts or you need to get book and she routes accounts is to be located adjacent to reception and people are to be routed and handled with friendly dignity the public tries to wander all over it is unaware generally of your hats and lines they will try to put anybodys hat on the nearest guy they can get hold of if it isnt your job and hasnt come to you on the proper routing line then you only route river will overflow if the barriers banks at the side are 125 not there or so weak that they cant hold up if it has strong firm banks the river will flow down the channel so delineated having by now i hope heard the tape of march 2 1965 you recognize that you dont do big acknowledgement job on the incoming student or preclear you dont say well you arrived good fine i am sure glad you got here you dont end the cycle this way for him reception never greets it is just barely at start getting the person to reception was not the cycle you are working for and neither is the pc or student so you say well you must be anxious to get going lets get you into class or testing is waiting for you staffs should dress and behave with appropriate dignity to create the attitude and atmosphere set out in this policy letter so you have had hard time and have clothes well get inventive until you get so affluent that you can hire tailor get inventive on low or cost ways of sharpening up the premises particularly that part which meets the public eye until you are affluent enough to do something better about it and demand cleanliness and neatness of premises at all times but dont let clothes and shaping up premises distract you from your job just make habit of expectancy on it got the idea the day of the doldrums is over so just end cycle on that thank you we have entered new echelon of scientology ps the effective data of this policy letter is as soon as you are set up with your materials printed up you need to get your wicket in and the personnel drilled on it but at the latest june i 1965 you will be receiving the additional data needed on this how to handle pledges internally membership card mockups etc in the meantime get going on what is supplied here and muzzle body and letter registrar on money route to accounts design by l ron hubbard written by marilynn routsong for l ron hubbard lrhjwrd copyright c 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved important see hco pl 18

prices and discounts saint hill has just opened its hubbard guidance centre in order to be in line with all orgs over the world in all departments the saint hill course now handles all levels of training but these courses are review courses at the lower levels and hca classed or unclassed or old commonwealth hpa classed or unclassed remain the entrance requirement students go through all levels usually the lower ones very rapidly and are classified for each level with saint hill classification saint hill classification takes precedent over all other classifications in any level students own classification is not taken away but for the duration of the course is invalid but may be resumed on departure from the course however the student usually has far higher saint hill class on leaving the purpose of the saint hill special briefing course remains the same to make the auditors and instructors who make the auditors and instructors over the world and to put the final polish on auditing as auditors sometimes do not realize that an auditor of higher level always audits at the pcs level seeing and getting lower level results and clearing with them is very revelatory one does not expect class vi auditor to run only level vi quite the contrary level vi training is never applied to an untrained pc by an ethical auditor level vi auditor should be able to do level 0 work superlatively well level 0 processes release people with ease and many clear today at only level ii much less iv so the saint hill course enters all students today at level 0 and rapidly moves them right on up in quick time students who know the lower material of course get it checked out very readily student can always ask hco board of review for classification while on course but of course must pass all lower classes before being tested for the one asked for discounts international membership 50 discounts apply to all hgc pc and course student enrollments at saint hill now credit by agreement with other orgs which might lose business if saint hill allowed it will not be extended by saint hill so lifetime membership does not apply at this time this gives 50 cash discount on all courses and intensives course the course 50 discount price is still œ275 sterling this makes its public price œ550 but of course public applies this is about œ40 level making it very cheap review course it must be bought all at once or œ275 hgc intensives are the same price as in the us the 50 cash discount makes an intensive 5500 or the equivalent in sterling saint hill student price for an intensive 75 discount price for saint hill students only is 250 the student may be an old graduate or one currently on course academy students do not qualify for the saint hill professional rate only saint hill students and graduates any level pc is taken but only the pcs level will be run of course however it will be run very well usually by level vi auditors pcs are issued their grade certificate the moment they complete level and this certificate takes precedence over all other grade certificates in the world books saint hill book prices carry 50 discount from list for

international annual membership there are two membershipsthe international annual membership this is the cash discount membership it gives 50 cash purchase discount across the boardstraining processing books meters tapes insignia congress the lot if we sell it an international member gets 50 off the membership must be renewed every year it expires on the same date the following year at one minute past midnight it keeps ones certificates in force services are ever promised to its holders but monthly magazine is sent and copy of the professional auditors bulletins comes to them from saint hill providing saint hill is given their addresses and changes of address members lists are kept in orgs and org central files and the org roster of members anyone can have an international annual membership providing they are for us and not members of groups seeking to harm mankind the cost is œ10 sterling or 30 us the entire fee is paid into the hco book fund account and buys advertising for scientology books and pays book bills all receipts for books meters tapes insignia and all memberships go into this account these are the funds that promote scientology through books the only effective way orgs have ever promoted to obtain or renew an international membership one must 1 get an accounts clearance and 2 what will be called division 9 clearance and 3 sign sworn statement promising to uphold the codes of scientology and declaring they are not member of group hostile to mankind or scientology note that there is waiver of rights to sign now lifetime memberships the lifetime membership is the credit membership of scientology its holders can obtain discount from the list price of courses intensives books meters tapes insignia congresses etc they can have one of anything on credit one course and one grade worth of intensives in books meters tapes insignia congresses they in actual practice can have reasonable amount as it is too hard on accounts to keep more than three items in view courses intensives books etc it acts as carte blanche credit card there is note interest rate nothing the lifetime or credit member is billed monthly on standard charge account system there are arrangements for payments at regular intervals however the credit member must have paid for his course or his grade worth of intensives or his book bill before he can have another course or grade or beyond reasonable amount of books if the bill is not paid in 12 months the membership is forfeit after forfeit of credit membership if the person then belatedly pays his bill in full with any additional amount as penalty he may now buy another lifetime membership if accounts will sell him or her one the idea here is to keep ones credit good for the card itself has good value in supporting credit elsewhere old holders of these may have the new discount if they sign the sworn statement for the new status if not then they get 20 off on books meters courses intensives bought for cash neither the old or new lifetime membership adds now to the international discount that went out because the international alone gives one the cash 50 discount if lifetimeinternational combination holder that bought both before march 1 1965 insists on 50 combination discount for credit the way we were selling we always deliver what we promised and he or she may have it by signing notes paying heavy interest giving the down payment and signing waiver of liabilities and all that just like we were doing from january 1 1965 to march 11965 newer ones sold after march 1 1965 cant have that privilege actually it is likely to be more costly to them than the new system 128 for in 1966 we will begin to gold star the lifetime members cards giving them gold star credit rating where they have promptly paid their bills and gold star credit card in scientology will carry 45 discount to get one really sizable credit will have had to have been advanced and promptly paid such as courses or grades gold star credit rating must of course be kept good after award and default carries the same results as new lifetime membership lifetime membership will be handy thing to haveone will only have to sail into an org get his accounts clearance slip and so have his next pc grade or course any time he feels like it the lifetime membership costs œ30 or 75 and need not be renewed unless forfeited for payment failures it is paid for in cash at the time of application anyone can have one of any race colour or creed they need only sign sworn statement to abide by scientology codes and that they are not member of group hostile to mankind or scientology old hasi shares you may wonder what to do with old hasi ltd shareholders the share of course cant be cancelled the answer to this is that hasi ltd shareholder is not lifetime member in any sense of the word the 20 discount if promised in that area is not additive if the shareholder buys books or intensives or courses for cash of course since nobody promised any credit discount ever the hasi shareholderif the local offer to buy one said so originallygets 20 discount and other it does not add to international few of these shares in south africa were maliciously held onto most other places converted back and turned their shares in such shareholders should be written to personally and advised of the advantages of new lifetime membership and the above limitations of the old share should be heavily stressed they should be told that the local government would not grant hasi ltd non profit status and so we remain hasi inc of arizona and will continue so and offer them their money back or new lifetime membership with all its advantages of full credit and good discount please shake off these old hasi shareholders so we can close the company were booming internationally as hasi inc its to their advantage to become lifetime members now qualification of membership there is grade certificate or classification qualification for any membership one must only swear to abide by and uphold the codes of scientology including the auditors code the code of scientologist and any other code of scientology and that one is not now member of group hostile to scientology or mankind this sworn statement is made in and the membership issued from the membership section of the org at once open door you may detect from the above that we have now opened the door of orgs for action hitherto one was interviewed and registered personally by the registrar this is longer necessary the registrar is now hco personnel and handles money makes notes one should be able now to walk straight into an org straight up to the accounts cashier near the entrance and get an accounts clearance this is white invoice slip accounts receives any payment and issues the white copy to the person if it is 129 credit sale the person must sign the white while it is still on the invoice machine but this is not necessary on credit mail order from an org this is all the procedure for the person he or she then takes the accounts clearance to the division giving the service and gets it then and there if one is buying membership and then processing or training or books one goes to the accounts cashier first then to division 9 nearby and gets the membership issued then with their membership card returns to accounts for the accounts clearance for the next service reception near accounts is ready to direct anyone to membership issue or the hgc or academy interviewers if member requiring processing or wanting training wants advice registrar is available but actually all the necessary advice is posted beside the accounts cashier window complete with membership descriptions and costs and all prices including book meter tape and insignia prices floor plan is in plain sight in reception if one wants to find ones own way therefore there is waiting the newcomer if person comes in asking what is scientology reception instantly says that is very well covered in book here is the correct book for you and it will tell you all about it the price is reception via accounts sells the person the public book and reserves all other books for members only thus nobody there explains scientology they sell him book the registrar does not talk to newcomers and indeed is forbidden to try to explain scientology or processing to completely uninformed person if they didnt know she like everyone else sells the newcomer the public book there is brochure given out in reception pe brochure only book ads in the back of the book the newcomer buys an inserted card fastened in invites him to pe course this card must be discovered only by someone who has read that far in the book it mustnt merely fall out and such cards may be placed about in reception pe is for book finishers if they can read book we want them if not we dont as theyll only fog others in the class the passport to pe is have you read book that alone is what we require before we will put in admin time on them there is formula and drill for use on public persons on personal contact we dont use it at the front door of the org we use it through members of our field division onlythe field auditors this handling of the newcomer is based on 15 years of experience the field auditor can handle him best only when the newcomer has read book or been audited or trained by field auditor can he or she be entered into an org at any higher level than buy book what you have to do to sell the newcomer book is another thing and is technology not policy and so is not covered here the policy is the newcomer must buy book and thats it otherwise an org tends to develop psychiatric type practice that wears everyone out orgs are live activities not morgues admitting the newcomer who has not read book into pe or the hgc or academy is pure nonsense scientology is aimed at the able when you curve it toward the unable your dissemination programme will go all awry as it is longer reaching the able public for which it is designed and you will get into the org lot of fringe that breaks the instructors and staff auditors hearts and breaks the economics of the org as well scientology is for scientologists not for the person in need of daily nursing you cant build new civilization with dead meat you tend to them afterwards when youve time and money to burn the simple selection is can they read book if they cant theyll take far too much time and effort and will only distract the main body theres plenty who can read book and if you only handle them youll handle more and more of them if you even try in an org or practice to handle people too distracted to do so youll handle less and less that formula alone is the determining force of whether an org auditor goes up in activity and numbers or down if you accept only those who can read book you will grow if you ever accept those who cant you will shrink there are exceptions leave it to to give them the book they can read you tend the store and well have rush hour 24 hours day and the staff to handle them 130 advertise and sell books hard then service those who could read book prices of public books will be such as to permit the book to sell there will only be 3 or 4 public books in all you dont have them yet meanwhile sell problems of work or old dianetics or scientology evolution of science or the original thesis the real public book 1 will be out before the end of 1965 by the thousands its already outlined and mostly written it will probably cost the public 5 in the us and 30s in england and some round equivalent in the australian or sa market whole paper money in every case post paid even airmail so dont use up too much public medium ad money yet for old books just feel your way around until we shoot the works on public book 1 we have to groom up our orgs first anyway and get them booming by existing actions alone and clearing up their existing public they better come in and get clear now because next year will find jam for service matter how many we have on staffs tell them so professional rates old time professional rates are back for the hpahca or above classed or unclassed if he or she has an international annual membership in good standing current year and unexpired intensives cost only 25 of the public list cash only hqs has are not eligible when not actually in the academy however an has or hqs student only if ordered by the d of 1 to an intensive may also be given the professional rate if they have also an international annual membership this is an excellent chance and should receive wide publicity however trip up hashqs students who enroll on course only to get hgc student rates for the d of t may not order student to processing if he suspects the enrollment was only for that purpose has prices has prices may be too low to take 50 cash discount in some areas if so raise it continental director has that authority it still gives 25 refund if the course is finished by the student these has courses can be weekend courses too you know or night courses 160 course hours i think course times all courses in all orgs enroll every monday special courses for certain dates will be tolerated in any org magazines should say enrolls every monday after every course in every academy ad if you dont you go mad trying to get pcs every week for ad money and wind up with psychiatric ward for an hgc the check sheet system used now at saint hill for levels fits every course nicely and requires every 4 weeks saint hill enrolls all week long further instructors in scientology must not personally lecture students on technology instructors only do this when they dont know their hco bulletins and the same instructor is always giving squirrelly unusual solutions in answer to student questions rather than answer them accurately or get the student to find the answer in his student materials if you want current check sheet for level write your commmember hco pol ltr of march 13 65 at saint hill processes to use break down the q and that class vi auditors run class vi only on all pcs it isnt so pcs not trained dont get enough ta and class vi caves them in quite same pc gets as much as 75 ta div per session run on level 0 where he should start class vi auditor can do better level 0 one audits always where the pc is never only where the auditor is that error alone stops you from making clears clears clears are bobbing up routinely now they release these days at level 0 or level i and begin to clear at level ii free needle however levels iii and iv stabilize them very well and they really go very clear if the auditing is good and smooth 131 sell release and clear with confidence only squirrelling on levels and rough arc break handling can prevent it the total rundown of processes is easy to groove in in an hgc and should be adhered to violently if you want to get results and releases and clears its myth now person who clears at level ii can be audited on level iii and iv providing you dont do subjective processesonly ct work and the clear can and must audit others subjective and objective pc grades pc grade certificates as already outlined in recent awards hco policy letters will save your bacon on odd demands for hidden standard type results and save you as well from hgc squirrelling pc is given his grade certificate when he has finished all the processes of level some new auditor may try to do this in 20 minutes but it really takes about 3 twentyfive hour intensives on lower level to do all the processes of that one level and flatten them this is easy easy dont strain anyones brain just use check sheet on the processes run in the hgc for each level its form the auditor has to certify each process has more ta in it when left it also finally says the pc has arc breaks now and is very okay the pc must also agree and sign the sheet when done the grade check sheet goes rapidly to certificates and grade certificate letter is signed by the hco area sec and is issued to the pc the pc only now can go on to the next grade where pc gets to grade in the middle of an intensive and has more bought and particularly where he has this one on credit spend the last few hours of any grade doing itsa in all his treatment auditing and other solutions now that hes loosened up by the grade you may be astonished to see your meter needle start to float clearing has always been easy people mainly were too rough on pcs or tried too strenuously the grade sheets and the pcs must all begin at level 0 and go on up matter who the pc is or what old certificate he or she has or how horribly urgent it is that ot be reached last week hgc processing must now be all by grade certificate the grade certificate says on appropriate stationery let it be known this day ofthat john doe has completed all processes of this grade as preclear in the hubbard guidance centre and has successfully completed grade and is now fully qualified to be processed on grade next grade processes signed hco the sooner that system is in check sheet grade carts the quicker youll start making releases and clears release and clear are honorary not technical awards release is simply know now i wont be getting worse and clear is meter condition of near ta position and floating needle you cant miss it when you see it some meters arent dead centre on the clear read but its near 2 or near 3 and all meter needles float just because person attains release or clear is reason to halt either an intensive or grade let the pc have win on the process if he or she insists that one is flat now but go on to the next process you only begin to skip subjective figure or think processes except pure itsa all clay table work is objective students let student finish his course such as complete his own case for grade if he insists but course completion is check sheet not condition or classification it is now crime to run course without check sheet or to change check sheet on student after its issued different check sheet can be issued to the next student that enrolls on that very same course but once issued the same one is completed for course completion of that course and the student gets his certificate for the level when it is and can take his exam for class there are 3 check sheets actually theory practical and auditing there is academy check sheet for students own case but an hgc case check may be used but not taken much account of all 3 should be complete 132 before you let student go up for classification grade certificate is only issued student who has had all the processes run not because he finished his study of the level the grade certificate if issued says loudly academy and may have weight in an hgc or saint hill cleared students students who are clears have to do all the required auditing as an auditor and get it passed clear is an honorary not technical award but truly floating needle clear may not be audited on involved subjective processes this doesnt get him off any ct work at all he or she may not be jumped grade or course one course early on in clearing they panicked and urged promotion of student to high levels at once from an incomplete level ii were refused and in ct work the student cleared more clear student doesnt know more about scientology just because hes clear he just learns faster so the cleared student must do all his auditing on pcs subjective and objective clear or not if you dont have any raw meat for student to do all his levels on make the student scrounge his own pcs off the street or city dump remember dont panic on clear it means the student like any other student must do all his required check sheets and go on up level by level just like every other student just dont run any further subjective processes or hell key in ct will only key him out more if properly done saint hill prices saint hill is being careful not to undercut anybody and wont give credit in order to prevent orgs from losing out saint hill auditing prices are same as us professional discounts and student discounts apply at the saint hill hgc the saint hill course was doubled in price and then halved for international members just to be able to grant the discount like anybody else saint hill books tapes meters insignia are all 50 off for internationals 20 for all lifetime if cash not additive now just like in other orgs this standardizes the shape and activities of saint hill and makes it the same as other org boards this makes its advices more real too saint hill has the worlds most experienced people in central org activities so dont be misled about the advice you getits hot and good mailing lists the elementary emergency formula for down org is 1 promote promote promote 2 then change bad spots and reorganize 3 then economize cut off all purchase orders except postage communications and rent 4 get ready to deliver to the people who will be coming in as result of the promotion and deliver to promote you must have full mailing list anyone who failed to get his mailing list back off old invoices will probably make about thirty or forty thousand pounds less between now and christmaswhich is punishment enough for not following my late 64 orders where the job was skimped i see two orgs that are limping also have very small mailing list any connection rush the project ordered in 64 wherein you culled your addresses back from old invoices and youll have lots of people and money again scientologists never get truly lost 133 then get onto book promotion put return selfaddress card for more info in the back of every book you sell and get your list up both from the book sale and the card omitted that look over the earlier 1965 policy letters that define promotion thats all it is but promotion is successful when you use books to front for you and flop when you dont if you think promotion is costly its because the money isnt invested in getting books sold books are your first line of promotion reorganize your book department if it doesnt slam back book at every orderer within 24 hours of the receipt of the order why be poor all the time 1 place ads 2 get mailing lists from anywhere 3 get mailing lists by selling books 4 sell more books to them 5 have good processing available for them and say so loudly 6 have good training available for them and say so loudly do just those things and do only those things and youll be 10 times your size with lot more pay its very easy why keep doing it the hard way im interested in review that only those orgs are poor which havent been following my direct orders well anybody has right to be poor i suppose if he has an appetite for it personally i dont care for it it must be carefully acquired taste as brand new idea in those orgs that are struggling why not get rich by doing what ron says l ron hubbard

communications office 37 fitzroy street london w 1 hco policy letter of 27 april 1959 why new books are few the income i am supposed to derive from scientology should pay for research investigation my promotional time the writing of books and my living expenses at present it does not we are short of new books because i havent had the time or the place to write them and do not even have transcription secretary clear results were delayed and released incomplete because research funds were missing and i had to do it all on the cuff i couldnt pay auditors to assist right now i am buying home in england which will be research centre and am faced with getting another house in the us soon basically the 10 paid as royalty by central orgs is looked on as my income it is not income it pays for hco personnel in most places who are more and more doing the administrative and promotional work vital to keep the lines flowing hco is worth in income to central orgs an enormous amount just for these things i have need for help here research and writing on which we exist is not being paid for therefore it is very hard for to get it done it would not be unusual for 10 to be paid for these two items on the contrary but the 10 is absorbed in paying for administrationand vital administration it is magazines promotion organizational data to name few come under the 10 we are in for boom you may not see it in your area yet but has coaudit well run has begun the project clear earth hgcs have already begun theta clearing and hotter stuff is to come but unless i can up my income for writing research and living we are somewhat slowed down my program has gone as far as this i have bought with my own money and whatever i could gather place in sussex thats quiet enough and remote enough for research and in which i can get lost enough to write i emptied out all my loose cash sold my boats and made my credit creak but we have writing and research centre for the uk the place belonged to an important person and is itself more or less self supporting as to upkeep i want to get research centre for the us equally remote and later on for each continent in such places research records can be safe and the kind of research which now has to be done can be done this will take several years i am perfectly willing to do and finance any and all of this out of my 10 royalties from central orgs if hco personnel can be paid out of congresses books tapes records and memberships if certain hco services can be nominally charged for and if central orgs can help out by paying hcos where needed then i can get every one into position through writing research and planning to take all the strain off by increasing book sale volume and general volume right now we are doing things bit backwards i am having to bolster and plan to keep things afloat without the whereabouts or wherewithal to do the writing and research that will make floating easy 137 hco is vital to keep us going so is writing and research i am truly and honestly concerned with all our incomes and work ceaselessly in an effort to raise yours only recently did i realize that i was having hard time raising yours because my own income was too low despite the overall high current and steadily increasing income of scientology to pay for the things i have always paid for from any income or money i received research and writing in establishing has coaudit in london i found ads to be fabulously expensive i realized suddenly that i could get plenty of press with books and book reviews i abruptly cognited that have you lived before this life was our first new book in two years and all about radiation was our first new book for two years as we did in aar we sell from 6000 to 9000 new books worldwide every new one i write the market we have is steady only old books reprinted cost heavily new books get their cost out in about 80 days and make us thousands in friends and money our book market would take new book every six months these sent to reviewers widely in every area would give us plenty of press and wed have data in usable form and 9 to 25 people read every book printed hco has taken off heavy administrative burden to great extent freeing the time this leaves lacking 1 finance for research testing and leg work 2 place i can do research and do the actual writing 3 book transcription if we want boom its vital to free the income needed to create it and this will up all our incomes as well as get the job done my book schedule is now 1 have you lived before this life i rewrote it in the last 2 weeks amongst doing the new hcahpa series its now at the printers 2 the elements of scientology needed as the new course book to fit with the tapes its partially compiledhas been for year and half but needs complete redoing 3 the criminal mind to give us whole prison clearing program 4 the mentally retarded child the text for the society for mentally retarded children program we are now piloting in the uk 5 great men of the mind the biographies of mental healers missing text in psychology courses in universities you maybe sometimes wonder why i dont write more new books for research confirmation to whom do i say audit bill on so and so hgc processes are too stable now for research to whom do i say run down to the local library and find out whom do i pull off post and say type up these 80000 words of dictation tapes ive done why of course and i just cant get it all in so new books but 10 devoted to these and the cash i need can do it easily any comment or suggestion any secretary or executive in central orgs would care to make would be very welcome i would find your views very helpful ps only the fcdc bears the cost and more of writing and research at this time pps you didnt

letter of april 27 1959 it is now generally agreed that the suggestion of jack parkhouse is best he suggested that instead of 20 or 15 of the proportional income going into the building fund of each central organization that 15 or 10 be so deposited and the other 5 be made available to for promotional writing this 5 of the proportional income would then immediately be applied to the expenses mentioned in hco pol ltr of april 27 any part of the regular hco 10 would be applied directly to research expenses however new zealand and others suggest 1212 percent let us do it this way we make it 8 now and drop it to five when our income is all brought up by all our actions and my promotional writing all assoc secs should get the immediate opinion of staff and if favourable should then at once begin the regular routine weekly transfer of 8 of the proportional income to special fund hco ww national provincial bank ltd 6 fitzroy sq london w 1 and delete the sum from the building fund it should be clearly understood that this money and any funds that can be salvaged from the hco 10 which is spent locally in most central organizations will help pay the expenses of the new promotional writing and research centre located at saint hill east grinstead sussex if this money can assist promotional writing we will all experience an increase in income since it is promotional writing that carries most of the public interest and i am currently too pressed by other thongs to do it to an adequate extent we can continue with other financing plans for research many of which are quite good i have been paying for and shoestringing research for so long that an enormous backlog has developed needful to be done now to advance the whole picture of scientology so if we can get this 8 coming in very soon and gather up what hco cash is about and send it in we can get both promotional writing and research going with attendant rise in income everywhere l ron hubbard lrhmpcden copyright c 1959

as signature my own name that of mary sue hubbard as secretary and of marilynn routsong as treasurer any one of these three signatures being valid to withdraw the account is handled by the regular accounts unit of the organization not by separate system in hco invoicing to the hco account is however done on separate invoice machine in the accounts unit on this machine other than hco funds are invoiced all membership receipts for associate 5 shillings or 1 international and lifetime memberships are invoiced only on this machine all book tape meter and insignia sales are invoiced on this machine all congress and tape play receipts are invoiced on this machine there is also separate disbursement voucher machine and all disbursements from the hco div acct are disbursed only with voucher from the disbursement machine even when cheque on the account is written disbursement voucher is also written if the voucher has on it printed hco division of hasi inc with our compliments transmission letter is needed with the cheque as the data of what is being paid is on the voucher thus accounts does not need an additional letter to go with cheque an office which is too small to afford two invoice machines can do as well with sales book for income and disbursement book for disbursements such as they have in department stores providing the books give adequate carbons and are used consecutively one book completed before another is started these books can also be printed and have carbon pages one copy remains in the book and when finished that book becomes part of accounts records you must be very careful in invoicing and properly depositing membership funds particularly as many states and countries have regulations concerning such records of membership 162 books may be invoiced to the central org or city office general accounts for any reason all book sales are invoiced only to the hco div acct in some orgs reception does all invoicing when this is done the same procedure applies and the same invoice machines or books are used but the disbursement machine or book is kept by the accounts unit wages of any kind may be paid from the book account the only postage which may be paid from the account is book or magazine postage correspondence postage may be paid from the account rent may be paid from the account loans may be made from the account book and tape purchases may be made from the account magazine printing and postage bills may be paid from the account but extravagant increases in printing quality or volume may be paid from it nor may brochures or

the organization pays any salaries or space rental connected with books or tape handling congress hall space may however be paid from the account the above arrangement is equitable to the organization in that it receives without further cost to it all its training and processing ads in magazines and the full benefit of the increased business advertising fees may be paid from the hco div acct but only for book ads general advertising of the org may be paid for from the account personnel ads or pe ads may be paid from the account or be included in ad coverage contracts advisory fees may be paid

volume through ads and books and the alertness of the orgassn sec and the hco sec continental also has vested interest in books flowing and is paid for it thus this point is cared for advertising actions are arranged for in the above nobody expects magazines to cost any more than they have previously magazine cost and postage is dropped from org expenses note also that under this plan the most neglected action in producing income in any area book advertisement the 1 magic formula of dissemination is pushed into being by restricting the expenditure of memberships and other hco book account monies until to get rid of the surplus book advertisements nationally and locally on large scale would have to be placed constantly with quantities of book ads income from students and pcs as well as books will flood in it always has this is the basic formula of the coming boom because they cost the org money it could spend and needed elsewhere the number of national magazines printed was curtailed and book ads were dropped out and that has been the chief cause of any financial difficulty in any org as local offices and franchise centres become truly active they will cease to drain off the old timers from the central org and stir up more local business of which the central org gets its part in courses and pcs this all looks pretty favourable to i hope it does to you lrhwmcrd

letter of 11 may 1965 the hco div account old book account has very rigid policy on how its money can be spent the reason for this is that money must be safeguarded to provide for adequate promotion and sale of books book sales have always been your first line of dissemination and will always be so improper use of this money has resulted in depletion of the hco div account in some orgs leaving insufficient funds to order adequate book stocks print and mail the magazine and provide for other vital book promotion book promotion and book sales are an absolute must for the continued health of any org the most important and successful dissemination line is book sales and about three months later the buyers come in for service to cut this line by reducing book sales will seriously damage the org income three months later new policy because poor book sales could result in collapse of the org and misappropriation of the hco div account can make it impossible to buy and promote books violation of hco div account policy now becomes high crime hco div accounts are now to be monitored by ww each org exec sec is to see that an exact accounting of the hco div account expenditures and

staff treasury hats allocation of income cancels hco pol ltr 6 feb 63 hco area 5s all orgs allocate their income as specified in this policy letter unless specifically exempted from doing so by the guardian ww at present saint hill is the only org managed under different financial arrangements the basis of the proportionate income breakdown is only changed in that 1 the allocation between salary sum disbursement sum and building sum reverts to 50 35 and 15 respectively 2 minor changes have been made in the ac 1 report form to bring it into line with policy changes since 1963 note all additional information regarding the ac1 form must be written on separate sheet and not on the form the increase in the disbursement sum from 30 to 35 of corrected gross income has been found necessary to keep orgs solvent as income expands bills expand and if sufficient proportion is not allotted to disbursements some bills cannot be paid and debts accumulate however whatever the allocation to disbursement sum it is the primary responsibility of financial planning to see that the total of expenditure approved in any period is less than the funds available for expenditure in that period this of course includes making allowances for routine expenditure on electricity telephone telex postage and other utilities it is part of each staff members hat to see that wasteful use of such utilities occurs in order to improve the cashbills ratio of an org the local executive council may propose on lines to the executive council ww further change towards reducing the percentage of the salary sum while increasing the disbursement sum percentage it is expected that the better the ratio of cashbills of an org and its solvency is permitted to develop the more scope there will be for expansion as well as an increase of pay this is with reference to hco policy letter financial planning of 15 december 1966 and if anyone commits the org to expenditures that have not been approved this must be immediately reported to the ethics officer who must see that the org is reimbursed out of that persons own pocket salary sum the reduction of salary sum to 50 of the corrected gross income should make difference at all to staff member incomes if the org is kept solvent by having funds to pay bills execs will be able to put their full attention on 1 making scientology more widely known 2 promotion to 172 scientologists and 3 excellent delivery the more efficient and effective the org becomes the greater the flow will become and the faster org and staff pay will riseprovided the number on staff is not increased beyond what is necessary to handle the increased flow efficiently number on staff too many people on staff in relation to the rate of delivery bogs an org down with devt and poor rewards for good statistics too few people on staff in relation to the flow they have built up of services signed up results eventually in stagnation the flow jams efficiency falls off and the flow tends to dwindle and not increase because the flow of people demanding services is monitored solely by the excellence of delivery thus the optimum number on staff depends on the efforts of the whole org the optimum number on staff is when each member of tech and qual staff is working flat out at high efficiency and the techadmin ratio is 1 1 techadmin ratio number in tech qual number in all other divisions this does not mean that orgs must get rid of half their staff it means that they must dismiss any deadwood chronic low statistics personnel and then get moving to increase the effectiveness of distribution dissem tech qual and all other org functions technology is firmly established stable and works when applied exactly all that is needed for fantastic boom is

bring them routinely to date as continuing activity not in monthly rush folder statements sheets not up to date one month as to debit and credit will be up to date the next the folder statements sheets are mimeographed in general and lettered in particular on invoicing books this is the first operation of the day the invoices go at once by hand to shipping so books may be mailed same day this is rush invoice item folders are filed alphabetically by class which is to say orgs form group franchise forms group books form group etc it is the responsibility of the income division to know what hco ww is owed and to see that it is collected the income division must insist on disbursement copy of monies sent being forwarded us by each org when it is sent this copy is never entered on our statements sheets but is kept in the folder it is info only only money received in our banks is entered the income report from the income section also includes the amount shown on the last statement for each bank account there is further attempt to balance cash deposited but not shown on statement or cheques issued but not cashed in by the person or firm who received them this weekly report is the money on hand report it goes to lrh msh then peter hemery it is then filed with the weeks income report it is compiled and despatched when all statements for the week are in it is not attached to the income report but is separate in practice if convenient it could be so attached the income division retains and has all invoicing machines but disbursing machine disbursement division the disbursement division has the responsibility of correctly disbursing the money of hco ww such as bills wages mortgage payments etc each creditor including staff members has red folder each folder has statements sheet in it whenever cheque is disbursed or wage or cash is paid out disbursement voucher must be written giving all particulars the white voucher is sent to the creditor the next copy is filed in the statements folders the machine copy is retained unseparated and filed in an envelope dated as of the week disbursed the copy of the disbursement voucher for filing is placed in basket for filing and then is filed without entering it at that time on the statements sheet in the folder of the firm or person disbursed to all incoming bills are placed in basket along with the disbursement vouchers they are all filed at once at the same time as the disbursement vouchers they are not entered on the statements sheet at that time once each month minimum or every two months maximum the folders statements sheets are brought to date this is routine and continuing action all debits and credits are entered on the statements sheet these sheets are kept in the folder when disb voucher or companys bill is entered on the statements sheet large x is drawn on it it is returned to the folder these folders when brought up to date are brought up on the not xed bills and vouchers the purchase orders are filed in these folders and bills are checked against them disbursement is from 30 to 60 days on bills wages are paid now by cheque the cheques are signed by peter hemery over the stamp on authority of l ron hubbard cheques are given out late friday afternoon 184 we will cash our own cheques but not on pay day only the following week each cheque issued for wages or bills must be written on disbursement voucher persons receiving wages do not have to initial or sign the voucher they receive the white copy the folder copy is filed in their folder their pay books etc are kept in their folders not in any separate file the government has folder of its own one for each department of the government to which we pay out other pay papers than in the folder are kept in the government folder for pay this folder is filed adjacent to the pay folders of staff there must be loose tables folders or booklets kept anywhere but in folders there may be miscellaneous folders bank statements are filed in folders provided for the banks there is one folder for each bank account the cheque books are in the same file drawer but not in the folder cancelled cheques are fled loose in the banks folder for each account until cheque book is empty then each cheque is scotch taped not stapled to its counterfoil counterfoils are kept only in date and other data not even amount as disbursement vouchers are used for record not counterfoils cheques may not be taped into cheque books in use neither voided nor cancelled cheques there is only one report and that is monthly mimeographed sheets carrying each companys name to whom we disburse is marked with the last debit figure on the statements sheet and how long the amount is owing it is expected that all such statements will be brought to date before the monthly report is made this report totals all bills owing when executive directions are given on them cheques are issued as directed against this monthly report there are other reports except when requested on some firm summary the disbursement division makes income reports or reconciliation of bank statements the income division makes reports on disbursement every quarter an accountant audits the books and submits quarterly report in summation form he does not make books the law requires records be kept we keep records actually we keep books as above but their pages are folders history the bugbear of accounting is the failure to record all one knows about each transaction an executive is later expected to remember it all and spend two or three weeks going over tangled accounts with each audit this is circumvented by writing all you know about the transaction on the disbursement voucher or on the invoice we are at this writing being lot too brief on our history if you know something about the transaction related to what its for and why or whats odd about it put it on the invoice or disb machine not in despatch or in memory example joyce bibbin orders 2 worth of books but sends 3100 she wants us also to retain 1100 for future purchase make out one invoice for 200 and one for 1100 but say on each what and why and that it came out of 3100 also if you know purchase was for the garden when the bill is paid put it on the disb voucher this way well not be racking our brains and can have an audit without the place being torn down the person doing the

that production department regardless of other appointments or appearance of name on the organization board department staff member member of production department staff as posted on the organization board as different from unit staff member unit staff member staff member who is not member of production department but appears somewhere else on the organization board the organization secretary the person in general charge of all departments and units and the organization at saint hill as listed on the organization board the executive director the person in charge of all scientology organizations including saint hill general bonus an amount of money paid in excess of salary on six months or yearly basis christmas bonus one weeks salary formerly paid at the discretion of the executive director at christmas time and which is cancelled by this directive in favour of larger and different bonus net profit the net profit of an organization is the amount an organization makes above its income that is then paid out to directors or stockholders as profit net profit forms part of this directive or its calculations and the general bonus is not paid on the basis of net profit as saint hill is not run on profit basis net profit also means taxable profit which is not part of the plan being matter of accountancy 194 cash differential this is phrase used to describe the difference between what department or organization receives in income and what it directly spends in costs it does not include funds for research or the support of nonprofit activities gifts royalties or other matters it is clean statement of so many pounds received due to departments or an organizations activities less how many pounds that department or organization spent for salaries materials supplies printing advertising maintenance and general share of quarters utilities and general service departmental cash differential the exact difference between the cash received by or for production department and the cash spent by or on behalf of that department plus its share of the general cost so long as the result shows receipts greater than expenses organization cash differential same as the departmental cash differential but for the whole organization general share the cost of all personnel and activities which are not assigned to production departments negative cash differential where department or the organization receives less cash than its costs in this the general share is taken into account as well as direct costs administrative expense research general managerial and administrative expenses on broader basis are not included in cash differentials thus making the cash differential quite different from net profit thus we are not concerned with the corporate accounts but only with cash income and cash expenses in the bonus plan description at the end of every six months period those staff members who have been with the organization for one year will receive bonus based on certain percentages of the cash differential of department or the organization those heads of departments who are in charge of production departments will receive 20 of the cash differential for that period based on weeks they are or have been the head of that department providing the post was occupied for more than six months and providing that they have been with the organization in any capacity full year and that they remain in any capacity with the organization for minimum of six months after having ceased to be head of that department fraction of six months period in cases of removal as head of department before six months have been served is not then payable as such after removal and only for those weeks actually in charge of that department this applies only to production departments not to units the staff member employed in production department receives his share of 10 of that departments departmental cash differential the exact share is arrived at by taking 10 of that departments departmental cash differential and dividing it by the number of staff members in that department who have been with the organization for one year in case of partial period with one department the bonus is paid on the basis of weeks of service in that department the weeks being those actually served and the bonus being based generally on the cash differential of those weeks and the number of staff members in that department at that time 195 staff member who is member of unit not department receives his or her share of 5 of the organizational cash differential for the weeks in the six months employed on unit providing the unit staff member remains with the organization where staff member is transferred from unit to production department the unit bonus is paid for the weeks on unit and the production department bonus is paid for those actual weeks in the production department unit staff members share is calculated by taking the organization cash differential for any week and dividing it by the number of unit staff members on staff at that time to arrive at weekly departmental cash differential for any one department one takes the weeks of that month adds the total cash receipts of the department for that month subtracts the salaries and bills of that department and its general share for that month and divides the difference between receipts and expenses by 4 or 5 depending on whether the month covered more nearly 4 weeks or 5 weeks fact which averages this becomes the cash differential percentage for that week for that department the actual calculation is done by that department similarly the organization cash differential for any given week in the year is determined by adding up the cash receipts of the organization and its expenses for month and dividing it by 4 or 5 as above the organization secretary receives 10 of the organizational cash differential the head of department one receives bonus and staff members of department one are considered unit members except where they also belong to other departments full time staff member is one who works minimum of 40 hours in week not including the lunch hour part time staff member is one who works less than 40 hours week bonus is calculated and paid on the basis of full time staff member part time staff members regardless of what part of the 40 hour week worked are counted as half bonus and are paid half bonus in calculating the amount of the bonus part time staff members are used as half staff member bonus is paid anyone for weeks he is on vacation or out sick for any part of the week or weeks in which any part of day was taken off person may receive general bonus for two or more departments or unit and department share for the same week the existence of the bonus in way deprives management of transferring or dismissing personnel at its own discretion all existing bonus or commission arrangements including the christmas bonus are cancelled monies received by myself personally or not paid for actual service or commodity given by the saint hill organization form part of this bonus plan it applies only to cash received for service or commodities delivered at or by saint hill such as training books or percentages for service it does not include us organization percentages any liability for income tax by reason of general bonus lies entirely with the receiving individual and not with the organization and acceptance of general bonus is accepted only with this condition the organization takes responsibility for any matters of tax on the bonus and must report it when paid by law advances on bonus owing will be paid heads of departments who serve less than 6 months in that capacity will be paid 196 only on the unit staff member basis from the percentage he would otherwise receive and if departing from employ forfeits bonus the general bonus comes under the heading of gift and is not owed to the employee as it forms part of his work contract this scheme may be altered or withdrawn at any time by the organization at its discretion it will be found that 3 of departmental cash differential is quite sizeable it will also be found that 2 of departmental cash differential is very goodly amount even when divided by the number of persons on that departments staff less the head of department it will also be found that 2 of the organizational cash differential divided by unit staff members will be found to be very nice amount of money it does not matter whether they are in department one or unit as they would be part of the same bonus system even though domestic was transferred out of department one this is my answer to your rising living costs tax troubles desires to make more money and have bigger share in things if you make more money in department or help the organization make money by doing your job or promoting better or working harder and help the organization do its work at less cost then you will receive your ample share of that difference the earning potential of saint hill is high if at the end of the first 3 months period this system is found ineffective or undesirable it will be cancelled and bonus for the trial period of 3 months will be paid but if found effective and workable it will be confirmed and paid from july 6 1964 l ron hubbard lrhjwoden copyright c 1964 by l ron

of hco policy letter of 26 june 1964 the bonus system is modified as per this policy letter all departments and the organization were deeply in debt as per july 6 1964 this fact was only known partially at that time in the ensuing months large numbers of bills were discovered and paid that had not been suspected in april when i resumed active management the organization had been permitted to sink in very deep industrious promotion and reorganization in the following months began to bear fruit and when mrs hubbard took over as organization secretary in midjune and began to reorganize the actual activities of each department the organization climbed well out of the crisis area thanks to the cooperation of each staff member and his or her excellent work in the past few months expenses have fallen and income has risen as we still have long way to go before any department or the organization is out of the red the bonus plan as such cannot yet be put into full effect as there is excess with which to pay it however because the staff has cooperated so very well and done such fine job helping us handle this even though it drops the financial position back bit mrs hubbard and i wish to show our gratitude by 1 restoring the christmas bonus as per the original policy letter covering it so that the staff will at least have bonus at christmas and 2 doubling that bonus just to show that we really do appreciate the splendid effort everyone is making our review of the situation undertaken on the 16th shows that in september 1965 the organization continuing at the same level of economy and income will be level and able to pay bonus from its overages which should then exist however with good work and cooperation and great care in economy on the part of everyone that date can be brought back many months perhaps even to april 1965 when that date is reached bonus system based on percentage of an easily computed ratio between amount owed and disbursed and amount received will be put into effect for departments and general staff as we are daily improving our effectiveness and as new promotional plans for overseas are right now going into effect we should do very well

above sought to resolve the problem that orgs did not give their public divisions sufficient funds to promote they are cancelled the basic outness in orgs is that they have in the past sought to economize by saving on promotion establishing pes account was supposed to merely implement sums normally given in fp for promotion rough estimate of the amount of the money that should be allocated to

allocated for the total bills of the org this is minimum promotion therefore fp can be considered passed or valid that does not provide 14 of the corrected gross income for promotion expenses in an org which has three public divisions and is running public service services and courses such as testing free has hqs group auditing and coauditing and congresses the small fees for these courses and larger congress fees should be earmarked for and assigned to the cost of materials advertising quarters especially procured supervisors and other expenses directly related to giving these courses and services understanding that the public divisions stress div iv training courses in their larger sales to such public this is to prevent mobs of people being serviced free to such degree that the org would become financially unable to continue such services the full intention of this pl is to finance promotion and inhibit saving money at the expense of promotion complaints arising from unreal

are usually still in need of special attention that would normally tend to create situation of specialized care that would consume too much of the instructors time hgc prices for minors hgcs may accept child of any age for processing except psychos as per present policy below the age of 14 years child will be charged full price at hgcs they are pretty difficult to audit so should be charged

processing prices after the age of 14 children are easier to handle and this price reduction is an encouragement to teenagers to get processing in the case of minors directly related to certificated

crediting someone with monies paid and thus the right to take services on the strength of these or receive items from the bookstore as such they are prima facie worth something in terms of cash thus if invoice packs are not administered carefully then it is open to anyone to pick up an invoice and credit himself for some goods or service invoices are the record in time sequence of monies received and unless the numbers of the cashiers fourth and machine copies are seen to follow through consecutively then there is certainty that all monies are accounted for treasury invoice packs should be kept separate from any such packs used by other divisions such as qual and such divisions should arrange for the purchase of their own invoice packs submit their own requisitions and not depend on treasury division supply also such other divisions using invoices such as qual for routing slips should make sure that their invoices do not look like the invoices used by treasury division in order to keep treasury division invoices completely unconfused otherwise the ease of checking through the consecutive numbers of cashiers invoices is interrupted and made more difficult from the viewpoint of the outside professional accountant doing the audit the control of the invoicing system is fundamental to his check of monies received and he will expect it to be carefully controlled and in date and numerical sequence the control of voided invoices is also important and in these cases the original white copy and all duplicates should be retained and attached to the machine copy in the complete series without this there is evidence that top copy has not been given to client in lieu of cash and duplicate copies only marked void if the invoices are kept properly it will increase the speed of an audit and decrease accounting costs thus invoice packs must be controlled and accounted for down to the last invoice therefore 1 the dir of income is to keep book detailing all the stocks of invoice packs and their numbers such packs in stock are in his charge and are to be kept under lock and key 2 he issues and books out new packs as needed in the series of numbers following the justcompleted pack he issues the pack to the cashier in those orgs where the cashier does all the invoicing and of course in those orgs having also mail invoicing clerk he may issue new packs to him as needed 3 he issues the new packs on request but must check that the previous used series the fourth copy and the machine copy are all accounted for and that they were used and that any voided invoices are attached with duplicates to the machine copy 4 thus his book should show three things under three separate columns 266 the stocks of packs plus the additions of new packs coming into stock the stocks of packs are entered in the book by number per pack ie 06250162750 if those were the series numbers in one pack b new packs issued to the invoicing sections during the week c in the last column is the actual invoices used by the sections in the week the recording of the packs is obviously done by the numbers of the invoices and invoice packs concerned thus complete accounting for every invoice can be easily maintained and its history of issue and usage traced the second and third columns would show that invoices had been issued in consecutive series numbers and the third column not only shows the actual usage week by week but also enables one to see that the succeeding week follows on with the next number in series the dir of income in doing this must not be content to make the entries in the above book only he must actually physically check by examining the 4th copy and machine copy invoices for the week to see that the book actually records what happened with invoices during that week thus what is recorded in column three for invoices used in the week must be the actual numbers of the 4th copy and machine copy put away in the weekly folder with the adding

losing between 500 and 1000 daily in one org there is known to be one foot stack of signups who never got to cashier from the reg so where does all this lead us it leads us back to the former successful line of the late 50s and early 60s when the registrar would interview people sign them up and take their money for individual training and processing this is the way the line was in in the first very affluent foundation the line was changed probably on wrong why and since then has only worked on personality and proximity of registrar and cashier as evidenced at sh through 196567 responsibility for the orgs gi has been too long resting on the dir incomes shoulders with the way it is set up now department 7 mostly operates at the irreducible minimum of collecting cash over the counter while its vital admin functions would be in total neglect the point is all orgs have debtors be it only qual services and freeloaders partially paid advance payments are also truly debt to the org they must be followed up and collected and it is dept 7s major action to see that all funds for org services and sales get collected 268 it is fact then that money worries begin when one doesnt produce and then when one doesnt collect what one is owed from the above we therefore get split in income functions 1 dept 6 collects new cash 2 dept 7 collects credit owed and advance payments the registrar is beefed up as an income producer and treasury is freed up to get in its standard collection actions it now doesnt become question of who takes in the most income both depts take it in in bucketloads the new income producing line 1 the registrar has an invoice machine on her desk she is hatted on the subject of making out invoices 2 the registrar must be totally familiar with all pricing and price structures of the org 3 the registrar has an org price list and refund notice posted by her desk 4 the registrar is totally moneyminded and gets that body into the shop she is crackerjack at handling the public individual and producing income 5 the registrar has her lines fully in so that she never misses hot prospect from the public divs or the div 2 lines she signs them up and takes their money 6 the registrar interviews public pcs and students after training and processing and re signs them up and takes their money and usually nets some 50 of the orgs income for additional signups in these after interviews admin setup 1 dept 7 is responsible for the admin setup necessary to cash collection for the registrar 2 invoice packs are issued the registrar by the cashier and standardly logged in and out 3 the registrar invoices all monies received by her over the counter 4 the cashier and registrar work in close liaison one could even set up buzzer system between the cashier and registrars office so that the cashier could be called upon at moments notice to serve the registrar 5 the cashier makes change for the registrar the money and any notes are handled by the registrar 6 the registrar turns over to the cashier the fourth copy of her invoice and any note and the money received as usual dept 7 also gets the 3rd copy of any debitcredit invoice for collection purposes 7 the cashier then checks for correctness of invoice and sees that it matches the money received 8 the cashier keeps the money until picked up by the fbo or ram for banking 269 9 dir income remains responsible for doing weekly income breakdowns combining registrar takings and income dept receipts for the week 10 body collections are done by the cashier on past due payments locally and may also be done by fsms 11 the income dept is mainly concerned with getting in monies owed to the org and advance payments through standard collection actions and monthly statements 12 the above is done with routine admin setup which uses the xerox and address machine but entails letter writing or typing statements collection letters can of course be written to debtors who are not answering up to statements 13 the income dept has series of income folders each folder has in it summary sheet for that account 14 invoices are posted by hand to the summary sheets routinely 15 once month summary sheets are xeroxed for statements 16 dept 7 also uses billing slip which bears please remit in bold letters and which has blank space to write down the balance of account 17 dept 7 keeps

whatever source accountants first interest in mail is whether or not it contains money therefore he rapidly opens mail and places it in either of two baskets basket 1 accountant to comm centre receives all mail not containing money basket 2 accountant to invoice clerk receives all mail and money as further described basket 3 invoice clerk to comm centre receives all mail as fast as invoiced cash box beside invoice clerk receives all money accountant uses stapler in fastening letters to envelopes he staples all envelopes to their letters he uses paper clips to fasten money and cheques to letters invoice clerk never uses stapler always uses paper clips accountant does further separation of mail than 1 mail with money or orders in it and 2 with orders or money in it he does not stamp mail as received mail with money orders in it is placed by accountant in basket 2 invoice clerk only invoices does not otherwise process mail he writes name and address very clearly he marks the invoice number on the order letter and with paper clip attaches the white and the yellow to the letter he writes any special directions about the order on the invoice slip he puts any money in the cash box he handles each order letter one at time he takes order letter from basket 2 writes invoice verifies sum of money notes any discrepancy on the invoice or any credit due or amount still owing marks number of invoice on the letter removes money from order letter and puts money in cash box clips white and yellow to the order letter and places it in basket 3 before he touches another order from 2 when invoicing to more than one organization the money is invoiced to the organization giving the service not necessarily the organization mentioned in the letter or on the cheque or money order such misnaming on cheques or money orders by public is straightened out by accountant at time he deposits by simply adding his pinks for any organization and taking that much money from cash box and depositing it to that organization cheques can be cross endorsed as needed to make this balance it is balanced with cash not at time of invoicing further split of cheque where part is payment for book on one corporation and part is processing payment on another is simply invoiced with the proper amount to each corporation and the cheque placed in cash box the moment the accountant has finished with mail he sets an hour such as noon for end of mail day and keeps all mail arriving after this hour to the next morningthus invoicing only once 24hour day he takes everything in basket 1 to comm centre and gives it to reception the moment the invoice clerk is finished he takes everything in basket 3 to reception 272 neither the accountant nor the invoice clerk distribute reception distributes

collection of accounts not hco policy letter original colour flash not green on white this supersedes all earlier directives on the collection of delinquent accounts all accounts collections that are delinquent stem from two sources 1 arc breaks 2 premeditated fraud arc breaks most failures to collect fall in category one arc breaks received during training or processing or through the mails or errors in accounts cause person to terminate the communication called money as well as other kinds suing such people does not collect money suits of this kind over period of the last two years cost more money than they collected and worsened the arc break the remedy of delinquent accounts depends on the following steps 1 accounts prepares list of delinquent debtors every thirty days this list is sent by accounts to the assistant registrar it is done at the same time as statements 2 the pr communicator gathers up the files to go with the list and gives to the assistant registrar 3 the assistant registrar writes these people on the basis of arc breaks trsn money is mentioned the assistant registrar pulls these people into communication and repairs the breaks by continued correspondence at the time of each new list submission statements to the people are still sent out each month independent of the assistant registrar further action is taken than the above premeditated fraud in the case of premeditated fraud we have person who at the beginning never intended to pay but intended to defraud such persons can usually be spotted by an insistence on courses and processing with down payment this is their hallmark records should be combed for list of such names and each time request for 277 totally credit arrangements is made by anyone that name should be added tentatively to the list this list is called the questionable risk list or the q r of these people must be demanded payment adequate to cover the real cost of the training processing or service and departure from this may be made in the cases of persons with proven past credit this caution may be relaxed suit of such persons is useless they have on the whole credit or possessions the question now arises when do we sue we sue only when we have had to guarantee credit company that we would which does not apply in the united states on the whole in the matter of credit the registrar and accounts must learn to say this is religious institution not credit agency we are not interested in credit and indulge in such credit activity only for your convenience it is not true we lose money by extending credit we make money by doing so thus cancellation of all credit as has been tried is serious mistake we can cut our income 23rds by trying to run on cash only this is tested fact so credit problems will be with us for long time i believe that if we collect only 50 of our allowed credit we are justified in advancing credit to cut our losses from advancing credit use the above procedures if person is profiting by dianetics or scientology and has not paid his share in it and he owes us money and wont pay it refer the matter to hco for certificate cancellation great many such persons now exist if they are an arc break with us they will harm us with the public if they are premeditated fraud they will harm us with the public therefore if all efforts to collect do not avail do the following 1 in the matter of trained auditor cancel his certificates and rights and sue him for illegal practice via local hco 2 in the matter of pc inform the person that the name will be published forbidding all further processing by anyone and sue in other words as general financial policy extend credit only when the down payment covers all cost or the past credit record guarantees future payment handle all failures to make payments as arc breaks and stretch patience to the limit in seeking to collect when all else fails and apparently will never work out play rougher than anyone would

because the policy laid down herein was constantly violated by cheque signers the accountants in every case had practice of dropping casual cheques before cheque signers and those cheques when signed and sent were in excess of income or any sensible procedure economy in each case should have started long before but for lack of continual advices and because of casually presented and casually signed cheques the affairs of the org were suddenly exposed as in terrible condition long after ordinary means would have salvaged them it took in every case nearly year and half of furious work to save the

in the bank by bank statement not by adjustment of outstanding cheques 3 the adding machine tape of the cheques being presented 4 disbursement voucher white clipped to each cheque with these data one can see whether or not it is safe to sign cheque or whether instead one must carefully plan ones way out of an impasse and preserve credit accounts presentations can be so complex the executive does not know what he is signing bank statements huge folders etc are not needed by the executive he or she only wants 1 to 4 above and in very concise form the totals of dateline paying sheets to date monthly bills mimeo sheets show the gross amount owed written list of bank accounts and the amount in each as per last statement is adequate adjusted or reconciled statements down to an hour ago are waste of time it all averages out if one always takes the sums on the statements with adjustment for outstanding cheques adjustments are often inaccurate and are lot of needless work the tape of the cheques to be signed should always be counted by the executive for the number of cheques on it and then the cheques should be counted before signing the number should be the same if one wishes one can also check the amounts on the cheque and the tape by comparing the total to be signed to the amount in the bank one can see if its safe to sign by requiring that the white disbursement voucher be clipped to each cheque one cures any tendency to omit writing vouchers and fouling up audits of accounts missing vouchers raise the mischief in an audit voided cheques should always be shown to the

of 5 may ad13 orgs only not students or franchise sec ed staff member enrolments issue the following secretarial executive director it expands cable already sent staff member enrolments on saint hill special briefing course under the general direction of the association organization secretary and the immediate supervision of the letter registrar and with the help of the director of training and the director of processing the following programme is instituted in that it is desirable to increase the number of saint hill graduates in any organization and area and in that saint hill training costs for staff members should be less of strain on an organization for every four paying students sent by an organization from the public or field in the organizations geographical area one staff member of that organization may be enrolled on the saint hill course without course fee field or public prospective students who have already signified their purpose of enrolling on the saint hill course to the saint hill course administrator are not to be included in the required number of students this does not mean that for every four staff members sent to saint hill one may be sent without fee this does not mean that an organization may not send additional staff members and pay their fee it does mean that if an organization is instrumental in enrolling four nonorganization auditors on the saint hill course one staff member may also be enrolled from the organization without fee evidence of enrolment will be course fee received at saint hill the staff member so enrolled may have his expenses paid including any small salary for maintenance here from the building fund thus relieving the salary sum and disbursement account of any expense other staff members sent with fee paid will have their travel expenses taken from disbursement account and their salary which includes their expenses at saint hill taken from the salary sum this has been instituted not because saint hill enrolments would not remain up but to increase the number of saint hill graduates in each area and to make it easier on orgs to get trained staff i also feel this may end any possibility of games condition building up whereby individuation occurs in getting people to enroll in the saint hill course remember that an hpahcahda is necessary requirement however there are not other burning rules such as age or field experience people arent too old or too inexperienced as auditors to enroll the course has gotten easier and is making excellent auditors out of its students regardless of age or experience in selecting an organization staff member to come to saint hill pick your better auditors please they finish faster however give priority to any staff member who overtly finds four enrolments for saint hill on his or her own it is however to the benefit of all staff members to promote this programme as it means loss of pay and technical boost for the organization this is my own

proportionate pay plan proposal 5 april 1957 not hco policy letter original colour flash not green on white the situation the board cannot raise wages as such since it is also afraid that in some slack period the payroll would swamp the association thus even in good period it cannot raise wages all management is in this situationhence its attitude on wages wages working for wage is one of the deadlier control mechanisms since it brings about an irresponsibility in the person for his job fixed wage is means of suppressing person into slavery class pegging him at hope this mechanism is one of the best modern society has for keeping people down it is artificial and arbitrary and denies person the fruits of his labour the association since the publication of two new books and after year and half of hard work by myself and council and staff the association is new organization its earning potential has not been realized yet it is not the old association its income is already rising above old levels however the association is stable it has been here and functioning for 5 years without falter and it is winning all the time scientology while we have for years been far ahead of any of mans earlier technology on the mind new certainty and ease of auditing have been added in the past three months which eclipses earlier strides that is why i am here had i not had so much to impart i would possibly not be here for this congress i am confident as never before concerning lower level and higher level cases with what we know we can expect soaring climb of association business which has always been just as good as the subject worked today we have four times the preclears we had to this period last year were doing four times better organization with the proper organization of procurement section association business is expected to rise payroll as the association books will show wages comprise an average of about 4489 of the associations gross income as the book sales of the association are minor part of its income these can be and would be omitted from the gross on which this is based with book sales omitted from income the figure could be estimated at around 48 of the whole gross with this pay plan proposal i am prepared to make the amount to be spent on wages 50 of the gross income less books and tapes this would prove considerably more than it has been the pay plan pegging salaries in proportion where they are and then using this as unit value we could divide these units into 50 of the gross income less books and tapes each week and pay on that basis the following week this would then give each staff member or employee the benefit of any increases in income as are expected there is reason for the association to pay it to inland revenue in profit tax 293 in this way the board would not be worried about salary increases and the salaries would increase to the degree that the association earned further this is not firm or corporation run for the profit of small group at the top what it earns should be shared since it is the product of the effort of all of us proportion of pay of the gross income less books and tapes we would use all of 50 always for pay purposes this would never be cut into for any other purpose or changed from 50 for pay we would take 25 and pay from it the bills of the association utilities building costs supplies phone payments on property etc as well as old bills of all kinds including books and printing books small income factor are really advertising we would take the remaining 25 of the gross and use it as an accumulating fund for new quarters outside london for royalties and sinking fund all these percentiles are on the gross less books and tapes the book and tape income we would set aside and out of it buy new book stocks pay old printing bills and in general use it as though it were part of the expense 25 to which it would be weekly added example we would take the pound as par if one were now getting œ8 week he would have 8 units if one were getting œ6100 he would have 65 units etc we take all the pay for week in terms of units let us say we have gross of 250 units let us say we have weeks income of œ500 50 of œ500 would be œ250 we divide the units 250 into the 50 250 and we have pay for that week of parunit is one pound now let us say we have an income of œ630 for one week we would take 50 of this and we would have œ315 divide 250 units into œ315 and we have unit value of 126 this gives us pay unit of œ126 multiply this times 8 units for person getting 8 units of pay and we have pay for that week for that person of œ1013 what pay would be under this plan we would hold staff units of pay between 200 and 225 see staff meeting minutes on pay plan this being the margin necessary for management to operate we would convene regular staff meetings and change the number of units only on staff majority votea necessary restriction on management which could not be permitted to rearrange pay units so as to compensate for increased income management would only have power to adjust units within the 200 to 225 but not to go above or below without majority vote history of this plan this exact plan has gone into use in washington the staff there voted to go all out on this they have been paid about 10 better for the first few weeks of the plan but income is just now beginning to rise recommendation i recommend that you study this well you should realise your pay could go down as well as up the primary reason this plan is advanced by is to raise pay however great change of operating could take place by reason of this plan think well then well have staff meeting and vote on it ive made my bid here to better things hope you see it that way too ron 294 hubbard

following system staff is paid 50 of the gross income less congress fees books and tapes of the organization staff member is assigned units of pay the value of the unit varies from week to week but is par at one pound this system was proposed by the agent for great britain and accepted by regular staff meeting on april 18 1957 was endorsed by the advisory committee and the staff minutes were

total receipts of congresses book and tape sales before any expense deduction is made the expense sum is 25 of the allocation sum plus the cbt sum less 12 12 of cbt the salary sum is 50 of the

fourfile accounts system all monies received are invoiced every sum expended including petty cash is put on the disbursement voucher machine this means that payroll goes through the disbursement machine there are two maxims that regulate this one the less copying from one piece of paper to another that an accountant does the greater the resulting accuracy entering or crossentering of figures should be abolished as far as possible two if you want to speed up communication line you take mest out of it thus in accounts the use of long sheets of payroll computations and lists should be minimized voucher computation the accountant knows the number of people he will have to pay their names and in small organization he has list in large organization he obtains it from the weekly departmental report which arrives in his hand tuesday after ad comm which lists personnel in each dept and their pay part of the one departmental report per week system the accountant has in the back of his creditor file file for every active staff member this file contains in the commonwealth all the government books for the person as well as all papers and invoice copies relating to pay plus his staff application sheet the first action in preparing payroll is to take these folders out of the file cabinet and make sure that one has folder for every active staff member to be paid and that any departed staff member file has been relegated to inactive and is not included this is done by checking them off against the personnel list of last weeks departmental reports lay this mass of folders on table and make up folder for any new staff member and put in inactive files any folder for departed staff member add up the number of units by going through the folders and complete salary sum calculations obtaining the value of the unit carefully crosscheck unit value to make sure it is absolutely right and that units x unit value equals salary sum before you go further take the disbursement voucher machine and place it to your right leaving blank area between machine and folders take file number one open it knowing the units of the person the unit value and having any deductions to hand in the folder on the voucher in the machine do any and all calculation if calculator is used put down its results on the voucher do not use scrap paper use the disbursement voucher in the machine make any govt calculation from any government tables and put the results down on the voucher and in any govt book from the persons folder 302 add up the pay and deductions on the voucher in the machine arriving at any amount the govt gets any amount deducted for the organization and the actual money now coming to the person pull the machine handle bunch up the three vouchers to begin pile away from the folders and machine put the folder that has been calculated furthest from you take the next folder and repeat the operation with it again making all calculations on the new voucher in the machine even scribbles must be put on the voucher since we want accuracy and legibility not neatness crank the second three out of the machine and lay them on the first voucher crosswise put the second folder at the back of the pile repeat this operation throughout the folders when all folders are so calculated and completed put all the folders back in the file cabinet and close it there are now folders or books on the table only the machine and the crisscrossed pile of vouchers take your data from the white do not separate other copies remove the disbursement machine put an adding machine in its place clear the adding machine take up the pile of vouchers first add up the total of monies if any to be paid to the govt by going through the vouchers get this or these final figures on tape mark what the tape is on the tape with pen put the tape aside for later reference go through the vouchers again putting any organization deduction for each person on the adding machine total the figure extract the tape from the machine and mark it as org deduction lay the tape aside take the voucher pile again and again from each white put the pay of each person on the adding machine total and remove the tape mark it pay total the three tapes and see if they compare with the salary sum you started with if they do not count the number of vouchers and the number of figures on the tape count the org deductions and the number of vouchers with org deductions count the number of govt deductions and the number on that tape if the error is not found by reason of an omission start at the beginning as above pulling out the folders and once more recalculating the number of units and pay and the amount of unit continue on through all calculations until error is located if error means correction of voucher have loose pieces of carbon paper to correct them with and be sure to correct the copy still in the machine it is doubtful if more than one or two vouchers would have to be so corrected as they do not accumulate the error each one being separate computation take the three machine tapes add them carefully make out cheque to this sum only enter cheque its description and purpose on 303 the disbursement machine giving on the voucher any govt sum org sum and actual pay make out separate cheque for any petty cash put its full description and purpose on the voucher take these two cheques and these two vouchers and all vouchers for pay to cheque signing persons for their inspection to get the exact right change for payroll make table before going to bank write down left to right across sheet of plain paper pounds ten shilling notes two shilling coins one shilling sixpenoes threepences pennies or in us ten dollar bills five dollar bills one dollar bills fifty cent pieces quarters dimes nickels cents take the vouchers and do sight breakdown of each pay sum to be paid in cash put down the number of pound notes etc it will take to pay that person and mark each monetary piece under the appropriate column then add up each column which will give the exact number of each monetary piece required from the bank needless to say addition across the bottom should add up to the amount of the gross pay cheque as you will also have coins in your petty cash cheque errors in payout can be remedied cash cheque at the bank making sure you obtain enough change do not get the money in packets for each person just get lump sum buy govt stamps or postal order to give the govt the amount it has coming from the cash you have in hand the org deductions are now invoiced on the invoice machine as loans or income the money for this sum is taken from the cash you received at the bank and placed in the usual income cash box pay day all disbursement copies and cash are laid out on table persons to be paid come in person to the accountant or cashier the person is given his white disbursement voucher for inspection by use of carbon between them he signs the yellow and blue copies the person is paid the pay sum from the disbursement copy the person retains the white the accounts officer tosses the yellow and blue into his file basket as soon as that payment is done all persons are paid anyone not there to be paid has the three vouchers and the cash placed in an envelope it is sealed and left in cash box until picked up at which time the yellow and blue must be signed as before filing the signed yellow copy is filed in the creditor folder of the staff member the signed blue copy is filed in the weekly pay breakdown envelope paying by cheque

held back to accts who at once invoices it saying exactly what it is on the invoice and gives the staff member the invoice white such staff member should also be given debtor folder at once copy of the invoice is then filed in it since debtor folders may be plus or minus with the org us modification as in the us some orgs may not pay the government anything go over the above with pencil and score out all references to govt payments commonwealth action the govt stamps bought as above should be posted to the books when the yellow is filed any govt sums should be postal ordered as we dont want the amount going back through our system the receipt for the order is filed in the creditor file marked govt with all other bills the govt being only creditor after all additives additional files to handle pay other than those mentioned above are not allowed paybooks are not kept only pay folders themselves complete reports if payroll report person by person is required by an executive other than the departmental reports that come to accounts it is not made by copying or typing the weekly pay blue vouchers signed are enveloped and sent to the executive who sends them back much better

organizations any organization not on units but paid on fixed pay should go over the above and pencil out all references to unit calculation to simplify the use of this directive compliance this system is effective at once upon receipt make up creditor folders for staff members obtain any of the above mentioned equipment and get this system in because it will save you time if you are keeping pay books etc etc drop them and file them in an extra folder at the back of the staff creditor folders so that they can be used for staff that wants yearly summations all such summations should come in the future from the folder of the staff member since that will now contain all future data please realize it is easier to do this and that this is more accurate than the system you are using and

that get into deep water over the paying of their auditors bookkeeping annual fees it is only suggestion and carries weight unless it is approved by full staff meeting lets take look at the situation our accounting system is ridiculously simple it has to be or wed need highly trained and very expensive personnel to keep it going it is not our policy to do this much better to have simple system that any reasonably intelligent person can operate efficiently and easily this way we cut hundreds even thousands of pounds off the payroll each year by doing away with the necessity of having to employ highly skilled personnel however our system has this drawback we have to by law in all countries have balance sheets drawn up audits done etc for the org these balance sheets can also be of considerable help to ourselves by providing useful information and to have these things done we must employ professional accountants who cost money probably the equivalent of six or seven hundred pounds sterling per year now as these accountants are in effect taking the place of staff we should otherwise have to employ i suggest that we in effect put them on the payroll in other words say the average annual audit fee is œ520 we put aside each week œ10 from the salary sum to accumulate in the salary account until such time as the accountants present their bill at which time cheque is drawn on the salary account for the amount involved œ10 x 52 œ520 alternatively if the account is to be paid by instalments cheques could be drawn once month or as necessary alternatively we hire as regular

letter reg typists vacation and leave rules are the same as for the day org day org personnel exec or otherwise may be paid as foundation who are doing their day work during these hours to be paid on the foundation the staff member must work on foundation duties exclusively this includes exec secs scientology executives do not receive overtime pay for extra hours worked on their posts as they are paid for being responsible for the duties of the post which includes management of work loads and management of posts and lines under them any exec having to work overtime for many hours routinely should analyze his lines for devt or off line work or he should shed some hats when one has to work late and long it means that the lines at that point are jamming or that the work is being handled inefficiently and ineffectively this should serve as an indicator for investigation the intention of the system outlined here in addition to paying for the responsibilities entailed in the rank of the post is to pay staff on the basis of experience in the org and experience in scientology as this is the day of expansion for scientology it is conceived that persons new on staff will be promoted and hence increase their pay on the basis of their statistics and will improve their level of training in scientology both technically and administratively through taking courses at night and through the attainment of staff status c in the event training took place in the period that lower levels were not being classified or the shsbc only the top level achieved vi or vii is understood to include the

incorrect examination shall pay the forfeit to the org the examiner threatened with such penalty by reason of this paragraph only may ask for board of investigation on the matter the full intent of this policy letter is to make it worthwhile for an examiner to make completely honest examination without regard to anyones statistic and to be immune from any pressure to declare or not declare the

allocation of income the current financial structure of outer orgs has been partly successful but on am overall basis has failed to 1 accumulate large reserve to handle unexpected financial needs and ensure solvency 2 provide staff with reliable and stable source of personal income 3 permit long range financial planning with any degree of certainty saint hill and the sea organization on the other hand have succeeded very well m all three of the above and upon inspection the most successful aspects of financial procedures in these orgs were found to be 1 fixed salaries as opposed to proportionate pay 2 disbursement sum well below the gross income of the organization to bring outer org finance in line with the above the following changes are made effective 1st january 1969 all orgs are required to operate on fixed sum this sum is derived from percentage of past quarterly corrected gross income of the organization this figure is then set as ceiling for expenditure for the coming quarter and is obtained as follows add the corrected gross income each week for the past quarter day and foundation combined b divide this figure by the number of weeks in this period c 70 of the figure in b above establishes the ceiling for expenditure in the coming quarter the term ceiling is defined as the set figure on which an organization operates weekly regardless of the income the day org being the senior org handles the financial planning for both orgs day and fdn based on the allocated amount the ceiling figure once established would normally remain the same throughout the quarter but in actual practice major increase or decrease in average income during the quarter could warrant change of the ceiling amount if the established figure proved unworkable any proposal for such change would be approved at the discretion of the deputy guardian for finance ww 324 while the ceiling establishes how much can be spent it would be wise for the executive council to bear in mind that the corrected gross income for any week may go below the allowed amount provision for this is made by always spending less than the allocated amount fixed salaries in an org which pays wages on unit system proportionate pay the wages vary wildly from one week to the next factor which in itself discourages expansionwhile at the same time large percentage of weekly income is consumed by payroll fixed salaries as currently paid by saint hill and the sea organization provide stable wage for staff members while consuming smaller portion of gross income thereby permitting the accumulation of substantial reserve it is the function of the executive council to set the basic salary for each staff member within the allotted percentage this is then approved by the assistant guardian for the org or the continental assistant guardian for finance wage scale will be approved which consumes the entire salary amount thereby leaving room for expansion reserve account this account replaces the general liability fund and building fund accounts the reserve account has purpose similar to the general liability fund and building fund accounts and is established for organizations to put aside monies for legal fees new buildings mission payments to sea org etc it is also designed to provide cushion of cash for organizations to fall back on if ever needed this account is setup to be trustee account for the outer orgs which is controlled by the guardians office ww and the sea organization the weekly deposits are considered disbursements to the sea org but the money in actual fact still belongs to the org for the purpose of its cashbills statistic as will be seen from the new ac 1 form the weekly deposit to reserve consists of the difference between the established ceiling figure and the weeks corrected gross income less the ww 10 this figure will vary considerably from week to week orgs which are not restricted by exchange control remit their weekly cheque made payable to the ots service account to the reserve liaison officer sea org for deposit the reserve account for south africa orgs is situated in johannesburg for australian orgs in sydney

the general liability fund and building fund accounts will be closed and the monies transferred by cheque to the respective reserve accounts via the reserve liaison officer monthly rent payments for

post public b board field auditors become staff cancels hco pol ltrs march 26 65 march 30 65 all field auditors of the level of hba and above are appointed herewith field staff members of their nearest scientology organization their rank is field staff member provisional they come directly under the department of clearing director of clearing of their nearest org the purpose of the field staff member is to help lrh contact handle salvage and bring to understanding the individual and thus the peoples of earth their pay shall be in terms of commissions and therefore should be equal to that of general staff members in the orgs themselves depending only on the activity of the field staff member the field staff member is not on proportionate pay and is not on payroll for tax purposes the situation is this the idea of the practitioner setting up practice to audit preclears must be wrong because it is used with poor success by new doctors and psychiatrists it also has worked poorly for doctors as groups as they more and more require government subsidy personally require large borrowed sums to set up new practices and depend for affluence on laws passed to protect them and give them monopoly monopoly held in place by force alone soon vanishes further their system took over 700 years to establish them to point where they could demand the legislation needed to protect them proof examine the status of medical man in the centuries between the great plague and today century by century and see the tiny progress each century in the standing of their profession and their security we neither have nor need 700 years civilization is successful only because it is team the individual in our present society has rough time we are team we have big job to do we need every one aboard hence the appointment this appointment should come as surprise as we were waiting only for the completion of technology to press the boom buttons and one of them was to reclaim and enrol as staff members everyone we have ever trained commissions the official scientology organization to which the field staff member is attached will pay the field staff member percentage of all training and processing fees received by that organization through its field staff members this system has already been piloted some years ago and its administration design is now smoothed out however it must be followed closely the field staff member selects the person to be trained or processed after direct personal contact with the person and issues to that person paper stating the contacted person has been selected this paper bears the hour date and place of the selection the paper is in quadruplicate the original goes to the person selected selectee the second copy is sent promptly to the field staff members orgs advanced booking registrar the third to the director of clearing and the fourth copy is held by the field staff member 328 if the selectee appears at the org presents the selection paper to the cashier and enrols for training and processing and pays the org sends at once commission of 10 for total cash there is waiting in sending the commission the org sends the sum at once 10 is also paid in memberships bought by the selectee if accompanied by another selection paper marked membership also issued by the field staff member example of commission selectee presents the selection paper at the org accounts office and pays for the services bought totally in cash the org promptly sends the field staff member 10 of the whole payment example selectee presents the selection paper of the field staff member at the org accounts office and pays for the service in cash the org promptly sends the field staff member 10 of the total sum these both end the transaction there is later amount owing the field staff member when the credit extended is paid off if any field staff member gave the selectee another later paper the selectee then used again commission would be paid by the org the person selected is directed by the field staff member to reception at the nearest organization the name and address of which is given to the selectee cash for memberships may be taken by the field staff member as memberships must be paid for only to the org accounts cashier the preclear or student may be selected as often or as many times as the field staff member can do so if the person is not however selected again by the field staff member after training or processing the org may select the person once more and commission is paid the org does not have to have selection paper to train or process person the org will honour and pay commission on the selection papers presented to accounts by the selectee it is the responsibility of the field staff member to inform the selectee to present his or her selection paper existing centres existing scientology centres are not official orgs the field staff member is not attached to unofficial orgs however centre or group or group of auditors may send selectee as student or pc providing it is field staff member that signs the selection form centres may not have field staff members of their own unless the centre is owned and operated by scientology and field staff members may not send pcs or students to any but official orgs to do so constitutes suppression of scientology official orgs as this is scientology org activity not designed for centres or franchise holders to use until they are officialized and their service can be supervised remember to use this system all centre has to do to use the field staff member system is become official and meet requirements for new org forms where forms exist the field staff member can write on plain paper preferably pink the org flash colour for accounts matters and using carbon or hand copying can make the forms himself the form must bear the hour date and place the block printed name and address of the selectee and the block printed name and address and certificate initials and certificate number of the field staff member and what the selectee is selected for membership training or processing and some approximation of arrival date at the org orgs may care to furnish forms but this is all they contain membership and rate cards the field staff member should be supplied with book lists membership descriptions and the org rate card he or she should give copies of these to the selectee if the field staff member has them books the field staff member may buy books from an org and sell them for his own profit any discounts are arranged with the org and regulated by the director of publications saint hill 329 org members other org staff members may not use this system as they are general not field staff members but where they have had personal pcs before taking org employment they may handle the matter as field staff member would if done within the first three months of org employment and the selection was done before org employment certificate required any auditor who has any certificate including hubbard book auditor may become field staff member classification is required other stipulations may be locally made pitfall this is all taken from my own experience when i was the only field auditor there was i was hammered at by many to process them and became quite overworked i was only saved by org formation to which i could turn over my traffic the moment field auditor starts individual processing he becomes too pinned down to promote and in year or so fails therefore or has to turn to other activities i got my pcs by casual personal contact and by letting book circulate the original thesis and by local personal promotion i ran pe type course not as high as an has and at one time had even psychiatrists demanding i process their wives after they had heard one lecture the demand for my own processing cut back my time and nearly stopped everything until i turned everyone over to the org and got on with my local public promotion i refused to process people myself and therein lies the secret of expansion only an org with its organization and facilities and teamwork can handle pcs and students even very small org doesnt dare process pcs or train students it does best when it only promotes and it should send its pcs to bigger org it should limit itself as i did after orgs took my pcs over to short assists pe courses and small coaudits dissemination formula ive now discovered the dissemination formula weve wanted so long and its easy central orgs have it and train field staff members on it in the staff training programme being tech it has part of this policy letter it takes four or five hours to learn theory and practical the org will have all such programmes of staff training payment of commission accounts receives the selectees selection paper from the selectee when that person arrives at the accounts window accounts must write on the invoice the auditors name who did the selection accounts will at once or within week of registration make out cheque for 10 of the cash payment made to the field staff member and mail it to him or her when the commission is paid accounts sends an invoice copy of the payment and of the pc or students training processing or membership payment to the dept of clearing the department staples these to the field staff members copy and files it under the field staff members name the commission is only given on the actual amount the selectee paid in intensives this should be for at least one intensive however if at that appearance the selectee bought several grades worth of intensives or several courses the commission is also given for those time there is time stipulation as to how often selectees may be selected and the org has period of grace wherein person may only be selected by the org itself if an org procures pc or student however directly the org not one of its general staff members gets the commission 330 professional rates commission is also paid on professional rates but not to the auditor himself or friend who will refund the commission the professional rate applies only to auditing there is professional rate for training or courses disputes where one field staff member claims he or she sent in pc or student and another also claims it the director of clearing should be appealed to to settle the dispute the org always pays on the selection paper handed in by the selectee not on the earliest contact at least one of the claims must be paid two commissions may not be paid on the same matter to settle dispute field staff member who feels an error has been made can write the director of inspections and reports in his nearest org who will handle it disputes between field staff members in any disputes between two field staff members either may appeal to the chaplains court department of success in their nearest org which may hear the matter by mail and render decision such an action does not make any scientologist liable to further action forming orgs as official orgs are now on the lookout to form orgs and as distant service is not as easy as close service the hco area sec should be approached concerning the formation of new local org such an org would be owned and operated by scientology from saint hill the hco area sec will base decision upon the amount of traffic coming from that area and the successfulness of the field staff members there final permission for new org must come from saint hill the new org will be only class zero org at first with very limited services but all orgs grow such an org must be formed and conducted like any other official org it is prohibited for an old org to finance new org in any way the new org pays percentage of its gross to the founding official org and the new org pays 10 commissions as above to the field staff members on its staff but only if it is fully official and only when authorized to have an hgc until it has an official hgc it continues to operate on commissions and pays percentage to the forming org but still receives them its pe and coaudit activities and commissions paid in students and pcs sent into the founding org support it hgcs and academies hubbard guidance centres of official orgs only may be sent pcs and academies of scientology only may be sent students by field staff members as long and arduous experience has determined that great quantities of trouble can come from courses and clinics which are unofficial and usually official orgs have to clean the resulting mess up notable examples were sydney and the us pacific north west in 54 there have been dozens of such instances with many people hurt the names hubbard guidance centres and academies of scientology are protected by law only their service is supervised by saint hill or myself field staff member regulation field staff member comes under the same discipline as any other org staff member and is subject to the same codes of ethics auditing org pcs or students is forbidden to all staff members acceptance the field auditor should write his or her nearest official organization addressing his letter to the director of clearing who would be his superior in an org giving his acceptance of appointment or declining it in return he will receive his credentials as field staff member provisional which consist of letter signed by the hco secretary signifying his or her appointment to be followed after year by more formal credentials in writing the director of clearing head the letter re field staff member 331 appointment and give current address and any other particulars if there are any questions or hitch write to at saint hill provisional the first appointment is provisionalmeaning not permanent at the end of one year the appointment expires unless renewed on being confirmed at the end of one year the provisional is removed and more extensive credentials are issued when field staff member provisional has been one for ten months he or she should write the director of field activities requesting the full appointment be made and giving any evidence of good work at that time the director of clearing will cause to be issued new set of credentials to the field staff member declaring him or her to be field staff member activity is the criteria of issuing full credentials if any difficulty develops in obtaining full credentials contact at saint hill the names or short lists sent to the field staff member for selection or collection are considered to be org prospects the field staff member may only select them to the org or collect from them for the org and if the field staff member processes or trains for his own fee prospect names sent by the org he is subject to discipline by the distribution secretary private practice any field auditor with private practice who wishes to retain it should advise his organization or association secretary of the nearest official org and explain why centres any centres wishing to become class zero orgs should advise the hco area sec of their nearest org they are accepted when authorized by the office of lrh and when the earlier mentioned conditions for new org are met meanwhile they operate in relation to their nearest org as group of field staff members if they accept appointment as field staff members franchise holders existing franchise holders may retain their franchise and status so long as they remain in good standing at saint hill new courses and processing field staff members hca and above may have the professional rate now for hgc intensives if international members in good standing courses for field staff members are given at the same fees as for any other international member or staff member there is professional rate for courses only for intensives they are however given short briefings on pertinent subjects at such times as the secretary of their org makes it available however the better trained field staff member is the better he will succeed and therefore this appointment should not interrupt training plans debts field staff members may be requested by the department of accounts to collect overdue accounts on which 10 commission of any sums collected will be paid by the org but they may not be ordered to do this accounts may release to field staff members in an area lists of overdue accounts in that area by using arc break technology and assists the field staff member may collect the sums in cheque form only payable to the org and forward it with any details to accounts in the org accounts must inform inspections and reports of any such issue of lists or any collections received by this method all such assists are given at the field staff members own discretion without org reimbursement general and executive staff member selections the general staff member of any org may select students or pcs or memberships applicants by issuing them selection papers to their own orgs in this case any commission is paid to the staff members own org and the selection paper is of different appearance the general or executive staff member receives any benefit through org pay along with the rest of staff 332 saint hill field staff members any auditor trained to any level at saint hill is similarly appointed by this policy letter all saint hillers are therefore appointed field staff members saint hill when working as general staff member or executive for an org the 10 is paid to that org not the staff member personally so that all its staff may benefit they may select to the saint hill course or hgc the same stipulations and procedures as for other orgs as above in this policy letter apply to saint hill field staff members commissions are paid on the saint hill briefing course and saint hill hgc if the student or pc sent is sent expressly to saint hill as above acceptance of appointment from saint hill does not prohibit being as well field staff member of local org senior org preference field staff member trained and certified at senior org may be field staff member of that org even while employed on staff by junior org but the commission is paid to the junior org the junior org is paid the commission on any pc or student he sends to the senior org not his own memberships alone are denied commission in such case as the junior org can also sell them such field staff member for senior org employed in junior org must not distract students or pcs already selected by field staff member of the junior org before they can present selection papers being on two staffs any field auditor can be field staff member to more than one org but is actually on the staff of the nearest org to his address and may not use another appointment to another org or saint hill to set aside the nearer orgs requirements of him or her in changing location the field staff member must inform the director of clearing of the org he has been

selectee was supposed to present this paper to the cashier of the org when signing up and only then was commission paid i now find the selectee seldom remembers to present the paper in the hurlyburly of arrival at an org therefore policy on this is modified as follows the preclear or student may but need not present the selection paper personally to the cashier of the org for commission to be paid the field staff members commission will be paid anyway in the event of two field staff members selecting the same person the paper the selectee acted upon will be credited in case of disputes ethics is to settle the matter equitably between field staff members involved the procedure is changed only as follows the commission of the field staff member is paid when the selectee signs up payment is on the same terms as before but the responsibility for the payment of commission lies with the director of clearing field staff members must send an additional copy of the selection paper to the advance schedule registrar dept of registration department 6 division 2 the advance schedule registrar notes it in her advance schedule book and gives the selection paper copy to the body registrar these copies of the selection paper are kept by the body reg in file alphabetically arranged this is the selectee file when any person comes to sign up who might be selectee the body registrar looks for the persons name in the selectee file and if it is there marks the conditions of sign up on the selection paper from the file and sends it to the disbursement dept for commission to be paid disbursement pays the commission on the basis of this copy the field staff member also sends his usual copy of the selection paper to the director of clearing dept 17 division 6 distribution division this means then that the field staff member selects student or preclear to an org the field staff member must also send two copies of the selection paper to the org one to the advance schedule registrar and one to the director of clearing in this way there is cross check possible and none will lose out on commissions an org as field staff member selecting to another org or saint hill follows the same procedure original to the selectee copy to the advance schedule registrar and copy to the director of clearing of the org to which the person is selected director of clearing each week on friday before attending his divisional adcomm meeting in the last hours of that day the director of clearing must obtain list of every student and pc signed up that week and compare these to his complete file of selection papers and find if they have been selected he notes which ones have and sends this list to disbursement for guidance disbursement action disbursement checks off the commissions it is paying and how much and sends the list back to the director of clearing this is used in the adcomm of the dist div to quote as statistic 334 reconciliation if there is difference in the lists disbursement receives from the registrar the amount of money received by income or the list submitted by the director of clearing disbursement informs the director of clearing during the following week whether informed or not the director of clearing must make sure that there is error or omission m paying commissions if disbursement does not pay commissions properly owed field staff members the director of clearing makes statement to that effect in his dist div adcomm meeting for inclusion in the minutes and also reports it to inspection and reports and does not rest on the matter until he is sure his field staff members have all been paid if it comes to anyones attention that selectee is in the org taking service on whom commission has been paid then it must be reported at once to the director of clearing the director of clearing must then follow through to make sure that commission is paid policy is field staff member who selects person for training or processing may remain unpaid the field staff member is responsible for sending in two copies of any selection paper to the org and giving one to the selectee he may keep copy for himself any pieces of paper serve so long as they have the selectees name and address and date of selection for what selected and the name of the field staff member proper forms may be furnished proper routings on them by the director of clearing to the field staff members unpaid field staff members if field staff member finds person he or she selected has actually entered an org for service and commission has been received within three weeks the field staff member must report the omission to the ethics officer of the org who should investigate and see that the matter is cared for the ethics officer must report the matter and its final disposition to the adcouncil as soon as findings and actions are complete errors in payment must also be so reported by the field staff member to the ethics officer the gravest possible view will be taken of any irregularities in field staff member commissions resulting in incorrect or nonexistent payment of field staff member commissions and should the registrars disbursement or the director of clearing especially become lax in this matter ethics action must be taken and reported as well to the office of lrh saint hill field staff member appointments any eligible person may become field staff member provisional appointment must be sent promptly to any eligible person applying furthermore as some auditors being eligible take their appointment for granted and simply send in selection papers the director of clearing on receiving selection paper from person not on his list must at once establish the eligibility of the person and if eligible must send an appointment as provisional field staff member to the person at once although application was made summary field staff members commissions do not depend upon administrative facts but upon the actual presence of student or pc in an org taking service and directed there by the field staff member to guarantee speed and smoothness in receiving commissions the field staff member should do all possible to help by sending in two legible copies of selection paper to the org and giving one to the selectee and keeping record himself the proof of an owed commission is however the presence in the

informing the area cashier as to whether the person signed up was selected by an fsm 4 the area cashier writing invoices clearly showing whether service has been fully paid for 5 the director of tech services noting that the person has started taking services in the org 6 the director of disbursements getting written attestations from the registrar as to what was signed up for and when and whether the service was selected and when and by whom from the area cashier that the service was fully paid for or exceptionally that proper credit arrangements were made and from tech services that the person has started taking services in the org and when 7 the dir of clearing and the dir of disbursements each independently keeping record of all fsm payments made so that there is double check on possible double or incorrect payments of commission 8 full csw including attestations as above being available to the cheque signers who sign the fsm commission cheques 9 the dir of clearing being vigilant that valid fsm commission remains unpaid reservations ic the reservations ic notes the selection in his advance reservations book and thus reserves for the person an appropriate date he has the letter registrar write to the selectee personal letter not form letter on the lines that he is pleased to hear that you have been selected by fsm for services selected on about approximate date given on the selection slip and that he has provisionally scheduled the person for service starting on date the letter registrar asks for confirmation of the reserved date and adds that reservations ic will be shortly sending packet of information material which is later done the reservations ic acknowledges the selectee for setting date but encourages him to come earlier the reservations ic should drive in as much business as possible on the tech division as soon as possible without regard to overloading the tech division 337 the reservations ic then initials the selection slip with date and routes it to the body registrar body registrar the body registrar keeps file of all selection slips received from the reservations ic filed alphabetically for easy access when person comes to him to sign up for service the body registrar takes from the file all selection slips relating to that person and uses them as guide to the persons interests but of course the body registrar from her interview with the person and her knowledge of org services decides what services the person should take always encouraging the person to sign up for many services when the person has signed up if there are selections by more than one fsm the body registrar asks the person whom he considers selected him or her selection routing form the body registrar initiates selection routing form which is document routing form not body routing form separate form is used for each service signed up the form has spaces to be filled in by the body registrar as to persons name service signed up for hour and date of sign up name of fsm who selected the person for that service date service is to start and initials of the body registrar attesting to these data the body registrar staples the selection slip to the appropriate selection routing form and hands it to the area cashier when passing the person on for him to pay for the services signed up when there is only one selection slip and more than one service signed up the body registrar attaches the slip to the selection routing form for the first service to be taken and notes on the other selection routing forms that this has been done thus later recipients of the form know where to find the slip if needed if there are selection slips to hand the body registrar asks the person if he has been selected by field staff member and if so gets details and writes these on the selection routing form noting on it that there was selection slip and getting the selectee to attest on the form in the space provided that the details given are correct the body registar keeps record of all sign ups selection routing forms started and whether selection slip was attached thus when the person comes back for resign up body registrar has record of what was done at previous sign ups area cashier the area cashier gets the person to pay in full for all the services signed up for if an advance payment has partly paid for the services this is of course taken into account any service must be fully paid for before the person starts taking it unless credit is specifically permitted by policy and proper arrangements note signed have been made for payment or unless it is review auditing if the area cashier fails to persuade the person to pay for the other services signed up he tries to get partial payment in advance but fsm commission is not payable until the service is signed up and fully paid for and the preclear or student is in the org taking service the selection routing form for each service has space for the area cashier to write the date amount paid invoice number and yes to the question is this service fully paid for and to attest with initial and date if the service is one for which credit is permitted by policy the area cashier having made the necessary arrangements writes credit in answer to the above question if credit is not permitted for the service the area cashier does not write on the form but tells the person that the service cannot start until payment is complete in 338 such case the area cashier files the form in the persons advance payment folder or in his collections folder if the service is fully paid for or if credit has been allowed the area cashier routes the selection routing form with the blue copy of the invoice to tech services if more than one service has been signed up and paid for all the relevant selection routing forms are routed to tech services tech services the director of tech services attests on the selection routing form that the person has started taking service in the org this is done on each form that has been received from the area cashier at that time even though only one service is being taken and the other forms relate to services to be taken later but before the person leaves the org as completion if the person is delayed in starting taking service the director of tech services holds the selection routing forms pending but completes the attestation immediately the person starts taking service and ensures that the forms do not get overlooked the director of tech services routes the completed forms to the director of disbursements director of disbursements the director of disbursements checks from the selection slip and the selection routing form that the commission to the fsm is valid as per current policy and that there is complete set of attestations on the form he also checks from record kept by the disbursements officer of all payments made to fsms filed alphabetically under names of persons taking service that previous payment has been made in respect of the service detailed on the selection routing form he attests on the form that this is all in order he then passes the documents to the disbursements officer disbursements officer the disbursements officer prepares cheque for presentation to the cheque signers and attaches it to the documents having entered on space provided on the form the amount of the commission cheque number and date name of bank and bank account and having attested to these with initial and date since fsm commissions may not be budgeted but must be permitted to rise to any level as long as the commissions are valid purchase order or financial planning approval is needed all the prerequisites as set in in hco pol ltr of 30 jan 1966 issue iv cheque signing procedure must be provided to the cheque signers with any fsm commission cheques when the disbursements officer receives the signed cheque he immediately mails the cheque to the fsm and the selection routing form and attached selection slip are routed to the director of clearing together with the second copy of the disbursement voucher the director of disbursements must report via the treasury sec to inspections and reports and to the advisory council for inclusion in their minutes any effort by the director of clearing to falsely pay any commission not allowed by policy or which may appear contrary to policy director of clearing whether informed or not the director of clearing must make sure that there is error or omission to paying commissions if it comes to anyones attention that selectee is in the org taking service on whom commission has been paid then it must be reported at once to the director of clearing the director of clearing must then follow through to make sure that any commission validly due according to policy is paid this is done by originating the 339 selection routing form clearly marked originated by dir of clearing with the director of clearings copy of the selection slip to the body registrar who must fill in the details and similarly for all the other terminals indicated on the selection routing form some students and preclears may not have been selected it is not the job of the director of clearing to force selection upon them if disbursements does not pay commissions properly owed fsms the director of clearing makes statement to that effect in writing to his secretary who must report it at the next ad council meeting for inclusion in the minutes the director of clearing also reports the matter to inspections and reports and does not rest on the matter until he is sure his field staff members have all been properly paid likewise the director of clearing must be sure false commission or commission contrary to policy is paid the director of clearing is also responsible for seeing that the line as described above flows smoothly and that papers are not backlogged anywhere however he is not to abuse this authority and devt personnel solely to obtain inclusion of any fsm payment in an earlier weeks statistic but he must certainly see that there is tardiness in payment of fsm commissions weekly lists in order to assist the director of clearing in this duty the body registrar prepares each week list of all students and pcs signed up during the week and routes it to the director of clearing as soon as possible after 200 pm thursday certs and awards similarly prepare weekly list of all memberships sold and route it to director of clearing each thursday the director of clearing compares these lists with the second copies of selection slips which have been routed to him by fsms and if it appears that commissions properly due have not been paid he follows the matter up the director of clearing also gets the selection routing forms after the cheques have been mailed and files them alphabetically by name of fsm he uses the file of selection routing forms as record of fsm activity and in answering queries from fsms the following

light of my own experience with persons demanding refunds and due to two recent upsets in organizations australia and london regarding refunds the following data may be of assistance in 13 years involving hundreds of thousands of hours of processing and millions of dollars of income in any organization where i was assuming direct command i have always promptly and immediately caused to be refunded every penny of the money paid by any person who was dissatisfied with his or her processing this has been the consistent policy i myself have worked with in all that time i have only refunded about 3500 this is due in part to ensuring certainty of results in any hgc and working hard to make sure the pc gets results regardless of the current style or mode of processing this low amount of refund is also due in part to my firm policy that persons who demand refunds may have them exactly according to the code of scientologist but that any person demanding or accepting refunds thereafter shall be refused as an hgc preclear and posted for the information of field auditors i have only worked then with these three policies 1 refund at once in full any refund demanded 2 work hard with tech staff to ensure good results 3 forbid the sale of further processing to anyone receiving refund and make the case known to scientologists it is notable that all but one refund were made to persons with histories of insanity who had been accepted unwittingly for processing recently australia was sufficiently remiss in following the code of scientologist as to incur potential legal action i did not understand why and investigated the facts resulted in my sending cable to the continental director requesting that he do the usualrefund the money and locate the bypassed charge the case promptly resolved what was shocking to is that he had not immediately refunded whatever else he did of course he was absent when the incident occurred but still his first thought on finding the matter out should have been to refund the money not because of threatened legal action but because an organization is bound by the code of scientologist central organization is as successful as it gives good technical service tough refund policy injects aberrated stable data against the confusion of bad or poor technical service mild refund policy keeps technical on its toes 344 the world of scientology is based on arc and held together with arc bad technical and tough attitudes concerning the remedy of poor service break down this world my own often repeated policy to my personal staff is give them what they want and keep them happy that sounds like very indefinite policy indeed but it makes people face up to and handle individual confusions as they occur each on its own merits it presupposes people are basically good and it is successful the more thetan you have present the less policy you need and the better things run only thetan can handle post or pc all he needs is the knowhow of minds as contained in scientology that was all he ever lacked so given that sheer policy is poor stuff as it seeks to make datum stand where being should be thats the whole story of the gpms so why not have live orgs policy is only vital where agreement must exist between two or more thetans working together beyond that it fails needful policy is well start work on time since without it the org goes ragged useless policy would be the registrar must always smile at an applicant for that puts datum where person should be so there are two kinds of policiesthose needed to obtain worktogether ease and those which seek to put datum instead of being in position the less you have of the latter the better things will get the more reasonable the former the more work will be done refund policy is an agreement type policy needful but it must be very mild indeed or it will stand in lieu of good service the new policy then is refund any fees when and as demanded whether for training or for processing 2 refuse further and all future training or processing to anyone demanding refund as the condition of refund 3 if 2 is not acceptable to the person demanding the refund then do all possible to smooth out the case or training situation 4 count only on high technical results in the hgc and academy to inhibit or reduce demands for refunds l ron hubbard lrhjwrd copyright c 1963 by l ron

also the system i advise for modicum of protection on this would be merely that when the monthly statements are prepared we should prepare them with 2 carbon copies one copy to remain with the accountant the other set of copies to be shipped by registered mail to the nearest hasi office for safe keeping this set of copies to be destroyed on receipt of the following months set in this manner the most we could lose record of would be the current months business and most of that would be sufficiently fresh in staffs minds that most of it would be remembered on item 1 when addresses is preparing the sticky labels of new addresses they merely make one extra copy and ship all the new ones off weekly to another hasi office this would not involve much work as there would be expiries as

hco policy letter of 15 february 1964 all heads of organizations hco secs dir admin administrators and supervisors of companies the equipment of organizations the person in possession of organization equipment is responsible for the equipment on its loss or damage through carelessness or neglect the person in whose charge it had been placed not only the person who damaged or neglected it is liable to have to recompense the company or myself for the cost of the repairs or loss of the equipment or some portion thereof stock cards for all equipment possession or issue in organizations shall be prepared by the administrative head of the organization if equipment is not so accounted for and is lost or damaged the administrator of the company not having stock card of issue on it becomes liable financially to the organization or myself for its repair or replacement the idea of company property is both stupid and dangerous that which is owned by everyone is actually owned by one and falls apart company corporation or state does not live or breathe and so it cannot care for anything the doubtless noble experiments of totalitarian communal states such as cuba or russia starve and fail because of this one idee fixe only the state owns that leaves nobody to have or take care of anything their enormous five year plans never materialize because their tractors will not run their tractors wont run because they belong to nobody saying they belong to the state is way of abandoning them company cant really own anything since it has concept of ownership and you see how company property falls apart look at it this way you own those things that are in your charge when you take over position you become richer by the things that go with it you stay rich as long as you keep them in good shape you get poor to the degree they go bad or wont work or get abused because you incautiously lent them to careless fellow worker righteous indignation because you messed up my typewriter or you scarred up my auditing table is not peculiar its quite in order look around you and see what you own in your position if two people use it only one even so can own it it is curious that around orgs my own personal possessions are given good care i never worry about my mest being in org hands and lot of it is if its rons its taken care of thats long standing observation but company property gets badly abused at times if you figure that i own everything in scientology and you own the things that go with your position well have more and have it longer there are three kinds of possessions in scientology organizations title these are permanent installations buildings walls radiators anything fixed in place title b valuable equipment which is not expendable these are desks typewriters mimeo machines blackboards chairs furniture rugs decorations cars etc title c these are expendables office supplies paper chalk stencils dust rags mops etc they are issued on the understanding they will get used up 358 in inventorying and making up cards of issue to persons in charge title is issued to the head of the organization or department exclusively using them title b is made up to the head of the department or the person who is actually using them title c is issued to the person using the material stock cards are kept on title and title b the administrative head has to have signature for title and title b as having given it to somebody who then signs for it stock cards may be written or issued to training dept or director of training they are issued to richard roe the person himself the main building is not issued to organization secretary it is issued to george george person who happens also to be organization secretary car is not issued to department of materiel it is issued to john john who happens also to be director of materiel when person is transferred his possessions are signed for by the person as person who takes over that position and so long as the person who owned them has failed to transfer them to the new person he or she can be charged up for them regardless of post transfers the person on the stock card remains the owner and is liable for any loss or abuse until the possessions are actually signed for by somebody else if it exists somebody owns it and has signed for it and until new person signs for it the old owner is liable for it regardless of his whereabouts or new post until it is signed for initially it is owned by the administrative head and if anything happens to it or it is lost the administrative head is liable for it the stock cards should be stiff cards of good size kept in box that fits them there is only one card per piece of equipment the card says where it is and what it is and when bought and has ample area for owning and transferring signatures cards are prepared from inventory and are checked by accounts records new acquisition brings about new card which is then signed for the head of the organization is accountable personally for any losses up to july 1 1964 which occurred during his term of office to dispose of title or title b or account for its loss it is necessary to survey it this is done by board of three executives of departments who must see the equipment being disposed of or certify it as lost survey board is liable for any falsification of records in organizations that have director of administration the head of the organization acts in his capacity and is responsible for having stock cards we are pretty good withal on the subject of equipment its loss or damage is not one of our major problems only one organization johannesburg has gone mad on the subject where one senogles temporary head of it had passion for losing tapes and tape recorders however we are expanding expansion needs some orderly ownership there is not very much title and title b about so it is not very heavy task to organize it if we straighten this out now well save ourselves mess later further at this time inventories for corporation transfers have to be done anyway so we may as well get it all done at once lrhglrd copyright c 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved l ron hubbard 359 hubbard
