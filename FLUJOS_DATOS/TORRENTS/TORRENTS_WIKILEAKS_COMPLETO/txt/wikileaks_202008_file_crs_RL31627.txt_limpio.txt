december 17 2003 jeffrey w seifert analyst in information science and technology policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress computer software and open source issues primer summary the use of open source software by the federal government has been gaining attention as organizations continue to search for opportunities to enhance their information technology it operations while containing costs for the federal government and congress the debate over the use of open source software intersects several other issues including but not limited to the development of homeland security and egovernment initiatives improving government information technology management practices strengthening computer security and protecting intellectual property rights currently the debate over open source software often revolves primarily around information security and intellectual property rights however issues related to cost and quality are often raised as well open source software refers to computer program whose source code or programming instructions is made available to the general public to be improved or modified as the user wishes some examples of open source software include the linux operating system and apache web server software in contrast closed source or proprietary programs are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the software manufacturer in the case of closed source software updates to program are usually distributed in the form of patch or as new version of the program that the user can install but not alter some examples of closed source software include microsoft word and corel wordperfect the majority of software products most commonly used such as operating systems word processing programs and databases are closed source programs for proponents open source software is often viewed as means to reduce an organizations dependence on the software products of few companies while possibly improving the security and stability of ones computing infrastructure for critics open source software is often viewed as threat to intellectual property rights with unproven cost and quality benefits so far there appear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusively compared closed source to open source software on the issue of security in practice computer security is highly dependent on how an application is configured maintained and monitored similarly the costs of implementing an open source solution are dependent upon factors such as the cost of acquiring the hardwaresoftware investments in training for it personnel and end users maintenance and support costs and the resources required to convert data and applications to work in the new computing environment consequently some computer experts suggest that it is not possible to conclude that either open source or closed source software is inherently more secure or more cost efficient at this time there appears to be centralized accounting of open source software throughout the federal government however the growing emphasis on improved information security and critical infrastructure protection overall will likely be an influential factor in future decisions to implement open source solutions the rapidly changing computer environment may also foster the use of combination of open source and closed source applications rather than creating need to choose one option at the exclusion of another this report will be updated as events warrant contents what is open

government use of open source software 6 use of open source software by other governments 8 for further reading 9 computer software and open source issues primer what is open source software open source software refers to computer program whose source code1 is made available to the general public to be improved or modified as the user wishes changes to such computer program may be available freely through web sites and users groups dedicated to that particular program some examples of open source software include the linux operating system2 and apache web server software3 in contrast closed source or proprietary programs are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the software manufacturer in the case of closed source software updates to program are usually distributed in the form of patch4 or as new version of the program that the user can install but not alter some examples of closed source software include microsoft word and corel wordperfect the majority of software products most commonly used such as operating systems word processing programs and databases are closed source programs although open source software has been attracting renewed attention recently its origins date back to the development of arpanet in the late 1960s during this time the individuals and universities that composed the small network of programmers often worked collaboratively sharing source code as means to build their knowledge base5 more recently open source software has been seen by some observers as an alternative to the influence of few large software companies in 1 source code is the set of programming instructions written by the software developer that allows program to execute its functions source code is written at the keyboard and appears as set of commands in the form of words symbols and numbers after programmer has finished writing the source code it is compiled into machine language that is recognized only by computers and is represented entirely as numbers proprietary software includes only the machine language code which allows the computer to function but cannot be altered by the user open source software includes the source code and sometimes the machine language code so that the user can make changes to how the software program functions 2 for more information about the linux

httpwwwgigalawcomarticles2000allhollander200004allhtml crs2 some of the more popular user areas such as operating systems and office productivity suites one of the more well known open source programs is linux an operating system developed in the 1990s by linus torvalds finnish programmer now working for an information technology company in the united states while linux holds small share of the operating system market compared to microsoft windows and is not widely used in the federal government some agencies have begun trial demonstrations in limited settings6 for example the national security agency has been working with volunteer programmers to create new version of linux called securityenhanced linux selinux in an attempt to develop tools and applications that could be used to improve the security of government computer systems7 leading organizations in the open source software community although the open source software community is loosely organized two primary organizations are identified as leaders in advocating standards and definitions one is the free software foundation fsf founded in 1985 and dedicated to promoting computer users right to use study copy modify and redistribute computer programs8 by free software fsf means that the user should be allowed to alter improve andor redistribute version of software program either gratis or for fee using this interpretation fsf does not suggest that software should necessarily be costfree the second major organization is the open source initiative osi9 osi is self described as nonprofit corporation dedicated to managing and promoting the open source definition10 through certification program it administers11 6 declan mccullagh and robert zarate supersecure linux inch by inch wired 11

software issues open source software has been gaining attention as organizations continue to search for opportunities to enhance their information technology operations while containing costs for the federal government and congress the debate over the use of open source software intersects several other issues including but not limited to the development of homeland security and egovernment initiatives improving government information technology management practices strengthening computer security and protecting intellectual property rights currently the debate over open source software often revolves primarily around security and intellectual property rights however issues related to cost and quality are often raised as well information security some critics of open source software suggest that it is less secure than proprietary or closed source software because it allows potential hacker to search the source code to discover and exploit flaws some observers suggest that the security through obscurity principle that accompanies closed source software enhances security by making it more difficult for potential flaws to be discovered and exploited12 concerns have also been raised regarding the possibility of trojan horse programs13 being introduced into computing environment through the downloading and use of open source software whose provenance may not be entirely clear in contrast advocates for open source software suggest that it may be less prone to security flaws due to the peerreview nature of open source software development this allows the source code to be scrutinized simultaneously by wide audience of individuals who bring different perspectives and may test the software under variety of conditions supporters of open source software suggest this approach can generate faster response to security problems and minimize the potential of trojan horse programs14 so far there appear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusively compared closed source to open source software on the issue of security in practice computer security is highly dependent on how the user andor administrator configures maintains and monitors the application consequently some computer security experts suggest that it is not possible to conclude that either open source or closed 12 although sometimes used as derogatory term by critics of proprietary software the philosophy behind the concept of security through obscurity is that security is enhanced if flaws are hidden from view and not publicized until solution can be made available 13 trojan horse program is destructive software program that appears as benign application one example is program that is described as an upgrade or service pack for current version of program but is in fact designed to disable computers virus scanner and introduces new viruses to the computer 14 drew clark defense cybersecurity officials praise open source software government executive magazine 29 october 2002 http20727329dailyfed1002102902td2htm crs4 source software is inherently more secure15 however this viewpoint may change as additional research is carried out intellectual property rights the implications of open source software for intellectual property rights continue to evolve while open source software generally provides users with greater freedoms than closed source software16 open source software is usually distributed with some form of licensing agreement17 that details the conditions under which user may use make changes and redistribute the source code critics argue that open source software threatens intellectual property rights because any software that incorporates open source code must be freely redistributed at cost while one of the underlying principles of open source software is the unrestricted redistribution of source code distinction is made between software that incorporates open source code into its program and programs that work with open source software for example the general public license gpl drafted by the free software foundation is one open source agreement the gpl requires that entities using open source code must upon further distributing that code or subsequent modifications of that code either provide copy of the source code or offer to give any third party copy of the source code however the gpl allows user to include an open source program with closed source program without providing the source code for the closed source program provided the two programs are functionally separate18 such as in the case of an editor program that works with shell program19 in contrast to the concerns raised regarding the potential threats to intellectual property rights some observers suggest that the increased use of patents as compared to copyrights or trade secrets by technology companies to protect online business methods such as oneclick shopping customer referral affiliate programs and buyer driven ecommerce could hinder the future development of open source software 15 jonathan krim opensource fight flares at pentagon the washington post 23 may 2002 p e1 michelle delio did ms pay for opensource scare wired 5 june 2002 httpwwwwiredcomnewslinux014115297300html dennis fisher open source false sense of security eweek 30 september 2002 p 20 16 most notably the ability to make changes to the source code 17 there are many open source licenses currently in use some are more general in nature designed to be easily adopted by anyone developing open source software while others are more specific created by particular company or organization collection of some of the most well known licenses can be found at httpwwwopensourceorglicenses 18 for more complete explanation of this concept see httpwwwgnuorglicensesgplfaqhtmlgplinproprietarysystem 19 in this example the editor program could be one that executes text commands to complete tasks while the shell program provides graphical interface with menus to allow the user to complete these same tasks without knowing the text commands so the editor program could be closed source program used by people with strong knowledge of text commands the shell program could be an open source program developed later to help less knowledgeable users to complete the same tasks the editor can work independently of the shell and as such the editor can be distributed with the shell program without having its source code included crs5 under this scenario technology companies could choose to license patented business methods and technologies only to organizations for use in closed source software this in turn could affect the type of software that could effectively be developed as an open source product as compared to closed source product quality related to the issue of security some supporters of open source software argue that the potentially large number of programmers contributing to the development of an open source program can contribute to higher quality product with fewer bugs because it is more likely an error will be discovered before it becomes major problem in addition some observers suggest that open source organizations generally react quickly when problem is discovered and use small software patches to fix specific problem potentially limiting unanticipated side effects these observers contrast this approach with that of software companies who may wish to wait and release multiple patches together in single service pack20 while the use of service packs can be more convenient and efficient than having to install numerous patches individually service packs can sometimes cause new problems due to the simultaneous introduction of several uncoordinated changes to the software program21 in contrast some critics cite the lack of formal vendor or technical support for open source software that is not commercially distributed since open source software is developed by community of users it often does not have dedicated technical support team that will respond to troubleshooting inquiries on fixed schedule where company or agency relies on the proper functioning of the software to carry out mission critical tasks vendor support can play an important role in the event of mishap related to the technical support concerns some observers suggest that open source software is not as reliable as the closed source or commercial alternatives because there is identifiable company or organization whose profits andor reputation is dependent upon the proper functioning of the software22 as with security there does not seem to be any conclusive study comparing quality moreover with both types of software continually evolving and quality being somewhat subjective measure firm conclusion may be possible cost the costs associated with using open source software compared to proprietary software is dependent upon number of factors including the cost of acquiring the 20 service pack is an update to software version that fixes an existing problem such as bug or provides enhancements that will appear in the next version of the product 21 jim rapoza eweek labs open source quicker at fixing flaws eweek 30 september 2002 httpwwweweekcomarticle20395956222600asp 22 in recent years as interest in open source software has become more widespread some software vendors have begun to sell commercial versions of popular open source programs such as linux which can include access to vendor provided support and service two examples of such companies include red hat httpwwwredhatcom and the sco group formerly known as caldera international httpwwwscocom crs6 necessary hardware and software23 investments in training for information technology personnel and end users maintenance and support costs and the resources required to convert data and applications to work in the new computing environment calculating these costs also referred to as the total cost of ownership tco is unique to each organization and application some observers suggest that by utilizing the community of unpaid programmers and users that grows around particular product open source software carries lower costs than closed source software by potentially decreasing the number of inhouse information technology professionals needed to support the software and by eliminating the need for costly service contracts offered by proprietary software developers the availability of community support may also offer the flexibility of allowing the adopting organization to decide if and when it will upgrade to new version of particular software program in contrast commercial software vendors usually discontinue support of older programs some time after new versions are introduced which leaves organizations to decide whether or not to continue using unsupported software or to incur the costs of upgrading to new version on the other hand organizations that adopt open source software in part due to the ability to customize the software for their particular needs will still need to either maintain an adequate level of internal information technology personnel or outsource these responsibilities on contract basis similarly many of the most popularly used programs in business and government such as word processing spreadsheets databases and email are designed to work with particular operating system such as windows so if an organization decides to switch to an alternative operating system such as linux it may also have to adopt other new programs requiring additional employee training and support implications for government use of open source software although there is increasing interest in federal government use of open source software the extent to which the use of these applications will continue to grow remains to be seen in an october 2000 report on the use of open source software for high performance computing the presidents information technology advisory committee pitac recommended that the federal government should aggressively encourage the development of open source software for high end computing the report also recommended that the federal government examine its procurement processes as they relate to open source software in addition the report suggested that there was need to analyze open source licensing agreements with an ultimate goal of agreeing upon single common licensing agreement for open source software applications24 23 while many open source software programs can be acquired for free commercially distributed versions of these programs are also sometimes available 24 presidents information technology advisory committee panel on open source continued crs7 in july 2001 report on the use of open source software for military applications the mitre corporation suggested that business case could be made for the implementation of open source software solutions for server and embedded systems based on potential cost reliability and support advantages however the report emphasized the need for program mangers to consider several factors when selecting strategy for specific set of circumstances these include assessing the size talent and organization of the supporting community examining the market demand for the open source product in question conducting riskbenefit analysis and comparing the long term costs of available options25 in an october 2002 mitre report on the use of open source software in the department of defense dod concluded that free and open source software plays more critical role in the dod than has generally been recognized it identified 115 open source applications and 251 examples of their use within the dod the report stated that open source software plays an especially significant role in the areas of infrastructure support software development security and research the reports authors made three recommendation regarding dod policies toward open source software they included creating generally recognized as safe open source software list as it regards information security and reliability developing generic infrastructure development security and research policies to promote the broader and effective use of open source software and encouraging the use of open source software to promote product diversity to reduce the dependence on single software product26 in addition to defenserelated purposes it has been widely reported that other agencies making some use of open source applications include national aeronautics and space administration nasa the department of agriculture the federal aviation administration and the department of energy27 currently one of more common applications is the use of apache one of the leading open source server programs to run government web sites28 there is also some use of linux for federal 24 continued software for high end computing october 2000 developing open source software to

critical infrastructure protection overall as well as the interest in developing governmentwide data intensive applications for homeland security and egovernment will likely be an influential factor in future decisions on implementing open source solutions the rapidly changing computer environment may also foster the use of combination of open source and closed source applications rather than creating need to choose one option at the exclusion of another in addition as the largest buyer of information technology products and services in the world the choices made by the federal government could have larger impact on the future growth or decline of open source software overall30 use of open source software by other governments the use of open source software by government agencies is growing issue in other countries as well in some countries governments have been taking an active role in encouraging the growth of open source software such initiatives have included proposals to either require the consideration or even mandate the purchase of open source software solutions for government technology projects the rationale for such proposals can vary widely in some countries open source software is seen as an inexpensive alternative for promoting it projects on limited budgets for example in brazil president luiz inacio lula da silvas administration has suggested that the licensing fees associated with proprietary software are unsustainable economically for its government to develop its technological infrastructure while also dedicating resources to improve its economic situation31 in thailand the government supported the development of linux tle thailanguage version of linux as part of its effort to increase citizen ownership of peoples notebook computers32 in other cases pro open source software policies are viewed as means to promote the development of domestic software industry and reduce dependence on foreign companies for both economic and national security reasons for example in september 2003 the governments of china south korea and japan agreed to collaborate on joint open source software development project this was followed by an announcement in november 2003 that the three major it industry associations of their respective 29 randall edwards nasa installs linux supercomputer federal computer week 18 november 2003
