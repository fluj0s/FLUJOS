voluntary voting system guidelines summary and analysis of issues summary the help america vote act of 2002 hava pl 107252 gave the federal election assistance commission eac th responsibility to develop set of voluntary voting system guidelines vvsg to replace the current voluntary voting systems standards vss the vvsg are to provide set of specifications and requirements to be used in the certificati on of computerassisted voting systems both paperbased and fully electronic that was also the purpose of the vss which were developed in response to concerns raised about voting systems in the 1970s and 1980s most states have adopted the vss in whole or in part and most are expected to adopt the vvsg which are scheduled to go into effect two years after approval the draft vvsg partial revision of the vss was released in june 2005 for 90day comment period volume i provi des performance guidelines for voting systems and is intended for broad audience it includes descri ptions of functional requirements and performance standards and requirements for vendors the most extensive revisions are to the section on usability and accessibility and the section on security of voting systems standards are also included for the use of voterverified paper audit trails vvpat recent s ecurity measure developed in response to concerns that electronic voting machines are vulnerable to tampering that might otherwise be difficult to detect volume ii provides details of th testing process for certification of voting syst ems and has few revisions some issues associated with the vvsg have been controversial among them is the question of timing some vendors cla im that there needs to be more time for technology development before the new guid elines become effec tive some activists argue that problems with voting system s and hava provisions demand more rapid implementation of the vvsg in any event it is generally considered unlikely that the guidelines will have much direct impact on voting systems used in 2006 when hava requirements for voting systems go in to effect one exception may be the vvpat provisions since the vss under which most current voting systems are certified have provi sions relating to this innovation the vvsg will be voluntary but some observers believe that regulatory approach would be more appropriate given the importance of elections to the mocratic process however since many states require that voting systems be cer tified vendors are expected to treat the vvsg in the same way they have treated the vss as effectively mandatory among the other issues being debated about the guidelines are whether they should be expanded to include voter regi stration systems whether they impede innovation by focusing on integrated system s rather than components how to treat commercial offtheshelf cot s products that are incorporated in voting systems and whether graded certification would be more effective than the current passfail approach several b ills introduced in the 109th cong ress could affect the scope or other aspects of the vvsg by requiring vvpat or other security provisions addressing concerns about conflict of intere st and other measures none have received committee or floor action in either chamber during the first session this report will be updated in response to major developments

pl 107 252 established the federal election assistance commission ac and gave it the responsibility to develop set of voluntary voting system guidelines vvsg the guidelines are set of technical standards for computerassisted voting systems that will replace the federal voluntary voting systems standards vss originally developed under the auspices of the federal election commissi on fec like those standards the guidelines are intended to be used in the development and certification of voting systems the vvsg are to provide set of specifica tions and requirements to be used in certification testing by independent boratories the eac released draft set for public comment in june 2005 that draft is partial revision of the vss the most extensive revisions are to the section on usability and accessibility and the section on security of voting systems which have been largely rewritten the public co mment period on the guidelines closed september 30 the eac had expected to have the final version of the vvsg revised in response to those comments and ready for approval in october but the large number of comments received at the end of the period has created uncertainty about when the guidelines will be finalized many issues about the vvsg have been raised by voting system manufacturers state and local election officials academic researchers professional and trade associations public interest groups nd members of the public among the questions are the following to what extent are the vvsg truly voluntary rather than regulatory what is the appropriate role of the vvsg and similar standards is the process by which the vvsg are developed the most appropriate for ensuring highquality timely standards for voting systems is the scope of the revisions in this version of the guidelines appropriate what impact will the vvsg have on the 2006 federal election should the scope of the vvsg be expanded to include voter registration systems to what extent should the guid elines accommodate interoperable components of voting systems rather than integrated systems how should certification of co mmercial offtheshelf cots products be managed in the vvsg httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs2 1 the former chair of this board thomas wilk ey became the first executive director of the eac in june 2005should the certification process re sult in ratings of voting system performance or is the current passfail system adequate how should the guidelines treat vote rverified paper udit trails and other verification systems this report begins with discussion of the historical context of the vvsg followed by summary of the guidelines and discussion of each of the issues identified above however th ere are many specific issues such as whether wireless communications should be permitted that are not covered here the report also briefly summarizes re levant legislative proposals in the 109th congress it contains two appendices sectionbysection summary of the guidelines and glossary of abbreviations used in the report historical context of the guidelines the vss were developed in response to c oncerns raised in the 1970s and 1980s about the then largely unregulated votin g technology industry in 1977 an fec advisory panel recommended the development of voluntary standards following an fecrequested study released in 1975 by th national bureau of standards renamed the national institute of st andards and technology nist in 1988 two years later congress enacted legislation directing the fec to perform study on the matter in cooperation with the national bureau of standards the study submitted to congress in 1984 reaffirmed the adviso ry panels recommendation and the fec received federal funding over the ne xt several years to develop the vss however congress did not establish the vss specifically by stat ute see crs report rs21156 federal voting systems standards and gu idelines congressional deliberations by by eric fischer for more detail about congressional deliberations the vss were first released in 1990 they applied to computerbased voting systems namely punchcard marksense optical scan and direct recording electronic dre systems they were deve loped for both hardware and software and included functional and doc umentation requirements performance characteristics and testing procedures standards were develope d for levermachine or hand counted paper ballot systems the fec developed plan to implement the vss through cooperative action by the fec nist set of laboratories th at would be called the independent test authorities itas state and local governme nts and voting system vendors under the plan states would adopt the standards and the itas would test voting systems to determine whether they met the standards nists intended role was to assist in accreditation of the itas however the plan did not materialize as originally conceived instead the national associa tion of state electi on directors nased which was established in 1989 ppointed voting systems board1 to choose itas and administer process for qua lifying voting systems under the vss the testing program began in 1994 nased chose the election center professionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs3 2 the changes in terminology are potential s ource of confusion the requirements for voting systems established by 301 of hava are called voting systems standards they are not the same as and shoul d not be confused with the vss the eac was also to develop voluntary guidance 311 to assist states in implementing the hava requirements 3015 however st atutory role is given to the tgdc or nist with respect to that guidance presumably the eac could have c ontinued referring to the guidelines as the vss but has chosen instead to use the terminol ogy contained in hava possibly to avoid confusion between the guidelines and the requirementsorganization of election officials to serve as the secretariat for voting system qualification states began adopting the vss with some requiring that voting systems be qualified under the standards be fore being used in the state and others adopting elements of the vss into state requirements as implementation proceeded and technology continued to volve calls increased for revising and updating the vss the fec began project to update the st andards in 1997 the second version was approved by the fec in may 2002 the revi sion took broader approach than the original version focusing on the voting dium paperbased versus electronic rather than specific kinds of voting system s it also included or expanded coverage of functions and requi rements not in the original version such as accessibility and some aspects of usability telecommunications and audit trails while this update was underway cong ress was considerin g legislation to respond to the problems that arose in th november 2000 presidential election the enacted version hava the help ameri ca vote act of 2002 pl 107252 was signed into law in october 2002 it includes voting system requirements and an administrative structure for promulgating standards and certifying systems the act established the eac and assigned it responsibility for developing the vvsg it also created three bodies standards boar d board of advisors and technical guidelines development committee tgdc to provide advice on standards and other matters and it gave nist substantial role for example it made the director of nist the chair of the tgdc s ec 222 of hava effectively renamed the vss as the voluntary voting system guidelines vvsg 2 to be developed by the eac pursuant to recommendations by the tgdc and with support from nist thus hava provided statutory basis for the vss hava does not direct the eac to include any specific issues in the guidelines however in the debate on the house floor before passage of the hava c onference agreement on october 10 2002 colloquy congressional record daily ed 148 h7842 sti pulated an interpretation that the guidelines specifically address the usability accuracy security accessibility and integrity of voting systems also s ec 221e requires nist to provide support to the tgdc for development of guidelines relating to security voter privacy human factors remote voting and fraud detection and prevention the current vss will serve as the guidelines until new ones are completed work on development of the first version of the vvsg partial revision of the vss began in 2004 with the appointment of the tgdc that committee transmitted its recommendations in the form of proposed version 1 of the vvsg to the eac on may 12 2005 after reviewing the reco mmended guidelines and making somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs4 3 for example appendix d on dual independent verification systems was part of section 6 in the tgdc draft also recommendations on best practices that were in section text have been moved to appendix c changes were also made in some cases that narrowed or otherwise modified provisions to line up more precisely with hava or other legal requirements or for other reasons see ection assistance commission us election assistance commission excerpt from the pub lic meeting transcript june 30 2005 available at httpwwweacgov063005_meetinghtm for example two of the three principles cited in the subsection on human factors were revised 1 all eligible and potentially eligible voters shall have access to the voting process without discrimination was changed to 1 all eligible voters shall and 2 each cast ballot shall capture the intent of the voter who cast that ballot was ch anged to 2 each cast ballot shall accurately capture the selections made by the voter other changes were made for clarification for example provision 226 if the norma l procedure includes vvpat the accvs accessible voting system should provide featur that enable voters who are blind to perform this verification was augmented with the following if state requires the paper record produced by the vvpat voterverified pa per audit trail to be the official ballot then the accvs

the vvsg released for public comment are virtually identical to those in the 2002 update of the vss that was consequence of stated intent by the eac to create version that could be used in preparation

expanded appendices more extensive revisi on is reportedly underway11 brief summary of provisions in the current draft is provide d below and sectionbysection summary is included at the end of this report in appendix 1 these summaries are intended only to aid in understanding the basic scope and contents of the guidelines from legislative perspective ot her writers might choose to emphasize different aspects the vvsg like the vss are divided into two volumes volume i provides performance guidelines for voting systems nd is intended for broad audience it includes descriptions of f unctional requirement s and performance standards as well as requirements for vendors in quality assurance and in configuration management complex discipline that involves ensuri ng that system and its components function in the ways they are specified to function under various modifications and throughout their life cycles it includes an extensive glossary and references suggested practices for election officials in some areas covered by the guidelines and discussion of verification concepts for future design of voting systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs6 12 see election assistance commission vol untary voting system guidelines view comments october 13 2005 httpguidelineskennesaweduvvsgview_sectionasp 13 section 12d of the national technology transfer advancement act of 1995 15 usc 272 note requires federal agencies to use vo luntary consensus standards except where they would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical office of management and budget circul ar a119 provides guidance for implementing this provision of the 1995 act 14 congress has made some standards mandatory for federal agencies for example the federal information security management act of 2002 pl 107296 requires that federal agencies adhere to set of computersecurity policies standards and practices but these do not apply to voting systems which are under the purview of state and local governmentsvolume ii provides details of the tes ting process for certification of voting systems it is aimed at narrower audi ence of vendors testing laboratories and election officials it includes descrip tion of the data that vendors are required to provide when submitting system for tes ting and basic requirements for testing against the standards described in volu i it also provides guidance and requirements for testing laboratories in planning tests and reporting certification results issues raised by guidelines many of the issues described below as well as number of more specific ones have been captured in the various public comments made on the draft vvsg 12 commenters include election officials vendors academic researchers representatives of professiona l associations and interest groups and members of the public however the discussion is not limited to issues raised in the comments technical guidelines versus regulatory requirements the vvsg like the vss before them are voluntary technical standards not regulatory requirements ch standards are usually veloped through consensus process they are common in industry and federal law encourages their use by federal agencies13 some observers believe that making standards voluntary at the federal level cannot ensure sufficient quality of voting sy stems and that adherence should be mandatory or at least condition of receiving any federal grants for voting equipment14 others state that mandatory standard s would give too large role to the federal government and reduce the flexibility of state and local governments to respond to their specific needs they also point out that mo st states have adopted the vss in whole or in part many require that any new voting systems purchased adhere to the vss or vvsg the practical effect of such state requirements is that voting system vendors can successfully mark et systems only if they are certified under the vss or vvsg in this sense the provisions have acquired some of the force of regulation in that they are treated by manufacturers as requi rements comments by vendors often reflect that perception hava addresses this controve rsy by establishing some specific requirements for voting systems sec 301 but leaving th method of implementation to the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs7 15 those requirements are that voting system s must provide for auditability accessib ility and ballot verification and error correction by vo ters that states must set standards for what constitutes vote on given system and that machine error rates of voting systems must conform to the standards set in the vss this last requirement sec 301a5 is the only direct connection in the act between the requirements and the vvsg it does arguably provide further impetus for vendors to have systems certified under the vvsg and for states to require that they do so in contrast sec 251d specifically exempts states from adherence to the vvsg as condition for receipt of payments to meet hava requirements 16 this distinction may be somewhat artificial focus on performance versus design can also be thought of as end poi nts on continuum or even as different dimensions that may be differentially emphasized 17 ansi is private nonprofit organization th at administers and coordinates the us voluntary privatesector standardization sy stem american national standards institute about ansi nd httpwwwan siorgabout_ansioverviewoverviewaspx 18 of course it is possible for both kinds of critic isms to be valid if for example they refer to different parts of the guidelines sec 305 the act is largely sile nt on the relationship between the vvsg and the sec 301 requirements15 the eac is required to provide guidance for implementing the requirements sec 311312 but the guidan ce is not technical standard and its use is also voluntary what standards can and cannot do there are many different kinds of standards they may be classified according to purpose eg product process testing or interface standards they can also be classified according to their focus commonly distinction is made between performance standards which focus on func tion and design standards which specify features dimensions or other such characteristics16 third classification is based on how standards are develope d and implemented they ma be developed through consensus or some other process they ma be implemented voluntarily or they may also be imposed for example by law nd therefore mandatory standards may also be open or proprietary but different observers define open standard somewhat differently some form of open standards is the approach used typically by major standards organizations such as the american national standards institute ansi17 the vvsg and the vss before them do not fall nea tly into any one of the above categories they combine product proce ss and testing requirements they are intended to be performanceba sed but in some cases they provide fairly specific design details that has been criticized by some observers as not providing sufficient flexibility for innovation but it has been prai sed by others as providing more precise requirements the vvsg have also been criticized on the one hand for being too precise and detailed and on the other for being too vague and ambiguous18 also they are voluntary at the federal level but mandatory in number of states finally the process of development of the vss might best be describe d as having been only partially open with the involvement of nist and the various eac boards and committees the development of the vvsg is arguably more closely akin to typical consensus process for st andards development httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs8 19 for details see crs report rl32139 election reform and elect ronic voting systems dres analysis of security issues by eric fischer 20 in the 1990 version of the vss the security section was under 6 pages in length in the 2002 version it was more than double that and in the vvsg draft it is over 50 pages long 21 the ieee which is involved in broad range of standardsdevelopment projects began developing standard for pollingplace voting equipment in 2001 but did not pr oduce consensus document before the draft vvsg was released see ieee voting equipment standards project 1583 january 5 2005 httpgrouperieeeorggroupsscc38 1583indexhtm however the organization is continuing to develop standards for electronic data interchange for voting systems under project begun in 2002 see ieee voting systems electronic data in terchange project 1622 december 3 2004 continuedproperly designed standards can provide clear baseline of expected performance in conjunction with wellimplemented certification program they can provide assurances to all parties that voting systems will operate according to specifications the vss and the nased certification program are widely credited with having greatly improved the performan ce of voting systems in several areas such as reliability and accuracy however standards can address only those issues that were considered by the developers and the way that the standard s are developed and implemented can also affect the way issues are addressed those factors can lead to at least two kinds of problems first specifications and testin g might not reflect realworld conditions that has been criticism of the vss and especially certification testing which was done in laboratory testing nvironment rather than real istically simulated election conditions thus considerati on of error rates in the 1990 vss was limited to machine error and did not take into account the kind of voter error that became such central issue in the 2000 presidential election second sta ndards may not be able to anticipate changed conditions this is especially true for rapidly evolving inform ation technology for example the security weaknesses found over the past few years in some dres19 were discovered in systems that had been certified under the vss20 those 1990 standards could not anticipate the rapid evolution of information technology nd the kinds of security threats to which it would be subjected the development process for the vvsg hava created relatively complex pro cess for the development of the vvsg proposed guidelines are developed by technical committee chai red by the director of nist those are then considered by two eac boards the standards board consisting of state and local election officials from all the states and the board of advisors consisting of representatives of various groups specified in the act and finally by the eac commissioners after public comment period even without that complexity the devel opment of standards can involve lengthy deliberations that is especially true for consensus standards21 but even the twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs9 21 continued httpgrouperieeeorggroups scc381622indexhtm

httpwwwietforgtaohtmlversions of the vss took years to develop interna tional standards are often updated on three to fiveyear cycle hava does not specify an updating cycle for the vvsg although sec 215a2 requires th standards board and the board of advisors to meet at least once year f or purposes of voting on the voluntary voting system guidelines referred to it and sec 301c requires that guidance for the implementation of requi rements be updated every four year s the first version of the vvsg currently under eac consideration is not anticipated to go into effect until two years after adoption22 that implies an initial revision cycle of at least two years although the tgdc has already begun work on the second version some observers believe that fouryear velopment cycle is desirable to permit systems to be used for two federal electi on cycles without requi ring recertification others have criticized the process for development of the vvsg as being too slow and cumbersome given the rapid development of information technology and associated issues others point out that rapid velopment and frequent revision could create serious financial and logistical difficultie s for both vendors and election officials in trying to conform to the guidelines as well as having potentially negative impact on the quality of any revisions this issue has been raised not only with respect to the release and effective date of the current vvsg draft but also subsequent revisions there appears to be an inhere nt conflict in responsiveness of the guidelines to on the one hand evolving needs and technology and on the other time and cost constraints inherent in responding appropr iately to such changes achieving the right balance between them is likely to be difficult the internet engineering task force ietf professional group involved in the evolution of internet architecture has ddressed the challenge of rapid development and change by creating system for devel oping standards that is performed largely online interested parties form working group that is completely open to anyone interested there is active attempt by the ietf to guarantee balance among different interests the group identifies the scope of standard and begins developing it drafts are posted online and comment s incorporated once the group reaches rough consensus the draft is sent to th internet engineering steering group iesg for independent review after which the dr aft may become standard through some additional steps23 according to some observers the use of such fully open online process rough consensus nd independent review results in cleaner standards and more rapid process than the more trad itional approach whet her the method could be adapted for the vvsg is not clear

has been developed for the purpose of creating performance ratings for voting systems but has not yet led to any public results24 another issue has to do with how other accepted standards are used and incorporated in the vvsg for example the draft guidelines reference many nist standards publications that are generally signed for use by federal agencies under the federal information security management act fisma25 some observers argue that product standards such as the comm on criteria isoiec 15408 which provides set of evaluation criteria for the security of information technology26 would be more appropriate certification process the development of plans for certification testing is also an issue volume ii of the vvsg specifies that testing laboratories are to develop explicit plans for the certification testing some observers believe that those plans like the vvsg itself should be public and that opportunities fo r public comment should be given before they are finalized however since the pl ans are to be designed for each submitted system and based on the data provided by the vendor it is not clear that public disclosure would be possible without re leasing proprietary information similar concerns have been raised with respect to the call from some observers that the results of the certification testing be made publicly available some argue that making such information public would be disincentive to investment and innovation by industry others disagree and state furt her that given the important role that voting systems play in the democratic process the public trust is best served by full disclosure some observers have also raised ques tions about the methods for determining how testing laboratories are chosen under the nased process there has been little to competition among different laboratories critics have expressed concern that the result has been higher costs for certification testing and barriers to the timely certification of systems from smaller innovative manufacturers the nvlap accreditation process being developed under eac auspices is expected to address such concerns by increasing the number of labor atories involved however this approach has also been criticized when testin g authorities compete against each other for business vendor can select the authorities most favorable to its products or negotiate for advantageous testing procedures27 those critics argue that government or nonprofit testing centers woul d be better approach httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs11 28 see for example statements of some vendors at election assi stance commission us election assistance commission public mee ting transcript june 30 2005 available at httpwwweacgov063005_hearinghtm 29 while the tgdc has referred to version i and version ii of the vvsg the latter to be the thorough revision the eac has preferred not to use that terminology ibid 30 sec 2271221 reads the vendor should conduct summative usability tests on the accvs using blind subjects and report the st results to the voting system test lab vvsg vol 1 p 214 this is intended to be an interim recommendation until the testing laboratories have developed usability testin g procedures however other provisions containing recommendations do not appear to be interim such as sec 227134 the acc vs should provide mechanism to enable non manual input that is functionally equivalent to tactile input the scope and features of revisions in the vvsg the vss were criticized for inadequately addressing usability security administrative procedures and practices performance in actual use voter registration systems and other aspects of election ad ministration those criticisms have been partially addressed in the vvsg as described in the s ection above summarizing the guidelines the tgdc decided to pr oduce only partial revision of the vss as the first version of the vvsg except for new sections on human factors usability and accessibility and security and the addition of some new appendices the vvsg is largely unchanged from the 2002 version of the vss the two major areas of revision are arguably the most important for immediate action since usability and accessibility are major focuses of hava voting system requirements and security concerns have been promin ent in recent public debate about voting systems especially dres some observers welcome this restricted focus believing that limited changes are more likely to be implementable in the short term others however believe that broader changes to the vss are more urgently needed and that the draft vvsg should have been more t horoughly revised with more stringent requirements some believe that an endtoend or life cycle approach is needed and that standards or guide lines should be developed for technology procedures and personnel across all entitie s involved in election administration ranging from developers and ma nufacturers of voting systems to pollworkers it is not yet clear to what extent future versions of the vvsg may take such an approach still other observers have expressed concer ns that the first version of the vvsg has created more new requirements for certification than is prudent for an interim document which is intended to be followed by more complete revision28 those observers propose delaying adoption of the vvsg until it can be thoroughly revised29 yet others believe that th added provisions are inade quate to meet accessibility alternative language and security need s and that broader and more stringent requirements are needed for example so of the provisions in the sections on human factors and security have been criticized for being recommendations rather than requirements the concern being that they do not therefore ensure full compliance with havas accessibility requirements30 there is also concern among some that the vvsg do not adequately cover the full ra nge of disabilities as required by hava disabilities that are specifically addressed relate to visi on dexterity mob ility hearinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs12 31 vvsg vol 1 p 212 32 see for example maryland department of

detail is provided for the last two there are several different ways to categorize disabilities and the vvsg provide neither source for the list used nor any indication of how exhaustive it is intended to be the guidelines also state as practical matter there may be small number of voters whose disabilities are so severe that they will need personal assistance31 the revised security provisions have also raised questions among some observers for example some statespons ored studies used penetration testing deliberate attempts to break into voting sy stems in attempting to address security issues associated with voting systems32 this is fairly common technique in security testing and some observers be lieve that it should be require d by the guidelines other observers have expressed c oncern that some of the different requirements may be conflicting that meeting one will require violating another some have also pointed to concer ns about specific elements of the vss that were not examined by the tgdc one particular ly contentious provision is the requirement that failures occur more often than every 163 hours of use33 some observers argue that this is far too low permitting 10 of precinctbased electronic systems to fail during an election34 others argue that the more relevant standard is availability which stipulates that the time it takes to re pair system must be short enough that it is available 99 of the time it is needed however availability is tested under laboratory conditions and in practice may depend on factor s such as whether someone is present at the polling place who can effect any needed repairs therefore system that achieves an availability score greater than 99 in testing might not achieve that level in actual use whether the vvsg should include management guidelines for election administrators is also matter of some disp ute in the current draft best practice recommendations have been placed in an appendix whereas they were in the numbered sections in the tgdc recomme ndation document their removal to an appendix eliminates any ambiguity with respect to their role or lack of it in the certification process however the velopment of set of administration or management sections in future versions of the vvsg could raise the question of whether certification protocol s should be developed for ection administration that possibility may be worthy of considera tion but it could require an additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs13 35 for discussion of practice standards and certif ication in the context of

improve security and reliability of electronic voting systems are under way but key activities need to be completed gao05956 september 2005 37 the large volume of comments has resulted in delay in finalizing the vvsg and date for adoption has been set 38 sec 81 of the vvsg states the effective date provisions do not apply to the mandatory provisions of section 301a of the help america vote act hava which states must comply with on or before january 1 2006 while the guidelines set requirements and measures against which voting systems can be examined they may represent higher standard than what is re quired by section 301a of hava to make sure states are able to be in compliance by th january 1 2006 deadline eac will issue guidance to interpret section 301a such guidance was not publicly available as of late october 2005 it is not clear whether meaningful guid ance would be possible if issued in the remaining two months of the yearcertification mechanism for election jurisdic tions as well as vendors depending on the focus of the manage ment requirements35 the vvsg and the 2006 federal election even with the limitations in scope of initial change to the vss there is some question what impact the vvsg can have on the 2006 election36 the eac has indicated desire to finalize the guidelines soon after the close of the comment period at the end of september 2005 but it s received more than 4000 individual comments altogether37 in addition the vvsg are not scheduled to go into effect until two years after adoption that is s ooner than fall 2007 til that time federal certification of voting systems will presum ably continue to be based on the 2002 vss although state or local jurisdictions may choose to requi re vendors to meet some or all of the vvsg requirements sooner and the eac pl ans to issue guidelines to assist states in implementation38 that may be especially im portant for those jurisdictions that require voterverifiabl paper audit trail for use with dres since that option is not covered by the vss but is covered by the vvsg some observers have expressed c oncern that uncertainties about the vvsg development and impleme ntation have resulted in delays by states in procuring new voting systems to meet hava requirements among the reasons are worries about acquiring new systems in time for the january 2006 deadline that might later be deemed not to be in compliance with the re quirements or not obtaining systems of as high level of quality as would be possible once the vvsg go into effect similarly some observers are concerned that syst ems in use that were certified under the vss but not the vvsg could be effectively decertif ied once certification under the vvsg begins those concerns are amplified by uncertainties with resp ect to federal funding for future acquisitions one proposed soluti on is for the eac to advise jurisdictions that systems conforming to the 2002 vss will satisfy hava requirements however that version of the vss was released before hava wa s enacted and since the eac has regulatory authority it is not clear wh at effect such advice would have otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs14 39 ieee project 1622

public meeting transcript june 30 2005 available at httpwwweacgov063005_hearinghtm adler used the example of an independent dual verification idv system to illustrate the problemobservers believe that delayi ng the implementation of the vvsg means that the 2006 federal election will need to be conducted with voting sy stems that are not designed to conform to hava requirement s another concern raised by some is that the proposed fall 2007 implementati on date may not leave sufficient time for vendors and states to develop and acqui re conforming systems befo re the 2008 federal election the vvsg and voter registration systems the focus of the vss has been limited to pollingplace and centraloffice systems involved in the conduct of an election from ballot preparation to election certification neither the vss nor the first version of the vvsg address the technology used to create and manage voter registra tion lists sec 22132a of hava requires nist to provide technical support for deve lopment of guidelines relating to the computerized statewide voter registration lists mandate d by section 303a of hava that arguably implies congressional intent that the vvsg cover that topic but hava does not explicitly require that the data interchange standards being developed by ieee include voter registration data39 however there are currently formal or widely accepted standards for those lists nd that absence has raised concerns about adequate state implementati on of the requirement by the january 2006 deadline integrated versus component certification the vvsg focus on voting systems rather than on individual components while they permit the submission of interoperable components fo r certification they require that vendors shall submit for testing the specific system configuration that will be offered to jurisdictions or that comprises th component to be mark eted plus the other components with which the vendor reco mmends that the component be used40 this implies in essence that vendor wishing to submit component that could be used with different voting systems would have to submit those systems along with the component for certification testing some obs ervers argue that this restriction stifles innovation by requiring that those vendors w ho wish to market devices that can be used with existing voting systems negotiate agreements with votingsystem vendors before certification of their components however such agreements may be difficult to obtain before component is certified or may entail restriction on the use of the component to only one brand of voting system41 one proposal to address this concern is to allow certification of components separately but require that they subsequently be certified with each voting system with which they would be used httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs15 42 see voting system performance rating charter 15 december 2004 available at httpwwwvsprorgvsprcharterpdf and p l vora and others

f c t s s f t w r t h t i s proprietary that is the code is not public ly available the use of cots software is somewhat controversial it is much less expensive in general to use such software when appropriate than to velop code specifically for the voting system in addition some commercial software such as micr osoft windows has b ecome standard with computer hardware develope d specifically to work with it however vendors have control over how the cots software is coded and the code ma be very complex code examination is not required under the vvsg for unmodified cots software and generalpurpose software such as opera ting systems may be exempt from detailed examination some observers object to this exemption arguing that it creates unacceptable security risks others believe that the guidelines should prohibit the use of cots software altogether although presum ably they are referring to its use in voting or counting machine not in backoffi ce computers used in such tasks as ballot preparation propone nts counter that vvsg safeguards are adequate and that the use of cots software permits superior applications at far lower cost than custom software would allow grading versus passfail certification under the vvsg testing scheme voting systems pass or fail but additional information is provided to potential cu stomers or the public about details of performance of certified systems such as to what extent the tested system exceeded the standards some observe rs believe that certification regime that provided more finely graded performance reports would be very useful in stimulating innovation and helping election officials decide which syst ems are best suited to their jurisdictions however to the extent such grading was subjective it could be misleading or potentially subject to abuse in 2004 gr oup of computer experts vendors election officials social scientists and advocates started the voting system performance rating vspr project which aims at deve loping performance rating standards for us voting systems42 but there has been public indication from the group about when such standards might be expected verification system s including vvpat one thing added to the vvsg was discussion of met hods by which votes could be verified for one such method the vote rverified paper audit trail or vvpat the vvsg provides standards since such systems have been mandated by several states however several other kinds of such syst ems exist and some are described in an appendix to the guidelines43 with some guidance for how they might be implemented

such systems has become matter of public interest because of the controversy over the security of dres while most public ttention has been paid to vvpat other methods arguably show more promise in terms of usab ility accessibility and verification power44 some observers believe that idv system s especially vvpat are essential to ensure security of and confidence in ectronic voting whereas others believe that the costs and complexity of at least some idv systems are disadvantages that outweigh any benefits the guidelines do not require such system although such requirement was considered by the tgdc45 some observers believe that the vvsg should require vvpat but others believe that the verification provided by that method is of questionable va lue in practice and may create unforeseen problems of its own some also believe that the accessi bility and alternativ language provisions relating to vvpat do not ensure full compliance with hava and other federal requirements still others believe that the vvsg should provide more stringent requirements with respect to what kinds of data should be recorded by voting systems for audit purposes in any case the trend at the state level toward requiring the use of vvpat to address security issues is rais ing significant questions about whether such requirements can be rec onciled with hava accessibility requirements under the constraints imposed by current technology legislative proposals in the 109th congress several bills introduced in the 109th congress could affect the scope or other aspects of the vvsg they

process ranging from ballot definition through system audit46 it characterizes voting systems as either paperbased such as punchcard and optical scan systems or direct recording electronic dre which are the two kinds of computerassisted system currently in use and distinguishe s precinct and centralcount systems but it recognizes that the distinctions may blur with future technology this section

involves both technical and administrative controls and is discussed in detail in section 6 accuracy this involves both accurate r ecording and error detection and specifies that dres must re tain redundant records of all votes cast error recovery systems must be able to recover from malfunctions and resume operating w ith data intact integrity systems must be protected against outside perturbations such as loss of power or attempts at improper data inputs and must record and maintain specific audit data system audit generation of audit records is to be largely automated including continuous realtime da ta on machine status along with accurate time and date inform ation and error messages where appropriate cots ope rating systems must have specific protections against vulnerabilities that could affect audit data election management system this involves da tabases that assist officials in performing wide range of functions from defining political subdi visions through the processing of election audit reports human factors this subsection has been greatly expanded and revised the standards in it ar based on three principles nondiscriminatory access to voting accurate capture of ballot selections and preserva tion of ballot secrecy it contains more than 50 specific provisions describing required and recommended features responding to disab ilities relating to visi on dexterity mobility hearing speech and cognition as well as limited eng lish proficiency and alternative language accessibility it also contains interim47 provisions relating to usability for all voters based on both hava requirements and established usability principles vote tabulating program systems must have software for tabulating votes that is flexible accurate and includes monitoring and audit functions ballot counter systems must have accurate tamperproof ballot counters that are visibl to election officials telecommunications systems that use telecommunications must

preparation installation and control of ballots and electi on programs testing for readinesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs20 48 this is machine accuracy not voter accuracy the standard is one or fewer errors per 10 million events although the maximum error rate permitted in tests is 1 in 500000 rate 20 times higher than the nominal standard but s till far smaller than the margin of victory in almost any election and the maximum falserej ection rate for paper ballots is 2 although presumably such ballots could be handcount ed if necessary in an actual election 49 vvsg vol 1 p 321 50 the vvsg vol 1 p 322 describe typical scenario as 45 hours 30 hours of set up and testing and 15 hours of operation during the election so this standard could arguably be interpreted to permit failure onc

time plus the average time it takes to repair the systemand verification of functions both centrally and at the polling place voting functions this involves ensuring that only properly tested activated and functioning devices are used in voting and that systems facilitate accurate and secr et casting of ballots and respond appropriately to power or telecommunications interruptions postvoting functions systems must accumulate and report both results of the election and audit trails and prevent additional voting after the polls are closed maintenance transportation and storage

independent ballot records that voters can verify before casting and that can be compared in post election audit examples include splitprocess architecture where the vote is captured on paper or another medium and th taken to verification station where separate voterverified reco rd is made and stored endtoend systems which permit voters to verify ballot choices even after casting without compromising ballot secrecy voters are typically given receipt with code number that they can check later such as on website the use of cryptographic techniques prevents voters from using the receipt to prove how they voted while ensuring accurate verification with very high degree of probability witness systems which independently record voters choices through means such as camera that takes picture of the choices displayed on dre screen and direct systems such as vvpat which pr oduce second record that the voter may directly verify before casting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33146crs24 63

documentation there are fi ve different categories of testing functionality hardwa re software system inte gration and documentation of practices for quality assurance and configuration management testing is to be performed according to test plan and in designated sequence from initial examination through delivery of the test report to the eac that follows specified practices vendors are required to submit for testing the specific system configuration that will be offered to election jurisdictions and testing is required for both new systems and previously certified ones that have been modified some hardware is exempt from some aspects of testing including certain kinds of commercial equipment that meet established standards and other criteria of compatibility and function if more than one laboratory is involved in tes ting one must be designated as the lead laboratory testing activities must be observed by one or more independent qualified obser vers test lab must witness
