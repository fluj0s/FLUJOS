summary in october 2008 the environmental protection agency epa issued regulation to revise 2003 clean water ac t rule governing waste discharges from large confined animal feeding operations cafos this action was necessitated by 2005 federal court decision waterkeeper alliance et v epa 399 f3d 486 2nd cir 2005 resulting from challenges broug ht by agriculture industry gr oups and environmental advocacy groups that vacat ed parts of the 2003 rule and remanded other parts the clean water act prohibits the discharge of pollutants from any point source to waters of the united states unle ss authorized under permit that is issued by epa or qualified state and the act expressly defines cafos as point sources permits limiting the type and quantity of pollutants that can be discharged are derived from effluent limitation guidelines promul gated by epa the 2003 rule updating rules that had been in place since the 1970s revised the way in which discharges of manure wastewater and other process wastes from cafos are regulated and it modified both the permitting requirements and applicable effluent limitation guidelines it contained important firsttime requirements all cafos must apply for discharge permit and all cafos that apply such waste on land must develop and implement nutrien t management plan epas october 2008 regulation addresses those parts of the 2003 rule that were affected by the federal courts ruling 1 it eliminates the duty to apply requirement that all cafos must either apply for discharge permits or demonstrate that they have potential to discharge wh ich was challenged by industry plaintiffs 2 it adds procedures regarding review of and public access to nutrient management plans challenged by environmental groups and 3 it modifies as pects of the effluent limitation guidelines also challenged by nvironmental groups the final rule also modifies provision of the 2003 rule that the court upheld clar ifying the treatment of regulatory exemption for agricultural stormwater discharges epas efforts to revise the 2003 rule have been controversial with particular focus on the duty to apply for permit and agricultural stormwater exemption provisions industry groups were generally supportive approving deletion of the previous duty to apply provision and also of efforts to provide flexibility regarding nutrient management plan modifications environmental groups strongly criticized epas actions arguing that the waterkeeper alliance court left in place several means for the agency to accomplish much of its original pe rmitting approach but instead epa chose not to do so state permitting authorities also had number of criticisms focusing on key parts that they argue will greatly increase the administrative and

waste from animal feedlots the portion of the livestock industry that involves large intensive animal raising and feeding ope rations to surface water groundwater soil and air is associated with range of human health and ecological impacts and contributes to degradation of the nations surface waters the most dramatic ecological impacts are massive fish kills which have occurred in number of locations in the united states variety of pollutants in animal waste can affect human health in several ways such as causing infections to the skin eye ear nose and throat contaminants from manure can so pollute drinking water sources data collected for the epas 2000 national wa ter quality inventory report identify agriculture as the leading known contributor to water quality impairments in rivers and lakes animal feeding ope rations are only subset of the agriculture sector but 29 states specifically identified animal feeding operations as contributing to water quality impairment1 federal efforts to control th sources of water pollution have accelerated in recent years but they have been highly controversial the primary pollutants associated with animal wastes are nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus organic matter solids pathogens and odorousvolatile compounds animal waste also contains sa lts and trace elements and to lesser extent antibiotics pesticides and hormones pollutants in animal waste can impact waters through several po ssible pathways including surface runoff and erosion direct discharges to surface waters spills and other dryweather discharges leaching into soil and groundwater and releases to air including subs equent deposition back to land and surface waters pollutants associated with animal waste can also originate from variety of other sources such as cropland municipal and industrial discharges and urban runoff although agricultural activities are gene rally not subject to requirements of environmental law discharges of waste from large concentrated animal feeding operations cafos into the nations waters are regulated under the clean water act cwa in the late 1990s epa in itiated review of the cwa rules that govern these

these regulatory activitie s and proposals have been very controversial agricultu re industry groups have opposed permitting requirements that they consider burdens ome and costly while others such as environmental groups have favored more stringent national standards that require improved control technology during this period congress showed some interest in cafo issues through oversight hearings

revise d the way in which discharges of manure wastewater and other process wastes from cafos are regulated and it modified both the npdes permitting requi rements and applicable gs under the 2003 rule all cafos are required to apply for an npdes permit epa estimated that this requirement expanded the number of cove red operations from about 12800 under the pre2003 rules to 15500 primarily the larg est cafos in terms of numbers of animals raised or housed onsite or bout 19 of all animal feeding operations of all size in the united states at that time epa acknowledged that prior to the 2003

animal confinement area manure storage area raw material storage area and waste containment ar ea and for the first time to the land application area referring to land to which manure litter or

industry petitioners were consolidated by the second circuit court of appeals which issued decision on february 28 2005 waterkeeper alliance et v epa 399 f3d 486 2nd cir 2005 the ruling reflected partial victory for all of the parties becau the court upheld or did not address significant parts of the re gulation such as the definition of what is cafo for regulatory purposes it uphe ld epas authority to regulate through permits the discharge of manure litter or process wastewater that cafo applies to land application area it also uphe ld epas interpretation that precipitation related discharges of manur litter or process wastewater from land application areas that are applied in accordance with nutrient management plan qualify as agricultural stormwater and thus do not require permits the court agreed with some of the cla ims raised by both sets of petitioners it vacated parts of the regulati on and remanded other parts to epa for clarification in response to the ruling epa proposed revisions to the 2003 rule in june 20066 the parts of the rule affected by the court s ruling and epas response are described in the remainder of this report epa offici als indicated in the

flexibility regarding nutrient management plan modifications especia lly to limit review and public participation requirements to only those changes that ar substantial environmental groups on the other hand strongly criticized the proposal arguing that the waterkeeper alliance court left in place several means for the agency to accomplish much of its original permitting approach but instead epa chose not to do so state environmental and resource agencies the primary implementers of cwa permitting also had number of criticisms they focused on key parts that they argue will greatly increase the administrative and resource burden on states final revised regulation was issued by epa on october 3111 the final rule substantially adopts the 2006 proposal nd the 2008 supplementary

cafoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs6 12 epa estimated that the cafo industry had grown by about 22 from 2002 to 2008 due to industry expansion and the trend toward larger more concentrated

activity that originally led congress to single out cafo s as point sources see 68 federal register 7198operating in 200812 the agency estimates that 9000 cafos currently are covered by existing permits the remainder of this repor t discusses key portions of the regulation that were affected by the courts ruling but begins with the agricultural stormwater issue which the court did not reject or remand followi ng that is discussion of issues that epa addressed as result of the litigation 1 the duty to apply requirement that all cafos either apply for npdes permits or demonstrate that they have potential to discharge which was challenged by i ndustry plaintiffs 2 procedures regarding review of and public access to nutrient management plans challenged by environmental groups and 3 aspects of the effluent limitation guidelines also challenged by environmental groups agricultural stor mwater discharges one issue that the federal court upheld in 2005 concerns the rules treatment of regulatory exemption for agricultural stormwater discharges this issue which was one of the most controvers ial during development of the 2003 rule arose in the context of the regulatory framework concerning the land application of manure litter and process wastewater as noted above the cwa expressly defines the term point source to include concentrated animal feeding operations the same provision of the act section 50214 also expr essly defines point source to exclude agricultural stormwater the court characterized th is provision as selfevidently ambiguous and observed the act makes absolutely attempt to reconcile the two13 when manure and other waste are pplied to land precipitationre lated runoff can transport nutrients pathogens and other pollutants in the waste to nearby receiving waters to develop the 2003 rule epa had to inte rpret the statutory inclusion of cafos as point sources and the agricultural stormwat er exclusion consistently and to identify the conditions under which discharges from the land application area of cafo are point source discharges that are subject to npdes permitting requirements and those which are agricultural stormwater disc harges and thus are not point source discharges14 the land application portion of the rule details requirements to ensure that animal waste is applied to land in accordance with nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in the waste under the rule as promulgated epa dete rmined that when manure or process wastewater is applied in accordance with those practices at appropriate agronomic rates it is beneficial agricultural produc tion input where such practices have been used any remaining precipitationrelated discharge is agricultural stormwater which is exempt from permitting in contrast where appropriate manure managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs7 15 waterkeeper at 509practices have not been used epa argued that it is reasonable to conclude that discharges of manure from land appli cation area have not been applied at agronomic rates are not agricultural stormwater and thus are subject to npdes permitting under the rule adherence to appropriate nutrient management practices eliminates any need to seek permit coverage for land application discharges or submit land application nmp to the permitting authority both groups of petitioners challenged th is portion of the rule livestock and poultry industry plaintiffs had argued that land application runoff should be considered point source discharge subject to permitting only if it is collected or channelized prior to discharge in contrast the environmental petitioners argued that the acts definition of point source requires regulation of all cafo discharges notwithstanding the statutory exemption for agricultural stormwater discharges the court found that epas interpre tation of the act in this regard was reasonable the court interpreted the rule as seeking to remove liability for agriculturerelated discharges primarily caused by nature while maintaining liability for other discharges where cafo has taken steps to ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in manure litte r and process wastewater it should not be held accountable for any discharge that is primarily the result of precipitation15 it rejected the challenges by the partie s and it upheld this portion of the rule although the court did not direct epa to revise this provision the agency stated in the preamble to the 2006 proposal that it was considering adding provision that would apply to runoff from cafo fields that are otherwise unpermitted because they do not discharge or propose to discharge and thus are considered to be agricultural stormwater under this addition in order to qualify as agricultural stormwater discharges and thus receive permit exemption unpermitted large cafos would still be required to comply with nutrient management technical standards for land application fieldspecific standards for exam ple that have been established by the permitting authority the state or epa in addition to the practices specified in the epa rule public comments industry groups endorsed epas proposal regarding agricultural stormwater which assumes th at where land appli cation is conducted in accordance with the rules nutrient manage ment standards stormwater runoff is exempt from npdes permitting however these groups strongly objected to epas suggestion in the preamble to the 2006 proposal that it was also considering requiring cafos to comply with additional technical standards established by permitting authority because they maintained that such change would unlawfully narrow the exemption environmentalists on the other hand argu ed that this portion of the proposal would unlawfully allow cafos to selfregula as it fails to require them to get permits in order to claim the exemption states expressed similar view contending that neither state nor epa can take enforcement action against an unpermitted cafo to comply with technical or other standards one state observed that epas proposal represents circular arrangement that would be quite difficult to enforcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs8 16 illinois environmental protection agency comments on the revised cafo regulation august 29 2006 p 4 17 71 federal register at 37748and administer and that courts would be skeptical of enfor cement cases against facilities that are exempt from regulation16 final revised regulation the final rule include s provision described in the preamble to the 2006 proposal the regulation states that in order for unpermitted large cafos to have their pr ecipitationrelated di scharges qualify as agricultural stormwater discharges they must apply manure litter or process wastewater to land according to sitespecific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in the waste full nutrient management plan is not required while this is new provision in the rule epa stated that it is not new requirement rather it clarifies epas existing interpretation of the agricultural stormw ater exemption in cwa section 50214 duty to apply for permit the 2003 rule explicitly required all cafo s to apply for an npdes permit or to demonstrate to the permitting authority that they have potential to discharge epas policy rationale for this dut to apply provision was based on its presumption that most cafos have potential to discharge pollutants into waters of the united states17 however farm industry plain tiffs argued that unless there is discharge of pollutant cafos and other point sources ar neither statutorily obligated to comply with epa regulations nor are they obligated to seek or obtain an npdes permit the waterkeeper alliance court ruled in support of these plaintiffs and held that epa exceeded its authority under the cwa in ordering all cafos to apply for permit finding that the law requires permits only where there is an actual discharge not just potential to discharge epa proposed to replace the broad duty to apply requirement of the 2003 rule with requirement that all cafos that discharge or propose to discharge must seek coverage under an npdes permit similar requirement for all point sources already exists under other part s of epa regulations that were not affected by the waterkeeper alliance decision 40 cfr 12221a1 the proposal deleted the 2003 rules provision allowing cafos to monstrate that they have potential to discharge saying that such designati on would be irrelevant because the proposal requires only those cafos that discharge or propose to discharge to seek coverage under permit epa estimated that the chan ge in the duty to apply provision ie eliminating the permit requirement for cafos that have the potential to discharge as opposed to those that actually discharge or propose to discharge means that 25 fewer cafos would ultimately seek permits and that cafo operators will experience 155 milli on per year reduction or 26 in administrative burden compared with the 2003 rule epas march 2008 s upplementary proposal included provision that would allow cafos to voluntarily certify that th facility does not discharge or propose to discharge this provision would allow cafo to certify to the permitting authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs9 18 natural resources defense council sierra club waterkeeper alliance comments on the revised cafo regulation august 29 2006 p 9 19 ohio department of agriculture ohio environmental protection agency ohio department of natural resources comment s on the revised cafo regulation undated p 6through an objective assessment that th operation does not discharge or propose to discharge and therefore does not need to obtain an npdes permit to be eligible for this certification the facility would be re quired to evaluate that its production area will not discharge and to develop and implement an nmp similar to that for permitted facilities the certification process would be voluntary but it would offer protection to farmer because in the event that discharge from certified cafo occurs the farmer would be not liable for having failed to apply for permit the operator would still be subject to liability for the discharge itself however and the certification would cease to be valid public comments both state permitting authorities and environmental groups opposed deletion of the original requi rement that all cafos must apply for an npdes permit they said that in doing so epa would change the entire permitting program from one that is proactive to one that is reactive because it would allow cafo operators to decide whether their situation poses enough risk of getting caught having discharge to warrant the investment of time and resources in obtaining permit18 although epa estimated that 25 fewer cafos will seek permit coverage states argued that this overestimated the number that will voluntarily get permits because under epa s proposed revisions there is virtually incentive to seek permit further states contended that any cost savings that cafos will experience will be shifted to permitting authorities which will be placed in more adversarial position of first proving that facility has discharge and then taking an enforcement action as one state observed the number of cafos permitted or not is the same and epa expect s states to inspect those that dont apply for permit coverage as well as process permits for those that do19 overall states argued that the administrative burden on stat of epas proposal to delete the duty to apply requirement will be greater than under the 2003 rule not less as epa concluded states and environmental groups also objected to allowing industry to voluntarily selfcertify compliance saying that it would undermine the environmental protection provisions of the rule industr groups also were critical saying that requiring most feedlots to seek permits or face retroactive pe nalties if an unpermitted discharge occurs would amount to form of the duty to apply concept that was rejected by the waterkeeper court agriculture industry commenters had other concerns about this aspect of epas proposal they had challenged the duty to apply provision of the 2003 rule and the court upheld their argument that the cwa only requires fac ilities that actually discharge to seek permit coverage indus try groups fundamentally disagree with any presumption that cafos do discharge po llutants contrary to epas position inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs10 20 national pork producers council united egg producers american farm bureau federation

71797181support of the 2003 rule or nvironmentalists contentions20 thus they objected to epas attempts to get cafos to voluntarily seek permits and the specific addition of permit requirement for those that propose to discharge according to this view epa may not lawfully establish permitting requirements based on speculation as to possible future cafo discharges any duty to apply triggered by accidental discharges could arise if at all only after an actual discharge has occurred and should be limited to f acilities that accidentally discha rge and fail after reasonable time to identify the cause and take appropriate corrective measures21 one of epas rationales for promulgating the 2003 rule was recognition that large numbers of unpermitted cafos were discharging wa stes that contribute to water quality impairments22 critics of industrys position on th is issue contended that allowing cafos to selfregulate selfreport accidental releases and then possibly seek permit coverage will likely perpetua those same conditions final revised regulation the final rule adopts the approach proposed in 2006 replacing the duty to apply require ment in the 2003 rule with requirement that cafo must seek permit coverage when it actually discharges or proposes to discharge ie based on an objective asse ssment that it is designed constructed operated or maintained such that discharge will occur not simply that it might occur epa recognizes that some cafos that do not discharge or propose to discharge will not seek permit coverage but in the event of discharge from an unpermitted cafo the operator would be in violation of the cwa because any discharge from cafo even one that is unplanned or accide ntal is illegal unless it is authorized by the terms of permit or is agricultural stormwater some cafo operators were concerned that an accidental discharge from an unpermitted facility would subject the cafo to liability for the discharge and for failure to apply for permit thus the final rule includes the option proposed in 2008 to allow cafo to certify to the permitting authority that it is designed constructed operated and maintained not to discharge certifying cafo will be required to implement nutrient management plan that at minimum meets the nmp requirements applicable to permitted cafos cafos discharge certifica tion is not subject to review by the permitting authority in order for it to beco effective and the permitting authority is not required to make the certification available to the public for comment because the certification is not permit application for which review is required in the event of discharge from certifying cafo other than agricultural stormwater the facility would be liable for an unpermitted discharge but not for failure to apply for permithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs11 23 the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551559 contains provisions that govern federal agency rulemaking proceedingsnutrient management plans the 2003 rule mandated that npdes per mits for all cafos that land apply animal waste include new requirement that the permittee develop and implement nutrient management plan that includes minimum elements specified in the rule such as ensuring adequate storage of manure litter and process wastewater and preventing direct contact of confined an imals with waters of the united states cafos were to develop and implement an nmp by the same date that the rule required them to comply with the rules land application provisions generally december 31 2006 under the original rule since the waterkeeper alliance decision epa twice extended the deadline now sc heduled for february 27 2009 the 2003 rule provided that nmps would be retained onsite at the cafo it must be available to epa or the permitting authority but it is not considered part of the facilitys permit the environmental plaintiffs argued to the federal court that the nmp part of the 2003 rule was unlawful under the clean wate r act and the administrative procedure act23 because it failed to require that the terms of the nmp must be reviewed and be included in the npdes permit inclusion in the permit would make the nmp enforceable by the government and pr ivate citizens and because it allowed permitting authorities to issue permits in th absence of any meaningful government or public review of this aspect of the permit they also argued that the permitting aspects of the rule violate the clean water acts public participation requirements by effectively shielding the plans from public scrutiny and comment the court agreed with the environmental plaintiffs on these points and vacated these portions of the rule in response epa proposed in 2006 to require that cafos seeking permit coverage submit an nmp as part of the permit application and that the permitting authority make the plan available for review prior to developing the facilitys permit the permitting authority would be res ponsible for reviewing the nmp for completeness and sufficiency the terms of the nmp such as the minimum elements described above would become terms and conditions of the permit as required by the court in its pr oposal epa distinguished between nmp terms which must be incorporated as enforceable c onditions of the permit following the public review process and the plan as whole which must be submitted to the permitting authority for review the nmp as whol epa said will include underlying data calculations and other information such as technical standards th at provide basis for the facilityspecific requirements epa rules generally allow permitting authorities to issue two types of permits either individual facilityspecific permits or general permits to cover multiple facilities without the need to receive indi vidual permit applica tions from facilities in advance of developing the permit in the 2003 rule epa indicat ed that it expected that most permitting authorities would utilize general permits as way of minimizing regulatory burden the waterkeeper alliance ruling required epa tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs12 expressly address public par ticipation in review of nmps since they must be included in permit in the case of individual permits existing npdes rules already establish procedures for pub lic participation thus b ecause the nmp would be part of the individual permit app lication it would be subject to existing rules requiring public participation and ru changes were needed epas 2006 res ponse to the waterkeeper alliance ruling contained new provisions for public participation in review of nmps for those facilities intending to be covered by general permit because there is provision in existing rules that explicitly addresses incorporation of sitespecific nmp requirements into general permit the proposal included mechanisms so that general permits for cafos can be modified once issued to include the terms of an nmp applicable to specific cafo and to provide an opportunity for pub lic review of cafos notice of intent including the entire nmp to be covered by general permit before the cafo actually receives coverage under the general permit under the proposal the permitting authority state or epa would ve discretion as to how best to provide public notification and comment in the context of general permits in the march 2008 supplementary propos epa presented alternatives to enable permitted cafos some flexibility in developing their nmps with respect to specifying the rates of application of nutrients in manure litter or process wastewater to land circumstances at farm change during the period of permit ordinarily five years and agricultural ope rations often modify thei r nutrient management and farming practices during the normal cour of their operations for example planting different crops that have different needs for nitrogen and phosphorus the alternatives were intended to allow cafos to make crop rotation and similar changes without requiring formal m odification of their nmps such flexibility would reduce the burden on permitting authorities and cafo operators by decreasing the number of significant changes to permits whic h require public notice and comment the alternatives would allow cafo operators to make routine changes at facility that affect the rate of nutrient application to land without changing the nmp itself epa proposed three alternatives with increa sing amounts of flexibility for the cafo operator each approach would require annual reporting requi rements to provide actual data that would be publicly ava ilable concerning compliance with permit requirements during the previous year public comments many comments on the 2006 proposal focused on the complexity of nutrient management pla nning and the administrative and resource burdens that nmps would put on cafo operators and state permitting agencies recognizing the problem of burdens im posed on permitting authorities epas proposal incorporated flexibility in various ways such as allowing states the discretion to decide how to provide for public notice other comments were critical that epa was proposing too much flexibility and discretion for permitting authorities and would not ensure adequate public participa tion and review industry commenters sought clarification in the rule of criteria that constitute the terms of the nmp since nmp terms become enforceable conditions of the permit which epa addressed in the 2008 supplem entary proposal however other commenters asserted that the entire nm p should be included in or expresslyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs13 24 the 2008 supplementary proposal included third option which many commenters had said would be too complicated epa agreed and did not include it in the final rulereferenced by the permit so as to ensure that the permit requires the cafo to comply with every discharge reduction or prevention measure in its nmp final revised regulation the final rule adopts the approach that epa proposed the revisions do not change the required contents of the nmp but they add requirement for cafos to submit their nmp as part of their permit application or notice of intent to be covered by general permit and add public participation requirements to ensure opportunity for pub lic review the rule establishes new procedures for permitting authority and pub lic review of nmps for cafo general permits to respond to the waterkeeper decision the final rule specifies minimum terms of the nmp that must be enforceab requirements of cafos permit but epa did not agree with those commenters who argued that all of the information in the nmp constitutes enforceable terms the court focused on rates of applications as perhaps the most important term of the nmp and it was an issue of concer n to many commenters thus the 2006 and especially the 2008 supplementary proposal addr essed this issue in detail the final rule modifies the 2008 supplem entary proposal to include two options for identifying the terms of the nmp with respect to rates of application of nutrients24 each approach provides means for cafo to articulate in its nmp annual maximum rates of application of animal waste by field and crop and identify the minimum required terms of the nmp specific to th at approach one approach would be suitable for operations with predictable crops and land appli cation epa said while the other likely would benefit cafos that may need to adjust their rates of application because of changes in soil vels of nitrogen and phosphorus due for example to changes in crop rotations aspects of the effluent limitation guidelines for cafos specific effluent limitations contained in individual npdes permits are dictated by the terms of more general effluent limitations guidelines promulgated by epa that typically specify the maximum allowable levels of pollutants that may be discharged by facilities within an indus trial category or subcategor using specific technologies while the limits are based on the performan ce of specific technologies they do not generally require the industry to use these technologies but rather allow the industry to use any effective alternatives to meet the pollutant limits as noted above in the 2003 rule epa established nonnumerical ffluent limitation guidelines for the production areas of cafos and did so for four subcategories of the cafo industry the environmental petitioners challenged several aspects of the elgs and the waterkeeper alliance court upheld parts of their cl aims in this portion of the decision the court remanded the rule to ep with instruction to present additional analysis and justification so as to clarify its decisionmaking rationale new source standards for swine poultry and veal operations the cwa requires epa to promulgate new source performance standards nsps for new as opposed to already existing sources of pollution based on what ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs14 25 this is statistical event defined as the amount of rainfall that has 1 chance of being exceeded in 24hour period in any given year or once in 100 yearsdetermined to be the best available demonstrated cont rol technology the 2003 rule dictated that new sources in this subcategory meet waste management standard of discharge except in the event of ma nure runoff and precipitation from 100year 24hour rainfall event25 the rule also allowed less restrictive alternative performance standard 25year 24hour stor m standard for those facilities that will voluntarily use new technologie s and management practices that perform as well as or better than the baseline elgs at reducing pollutant discharges to surface waters from the production area the court held that epa had not provided adequate statutory and evidentiary basis for these tions of the rule nd had not justified its decision to allow compliance through an alternative standar d in its 2006 proposal to revise the rule epa deleted the provision allowing cafos to meet the discharge standard through the use of 100year 24hour rain event containment structure thus effectively prohibiting all discharge of manure litter and process wastewater from the production area for new s ources in this subcategory epa also proposed to delete the voluntary superior performance standards provision since the baseline for all new facilities in this subcategory will now be discharge in the october 2008 final rule epa dopts the revisions proposed in 2006 deleting the use of 100year 24hour rain event containment structure and deleting the voluntary superior perfo rmance standards provision in the 2003 rule the agency also promulgated new provision that w ould allow cafo using an open surface manure storage structure to request the permitting authority to establish sitespecific elgs that incorporate the nsps discharge requirement the new provision is intended to create an incentive for the use of innovative technologies to meet the discharge requirement by providing an up front determination that the cafo will meet the requirement prior to potentially expensive construction technology for pathogen control an effluent limitation guideline establishes the degree of pollu tant reduction that is atta inable by industrial sources through the application of various levels of technology the cwa requires that elgs be based on standards that are progressively more stringent 1 best practicable control technology currently available bpt the minimum technological requirement 2 best

group of pollutants th at are naturally occurring in the aquatic environment are biodegradable and ar the traditional and primary focus of wastewater control five pollutants are presently considered conventional pollutants one of these the pathogen fecal coliform is associated with manure discharges from cafos point sources that discharge c onventional pollutants are required to meet the bct standard but the act requires that in establishing bct epa must conduct cost reasonableness test of attaining more stringent pollutant control than bpt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs15 in the 2003 rule epa said that the g requirements of the rule were not specifically designed to reduce pathogens in animal waste but may in epas view achieve some incidental reductions of pat hogens the environmental plaintiffs argued that epa had not presented adequate eviden ce to justify establishing bct standard for pathogens that is more stringent th an the rules bpt standard the court upheld this complaint and ruled that epa mu st make an affirmative finding that the bctbased elgs adopted in the rule do in fact represent the best control technology for reducing pathogens in its 2006 propos to revise the 2003 rule epa retained the bct standard promulgated previ ously and provided lengthy narrative discussion and cost analysis jus tifying its original rationale in the october 2008 final rule epa presen ts what it terms an affirmative finding that the bct limitations adopted in the 2003 rule do in fact represent the best conventional control technolog limitations for fecal colifor m thus it retains the bct standard in the 2003 rule with more complete explanation of how it made that determination water qualitybased effluent limitations while technologybased npdes permits derived from epas elgs may result in meeting state water quality standards for individual waterbodies th effluent guidelines program is not specifically designed to ensure that the discharge from each facility meets the water quality standards for that pa rticular waterbody for th is reason the cwa requires permitting author ities to establish water qualitybased effluent permit limitations wqbels where necessary to attain and maintain water quality standards that specify discharge limitations that are more stringent than the national elgs where wqbels are necessary they are establis hed without consider ation of treatment technologies or cost in the 2003 rule epa included requirements concerning wqbels saying that it did not expect that wqbels will be established for cafo discharges from land application areas ce as described above any precipitation related discharges from those areas will be considered agricultural stormwater which is exempt from npdes permitting the environmental plaintiffs challenged epas failure to justify the lack of wqbels for discharges other than agricultural stormwater they also charged that the 2003 rule bars states from promulgating wqbels the waterkeeper alliance court partly upheld these co mplaints and directed epa on remand to explain whether or not and why wqbels are needed to assure that cafo discharges will not interfere with the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards the court also found that the preamble to the 2003 ru was ambiguous about whether states may promulgate wqbels for discharges ot her than agricultural stormwater and it ordered epa to clarify this issue in the 2006 proposal epa restated its view that precipitationrelated discharges from land application areas are statutorily exempt from any effluent limitations including wqbels because they are agricultural stormwater but it clarified that wqbels can be applied in appropriate cases to further limit discharges from cafo production areas and with respect to non precipitationrelate d land application discharges this reasoning applies to stateissued as well as epaissued permits further epa said that it is possible th at state acting under its own regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs16 authorities could impose additional requirements that are broader than the federal npdes program if they so choose whet her states will do so however is unclear in the october 2008 final rule epa reitera tes its view that nothing in the rule limits states permitting authority to include more stringent limitations on agricultural stormwater discharges under its own state regulations thus the agency says that state could require wqbels for new sources that are subject to the rules discharge standard discusse d above but epa also reite rates its view that as practical matter it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which additional limitations would be necessary for cafos that already must comply with stringent discharge requirement conclusion while there was overall agreement am ong interest groups on the initial 2006 and 2008 supplementary proposals they did concur on at least one point epa should provide much more clarity and guidance on such key concepts as criteria or circumstances defining the need for cafo to seek permit coverage and what terms in nutrient management plan should be included in per mit epa offered some examples on these points but the public comments reflected considerable uncertainty about issues that are fundamental to implementation of the rule further agriculture industry groups and states generally agreed on one other issue as previously noted epa had orig inally expected to promulgate final revised rule by june 2007 the 2006 proposal did not include an extension of the original july 31 2007 deadline for complian ce with the rule apparently assuming that states have already adopted provisions of the 2003 rule and would simply need to rescind provisions of the vacated rule and replace them with language of revised rule states considered that date unrealistic nd unattainable as did many in industry because of delays in completing work on final rule in 2007 epa extended the compliance deadline for newly defined cafo s those previously not required to have permits to february 27 2009 environmen tal advocates objected to the proposed extension asserting that it would further lay the time when states will issue needed permits to cafos some states said that epas delay would complicate the work of state regulators who are anxious to have the rule finalized regulatory revisions in response to waterkeeper alliance were expected to be complete in the summer of 2008 if so this would leave six to eight m onths from promulgation of final rule for animal feeding operations not previously defined as cafos to submit permit applications for cafos to submit nmps to permitting authorities and for permitting authorities to incorporate nmps as enfor ceable conditions of pe rmits epa believed that this would allow sufficient time for all required actions the feasibility of this schedule implied that the final rule w ould not differ greatly from the 2006 proposal and the 2008 supplementary proposal and indeed the final rule substantially adopts epas proposals even so some gr oups continued to ask for more time for compliance in the final rule epa did not modify the february 27 2009 compliance date based on its view that cafos already have the information that they need tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33656crs17 26 us government accountability office concentrated animal feeding operations epa needs more information and clearly defined strategy to protect air and water quality from pollutants of concern gao08944 80 pdevelop nutrient management plans and have not needed to wait for further epa action before doing so epa pledged to work with states that will be affected by number of new requirements and epa officials said that state program fully meets the requirements of the rule under the final rule states will have one year to adopt program changes that comply with the regulation or two years if statutory changes are needed the february 27 2009 complia nce date refers to the deadline for cafos to apply for permits and develop nutrient management plans sources will have three years to actually get permit coverage epa estimates that economic impacts of th final rule on cafo operators will be nearly the same as costs of the 2003 rule 54 million annually while approximately 25 of cafo operators subject to the 2003 rule would not need permit coverage under the 2008 revisions largely due to eliminating the universal duty to apply requirement thus saving cafos appr oximately 14 million in reduced permitting costs other cafos f ace increases in annual administrative burden due to the new nmp requirements and costs to qualify for the agricultural stormwater exemption state permitting authorities are projected to incur slightly higher costs under the final rule compared with the 2003 rule about 17 million annually the smaller number of permitted facilities is expected to reduce costs while implementing the new nmp requirements is expected to increase the administrative burden on states initial reaction of stakeholder groups to the final rule is not surprising industry groups are generally pleased that ther was little change from epas proposals questions about implementation of the ag ricultural stormwater exemption persist both with states and environmental advocates and many states be lieve that epa has underestimated the impacts of the rule on permitting authorities finally environmental groups reportedl remain concerned about allowing cafos to self certify that they do not discharge as well as about epas failure to require stringent technology for pathogen control because of the differing perspectives on epas action one can anticipate that there will be further challenges to the fina l rule some of the public comments on the initial 2006 proposal and the 2008 supplemen tary proposal echoed criticisms that were made of the 2003 rule and seem to pr eview legal critiques that are likely to be raised in future challenges congress has shown some interest in cafo issues in the past primarily through overs ight hearings in 1999 and 2001 before issuance of the 2003 rule in september 2008 the governme nt accountability office issued report that questioned epas ability to effectively regulate cafos because the agency lacks comprehensive accurate information needed to do so26 whether these issues will receive more congre ssional attention in the future is unknown for now
