copeland 4 the government accountability office criticized this system in septembe r 2006 repor t gao 06969 concluding that nrcs c ould not document why it includes each factor how weights for each factor are assigned and adjusted and how ea ch factor contributes to the programs mandate 5 eligible land includes cropland rangeland pastur private nonindustrial forest land and other lands as determined by usda the agricultural conservation program acp the water quality incentives program and the colorado river basin salinity control program eqip program today eqip was amended by the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 section 2301 of pl 107171 may 13 2002 commonly refe rred to as the 2002 farm bill the us department of agricultures natu ral resources conservation service nrcs administers eqip under final rule2 eqips legislative mandate is to optimize environmental benefits nrcs implemented eqip by establishing national priorities to reflect the most pressing natural resource n eeds and emphasize offsite benefits to the environment the current national prio rities are 1 reduction of nonpoint source pollutants in impaired watersheds consistent with total maximum daily loads3 or tmdls 2 conservation of ground and surface water resources 3 reduction of emissions that contribute to air quality impairment violations of national ambient air quality standards 4 reduction of soil erosion and sedimentation from unacceptable levels on agricultural land and 5 promoti on of atrisk species habitat conservation nrcs considers these prioritie s in allocating funds to states and establishing cost share and incentive payment levels it makes the allocation to states using 31 factors about the characteristics of agriculture and nd use and resource considerations factors are assigned weights ones with the largest weights currently include acres of cropland eroding above the tolerance level 61 nd acres of fair or poor rangeland 614 how eqip works producers with eligible land5 can submit an eqip plan that describes the conservation and environmental purposes that will be achieved using one or more usda approved conservation practices usdaapproved cons ervation practices may involve structures vegetation or land management stru ctural practices include the establishment construction or installa tion of measures designed for speci fic sites such as animal waste management facilities lives tock water developments and capping abandoned wells vegetative practices involve intr oduction or modification of plan tings such as filter strips or trees

national poverty level or ss than 50 of county median household income in the previous two years beginning farmer or rancher has farmed for less than 10 years 7 the percentage reduction was very similar before the 2002 farm b ill as the 1996 farm bill authorized funding at total of 10 billion between fy 1997 and fy2002 but appropriators limited it to total of 897 million reducing it by slig htly more than 10 of the authorized totalproducers can receive techni cal assistance to develop an eqip plan and after approval to implement it decisions about which plans to fund are made at the state level with local input the local conserva tion district will review the plan and then decide whether or not to select the plan for eqip funding if approved usda will provide costshare payments or incentive paymen ts to help the producer offset the cost of each practice participants are eligible to receive costshare payments for both constructing structures and implementing land ma nagement practices in addition they may be eligible to receive incentive payments for implementing certain higherpriority practices such as developing comp rehensive nutrient management plans contracts have term of one to n years and are capped at 450000 total payments person or entity can receive over any sixyear period are also limited to 450000 individuals or entities with an averag annual adjusted gross income agi of 25 million for the three years prior to the c ontract period are ineligible unless they received 75 of their agi from farming ranc hing or forestry usda will pay up to 75 of the projected cost of each practice however limited re source producers and beginning farmers and ranchers6 can receive up to 90of the cost initial payments are made the year in which the contract is signed but most payments are made after the practices are completed of the total annua l spending 60 is allocated to livestock practices eqip funding the 2002 farm bill section 2701 provided mandatory funds from the ccc to the basic eqip program through fy2007 this law authorized eqip at 400 million in fy2002 increasing rapidly in subsequent years as shown in table 1 as mandatory program it receives the authorized amount unless congress reduces funding through appropriations legislation table 1 also shows that congress has reduced actual funding by almost 10 below the author ized total between fy2002 and fy20067 eqip funding levels were amended in s ection 1203 of the deficit re duction act of 2005 pl 109171 to limit funding to 127 billion in fy2007 while extending the authorization through fy2010 and providing 127 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 and 13 billion in fy2010 table 1 eqip funding and reductions in millions fiscal year 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 total authorized funding

initiatives including pilot projects that provide marketbased incentives for water quality and target small and limited resource farmers 9 in fy2005 gswc provided approximately 63 million in f unding to pr oducers includes 51million congressionally limited funding and 12 million through another farm bill provision that requires minimum total funding to eac h state in support of regional equity main justification for the large funding increase in the 2002 farm b ill was to respond to large backlog of producer mand that had been documented during the farm bill debate as shown in table 2 gap

eqip three subprograms enacted in the 2002 fa rm bill are implemented through eqip8 one of these the competitive conservati on innovation grants cig is intended to leverage federal i nvestment stimulate innovative pproaches to conservation and accelerate technology transfer in environmental protecti on and agricultural production cig is authorized from fy2003 through fy2006 at an unspecified annual funding level grants must not exceed 50 of the proj ect cost with nonfe deral matching funds provided by the grantee nrcs curren tly allocates up to 15 million for national component and up to 5 million each for state and chesapeake bay watershed components in addition 22 states conduct state cig component which awarded nearly 3 million in fy2006 cig awarded total of 143 million in fy2004 220 million in fy2005 and 248 million in fy2006 awards for fy2007 may be announced soon second subprogram the ground nd surface water conservation gswc program provides costshare and incentive payments to producers where the assistance will result in net savings in ground or surface water resources in the producers agricultural operation funding is authorized as separate amount in addition to eqip at 25 million in fy2002 45 million in fy2003 and 60 million annually from fy2004 through fy2007 congress limited funding to 51 million each year since fy20049 in the third subprogram producers in the kl amath river basin in california and oregon receive money from separate and additional 50 million aut horization which was to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040crs5 10 this program has been used to apply c onservation practices on almost 110000 acres and irrigation water management on more than 62000 acres 11 data compiled by soil and water conservati on society and environmental defense for march 2007 report environmental quality incentives program eqip program assessmentprovided as soon as practicable to install conservation practices and manage irrigation waters10 selected policy issues eqip continues to enjoy widespread support in the farm community and in congress as it remains the major source of financial and technical assistance to help producers implement conservation practices that ddress specific resour ce and environmental problems major issues that might be addre ssed in the next farm bill include 1 funding levels and the continuing backlog of interest that is not being met 2 assessing more precisely what is being accomplished through the eqip program and 3 using eqip to address specific topics or needs in specified locations adequate funding and the applications backlog funding levels will be c ontentious issue for all farm programs because of both overall budget constraints and the increased num ber of farm interest s seeking additional assistance through the farm bill in this tting debate over future eqip funding could be particularly contentious between those seek ing higher funding to clear the backlog and those who favor other funding pr iorities as show above in table 2 the gap between the supply of funds and the demand for them expanded rapidly in fy2002 and fy2003 when only 22 and 15 respectively of the pplications were f unded in fy2004 and fy2005 the number of contracts continued to grow and the backlog decreased to levels not experienced since fy2001 so since the number of app lications reached high of more than 200000 in fy2003 it has been declining each year as result nrcs awarded contracts for more than half of the applications in fy2005 and fy2006 the backlog was major justification for higher funding in 2002 and it could be strong argument in the next farm bill debate however from fy2004 to fy2005 very large number of backlog applications we re not updated for unknown reasons and are therefore longer considered as result the total backlog declined by almost 103000 even though only 50000 applications were funde d detailed informati on is not available on the characteristics of applications currently in the backlog answers to questions such as whether there are any agricultural regions where much smaller portion of applications are being funded whether some practices are more likely to remain in the backlog than others whether some applications stay in the backlog for much longer time period than others and whether recent backlog declines are due in part to declining interest because of long delays could pr ovide important insights for this debate one reason why higher funding has not resu lted in the elimination of the backlog is that the average contract size has grown si nce the last farm bill in 2002 prior to 2002 the average cost of an eqip contr act was 7750 since 2002 it has been 1625011 reasons for this may include raising the fundi ng cap in the 2002 farm bill allowing largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22040crs6 scale livestock operations to fund waste management facilities and installing more expensive conservation practices measuring eqip accomplishments nrcs can provide considerable informati on about eqip contracts including which conservation practices are bein g installed and their design and maintenance standards however until recently relatively little wa s known about what is actually being accomplished through eqip contracts to start to fill this voi d nrcs has compiled information about which resource concerns eqip addresses these data show that between 2002 and 2006 the primary resources concerns addressed through eqip spending included water quality 38 of the total spent in those years soil management 29 and water management 24 the remaining three resource concerns wildlife management air quality and we tland conservation together received slightly less than 10 of the total little is known howev er about how endurin g those conservation practices might be after the c ontract ends among the questions that nrcs is trying to address for all its conservation activities including eqip are how to evaluate performance how to measure environmental changes how to evaluate costeffectiveness which methods to use to identify environmenta l effects and which types of data should be collected to measure output nrcs initiated national review called the conservation effects assessment project cea p to develop better answer s to all these questions but only few initial results are currently available regarding eqip specifically nrcs has proposed to periodically review state prepared reports to determine how the program is being delivered at the state and local level nrcs will require states to prepare reports describing eqip implementation and accomplishments tied to performance measures of particular interest may be livestock production practices which recei ve 60 of total funding each year policy makers may seek more information about the developm ent and adoption of co mprehensive nutrient management plans especia lly by confined animal feeding operations referred to as cafos cafos are large livestock operations the minimum number of animals varies with the type of animal some have expre ssed concern that the effects of cafos on the environment and public health have not b een adequately assessed and may seek to address those concerns in the next farm bill targeting eqip small portion of eqip funding is now ta rgeted as result of provisions enacted in 2002 to the three new subprograms desc ribed above one the klamath basin is targeted to specific area nd the other two are targeted to specified topics ground and surface water conservation nd innovative conservation tec hnologies question that may be addressed in the farm bill debate is whether more subprograms should be created and if so what topics these programs will address and how much money will be committed to them interests may promote many different topics or geographic areas for such programs but if funds for these sub programs are carved out of the general eqip program that may attract opposition especi ally if eqip funding appears to be constrained in the current budget environment
