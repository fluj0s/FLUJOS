actions of your life all of the maybes on decision level and if you suddenly assert your decisions where you have withheld decisions i can guarantee you that your life will smooth out pretty well if you do that in big office for instance where theres big staff it may very well be that by asserting your decisions they fire you straight out the door thats where you belong then youre lot better off outside that door if this environment has smothered your power of decision you dont belong in it most of the indecision which you will meet in life is strictly based around choice of environment and the ability to exert decision in that environment l ron hubbard from the lecture decision delivered on 20 may 1952 this lecture can be found in research and discovery volume 10 the magic of listening to lrh lectures over six years i have listened to tapes nearly every day i listened all summer long while at my cottage with our children every summer and through all times good and bad i have bought

times in my first years of tape listening when my life seemed ruined and i could not cope i would have to recover on the bed from the body somatics that would blow off from hearing the data in fact

to be or not to be that is the question by l ron hubbard i would like to talk to you about decision decision is you will discover one of the fundamental points of indecision and one of the fundamental reasons why people are sane or insane decision you see decision is short way of saying choice and choice of course is the keynote of selfdeterminism to determine anything you must have the choice to determine choice to determine means that you must have the power of decision automatically you will discoverautomatically in any casethat the one thing that is holding up beingness is indecision maybe in any engram that presents itself to be runin any engram that presents itself to be runthere is maybe two choices which are relatively balanced and their even balancing makes an irresolution now theres great deal to do with time in decision decision and time have lot in common when we have clean clear decision we have clean clear time and when we have an indecision there is an unclarity about time if you are trying to decide anything and having difficulty in trying to decide that thing the root of its trouble is time not even necessarily data its time theres time hangup there somewhere and if you look for that back of the data usually the data becomes needless decision the basic decision that life makes that theta makes is to be or not to be shakespeares famous line to be or not to be that is the question hamlet was in very very bad condition that day he was hung up on the squarest maybe that anyone can be hung up on if you see someone facing new job choice of whether or not hes going to continue with his old job or take new job you may think that he is resisting change or lot of other things and so on hes not anything i mean he is hung up until he decides one way or the other on beingness situation so that any beingness situation where you had to be or not to be on case becomes itself the most aberrative situation running an engram is really basically only necessary until the preclear has reached of his own volition and evaluation the decision he didnt make hes found the maybe in his life hes found that maybe and having found the maybe it is clearly enough in view so that he can resolve it or evaluate its importance and the rest of the engram will blow itll disappearbecome completely unaberrative postulates are important only because postulates are the root material of decision that is to say you have the decision and you make the postulate to resolve the decision to be or not to be is action or inaction existence or existence l ron hubbard from the lecture decision delivered on 20 may 1952 this lecture can be found in research and discovery volume 10 here is the story behind one of the greatest breakthroughs of scientology so if youre going to
