srutherfordgsouriedu dear all ive attached draft attached word document incorporating many of the suggestions wording etc ive already recieved from various of you some specific commentsinquiriesrequests for help indicated in yellow highlighting waiting to hear back from peck and tom c guys if youre out there can you give holler to let know your disposition thanks otherwise everyone else has indicated theyre on board ive been in touch w judy jacobs at agu to clarify the ground rules apparently we can refer where necessary to press releases parenthetically in the piece i think this is important in our case because there is subtle but important distinction between what the papers actual purport to show and what the authors and their promoters have claimed they show eg in the harvardsmithsonian press release we need to draw out this distinctioni sent judy my paragraph on that and she said it looks fineso apparently its kosher ive avoided any reference to unpublished work however eg mann and jones because this opens up can of worms we can nicely make use of work that keith has already done to provide suggestion of the longerterm past 2k changes for greater context re referenceswe necessarily have to go well over the normal 10 or so because part of the strength of our piece is the wealth of recent studies supporting our basic conclusions judy said thats ok tooespecially since our text is short by about 100 words relative to the official 1200 word limit so we should try to keep it that wayie we need to play zerosum game as much as possible with any suggested revisions re figures scott rutherford has generously offered to help prepare draft of figure 1 which ill send on to everyone once its available ive also described in the figure caption my concept of figure 2clearly it would be helpful if phil and ray could collaborate on the preparation of this one guys looking forward to comments and suggested revisions ill just accumulate these from everyone in whatever form you prefer to provide them emailed comments word file w track changes or highlighting of changes used etc and try to prepare revised draft once ive heard back from everyone thanks again to everyone for their willingness to help with this and to be involved with this mike date wed 04 jun 2003 101757 0400 to phil jones pjonesueaacuk rbradleygeoumassedu tom wigley

subject re prospective eos piece cc mannvirginiaedu scott rutherford srutherfordgsouriedu thanks phil and thanks tom w and keith for your willingness to helpsign on this certainly gives us quorum pending even few possible additional signatories im waiting to hear back from in response to the queries i will work on draft today w references and two suggested figures and will try to send on by this evening east coast usa tom w indicated that he wouldnt be able look at draft until thursday anyway so why doesnt everyone just take day then to digest what ive provided and then get back to with commentschanges using word track changes if you like id like to tentatively propose to pass this along to phil as the official keeper of the draft to finalize and submit if it isnt in satisfactory shape by the time i have to leave july 11if i hadnt mentioned im getting married and then honeymoon prior to iugg in sapporogone for about 1 month total phil does that sound ok to you re figures what i had in mind were the following two figures 1 plot of various of the most reliable in terms of strength of temperature signal and reliability of millennialscale variability regional proxy temperature reconstructions around the northern hemisphere that are available over the past 12 thousand years to convey the important point that warm and cold periods where highly regionally variable phil and ray are probably in the best position to prepare this phil and i have recently submitted paper using about dozen nh records that fit this category and many of which are available nearly 2k backi think that trying to adopt timeframe of 2k rather than the usual 1k addresses good earlier point that peck made w regard to the memo that it would be nice to try to contain the putative mwp even if we dont yet have hemispheric mean reconstruction available that far back phil and i have one in reviewnot sure it is kosher to show that yet thoughive put in an inquiry to judy jacobs at agu about this if we wanted to be fancy we could do this the way certain plots were presented in one of the past ipcc reports was it 1990 in which spatial map was provided in the center this would show the locations of the proxies with rays radiating out to the top sides and bottom attached to rectanges showing the different timeseries its bit of work but would be great way to convey both the spatial and temporal information at the same time 2 version of the nowfamiliar spaghetti plot showing the various reconstructions as well as model simulations for the nh over the past 1 or maybe 2k to give you an idea of what i have in mind im attaching science piece i wrote last year that contains the same sort of plot however what id like to do different here is in addition to the multiproxy reconstructions id like to add keiths maximum latewood densitybased series since it is entirely independent of the multiproxy series but conveys the same basic message i would also like to try to extend the scope of the plot back to nearly 2k this would be either w the mann and jones extension in review in grl or if that is deemed not kosher the briffa et eurasian treering composite that extends back about 2k and based on phil and my results appears alone to give reasonably accurate picture of the full hemispheric trend thoughts comments on any of this thanks all for the help mike at 0925 am 642003 0100 phil jones wrote mike this is definitely worth doing and i hope you have the time before the 11th or can pass it on to one of us at that time as you know im away for couple of days but back friday so count in ive forwarded you all the email comments ive sent to reportersfellow scientists so youre fully aware of my views which are essentially the same as all of the list and many others in paleo eos would get to most fellow scientists as i said to you the other day it is amazing how far and wide the sb pieces have managed to percolate when it comes out i would hope that agueos publicity machine will shout the message from rooftops everywhere as many of us need to be available when it comes out there is still firm news on what climate research will do although they will likely have two editors for potentially controversial papers and the editors will consult when papers get different reviews all standard practice id have thought at present the editors get guidance whatsoever it would seem that if they dont know what standard practice is then they shouldnt be doing the job cheers phil at 2234 030603 0400 michael mann wrote dear colleagues eos has invited and prospective coauthors to write forum piece see below this was at ellen moselythompsons suggestion upon my sending her copy of the attached memo that michael oppenheimer and i jointly wrote michael and i wrote this to assist colleagues who had been requesting more background information to help counter the spurious claims with which i believe youre all now familiar of the latest baliunas soon pieces the idea i have in mind would be to use what michael and i have drafted as an initial starting point for slightly expanded piece that would address the same basic issues and as indicated below could include some references and figures as indicated in judy jacobs letter below the piece would be rewritten in such way as to be less explicitly though perhaps not less implicitly directed at the baliunassoon claims criticisms and attacks phil ray and peck have already indicated tentative interest in being coauthors im sending this to the rest of you tom c keith tom w kevin in the hopes of broadening the list of coauthors i strongly believe that piece of this sort coauthored by 9 or so prominent members of the climate research community with background andor interest in paleoclimate will go long way ih helping to counter these attacks which are being used in turn to launch attacks against ipcc agu has offered to expedite the process considerably which is necessary because ill be travelling for about month beginning june 11th so im going to work hard to get something together asap id would therefore greatly appreciate quick response from each of you as to whether or not you would potentially be willing to be involved as coauthor if youre unable or unwilling given other current commitments ill understand thanks in advance for getting back to on this mike date tue 03 jun 2003 201908 0400 from ellen mosleythompson thompson4osuedu subject re position paper by mann bradley et that is refutation to soon et xsender ethompsopopserviceohiostateedu to judy jacobs jjacobsaguorg michael mann mannvirginiaedu xmailer qualcomm windows eudora version 43 judy and mike this sounds outstanding am i right in assuming that fred reviews and approves the forum pieces if so can you hint about expediting this timing is very critical here judy thanks for taking the bull by the horns and getting the ball rolling best regards ellen at 0733 pm 06032003 0400 judy jacobs wrote dear dr mann thanks for the prompt reply based on what you have said it sounds to as if mann bradley et will not be in violation of agus prohibition on duplicate publication the attachment to your email definitely has the look and feel of something that would be published in eos under the forum column header forum pieces are usually comments on articles of any description that have been published in previous issues of eos or they can be articles on purely scientific or science policyrelated issues around which there is some controversy or difference of opinion or articles on current public issues that are of interest to the geosciences or on issuesscience or broader policy ones0n which there is an official agu position statement in this last category i offer for example the teaching of creationism in public schools either alongside evolution or to the exclusion of evolution agu has an official position statement climate change and greenhouse gases which states among other things that there is high probability that manmade gases primarily from the burning of fossil fuels is contributing to gradual rise in mean globab temperatures in this context your protoarticlein the form of the attachment you sent would seem right on target for forum piece however since the soon et article wasnt actually published in eos anything that you and dr bradley craft will have to minimize reference to the specific article or articles and concentrate on the science that is set forth in these papers presumably this problem could be solved by simply referencing these papers forum piece can be as long as 1500 words or approximately 6 doublespaced pages maximum of two figures is permitted maximum of 10 references is encouraged but if the number doesnt exceed 10 too outrageously i dont make fuss and neither will ellen authors are now asked to submit their manuscripts and figures electronically via agus internetbased geophysical electronic manuscript system gems which makes it possible for the entire submissionreview process to be conducted online if you have never used gems before you can register for login and password and get initial instructions by going to 1httpeossubmitaguorg if you would like to have set of stepbystep instructions for firsttime gems users please ask ellen indicated that sheyou would like to get something published sooner rather than later the eos staff can certainly expedite the editorial process for anything you and your colleagues submit dont hesitate to contact with any further questions best regards judy jacobs michael mann wrote dear judy thanks very much for getting back to on this ellen had mentioned this possibility and i have been looking forward to hearing back about this michael oppenheimer and i drafted an informal memo that we passed along to colleagues who needed some more background information so that they could comment on the soon et papers in response to various inquiries they were receiving from the press etc ive attached copy of this memo it has not been our intention for this memo to appear in print and it has not been submitted anywhere for publication on the other hand when ellen mentioned the possibility of publishing something like this in eg the eos forum that seemed like an excellent idea to and several of my colleagues that i have discussed the possibility with what we had in mind was to produce revised version of the basic memo that ive attached modifying it where necessary and perhaps expanding it bit seeking broader coauthorship by about 9 or so other leading climate scientists so far phil jones of the university of east anglia ray bradley of the university of massachusetts and jonathan overpeck of the university of arizona have all indicated their interest in coauthoring such piece we suspect that few other individuals would be interested in being coauthors as well i didnt want to pursue this further however until i knew whether or not an eos piece was possibility so pending further word from you i would indeed be interested in preparing multiauthored position paper for eos in collaboration with these coauthors based loosely on the memo that ihave attached i look forward to further word from you on this best regards mike mann at 0459 pm 632003 0400 you wrote dear dr mann i am the managing editor for eos the weekly newspaper of the american geophysical union late last week the eos editor for atmospheric sciences ellen mosleythompson asked if eos would publish what she called position paper by you phillip bradley et that would in effect be refutation to paper by soon et that was published in british journal energy environment few weeks ago this energy environment article was subsequently picked up by the discovery channel and other print and electronic media that reach the general public before i can answer this question i need to ask if you and your colleagues intend for this position paper to be published simultaneously in outlets other than eos if this is the case im afraid it being published in eos is moot point because of agus duplicate publication policy if the material has been published elsewhere first agu will not publish it i look forward to your response
