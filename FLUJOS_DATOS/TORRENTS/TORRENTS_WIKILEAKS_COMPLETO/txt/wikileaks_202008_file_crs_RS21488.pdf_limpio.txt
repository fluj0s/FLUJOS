began implementing navymarine corps tactical air integration tai plan aimed at more closely integrating navy and marine corps strike fighter inventories don said the pl an will reduce strike fighter procurement costs by about 35 billion but in crease strike fighter readiness costs by about 165 billion resulting in net saving s of about 185 billion don in june 2005 modified the tai plan to respond to increas ed operational tempo the tai plan raises several potential oversight issues this report will be updated as events warrant background navy and marine corps strike fighters the navy and marine corps which make up the department of th navy don each operate hundreds of strike fighters the navy fields fa18cd hornets fa18e f super hornets and f14 tomcats the marine corps fields fa18cds and av8b harrier vstol verticalshort takeoff and landing jump jets the navy plans to shif t to combination of super hornets and f35 joint strike fighters jsfs while the marine corps plans to shift to an alljsf strike fighter force consistent with these pl ans don in fy2004 and subsequent years plans to procure additional fa18efs for the navy and jsfs for the navy and marine corps1 proposed tactical air integration plan in 2003 don began implementing navymarine corps tactical air integration tai plan aimed at more fully integrating the navy and marine corps strike fighter for ces key elements of the plan which would be carried out between latefy 2003 and fy2012 include the following operate smaller total number of don strike fighters the planned total number of operational don strike fighters is to be reduced thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21488crs2 smaller force is to be made more effective through increased spending on aircraft readiness and modern ization as described below reduce planned procurement of strike fighters consistent with the reduction in the total number of ope rational strike fi ghters planned purchases of fa18efs and jsfs are to be reduced increase the readiness of navy strike fighters don is to use some of the savings from reduced fa18ef nd jsf procurement to increase the readiness of navy strike fighters navy strike fighter squadrons whose readiness traditionally had been allowed to decline between the times that they are assigned to deploying navy aircraft carriers are to be maintained at more consistently high level of readiness over time like marine corps strike fighters so that they will be available in times of emergency for surge deployments aboard navy carriers or with deploying marine corps units enhance funding for don strike fighter modernization andancillary equipment to further increase the capability of the smaller strike fighter force don is to use some of the savings from reduced fa 18ef and jsf procurement to enha nce funding for don strike fighter modernization ie upgrade progra ms and procurement of don strike fighter ancillary equipmen t such as targeting pods crossassign navy and marine co rps strike fighter squadrons on daytoday basis 3 navy strike fi ghter squadrons would be assigned to deploying marine corps units and 6 marine corps strike fighter squadrons would be assigned to help fill out navy carrier air wings this is intended in part to familiarize pilots from each service with the operations of the other service and thereby ensure that in times of emergency strike fighters from one service could be readily surged to meet the strike fighter needs of the other service the crossassignment of the 6 marine corps squadrons woul d add to the 4 marine corps strike fighter squadrons that since the 1990s have been assigned to help fill out navy carrier air wings bringing the total number of crossassigned marine corps squadrons to 10 reduced number of operational don strike fighters as shown in table 1 below the tai plan would reduce the tota l number of operational don strike fighters with much of this change coming from reducing activeduty navy jsf squadrons reduced overall strike fighter procurement don said the 212aircraft reduction in the planned number of operational strike fighters translates into 497aircraft reduction in planned overall strike fighter procuremen t the tai plan don said will permit don to reduce procurement of fa 18efs to 460 from 548 reduction of 88 aircraft or about 16 and procurement of jsfs to 680 from 1089 reduction of 409 aircraft or about 38 the combined fa18ef and jsf buy would thus be reduced to 1140 aircraft from 1637 reduction of 497 aircraft or about 30 not procuring these 497 aircraft don said will save don about 35 billion in constant

apr 10 and apr 22 2003 2004 gao report an august 2004 government accountability office gao report on the tai plan concluded the following the department of the navy based its conclusion that it could meet the navy and marine corps operational requirement s with smaller force primarily on the findings of contractor study that evaluated the relative capability of different tactical aviation force structures gaos review of the contractors methodology and assumptions about force structure budget resources and management efficiencies suggests that much of the analysis appears reasonable however gao noted some limitations including the lack of analytical support for reducing the number of backup aircraft increase the risk that th smaller force will be less effective than expected the navy and marine corps each followed different process in selecting reserve squadron to decommission the marine corps made clear and welldocumented analysis of the operational fiscal logistical and personnel impacts of different options that appears to prov ide decision makers with reasonable basis for selecting the reserve unit to decommission by contrast the navy selected its reserve squadron without clear criteria or documented comprehensive analysis and thus with less transparency in its process two other factors that might affect succe ssful implementation of the plan are the potential unavailability of readiness funding and delays in fielding the new force although the contractor recommended that the navy identify future readinessfunding requirements to date the navy has not conducted this analysis in addition the department of the navy is experiencing engineering and weight problems in developing the joint strike fighter that will cause it to be delayed until 2013 at

issues for congress by ronald orourke1 year later than had been projected and other high risks to the program remain because these delays will cause the navy to operate legacy aircraft longer than expected they might also increase operations and maintenance costs making an analysis of future readiness funding requirements even more important2 2005 modification to plan in august 2005 it was reported that don in june 2005 had modified the tai plan in response to increased don strike fighter operational tempo resulting from operations in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere the modification called capabilitiesbased scheduling relaxes at least temporarily the commitment to crossassign 3 navy strike fi ghter squadrons and total of 10 marine corps strike fighter squadrons don says the modification results in more flexible approach to assigning navy and marine corps strike fighter squadrons that responds to increased strike fighter operational tempo and be tter aligns the tai plan with the fleet response plan frp which aims at improving the navys ability to surge forces in response to contingencies3 issues for congress congress expressed concern over the tai plan in marking up the fy2004 defense authorization bill hrep t 108106 page 327 srept 10846 page 123 and fy2004 defense appropriation b ill section 8141 of pl 10887 potential issues for continued congressional oversight in clude the three below total don strike fighter capability what effect will the tai plan have on total don strike fighter capability don argues that the plans operational strike fighter force though numerically smaller will provide more forwarddeployed don strike fighter capability on daytoday basis due to the enhanced individual aircraft capability and will improve dons ability to surge aircraft in emergencies due to the increased surge readiness of navy strike fighters the improved ability to assign surged aircraft from one service to meet the needs of the other service if need be and the enhanced individual capability of all don strike fighters skep tics may question whether the smaller force even with its improvements in readiness m odernization and ancilla ry equipment would have enough aircraft to fight and win two regional conflicts at the same time in assessing this question one issue concer ns the plans enhanced funding for strike fighter modernization programs and ancillary equipment don said that in the case of the tai plan enhanced funding refers to significant degree to an increased likelihood that don in coming years would be able to afford certain modernization programs and ancillary equipment included under its old pl an potential oversig ht questions include how much of the plans enhanced funding represents increased funding and how much represents an increased likelihood of being able to afford items included in dons old plan if the increase in f unding like lihood is less than don believes would the tai force still provide more capability than the previously planned force second potential issue concerns the meas urement of individual aircraft capability assuming the tai plan would result in stri ke fighter force refl ecting greater amountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21488crs5 4 the power pool op cit 5 the 35 billion and 165 billion figures would ch ange if computed on discounted basis to reflect the investment value of money over timeof spending for modernizati on and ancillary equipment what is the resulting amount of improvement in individual aircraft capability if the improvement is less than don believes would the tai force still be more effective than the previously planned force third potential issue concerns the tai plans impact on pilot training marine corps pilots are trained as infantrymen before they become pilots so that they will better understand the battlefield needs of ground forces as pilots they receive extensive training in close air support supporting frie ndly troops on the ground by attacking nearby enemy ground forces navy pilot training in contrast has traditi onally focused more on airtoair combat and on interdiction attacking enemy forces and assets in locations away from friendly ground forces the crossassign ment of strike fighters under the tai plan suggests that don strike fighter pilots might need to either increase their total training load or spend less time training in their own services most prominent missions what effect would the tai plan have on individual pilot training loads or the ability of don pilots to achieve high levels of proficiency in specific mission areas fourth potential issue concerns the imp act of the 2005 modification of the tai plan to capabilitiesbased scheduling don fficials argue that it effectively accelerates don tactical aircraft integration4 skeptics could argue that the relaxation of the commitment to crossassign strike fighte r squadrons will reduce don strike fighter integration reducing the origina lly advertised benef its of integration potential oversight questions for congress include the followi ng will cap abilitiesbased sche duling increase or reduce don strike fighter integration if the number of don strike fighter squadrons is reduced but the originally planned degree of integration is not achieved how will this affect don strike fighter capability will the don strike fighter force be able to meet operational needs have the inventory re ductions carried out under the tai plan made it more difficult for don to manage strike fi ghter operational tempo should the strike fighter force be increased to permit don to better manage operational tempo cost effectiveness second potential issue for congress is the cost effectiveness of the tai plan when all the cost impacts of the tai plan are taken into account will the net cost impact of the plan be worth the resulting change in overall don strike fighter capability although don estimates that the tai plan w ill reduce don strike fighter procurement costs by about 35 billion in constant fy2002 dollars through fy2021 the plan will create additional expenditu res in other areas most prominently the plan will require additional operation and maintenance spending to increase the readiness rates of navy strike fighters don estimates that increased spending for strike fighter readiness under the plan would total about 165 billion in constant fy2002 dollars through fy2021 and would c ontinue to accumulate thereafter5 for the six years covered by the fy2004fy2009 future years defense plan fydp don estimates that the tai plan would reduce don aircraft pr ocurement costs by about 1 billion and increase aircraft readiness spending by about 37 billion dod aircraft operation and maintenance costs have been growing in recent years particularly for older aircraft new models of dod aircraft have sometimes if not often prove n to be more expensive to operate and maintain than planned this raises the possibility that the increased readiness costs of the tai plan may be underes timated on the other nd since the costs of athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21488crs6 6 for discussion see crs report 93823 f four us air forces overlap and alternatives by allan w howey out of print available from christopher bolkcom at 72577least some if not many past dod aircraft procurement programs have also been underestimated there is also possib ility that the procurement cost savings of the tai plan may be underestimated second potential source of additional ex penditures under the tai plan would be increased spending for don strike fighte r modernization and ancillary equipment although much of the enhancement of funding in these areas under the tai plan refers to an increased likelihood of being able to afford modernization and ancillary equipment programs included under dons previous strike fighter plan some of the enhancement would come in the form of increased amounts of spending in these areas third potential source of additional ex penditures under the tai plan would be increased unit jsf procurement costs th 409aircraft reduction in don purchases of jsfs that is to occur under the tai plan would reduce the total planned buy of jsfs 2912 aircraft including 60 for the royal navy by about 14 any air force or royal navy jsfs that were scheduled to be procured after these 409 don jsfs would now occur earlier on the production learning curve nd therefore be more expensive for these services to procure though perhaps only margin ally so in addition if the reduction in the planned don jsf buy results in reduced annual jsf procurement rates in certain years compared to the old jsf procurement plan then the jsfs produced during those years could be more expensive due to redu ced spreading of manufacturer and supplier fixed overhead costs the resulting increase in unit procurement cost would be incurred by whatever services are pr ocuring these jsfs if the reduced don jsf buy under the tai plan somehow affects the number of jsfs sold to foreign buyers this could further affect unit procurement costs of jsfs built for the united states implications for further aviation integration third potential issue for congress is the potential implications of the tai plan if implemented for further integration of us military assets in the future could implementing the tai plan lead to additional integration of navy and marine corps aviation assets in the future if so what form might this further integration take and what would be its potential impact on don capabilities and costs the marine corps by law 10 usc 5063a is to be combinedarms force that includes its own aviation assets even so there have been proposals from time to time for turning the marine corps fixedwing aircraft over to the navy some observers may wonder whether the tai plan if imple mented could become the first step on slippery slope toward to tal integration of na vy and marine corps fixedwing aviation advocates of such inte gration have argued that it could reduce don costs and would be consistent with the armys reliance on air force and navy fixedwing aircraft for close air support marine corps official s and others have opposed the idea on the grounds that maintaining separate marine fixedwing aviation capability is critical to the services success as combinedarms force particularly in exped itionary operations where marine corps fixedwing aircraft rve as the equivalent of the armys more extensive artillery support units the tai plan in the longer run could renew discussions from earlier years over the costeffectiveness of maintaining separate aviation components in the air force navy army and marine corps the socalled four air forces issue6 some press reports suggest that dod is l ooking at this issue as part of the 2005 quadrennial defense review qdr to be reported to congress in early 2006
