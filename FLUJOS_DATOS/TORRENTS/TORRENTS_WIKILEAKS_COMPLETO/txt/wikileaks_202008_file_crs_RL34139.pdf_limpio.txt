proposals address particular aspect of the law such as abatement which limits restitution collection after the defendants death s 149 two bills hr 845 the criminal restitution improvement act and s

be ordered without recourse to the laws relating to probation and supervised release 2 an overhaul of the procedures governing the issuance and enforcement of restitution orders to aﬀord prosecutors greater enforcement ﬂexibility without having to seek the approval of the sentencing court and 3 authority for preindictment and presentencing restraining orders and other protective measures to

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 restitution is the act of restoring an individual or entity in whole or in part to the lost circumstances they might have once enjoyed in federal criminal context it is the order of sentencing court directing defendant to reimburse or otherwise compensate the victims of his crimes1 federal courts have inherent authority to award restitution they may do so only pursuant to statute2 there are four general statutory sources of such authority under 18 usc 3663a federal courts must order restitution when sentencing defendant convicted of crime of violence of crime against property or fraud or deceit that is proscribed in title 18 of the united states code of maintaining druginvolved premises or of product tampering under 18 usc 3663 if restitution is not otherwise mandatory under section 3663a federal courts may nonetheless order restitution when sentencing defendant convicted of an offense proscribed in title 18 of the united states code or of various drug or avia tion safety offenses under 18 usc 3563b2 federal courts may make restitution condition of probation 3 under 18 usc 3583d they may make restitution condition of supervised release4 there are handful of statutes that contain special restitution coverage for losses associated with particular crimes such as the failure to provide child support 18 usc 228d the procedure for the exercise and implementation of federal restitution authority is set forth in large measure in 18 usc 3664 18 usc 36113614 and to lesser extent in 18 usc 3572 restitution is based on the losses suffered by the victims of crime neither the defendants financial condition at the time of sentencing nor his future economic prospects figure in the amount of restitution awarded consequently in some cases particularly those in which restitution order is mandatory the amount of restitution ordered may exceed what the defendant can ever reasonably be expected to pay 5 nevertheless there have been suggestions that in other instances insufficient restitution has been ordered or collected because of the particularities of restitution law6 1 black s law dictionary 1339

489 493 7th cir 2005 3 by statute probation is not sentencing option where the defendant has been convicted of class or class b felony ie felonies punishable by death life imprisonment or some maximum term of imprisonment of at least 25 years 18 usc 3561 3581 the sentencing guidelines are more restrictive and recommend against sentencing defendant to probation for any crime for which the top of the recommended sentencing guideline range is more than imprisonment for one year ussg 5b11 4 by statute when sentencing defendant the court may also impose term of supervised release to be served upon the defendants release from prison 18 usc 3583 the sentencing guidelines recommend term of supervised release whenever the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for one year or more ussg 5d12 5 united states government accountability office criminal debt courtordered restitution amounts far exceed likely collections for the crime victims in selected financial fraud cases 2 january 2005the collection of outstanding criminal debt is inherently difficult due to number of factors including the nature of the debt in that it involves criminals who may be incarcerated may have been deported or may have minimal earning capacity and the mvra requirement that the assessment of restitution be based on actual loss and not on an offenders ability to pay 6 153 cong rec s3627 daily ed march 22

district court in houston texas vacated the conviction of and dismissed the indictment of former enron executive kenneth lay at the same time it refused to order restitution for the victims of the crimes for which he had been convicted 11 mr lay had died shortly after his conviction and the court felt that the doctrine of abatement recognized by the fifth circuit compelled its action12 the supreme court once observed that the lower federal courts had consistently and correctly held that death pending direct review of criminal conviction abates not only the appeal but also all

practice had been to dismiss and remand upon the death of petitioner pending grant of certiorari the durham court indicated that it did not consider important the distinction between death pending appeal and death pending petition for certiorari id at 483 n later and without further explanation the court dismissed the petition for certiorari of man who had died while his petition was pending in doing so it expressly overruled durham to the extent of any inconsistency dove v united states 423 us 325 197613 since then the lower federal courts have read dove to mean that abatement does not apply to petitions for certiorari but have continued to adhere to their earlier general rule on abatement upon the death of defendant pending appeal the courts treat his indictment and conviction as if they had never occurred the case is returned to the lower federal court with instructions to vacate the conviction and to dismiss the indictment14 the circuit courts are somewhat more divided on the question of whether restitution order likewise abates upon the death of the defendant pending appeal15 in the twilight of the 109th congress the senate passed legislation that would have barred abatement of restitution order16 the bills sponsor senator feinstein reintroduced essentially the same proposal as s 149 in the 110th congress17 except for restitution and civil forfeiture s 149 replicates common law abatement for sentencing purposes18 the obligation to pay fines and special assessments and apparently to honor conditions of probation or supervised release dies with the defendant 19 s 149 does not however obligate the government to return funds received in payment of the defendants fine special assessment or criminal forfeiture20 for civil 13 the entire dove per curiam opinion reads as follows the court is advised that the petitioner died at new bern nc on november 14 1974 the petition for certiorari is therefore dismissed to the extent that durham v united states 401 us 481 1972 may be inconsistent with ruling durham is overruled it is so ordered 423 us at 325 14 united states v estate of parsons 367 f3d 409 413 5th cir 2004en banc citing united states

united states v estate of parsons 367 f3d at 415 according regardless of its purpose the order of restitution cannot stand in the wake of parsonss death b ecause he now is deemed never to have been convicted or even charged the order restitution abates ab initio accord united states v logal 106 f3d at 1552 but see united states v christopher 273 f3d at 299we conclude that the order of restitution in this case is more compensatory in nature than penal historically restitution an equitable remedy was intended to reimburse person wronged by the actions of another to absolve the estate from refunding the fruits of the wrongdoing would grant an undeserved windfall we are persuaded that abatement should not apply to the order of restitution in this case and thus it survives against the estate of the deceased convict accord united states v dudley 739 f2d at 178 united states v pogue 19 f3d at 665 because the government has conceded that pogues estate has assets against which any claim for restitution might be advanced any questions concerning the survival of the re stitution order raises moot issue we offer opinion on this issue 16 s 4055 passed by unanimous consent 152 cong

the applicable statute of limitations and denies the application of abatement doctrine to civil forfeiture cases22 for restitution it essentially ignores the defendants death more precisely it allows for substitution of the defendants representative and permits restitutionrelated proceedings to continue as if the defendant were still alive if the defendant dies after conviction but before being sentenced s 149 authorizes sentencing hearing and restitution order with little said about exactly what procedures are to be followed 23 thereafter or if the defendant dies after having been sentenced the appellate process remains open to the defendants representative victims and the government for restitutionrelated matters24 continued 861 f2d 1234 1236 11th cir 1988 21 civil forfeiture is confiscation accomplished not as part of the criminal prosecution against the property owner but under civil procedure ordinarily conducted in rem where the property is treated as the defendant where confiscation turns upon whether the property is shown to have the statutorily required nexus to particular crime and where the owners guilt or innocence is not necessarily relevant calerotoledo v

pursue ci vil forfeiture of property as authorized by law 2 notwithstanding the expiration of any civil forfeiture statut of limitations or any time limitation set forth in section 983a of this title not later than the later of those time peri od otherwise authorized by law and two years after the date of the death of an individual against whom criminal indictment alleging forfeiture is pending the government may commence civil forfeiture proceedings against any interest in any property alleged to be forfeitable in the indictment of that individual there is some indication that civil forfeitures may not abate under existing law united states v 10380 sw 28 th street borroto 214 f3d 1291 1294 11th cir 2000these abatement cases involving criminal defendants have never been applied to civil forfeiture cases under 21 usc 881a7 it is doubtful that the rationale which governs the decision in criminal cases would ever be applied to civil forfeiture 23 proposed 18 usc 3560b3aif defendant dies after plea of guilty or nolo contendere has been accepted or verdict has been returned and before sentence has been announced the court shall upon motion under subsection c2 by the government or any victim of that defendants crime commence special restitution proceeding at which the court shall adjudicate and enter final order of restitution against the estate of that defendant in an amount equal to the amount that would have been imposed if that defendant were alive s 149 does provide for victim notification for the appointment of representation of the deceased and relaxes deadlines accordingly proposed 18 usc 3560d yet silence greets the question of whether the court and probation officer must or may otherwise proceed as if the defendant were still alive 24 proposed 18 usc 3560c2a if defendant dies after being convicted in criminal case but prior to sentencing or the exhaustion or waiver of direct appeal the personal representative of that defendant the government or any victim of that defendants crime may file or pursue an otherwise permissible direct appeal petition for mandamus or writ of certiorari or an otherwise permissible motion described in section 3663 3663a 3664 or 3771 to the extent that the appeal petition or motion raises an otherwise permissible claim to i obtain in special restitution proceeding final order of restitution under subsectio n b3 ii enforce correct amend adjust reinstate or challenge any order of restitution or iii challenge or re instate verdict plea of guilty or nolo contendere sentence or judgment on which i restitution order is based or ii restitution is being or will be sought by an appeal petition or motion under this paragraph b if defendant dies after being convicted in criminal case but prior to sentencing or the exhaustion or waiver of direct appeal the personal representative of that defendant the government or any victim of that defendants crime may file or pursue an otherwise permissible direct appeal petition for mandamus or writ of certiorari or an otherwise permissible motion under the federal rules of criminal procedure to the extent that the appeal petition or motion raises an

does not apply when the defendant dies after all appeals have been exhausted but s 149 addresses the question it allows for the issuance or continuation of any protective orders designed to prevent dissipation of assets that might be used to pay restitution25 even more interestingly it seems to establish collection method reminiscent of forfeiture of estate and corruption of the blood if restitution has not been fully collected on the date on which defendant convicted in criminal case dies i any amount owed under restitution order whether issued before or after the death of that defendant shall be collectible from any property from which the restitution could have been collected if that defendant had survived regardless of whether that property is included in the estate of the defendant 26 the provision seems straightforward enough for property or property interests held by the defendant at the time of his death it becomes more intriguing for property or property interests that would otherwise have passed through the defendant to his heirs at some point after his death the constitution denies congress the power to punish treason with corruption of the blood or forfeiture of estate27 story lays out the background and reasons for the prohibition in his commentaries it is well known that corruption of blood and forfeiture of the estate of the offender followed as necessary consequence at common law upon every attainder of treason by corruption of blood all inheritable qualities are stroyed so that an attainted person can neither inherit lands nor other hereditament from his ancestors not retain those he is already in possession of nor transmit them to any heir and this destruction of all inheritable qualities is so complete that it obstructs all descents to his posterity whenever they are obliged to derive title through him to any estate of remote ancestor so that if father commits treason and is attainted and suffers death and then the grandfather dies his grandson cannot inherit any estate from his grandfather for he must claim through his father who could convey to him inheritable blood in addition to this most grievous disab ility the person attainted forfeits by the common law all his lands and tenements and rights of entry and rights of profits in lands or tenements which he possesses but this view of the subject is wholly unsatisfactory it looks only to the offender himself and is regardless of his innocent posterity it really operates as posthumous punishment upon them and compels them to bear not only the disgrace naturally attendant upon such flagitious crimes but takes from them the common rights and privileges enjoyed by all other citizens where they are wholly innocent and however remote they may be in the lineage from the first offender iii s tory commentaries on the constitution of the united states 17071 172 1833 some courts have suggested that the due process clause embodies comparable proscription against the use of forfeiture of estate and corruption of the blood as punishment for other 25 proposed 18 usc 3560d2dif restitution has not been fully collected on the date on which

interesting feature its amendments are effective with respect to any criminal case or appeal pending on or after july 1 2007 that is to crimes occurring prior to that date as long as the prosecution

convicted of qualifying offense which has as one of its elements such scheme conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity and 5 in the case of children the incompetent incapacitated or deceased legal

who suffer pecuniary loss proximately caused by the offense39 identifiable individuals and entities who suffer pecuniary loss as consequence of physical injury to another proximately caused by the offense40 the successors to any such direct or third party victims41 anyone the parties agree to in plea bargain42 and anyone otherwise provided by law43 like existing law hr 845 permits restitution

under existing law45 third in somewhat varied terms hr 845 admits to the possibility that faced with host of victims or an exceedingly complex factual environment full restitution for all victims need not be required46 perhaps the most obvious difference produced by hr 845s description of the victims entitled to restitution is its silence on the extent to which victims of misconduct collateral to the crime of conviction may be entitled to restitution section 3663a now requires restitution for limited class of individuals who are not victims of the defendants crime of conviction strictly speaking that is it recognizes as victim entitled to restitution any person directly harmed by the defendants criminal conduct in the course of scheme conspiracy or pattern if the offense involves as an element scheme conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity 47 under this provision victims of the same scheme but of different episode of the scheme than that for which the defendant was convicted may be entitled to restitution 48 there is comparable language in hr 845 the second major difference flows from hr 845s depiction of those who do not fit the traditional concept of primary victims but who are entitled to restitution nonetheless existing law treats victims estate as the victim if the victim is dead49 if the victim is child incompetent or incapacitated existing law allows the victims legal guardian member of the 45 proposed 18 usc 3663athe court shall order convicted defendant to make restitution for all pecuniary loss to identifiable victims proximately resulting from the offense 18 usc 3663aa when sentencing defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection c the court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the vic tim of the offense for purposes of this section the term victim means person directly and proximately harmed as result of the commission of the offense for which restitution may be ordered 46 proposed 18 usc 3663ethe court shall provide as complete restitution to as many victims as possible though not the full restitution to all victims otherwise required by this section to the extent the court finds on the record that 1 the number of

offense described in paragraph 1aiirelating to fraud and property damage offenses if the court finds from facts on the record that the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution

court appointed representative to assume the victims interest50 existing law also realizes that parents insurance carriers and other third parties who assume or provide compensation for the victims losses may be entitled to restitution51 hr 845 replicates the provision of existing law covering insurance carriers and similarly situated third parties and when restitution takes the form of inkind services52 but otherwise speaks simply of successors and those who suffer losses as result of physical injuries to another proximately caused by defendants crime 53 hr 845 makes express mention of the victims estate or representative or of the assumption of the victims rights some courts may feel that the change is intended to mean that the right of victims to restitution dies with them54 although their parents and estates may be entitled to restitution for related costs which they incur55 on the other hand it may be that the bill contemplates that the estate and heirs of deceased victim will be considered the victims successors and therefore entitled to restitution in the victims stead56 conversely at least in the case of human victims the classification of successors as victims may be intended to signal more than the fact that victims may assign their right to restitution if only during their lifetime57 hr 845 does classify as victims those who are otherwise provided for by law58

law treats the restitution for property losses in one way return andor payment of the lost value and the restitution for crimerelated physical injuries in another coverage of medical expenses costs of rehabilitation funeral costs when victim has been killed and the victims expenses relating to their participation in th investigation and prosecution of the qualifying offense 61 hr 845 essentially merges the two eliminating the distinction and expanding coverage it calls for restitution regardless of the nature of the crime fraud property damage or physical injury offenses62 its vindication expenses clause runs parallel to existing law but makes specific allowance to cover the costs of attorneys other than those employed by the government63 it carries forward the language under which restitution orders must include in the case of an offense resulting in the death of the victim an amount equal to the cost of necessary funeral and related services64 and it uses the same language to describe restitution for lost income medical expenses and the cost of rehabilitation with difference existing law makes them matter of mandatory restitution only with respect to offenses involving physical injuries hr 845 recognizes such distinction 65 as noted earlier hr 845 expressly repeals the individual restitution provisions now found in 18 usc 1593 human trafficking 2248 sexual abuse 2259 sexual exploitation of children 2264 domestic violence and 2327 telemarketing fraud66 since it extends mandatory restitution to all federal offenses the most obvious implication of the amendment is the change in the type of losses which qualify for restitution for instance the human trafficking sexual abuse sexual exploitation and domestic violence sections in existing law cover necessary transportation temporary housing and child care expenses as well as attorney fees generally 67 hr 845 only covers them when they are incurred during participation in the investigation and prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings relating to the offense68 the trafficking section also has an income loss calculation 61 18 usc 3663ab1 2 62 proposed 18 usc 3663c2 3 4 63 lost income and

hr 845 leaves as they stand the individual features of 18 usc 43c animal enterprise terrorism which authorize restitution orders covering range of economic damages that appear to be beyond hr 845s reach when hr 845 merges sections 3663 and 3663a into revised section 3663 it repeals sub silentio subsection 3663c which permits restitution order in favor of state victim assistance and drug agencies upon conviction for various controlled substance offenses with the merger hr 845 presumably intends to bring individual restitution laws such as 18 usc 228d failure to pay child support which continue to cross reference section 3663a within the coverage of the new section 366370 those laws define the losses for which restitution may be ordered solely by their cross references to section 3663a repealed by the bill since the bill provides for mandatory restitution upon conviction for any federal offense presumably including violations of 18 usc 228 and any other statute carrying similar obsolete baggage the failure to adjust the references to section 3663a may well be seen as harmless scriveners error

restitution order is laid out in 18 usc 3664 following conviction probation officer conducts an investigation collects information from the prosecutor victims and defendant and prepares report for the court which is shared with the parties 75 the court conducts hearing to resolve any questions relating to whether particular individual is victim entitled to restitution whether particular loss is one that qualifies for restitution and the specifics of the defendants ability to pay76 courtissued restitution orders may direct the defendant to pay in lump sum in installments inkind or in some combination of the three77 until full restitution is made the court may modi fy its order to reflect any change in the defendants financial circumstances78 the justice department contends that the role which the statute assigns to the courts impedes effective collection of restitution and has recommended amendments some circuit courts of appeal have interpreted one clause in 18 usc 3664f2 to require that mandatory payment schedule be set at the time of sentencing therefore the current legislative scheme impedes the effective enforcement of criminal monetary penalties including restitution the enforcement of restitution would be enhanced substantially if congress were to amend 18 usc 3664f2 to clarify that restitution is due immediately upon the imposition of restitution order another major change to the statute clarifies that payment schedule set by court at sentencing is only minimum obligation of the offender current 18 usc 3664f2 has undermined the efforts of the united states to enforce restitution because courts of appeal ve interpreted it to require the imposition at every sentencing of an exclusive courtimposed payment plan this limits the ability of the united states to enforce restitution using other available civil and administrative 72 analysis at 21 73 id at 223 critics might respond that deficiencies in federal environmental laws might more appropriately be considered in the context of those laws rather than as an aspect of general criminal law enforcement 74 proposed 18 usc 3663b1b 4 6 proposed 18 usc 3663ab1b 4 5 75 18 usc 3664a b d 76 18 usc 3664e 77

result district courts generally impose minimal payment plans upon the defendant that cannot thereafter be changed except by the court and upon showing of substantial change in the defendants economic circumstances letter at 1 the appellate decisions to which the letter alludes have held that the sentencing court must set any installment payment schedule it may not make restitution due and payable immediately when the defendant had realistic means of complying such an arrangement effectively transfers the district courts responsibility for setting restitution schedule to the probation office or to prison authorities which is inconsistent with the statute79 both hr 845 and s 973 amend section 3664 to meet the justice departments objections section 3664f now states that the court shall order restitution to each victim in full80 and the court shall pursuant to section 3572 specify in the restitution order the manner in which the schedule according to which the restitution is to be paid81 under hr 845 this language disappears and is replaced with statement that upon determination of the amount of restitution owed to each victim the court shall order that the full amount of restitution is due and payable immediately 82 furthermore the court may provide for payment in installments according to schedule83 and the attorney general may collect and apply unreported or otherwise newly available assets to the payment of restitution without regard to any installment payment provisions 84 all of which appears to mean that hr 845s amendments are intended to permit the court to establish payment schedule but to allow the government to formulate one if the court does not moreover the fact that the court has established payment schedule does not prevent the government from supplementing the effort with other collection measures taken without the need to seek the sentencing courts approval g18g155g142g156g142g151g157g142g151g140g146g151g144g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561

mandatory protective measures except under exceptional circumstances124 although s 973 neither expressly repeals nor amends rule 38e its amendment is rather clearly intended to supplant the rule in addition s 973 states that the issuance of such mandatory protective measures should not be construed as limitation on the authority of prosecutors to continue their restitutionrelated investigations and enforcement efforts125 the justice department materials describe the change but do not explain it126 to some extent the motivation is clear secure restitution for victims as quickly as possible and prevent the loss of any assets that might be used to pay restitution the materials do point out that in part the proposal for restitution pending appeal parallels the treatment of fines pending appeal under existing law127 but the two may raise different considerations for instance if defendant is vindicated on appeal the government can be compelled to return the amount the defendant paid in fines pending appeal128 on the other hand the government cannot be compelled to return amounts it recovered as restitution and passed on to victims even if the defendant is subsequently vindicated on appeal129 there is another difference the law permits court to forego imposition of fine when it might otherwise impose hardship thus court may refrain from imposing fine when defendant has insufficient resources to satisfy both fine and restitution obligations130 the sentencing guidelines state that the court need not impose fine where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine or imposition of fine would unduly burden the defendants dependents131 there are such ameliorating provisions in the law of mandatory restitution therefore the denial of stay pending appeal or an asset freeze pending appeal may impose greater hardships in the restitution cases than in fine cases the silence of the justice department materials may seem unfortunate in another respect the materials do not further identify the type of order described in subparagraph ban order limiting the enforcement of restitution obligations that may not intrude upon prosecutors authority to conduct investigations of the defendants finances conduct discovery record lien or seek any injunction132 it obviously includes stay pending appeal but the wording is 124 proposed 18 usc 3664f10b absent exceptional circumstances as determined by the court an order limiting the enforcement of restitution obligations shall i require the defendant to

under grand jury subpoena135 those statutes may be thought to proscribe disclosure beyond the grand jury absent some additional grant of authority there are statutory provisions which specifically proscribe bureau of prisons officials from disclosing to prosecutors information relating to an inmates ability to pay restitution s 973 grants the united states attorneys access without court approval to financial information on the defendant held by grand jury the probation office or the bureau of prisons in order to enforce restitution orders 136 the justice department has explained that the change is necessary because some district courts insist upon court approval before allowing prosecutors to examine probation officer reports on defendants financial condition 137 they do not

judicial asset freeze orders and other protective measures before conviction both before and after indictment153 the procedure draws upon and in part is modeled after the protective order features of the criminal forfeiture section of the controlled substances act154 in some ways the model may seem less than perfect fit the title to forfeitable property vests in the united states when the confiscationtriggering offense is committed155 restitution has comparable feature at the time of the passage of the controlled substance act property used to facilitate the commission of forfeituretriggering offense could be confiscated in civil proceeding upon showing of probable cause 156 and so it seems great step to say that the continued restitution is to be paid in consideration

authority to order the property confiscated civilly under the same probable cause standard restitution requires conviction of the property owner civil forfeiture does not157 restitution has civil forfeiture equivalent the controlled substances act permits the issuance of the protective order before the property owner has been charged with any offense158 so do hr 845 and s 973159 again in the

tools in the case of restitution the government is the beneficiary of confiscation the victims of crime are the beneficiaries of restitution victim is likely to feel the loss of restitution more sharply than the government will feel the loss of forfeitable property as for the availability of civil forfeiture equivalent proponents might note that under existing law authorities may use search

particular offense or can only be issued in the interest of justice163 they are not administrative commands but are courtissued protective measures and come with the prospect of judicial hearing to

departments guidance the text is sometimes perplexing the bills authorize protective orders generally165 and although they do not say so in so many words they clearly anticipate that protective measures will be available prior to conviction both before and after indictment166 they call for protective orders in the case of traceable property and in the interest of justice upon the governments

defined in section 3613 of the defendant that may be used to satisfy such restitution order proposed 18 usc 3664aa1 hr 845 the justice departments analysis of the proposal indicates that the department believes 1 that the paragraphs represent two distinct grants of authority not one grant with two elements each of which must be satisfied before the authority may be exercised 2 that the difference between paragraph and b is the difference between assets traceable to the crime charged and those that are not b 3 that the measures described in ai ii and iii all apply to traceable property 4 that the interest of justice standard applies to protective measures issued against property unrelated to the offense b property but not to the measures issued against traceable property property and 5 that the court is obligated to issue the protective measures sought under traceable property and subject to an interest of justice determination those under bany property 167 it does not explain the apparent duplication perhaps the most plausible explanation is that the two are available to the government at its option there might be some logic to the argument that the traceable property clause is meant to ap ply in preindictment cases and the allproperty clause b in postindictment cases after all read that way preindict ment orders those which might to held the more

the text fails to confirm such an interpretation when it refers to both pre and postindictment measures as those taken under subsection a1 of which both and b are part168 more compelling still is the text of the traceable property clause which authorizes protective measures for property traceable to the commission of the offense charged 169 the traceable property clause can hardly apply exclusivel to preindictment orders since prior to indictment there is crime charged the hearing procedure intended in postindictment cases seems to present further ambiguities it seems fairly certain that the bills mean to blish the following procedure courts would be authorized to issue an ex parte protective order upon probable cause showing that 1 the defendant had been indicted for an offense for which restitution might be ordered 2 that the offense or offenses had resulted in qualified losses to qualified victims of an approximate amount for which the defendant would be obligated to make restitution if convicted of the offense or offenses charged 3 the value of the property to be restrained or the amount of the bond to be posted did not greatly exceed the approximate amount of restitution that might be awarded and 4 perhaps the property is traceable to the offense charged defendant would be entitled to hearing upon prima facie showing that the value of property restrained or the amount of the bond greatly exceeded the amount of the restitution that could be ordered or that the law does not authorize restitution for the offense victim or losses claimed in the order or if the court relies on the traceable property prong of proposed section 3664aa1a that the property restrained is not traceable to the offense charged even then hearing could be granted only if the defendant could also show by preponderance of the evidence that the order had or would deprive him of defense counsel of his choice or deprive the defendant or his family of the necessities of life if the defendant is able to meet this burden or whatever reduced burden due process demands he is entitled to hearing at which the government may contest his challenge after which the court may modify its protective order should it find either 1 want of probable cause to believe that the restrained property or at least all of it would be needed to satisfy any restitution order under the facts of the case or 2 if the traceable property authority was relied upon want of probable cause to believe that the restrained property or some of it is traceable to the offense charged or perhaps or at least to the extent due process requires 3 that failure to modify the order would deny the defendant defense counsel of his choice or would impose an undue hardship upon the defendant or his family the above description seems likely what s 973 and hr 845 intend it is not literally what they state first s 973 states that the court shall issue protective order upon finding of probable cause to believe that defendant if convicted will be ordered to satisfy an order of restitution 170 it says nothing about the size of the an ticipated restitution order nor about the relationship between the value of the restitution that might be owed to the value of the property to be restrained hr 845 suggests this may have been an oversight for the only change it makes in s 973s treatment is to state that court shall issue protective order upon finding of probable cause to believe that defendant if convicted will be ordered to pay an approximate amount of restitution 171 hr 845 says nothing about necessary relationship between this approximate 168 proposed 18 usc 3664ab1 2 169 proposed 18 usc 3664aa1aiii 170 s 973 proposed 18 usc 3664aa1 171 hr 845 proposed 18 usc 3664aa1

of the property restrained but otherwise there seems little reason to make the change both bills note that once their probable cause standards have been met protective order covering traceable property may be issued neither bill indicates what level of certainty is required for finding that particular piece of property is traceable to an offense charged second both bills state that the defendant is entitled to hearing in which to seek modification of the ex parte order only if he shows by preponderance of the evidence that he has or will suffer hardship or lost defense counsel and if he makes prima facie showing that there is bona fide reason to believe that the courts ex parte finding of probable cause under subsection a1 was in error 172 the text of s 973 on its face limits the probable cause threshold to showing that the court erroneously concluded that if convicted the defendant could be ordered to pay restitution the defendant can literally overcome this obstacle only if he can show that restitution cannot lawfully be ordered because the offense is not one for which restitution may be ordered or because the case lacks either victims eligible for restitution or losses for which restitution may be awarded if this were all that was intended there would be reason to add the additional hardship threshold that s 973 imposes the same is true of hr 845 moreover in the case of hr 845 the defendant must show that the court erroneously concluded that probable cause existed to believe that the defendant if convicted will be ordered to pay an approximate amount of restitution 173 there is reason to insist on showing of an approximate amount of the possible restitution unless that determination somehow relates to the value of the property restrained if only very roughly exactly how much more is intended or must be intended is complicated by the unresolved question of what due process requires in the forfeiture context and as matter of statutory construction the supreme court indicated that the courts have choice but to issue protective order upon receipt of an ex parte government application following indictment even where the defendant seeks to use the assets to pay for legal representation 174 the court expressly left open the constitutional issue of when and what sort of hearing may be required as matter of due process175 the issue divides the lower federal appellate courts some hold that postindictment ex parte restraining order is only good for ten days with the possibility of only one ten day extension before probable cause hearing must be held 176 others find that although pretrial 172 proposed 18 usc 3664ab2b 173 proposed 18 usc 3664ab2b a1 174 we note that the equitable discretion that is given to the judge under 853e1a turns out to be discretion at all as far as the issue before us is concerned judge winter concludes that assets necessary to pay attorneys fees must be excluded from the restraining order for that purpose the word may becomes may not the discretion found in 853e becomes command to use that subsection and 853c to frustrate the attainment of 853as ends this construction is improvident whatever discretion congress gave the district courts in 853e and 853c that discretion must be cabined by the purposes for which congress created it to preserve the availability of property for forfeiture we cannot believe that congress intended to permit the effectiveness of the powerful relationback provision of 853c and the comprehensive any property any proceeds language of 853a to be nullified by any other

needed to retain counsel implicates the due process clause the trial itself satisfies this requirement177 the majority are somewhere in between but are particularly swayed when it appears that the order may reach funds needed to pay defense counsel178 third once hearing has been granted the bills state that an order may be modified if more property has been seized and restrained that may be needed to satisfy restitution order 179 they also permit modification if the court finds under subparagraph that probable cause exists as to some or all of the property 180 subparagraph hearing is conducted to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant if convicted will be ordered to satisfy an order of restitution and that the seized or restrained property may be needed to satisfy such restitution order 181 the italicized language suggests that some comparative analysis of the relative value of the assets frozen and restitution to be owed was necessary from the beginning when the court entered its ex parte order moreover although neither bill makes any mention of it either the text or due process will be construed to bar restraint of innocent assets those not traceable to the offense charged if needed to provide the necessities of life and perhaps if needed to retain counsel as for preindictment protective orders the bills declare that applications and orders are to be governed by 21 usc 853e and proposed section 3664a 182 this should probably be understood to say that proposed section 3664a governs in cases of conflict with section 853e prior to indictment section 853e requires th at the property owner be given notice and an opportunity for hearing 183 unless the government establishes by probable cause that the property will become unavailable if prior notice is given184 the bills seem to make the initial 177 united states v register 182 f3d 820 835 11th cir 1999 178 united states v holy land foundation ____ f3d _____

states the court may enter protective orders to preserve the availability of property which the government asserts is subject to criminal forfeiture prior to indictment if it finds that i there is substantial probability that the united states will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture and ii the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against

onerous alternatives190 at least on the face of things third parties may not continued united states without notice or opportunity for hearing when an information or indictment has not yet been filed

traditionally the federal courts will not enjoin the commission of crime unless expressly authorized to do so by statute192 as part of the comprehensive crime control act of 1984 congress enacted 18 usc 1345 which authorized th federal courts to enjoin the commission of mail bank or wire fraud193 over the years it expanded the authorization to encompass false claims against the united states conspiracies to defrauding the united states false statements in matter within the jurisdiction of federal agency or department securities fraud banking law offenses and health care crimes194 in 1990 it also authorize federal courts to freeze property derived from some of these offenses namely banking law or health care offenses195 hr 845 and s 973 each enlarge section 1345 to authorize both injunctions and freeze orders relating to any federal offenses for which restitution might be ordered196 their reach is somewhat different since their view of offenses for which restitution may be ordered is different for hr 845 it is any federal offense which proximately causes another pecuniary loss197 for s 973 it is the mandatory restitution crimes that is any federal crime of violence crimes of fraud or property damage proscribed in title 18 and product tampering198 as well as the discretionary restitution crimes that is any other crime proscribed in title 18 various aircraft safety and drug offenses and the environmental crimes that s 973 adds to the restitution list199 the justice department materials do not identify any particular reason why expansion would be necessary or useful the failure to expand the authority to enjoin wider range of criminal violations would not appear to have any obv ious restitution consequences expanding the authority to issue restraining orders does have restitution consequences but it is not clear what continued restitution 191 proposed 18 usc 3664ac3a except as provided in subparagraph b or paragraph 1 person other than defendant

paid immediately unless in the interests of justice the court authorizes an installment payment schedule 201 installment payments are to be scheduled to permit full payment as quickly as possible202 the defendant is obligated to inform the court of any change in his financial circumstances and the court may modify the order for payment accordingly203 following the pattern it uses for restitution s 973 eliminates the language that might suggest that the court has exclusive and predominant payment scheduling authority in its place appears language that instructs the courts to order that any fine or assessment imposed be due immediately 204 couches their installment payment scheduling authority in permissive may rather than mandatory shall terms205 and adds references to the special enforcement authority of the government206 as with restitution s 973 instructs the court to direct defendants to pay their fines and assessments as quickly as is reasonably possible avoid concealment or dissipation of assets or income notify the court of any change of address and notify the prosecutor of any change of address or financial circumstances 207 for purposes of fine and special assessment collection by virtue of s 973 prosecutors enjoy access without the necessity of court approval to financial information relating to the defendant and held by the grand jury probation office or bureau of prisons208 s 973 adds that the court may impose nominal payment schedules set at less than 100 per year where the defendants financial circumstances preclude more substantial payment 200

3572d8 210 proposed 18 usc 3572d5a the uncertainty flows from the fact that section 3613 does not have completely unambiguous statement of the termination of restitution obligation it does say that the liability to pay fine shall terminate the later of 20 years from the entry of judgment or 20 years after the release form imprisonment of the person fined or upon the death of the individual fined 18 usc 3613bemphasis added and it states that sections authority is available to the gove rnment for the enforcement of restitution orders 18 usc 3613f although some may argue that does not n ecessary mean the fine termination dates in subsection 3613b apply section 3613 treats them as if they do an order or restitution is lien in favor the united states the lien arises on the entry of judgment and continues for 20 years or until the liability is term inated under subsection b 18 usc 3613c on the other hand if the termination dates for fines and restitution orders are the same under section 3613 why does s 973 state that the court may modify its fine enforcement order up until the date for termination under section 3613 for restitution orders instead of for fines the most logical explanation may be this was simple drafting oversight the phrase in proposed section 3572d5a should read termination of fine obligation under section 3613 not termination of restitution obligation under section 3613 211 proposed 18 usc 3572d5g 212 proposed 18 usc 3572d5cthe court may direct the defendant to repatriate any property that constitutes proceeds of the offense of conviction or property traceable to such proceeds it is not clear why the court should not be authorized to order the repatriation of any asset th at might be used satisfy the obligation to pay fine 213 proposed 18 usc 3572d5demphasis addedin ordering restitution the court may direct the defendant to surrender to the united states any interest of the defendant in any nonexempt asset this too may well be drafting oversight where use of the word fine rather than restitution was intended the nonexempt assets refer to those that do not qualify for exemption under section 3613 that is assets qualify for the exemption under 26 usc 6334a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 and 12 of the tax laws 214 18 usc 3572d10a 215 18 usc 3572d10b 216 18 usc 3572d10c
