government and finance division summary the taxation of individual capital gains income is perennial topic of debate in congress taxes on longterm capital gains income were reduced in 1997 and again in 2003 the holding period to qualify for longterm capital gains treatment was reduced in 1998 this report provides historical information on the holding period maximum statutory tax rate and revenues from the taxation of individual capital gains income this report will be updated as legislative action warrants or as new data become available since the enactment of the individual income tax in 1913 the appropriate taxation of capital gains income has been perennial topic of debate in congress almost immediately upon enactment legislative steps were initiated to change and modify the tax treatment of capital gains and losses since 1913 at least twenty major legislative changes and countless minor changes have been enacted capital gains tax rates were last reduced in 2003 while the holding period to qualify for longterm capital gains treatment was reduced in 19981 in may 2003 the 108th congress passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 under this act the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains income was reduced to 5 0 for tax years after 2007 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 marginal income tax brackets the maximum capital gains tax rate was reduced to 15 for taxpayers in marginal income tax brackets exceeding 15 the act also repealed the special capital gains tax rates for assets held five years or longer these changes were originally effective for assets sold or exchanged on or after may 6 2003 and before january 1 2009 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 extended these lower rates through december 31 2010 1 see crs report 98473 individual capital gains income legislative history by gregg esenwein crs2 under current income tax law capital gain or loss is the result of sale or exchange of capital asset if the asset is sold for higher price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital gain if the asset is sold for lower price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital loss capital assets held longer than 12 months are considered longterm assets while assets held 12 months or less are considered shortterm assets capital gains on short term assets are taxed at regular income tax rates gains on longterm assets are taxed at maximum tax rate of 15 ideally tax consistent with theoretically correct measure of income would be assessed on real inflationadjusted income when that income accrues to the taxpayer conversely real losses would be deducted as they accrue to the taxpayer in addition under an ideal comprehensive income tax any untaxed real appreciation in the value of capital assets given as gifts or bequests would be subject to tax at the time of transfer2 obviously the current law tax treatment of capital gains income varies considerably from the ideal treatment under comprehensive income tax one response to this deviation from comprehensive approach to the taxation of capital gains income has been call for further reductions in the tax rates applicable to capital gains income one argument for lowering capital gains taxes has focused on the benefits of reducing lockin effects lockin occurs because the income tax liability on capital gains income can be deferred until the asset is sold tax deferral creates bias because individuals faced with large lumpsum tax are reluctant to sell their capital assets even though on pretax basis they could earn higher rate of return on an alternative investment this lockin effect tends to retard the efficient allocation of resources in the economy with tax considerations tending in some cases to dominate other market forces proponents of capital gains tax reductions argue that cutting capital gains taxes will reduce lockin effects and free up resources increase savings and stimulate economic growth and make the tax code less complex critics are concerned about the distributional effects possible tax shelter abuses and the revenue losses associated with reductions in capital gains taxes some commentators argue that reducing taxes on longterm capital gains will not reduce federal revenue but will in fact result in increased revenue it is argued that as taxes are reduced on capital gains lockin is reduced which increases realizations and investments in capital assets the net effect is to increase federal revenues although taxes on increased capital gains realizations would offset some of the initial cost of cutting capital gains taxes there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the unlocking effects it appears that over the longrun the revenue generated from an increase in capital gains realizations accompanying tax cut would not be large enough to offset the static revenue loss from the tax cut itself net revenue gain is also less likely under current law than it was in the past in part because the increase in realizations would be taxed at lower rates than would have been the case in the past 2 for more information see crs report 96769 capital gains taxes an overview by jane g gravelle crs3 the following two tables present background information that may prove helpful to policy makers as they debate the merits of further capital gains tax changes in the 110th congress table 1 shows the statutory maximum tax rates on both ordinary income and longterm capital gains income since the adoption of the federal individual income tax in 1913 this table also shows the holding period required for capital assets to qualify for longterm capital gains tax treatment two major observations can be drawn from the data in table 1 the first item is that with the exception of the first nine years the maximum statutory tax rate on long term capital gains has been substantially lower than the maximum statutory tax rate on other forms of income3 the second observation is that the current maximum statutory tax rate on longterm capital gains income is lower than it has ever been in the post world war ii time frame table 2 shows realized capital gains and federal individual income taxes paid on realized capital gains for selected years 1955 through 2002 it also shows cbo estimates of realized capital gains and taxes paid on capital gains for 2003 through 2016 3 the effective marginal tax rate the tax rate that taxpayer actually faces on both ordinary income and longterm capital gains income can be higher than the statutory tax rate because of the interaction of various other provisions in the tax code crs4 table 1 statutory marginal tax rates on longterm capital gains income 19132010 holding period for maximum tax rate on
