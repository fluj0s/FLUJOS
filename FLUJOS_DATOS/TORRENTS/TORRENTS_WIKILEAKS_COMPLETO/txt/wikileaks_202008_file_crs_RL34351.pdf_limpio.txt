world trade organizations wtos dispute settlement body dsb established single panel to consider charges against us farm programs brought in two separate but similar cases ds357 brought by canada and ds365 brought by brazil both cases make two charges against us farm programs first that the united st ates has exceeded its annual wto commitment levels for total aggregate measurement of support ams for agriculture in each of the years 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 and second that the us export credit guarantee program for agricultural commodities operates as wtoillegal export subsidy both charges stem in large part from previous negative ruling against us farm programs in case ds267 brought by brazil against the us cotton program in that case wto panel ruled the ruling subsequently was upheld by wto appellate body first that direct paym ents made under us farm programs do not qualify for green box exemption status b ecause of restriction prohibiting the planting of fruits vegetables or wild ri ce on payment acres and second that the us export credit guarantee program operates as prohibited export subsidy program because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their long run operating costs as result export cr edit guarantees are subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments for more information see crs report rs22187 brazils wto case against the us cotton program brief overview by randy schnepf canada and brazil claim that since they fail to qualify for inclusion in the green box us direct payments should be dded to its ams when calculating total domestic support in addition they also ch arge that the united states has improperly notified several of its fa rm support programs as exempt from the ams limit while several other programs were improperly excluded from u s notifications canada and brazil claim that when all of the outlays from these allegedly misnotified programs are included then the us ams total exceeds its wto commitment level the panel hearing the case is not likel to conclude its work until late 2008 should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to comply with wto ruling against the united

for domestic agricultural support programs second they charge that the united stat operates its agricultural export credit guarantee program in such manner as to provide prohibited subsidies to those exports made under the programs on d ecember 17 2007 the wtos dispute settlement body dsb announced the establishment of panel to hear both cases against us farm programs panel ruling is not expected until 2008 subsequent appeals of any negative ruling and disagreemen t over appropriate retaliatory levels etc could push resolution of the dispute well into the future however the importance of the

support programs and trade practices2 in 2005 after several years of wrangling over wheat trade issues canada extended its disagreement with us farm programs to the corn sector when canadian corn producers sought legal action for alleged unfair subsidization and dumping of us corn in canadian markets ca nadas international trade tribunal citt ultima tely ruled on the 2005 anti dumping and countervailing adcv duty case in favor of the united states3 however canadian corn producers continued to press their cerns upon the canadian government about perceived unfair subsidization of us corn in january 2007 canada requested cons ultations with the united states to discuss three specific charges against us farm programs 1 us farm support resulted in serious prejudice against cana dian corn

against the united states initiated by canadian corn producers starting in 2005 while the latter two allegations were based on previous wto ruling in case wto case ds267 brought by brazil against the us cotton program4 another potential factor motivating canada to bring its case against us farm subsidies was canadian domestic political concerns emanating from weak coalition government responding to pressure from cornproducing interests following the unfavorable citt adcv corn duty ruling in addition canada had general interest in influencing the 2007 us farm bill debate in favor of lower amberbox type support5 news report suggested that two additional factors motivating canadas case included the temporary susp ension of doha round negotiations july 24 2006 which indefinitely postponed the po ssibility of us farm program reforms under multilateral trade ne gotiations and the settlement of softwood lumber dispute between canada and the united states wh ich freed up canadian government trade attorneys to refocus on the wto litigation against us farm programs6 the request for consultations represented the first step in instituting wto dispute settlement case against the

least the end of the year pending the outcome of doha round trade negotiations9 however in june 2007 cana da requested that the establishment of wto dispute settlement panel to hear its case against us farm programs be included on the agenda of the next meeting of the wtos dispute settlement body dsb in its panel request canada dropped the serious prejudice charge against us corn subsidies probably in large part because corn market prices have risen so dramatically since mid2006 and were projected to remain high for at least the next ten years10 the united states blocked canada s request at the june 21 2007 dsb meeting according to wto rules panel can be blocked only once implying that second request by canada if made at one of the subs equent dsb meetings would have to be honored howeve r canada refrained from pur suing the establishment of panel to hear the case at the next several dsb meetings origins of brazils wto case brazil which has already won series of wto dispute settlement rulings against us cotton programs11 introduced its new challenge against us farm prog rams on july 11 2007 when it requested consultations with the united states to discuss the same two charges against us farm programs as in canadas case ds357 the context for brazils new challenge of us farm programs is significant first the new challenge builds on panel rulings from brazils successful case ds267 against certain aspects of the us cotton program previous findings in the case although not part of the final reco mmendations appear to have set legal precedent and could facilitate brazils new claims second the doha round of wto trade negotiations continues to make very little apparent progress after having resumed in september 2007 possibly providi ng further incentive to seek legal recourse under wtos dispute ttlement process rather than via negotiation12 third the us congress is presently revis iting omnibus farm legislation brazil has general interest in influencing the us farm bill debate in favor of lower amberboxtype support fourth canada d already initiated similar case brazil initially joined canadas case as an interested third party however brazil has since chosen to pursue its own separate but similar case news sources speculate that brazil did this in order to have g reater voice in the wto dispute settlement process13 furthermore

failed to resolve the dispute status of the two cases by late 2007 canada nd brazil appear to have coordinated their efforts as both countri submitted official requests on november 8 2007 for the dsb to add the establishment of panel to its next meeting agenda again according to the wto rules the united states blocked this new panel request at the november 27 2007 dsb meeting ho wever at its next meeting on december 17 the dsb announced the establishment of single panel to jointly hear both cases brought by canada ds357 nd brazil ds365 against us farm programs in their requests brazil and canada asked for si ngle panel to be established to consider both cases jointly the united states did not object to this proposal15 in accordance with the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes dsu16 once the establishment of panel has been announced the dsb has up to 45 days for panel to be appointed plus six months for the panel to conclude its work as result it is not likely that the panel once appointed will finish its work and issue final ruling before late 2008 major charges against us farm programs both the canadian ds357 and br azilian ds365 cases raise two principal charges against us farm programs each of these is discussed below first allegation us total dom estic agricultural support exceeds its wto limit in accordance with wto

terms and conditions of annex 2 of the agreement on agricultureunited states has notified details of its farm pr ogram outlays through 200518 according to us farm program spending notifications to the wto us domestic support outlays have rema ined well within us wto spending commitments19 however canada and brazil argue that veral us program payments were either omitted from the notification data or incorr ectly notified either as green box or as nonproductspecific ams where they would more easily qualify for exclusion from amber box limits under the nonproductspecific minimis exemption canada and brazil contend that when all of the di sputed payments and other subsidies are included in the us ams calculation then the total outlays would exceed the spending commitment in each of 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 the claim that the united states has exceeded its total spending limits hinges largely on previous ruling from the usbrazil cotton case in which wto panel found that us payments made under the production flexibility contract pfc and direct payment dp programs do not qua lify for the wtos green box exemption category because of their prohibition on pl anting fruits vegetables and wild rice on covered program acreage20 however the panel did not make the extension that pfc and dp payments should therefore be c ounted as amber box programs but instead was mute on this point in its wto notifications the united states has notified its pfc payments as fully decoupled and green box compliant21 this is an important distinction because the green box contains only nondistorting program payments and is not subject to any limit canada and brazil argue that because of the previous panel ruling pfc and dp payments do not conform with wto greenbox rules and should be included with us amber box payments furthermore canada and brazil argue th at several other u s program payments were incorrectly notified as exempt from the us ams limit these includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34351crs8 22 blue box payments are defined as productionlimiting types of payments for more information see crs report rl33144 wto doha round the agricultural

correctly notified as productspecific ams outlays in addition both canada and brazil ar gue that ccp payments established under the 2002 farm act pl 107171 should similarly be counted against the us amber box spending limit of 191 billi on in contrast the united states has notified ccp payments as exempt fro m ams limits under the nonproduct specific minimis exemption in addition as part of its doha policy reform proposal the united states recommends that ccp payments be eligible for the blue box where they would be subject to different limit than the amber box22 unlike canadas case brazil cited veral additional u s farm support programs that it claims were simply not notified ie they were omitted from inclusion in the us ams total these include both direct and guaranteed loans and usda farm loan programs programs exempting onfarm use of gasoline and diesel fuel from payment of various ex cise and sales taxes programs exempting us farmer s from taxes based on overall farm income eg deductions from taxable income from farming farm marketing and purchasin g cooperatives and ex port transactions of agricultural commodities and subsidies related to the operation and maintenance of irrigationworks by the us department of the interior canada and brazil charge that when pfc dp and ccp payments for all covered crops wheat corn grain sorghum barley oats upland cotton rice soybeans and other oilseeds as well as the additional program outlays that were excluded from us notifications are included in the uss amber box then the total outlays would exceed the spending commitment in each of 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 however neither canada nor brazil provide the specific details on its yearbyyear determinations so direct comparisons are not possible crs calculations based on us notifica tions and available usda data suggest that with the inclusion of the otherwis excluded pfc and dp the us ams total would exceed the spending limit in two of the years indicated figure 1

and brazil argue that the us export credit guarantee program operates as wtoillegal export subsidy in the usbrazil cotton case ds267 wto panel found that us expor t credit guarantees effectively function as export subsidies because the financial be nefits returned by these programs failed to cover their longrun operating costs23 furthermore the panel found that this applies not just to cotton but to all co mmodities that benefit from us commodity support programs and receive export credit guarantees as result export credit guarantees for any recipient commodity are subject to previously scheduled wto spending limits the panel recommended and was upheld on appeal that these prohibited subsidies be removed by july 1 2005 on december 18 2007 compliance panel found that the united stat had not yet fully complied with the panel ruling with respect to the ruling that export credit guarantees operate like illegal export subsidies compliance through policy reform would likely involve incorporating user fees that reflect the market risk associat ed with each loan guarantee for example this could be achieved by removing the 1 cap on user fees charged under the export credit guarantee program the 1 fee cap prevents charging marketbased fees and contributes to the export credit guarantee program operating as wtoillegal export subsidy both the senate and housepa ssed versions of the 2007 farm bill hr 2419 include changes to the export credit program including the elimination of the 1 cap on user fees in addition both bills reauthorize direct payments but without the decoupling recommended to achieve greenbox compliance us response in response to canadas request for cons ultations on us subsidies thenus secretary of agriculture mike johanns d eclared in early 2007 that the united states would vigorously defend us farm prog rams against any possible wto challenge by canada24 spokesman for the us trade representative ustr declared that it was disappointed at canadas and brazils requests the us official said that this dispute was an unnecessary diversion of resources and time from the doha round negotiations the official also stated that us farm programs were designed to be in compliance with its wto obligations and believed that the panel would agree the official also added that some measures identified by canada and brazil had ceased to exist five years ago prior to the 2002 fa rm bill and that others were not part of the consultations with canada all thr ee countries involved the united states canada and brazil have agreed that the meeting of the panel would be open to the public httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34351crs11 25 for more information see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne

as passed december 14 2007 with amendmentspotential implications and role of congress many market analysts suggest that the two recent cases brought by brazil and canada are harbingers of future challenges to us commodity programs if either country were to successfully pursue its cas it could affect most us program commodities since the charges against the us export credit guarantee program and ams limit extend to all major program crops should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to comply with wto ruling congress likely would be called upon to address this issue including adjus tment if not full removal of the planting restriction on base acres receiving direct payments ultimately congress is res ponsible for passing farm program legislation that complies with us commitments in international trade agreements when confronted with negative wto dispute ttlement ruling c ountry has essentially five options to choose from eliminate the subsidy reduce the subsidy to diminish its adverse effect revise the pr ogram function to reduce the linkage between the subsidy and the adverse effect referred to as decoupling pay mutually acceptable compensatory payment to offset the advers effects of the subsidy or suffer the consequences of trade retaliation while wto case can result in punitive sanctions being authorized the proceedings of formal case can take ma ny months and sometimes years to reach conclusion25 for example the usbrazil cotton case was initiated by brazils request for wto consultations on sept ember 27 2002 panel was established nearly six months later on march 18 2003 the panels final report was delivered to the dsb on september 8 2004 the case was appealed and the appellate bodys final report was adopted by the dsb on march 21 2005 nearly 30 months after the initial request for consultations26 subsequently brazil requested wto compliance panel to review whether the united states had fully complied with the panels rulings the wto compliance panel issued its final ruling on december 18 2007 thus extending the length of the us brazil cotton case to over five years congress is presently revisiting omnibus farm legislation27 proposed provisions in the house and senatep assed versions of the farm bill hr 2419 would bring the export credit guarantee program into compliance with wto rules by eliminating the subsidy component of export credit guarantees28 however neither version appears to address the issue surrounding the disqualification of direct payments from the wtos green box ams exclusion due to the planting
