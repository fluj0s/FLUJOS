services and vice versa and to boost economic growth in poorer regi ons of the world the united states has entered into free trade agreements and established preferential trade programs major challenges are preventing nonmembers or ineligible countries or products from benefitting and limiting the poten tial harm to us producers these challenges are addressed in part by explicitly or implic itly setting rules for determining the origin of each of particular categories of goods to ensure that benefits flow only to the appropriate trade partners andor only to the designated categories of goods made by partner or beneficiary country usua lly this is done by establishing rules of origin based upon one more or conceptual approaches th at have been developed to help designate category of products or particular item as the product of particular country or group of countries as unambiguously as possible because the united states is considering entering into other free trade agreements it may be instructive to examine the rules that are part of current agreements and preferential programs existing us free trade agreements and trade preference programs include the following the north american free trade agreement the united statesjordan free trade agreement the united statesisrael free trade agreement andean trade preference andean trade preference and dr ug eradication act caribbean trade preference caribbean basin trade partne rship act as amende d and subsaharan trade preference african growth and oppor tunity act agoa as amended the united states has signed proposed free trad agreements with chile and singapore based upon brief summaries of the free tr ade agreements and preferential trade programs listed above it is observed that if trade ag reement has broader coverage than trade preference program it does not necessarily indicate that it is more generous trade promotion vehicle with respect to textiles and apparel trade agreement is intended to generate reciprocal benefits whereas preference program is unilateral grant of bene fits to the intended benefici ary countryies however while recognizing this caveat it needs to be reported that the trade agreements cover textile and apparel categories more broadly than the preferential programs also major characteristic of rules of origin contained in all of the agreements and programs covered is that they tend to be very specific with respect to textiles and apparel one overall rule usually set out at the beginning of the relevant documents applies to textiles and apparel to the extent that the specific rules do not supercede it that rule requires that the value of materials produced in beneficiary country plus the direct cost of processing in beneficiar country must equal at least 35 of the total value of the article at its entry into the united states but up to 15 of the 35 may consist of the value originating in the united states thirdly all of the agreements and preferential programs make special allowance for handloomed handmade and folklore ar ticles as defined by consultation among or between the countries th is report will not be

4 also the bilateral trade agreement with vietnam which confers conditional normal trade relations ntr with that country has been supplemented by an agreement pertaining continuedtextile and apparel rules of origin in international trade1 setting and scope in moves to open foreign markets to us goods and services and vice versa and in some cases to boost ec onomic growth in poorer regions of the world the united states has entered into free trade ag reements and established preferential trade programs major challenges are preventin g nonmembers or ine ligible countries or products from be nefitting and limiting the potential harm to us producers in the form of improved opportunities for foreign pr oducers to sell in us markets there is tension between how much the united st ates wishes to open its markets and how much foreign competition us producers w ill face the agreements and programs explicitly or implicitly define rules for determining th origin of each of particular categories of goods to ensure that bene fits flow only to the appropriate trade partners andor only to the designated categories of goods made by partner or beneficiary country free trade agreements entered into by the united states include the north american free trade agreement nafta w ith canada and mexi co and individual country agreements with israel and jordan free trade agreements with chile and singapore have been signed2 preferential trade programs include andean trade preference andean trade preference and drug eradication act caribbean trade preference caribbean basin trade partnership act as amended and subsaharan trade preference african growth nd opportunity act as amended3 an important context of these agreements and programs is that textile and apparel manufacture has been shifting to developing countries with textiles and apparel accounting for large portions of thei r exports to developed economies in the last few decades because textile and apparel manufacture nd trade are important elements of developing country economies provisions regarding textile and apparel products are prominent in the agr eements and programs listed above4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31934crs2 4 continued exclusively to textiles and apparel us imports of those products from vietnam have increased markedly since vietnam began receiving the lower ntr tariff rates 5 this presentation of issues concepts and definitions is based largely upon more extensive discussion of such matters in crs report 92584e rules of origin and the north american free trade agreement by douglas karminbecause the united states is considering entering into other free trade agreements it may be instructive to examine the rules that are part of current agreements and preferential programs this report first presents the reasons for establishing rules of origin the issues involved and the approaches to establishing such rules it summarizes the actual rules used by several agreements and progra ms and then compares the rules of those agreements and programs the report provides minimal information on the trade agreements and programs other than the summaries of rules of origin for more extensive details on these agreements and programs see the list of selected crs reports on the last page of this report for discussion and analysis of the economics of textile and appare l production and of textile and pparel trade issues in general see crs report rl31723 textile and apparel trade issues the need for and approaches to rules of origin5 variety of issues arise in constructing trade agreements and preferential programs one is preventing nonmembers or ineligible count ries from benefitting another is the potential harm to us producers in the form of improved opportunities for foreign producers to sell in us markets in both cases there is tension between how much the united states wishes to open its markets and those of beneficiary countries and how much foreign competition will be faced by us producers consequently key challenge is to define exactly what constitutes the product of trade agreement member or what goods andor services qualify to benefit from preferential program usually this is done by establishing rules of origin in some cases such rules are designated as such but essentially are incorporated in stated criteria of eligibility for benefits the challenge is technical as well as political growing globalization of the world economy makes it difficult to identif the nationality of many products many products are an amalgamation of bor capital and material inputs from two or more countries systematic conceptual approach to deal with this is needed although economic interests usually force departure from strict approach as discussed below stated or implicit ru of origin are essential components of the agreements and programs such rules moreover will have continuing relevance inasmuch as the agreement on textiles and clothing under the aegis of the world trade organization provides for the phasing out of quotas effective january 1 2005 but not the phasing out of tariffs consequently it may be instructive to examine the rules that are part of current agreements and preferential programs for possible consideration nd comparison in future circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31934crs3 concepts and definitions basically four different pproaches have been deve loped to design rules of origin that as unambiguously as possible designate particular item as the product of particular country or group of countries or product of beneficiary country minimizing ambiguity usually means establishing extremely detailed rules in some cases the term rules of origin per is not used but such rules are implicit in stated criteria of eligibility for benefits the trade agreements and programs covered here use different approaches to defining origin most use two or more approaches some applying to only one category of articles there almost always are exceptions to the general approaches or rules the four basic approaches are as follows substantial transformation one or more manufacturing or assembling processes possibly involving the addition of new materials ch anges the character of good or class of goods thereby produc ing new or different product thus in the case of trade agreement origination generally is assigned if the application of manufacturing or assembling process changes the character of good or combination of goods thereby producing new or different pr oduct with different character in the case of preferential program eligibility for benefits is conferred if the product or product category undergoe s specified transforming process and specifically not conferred if it unde rgoes less transforming process change in tariff classification one or more manufacturing or assembling processes possibly involving the addition of new materials alte rs the product to the extent that its tariff classification changes for trade agreements origination is assigned if the application of manufacturing or assembling process alters the product to the extent that its tariff classifi cation changes for preferential programs eligibility for benefits is conf erred if the product is or was or is not or was not of specified tariff classification valueadded standard manufacturing assembling and materials newly included account for specified minimu m proportion of the products total production costs or value often measured by value added in the case of trade agreement origination is assigned if the application of manufacturing or assembling process andor materials newly included account for specified minimum percentage of the products production costs in the cas of preferential program specified minimum percentage of the value of the article at entry into the united states must be accounted for by the valu of materials produced in beneficiary country and included in the product plus the di rect costs of processing in that country critical process criterion specified key input is incorporated or specified key manufacturing process is performed for trade agreements origination is assigned if key input is incor porated or key manufacturing process is performed for preferential pr ograms it often is the case that product must contain one or more specified inputs or co mponents made in the united states variant of the critical process criterion the yarn forward rule of origin is used at least to some extent as an explicit or implicit general principle with respect to textiles and apparel by the trade agreements and preferential programs covered in this report albeit usually with exceptions in nafta textile product is consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31934crs4 as originating if the material used in each of the successive stages of fabricating textile products the yarn itself the fabric and the sewing thread originate in beneficiary country thus it is used to limit trade benefits to nafta countries only when used in us preferential programs such as the caribbean basin program the purpose of the yarnforward principle is to limit the extent to which intended beneficiary countries can inco rporate their own materials summaries of rules of origin the following table presents brief summaries of the explicit and implicit rules of origin provisions with respect to textiles and apparel in the following free trade agreements and preferential trade programs the north american free trade agreement

provisions are most important as noted earlier the trade agreements and programs covere d here use different approaches to defining origin and more than one of these agreements and programs use more

programs in terms of the breadth of inclusion of product cat egories that are afforded coverage in the trade agreement or preferential program and b in the case of preferential programs the extent to which the beneficiary countri labor capital and materials are allowed or required to add value to the product the comparisons are based only upon the summaries in the table in the preceding section moreover readers should be aware of the fact that the program by program descriptions below us less precise language than the summaries with respect to both bases of compar ison one should note that if trade agreement has broader coverage than trade preference program it does not necessarily indicate that it is more gene rous trade promotion vehicle trade agreement is intended to generate reciprocal benefits whereas trade preference program essentially is unilateral grant of benefits by the united states to the intended beneficiary countryies general comments the rules of origin in all of th agreements and programs covered tend to be very specific with respect to textiles and apparel at least in general all the agreements and preferential programs examined explicitly or implicitly use the critical process criterion approach to establishing rules of origin an overall rule usually appearing n ear the beginning of the relevant documents applies to textiles and apparel to the extent that the special rules do not supercede it that rule requires that the value of materials produced in beneficiary country plus the direct cost of processing in beneficiary country must equal at least 35 of the total value of the article at its entry into the united states but up to 15 of the 35 may consist of th value originating in the united states while recognizing the caveat in the second paragraph of this section the trade agreements cover textile and apparel categories more broadly than the preferential programs all of the agreements and preferential programs make special allowance for handloomed handmad and folklore articles as defined by consultation among or between the countries and permit eligibility for trade benefits while not specific to textiles and pparel it should be noted that all the agreements and preferential programs require that good behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31934crs10 imported directly into the united states from party to an agreement or from specified beneficiary count ry to qualify for trade benefits specific comments north american free trade agreement in so far as textiles and apparel are concerned nafta appears to have ve ry broad product cove rage with provisions related to very wide variety of type s of textile and appa rel goods including textile endproducts other than apparel there are provi sions specifically related to yarn to fabrics to appare l and to nonappare l textile products the yarn forward rule of origin principle applies quite broadly and nonnaftaorigin fiber to produce the yarn is allowed in super majority of instances however special rules of origin regarding fiber origin or s ubstantial transformation apply to several categories of apparel such as mens dr ess shirts nightwear womens underwear and silk and linen apparel in general and ch ange in tariff classification is required in nearly all cases at the individual product vel nafta went into effect january 1 1994 usjordan free trade agreement the usjordan fta appears to have broader pr oduct c overage than nafta here too there are separate provisions related to yarn fabrics pparel and nonappare l textile products but there seem to be fewer exceptions or special requireme nts affecting product type groups and the exceptions tend to include items rather than exclude them however considerable preference had already been accorded to jo rdan indirectly through the usisrael free trade agreement usifta this was expanded in sc ope in late 1996 to encompass among other things qualifying industrial zones between israel and jordan which produce predominantly apparel leading to large increase in exports of apparel from jordan to the united states the usjordan fta went into effect in december 2001 proposed ussingapore free trade agreement the ussingapore fta appears to have very broad produc t coverage with fewer specifications pertaining respectively to the broad cat egories of yarn fabr ic apparel and non apparel textile products than is the cas with nafta or the usjordan fta however it is similar to nafta in that lthough there is general principle of yarn forward change in tariff classification is required at the indi vidual product level in high percentage of cases relatively broad exception provides that limited yearly amount of textiles apparel containing nonus or nonsingaporean fiber yarn or fabric may qualify for dutyfree tr eatment the agreement must be approved by the senate andean trade preference program the andean trade preference and drug eradication act title xxxi of p l 107210 amended the
