federal holidays which are legally applicable only to federal employees and the district of columbia neither congress nor the president has asserted the authority to declare national holiday which would be binding on the 50 states this report discusses the history of each federal holiday and explains its rationale where public record exists federal holidays evolution and application summary by law congress has established 11 permanent federal holidays although frequently called national holidays these patriotic celebrations are only applicable to federal employees and the district of columbia the states individually decide their own legal holidays congress in several instances created federal holidays after sizable number of states had taken such action in others congress took the lead each action emphasizes particular aspects of the american heritage that molded the united states as people and nation the first five congressionally designated federal holidays were new years day

to extend holiday coverage to federal employees outside washington decoration day now memorial day and labor day became federal holidays in 1888 and 1894 respectively the first allowed civil war veterans in federal employ to pay their respects to those who gave their lives in the conflict without losing days pay the second was designed to honor american labor and foster the feeling of brotherhood among the different crafts congress created the armistice day holiday in 1938 to mark the close of world war i hostilities in 1954 the scope of this holiday was broadened to honor americans who fought in world war ii and the korean conflict and the name of the holiday was changed to veterans day although thanksgiving day was included in the first holiday bill of 1870 it was not until 1941 that congress specifically designated the fourth thursday of november as the official date quarter of century later congress made inauguration day permanent holiday in the washington dc metropolitan area eliminating the necessity of acting upon this matter for each inauguration the monday holiday law of 1968 shifted washingtons birthday memorial day and veterans day from their traditional dates to mondays and established an additional holiday in honor of christopher columbus observing these holidays on mondays it was felt would substantially benefit the nations spiritual and economic life by commemorating christopher columbuss remarkable voyage the nation honored the courage and determination of generation after generation of immigrants seeking freedom and opportunity

federal holidays evolution and application since 1870 more than 1100 different proposals have been introduced in congress to establish permanent federal holidays only 11 however have thus far been approved although these patriotic celebrations are frequently referred to as national holidays legally they are only applicable to federal employees and the district of columbia neither congress nor the president has asserted the authority to declare national holiday that would be binding on the 50 states each state individually decides what its legal holidays will be creating holiday for federal employees does however affect each state in variety of ways including the delivery of mail bank transactions and business conducted with federal agencies congress in several instances declared federal holidays after being prompted by earlier action in sizable number of states in other instances congress took the lead almost without exception approval of the 11 current federal holidays emanated from earlier unsuccessful efforts each was designed to emphasize particular aspects of the american heritage that molded the united states as people and nation this report discusses the history of each federal holiday and explains its rationale where public record exists first holidays when congress enacted the first federal holiday law in 1870 there were approximately 5300 federal employees working in washington dc and some 50600 in other locations across the country1 the distinction between federal employees working in the district of columbia and those laboring elsewhere proved important because the initial holiday act was only applicable to the federal workforce in the nations capital federal employees in other parts of the country apparently did not begin to receive holiday benefits until 18852 new years day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day the act of june 28 1870 which was apparently prompted by memorial drafted by local bankers and business men provided that new years day independence day christmas day and any day appointed or recommended by the president of the united states as day of public fasting or thanksgiving were to be holidays within 1 finance remarks in the house congressional record vol 2 march 7 1874 p 2053 2 23 stat 516 crs2 the district this legislation was drafted to correspond with similar laws of states around the district3 and in every state of the union4 washingtons birthday when congress in january 1879 added george washingtons birthday to the list of holidays to be observed in the district of columbia the principal intent of that resolution was to make february 22 bank holiday5 although there is indication in the authorizing statutes of 1870 and 1879 or in the accompanying floor debates that any federal employees were to be paid for such holidays an analysis of holiday legislation subsequently signed by president rutherford b hayes in april 1880 seems to support such conclusion this legislation was prompted by grievance filed by group of employees who had been denied holiday pay for the previous new years day while other federal workers had been paid for the day the house committee which favorably reported the bill stressed that while there were existing laws requiring such payment this group of employees in the committees opinion should be placed upon an equality in this regard with those of other government departments the committee went on to point out that on the question of legal holidays the revised statutes of the united states were silent but those relating to the district of columbia were very precise on the issue the implication was that the other federal employees in the district had already been paid for the holiday6 such reasoning is substantiated by an opinion issued by acting attorney general james c mcreynolds in august 1903 mcreynolds indicated that for many years prior to 1870 it was customary to close the executive departments of the government at washington on five holidaysnew years day george washingtons birthday independence day thanksgiving day and christmas daythat had been declared to be such by district laws7 3 rep burton c cook holidays in the

general of the united states washington gpo 1906 vol 25 p 43 crs3 this practice mcreynolds reasoned must have been known to the congress and it must have been that those days were declared public holidays only by laws applicable to the district as consequence mcreynolds concluded that congress intended with the 1870 and 1879 statute to designate all days made holidays by any law in effect within the district of columbia to be such for employees of the federal government as well8 this was done even though congress as late as the turn of the century had yet to enact legislation absolutely requiring that the executive departments of the government to be closed and the clerks and other employees therein to be released from work on such days9 in 1885 congress approved additional legislation making the five holidays thus far approved also applicable to per diem employees of the government on duty at washington or elsewhere in the united states10 this act apparently for the first time extended at least limited holiday benefits to federal employees beyond the shores of the potomac river enactment of the monday holiday law11 in 1968 shifted the commemoration of washingtons birthday from february 22 to the third monday in february contrary to popular belief neither the monday holiday law nor any subsequent action by congress or the president mandated that the name of the holiday observed by federal employees in february be changed from washingtons birthday to presidents day decoration daymemorial day decoration day now memorial day was added to the list of holidays to be observed in the district and in turn by federal employees in 188812 the joint resolution was probably adopted primarily because sizable number of federal employees were members of the grand army of the republic an organization of union civil war veterans who desired to participate in memorial day ceremonies honoring those who had died in the conflict their absence from work meant the loss of days wages it was felt they should be allowed this day as holiday with pay so that they might not suffer loss of wages by reason of joining in paying their 8 ibid pp 4344 9 ibid p 45 10 23

observance of memorial day was permanently changed from may 30 to the last monday in may labor day an entirely different rationale prompted the house committee on labor to report favorably legislation for labor day to become federal holiday in 1894 the use of national holidays the committee reasoned is to emphasize some great event or principle in the minds of the people by giving them day of rest and recreation day of enjoyment in commemoration of it by honoring labor with holiday the committee suggested the nation will assure that the nobility of labor be maintained so long as the laboring man can feel that he holds an honorable as well as useful place in the body politic so long will he be loyal and faithful citizen16 with time the committee felt the celebration of labor day as national holiday on the first monday in september would naturally lead to an honorable emulation among the different crafts beneficial to them and to the whole public it would also tend to increase the feeling of common brotherhood among men in all crafts and callings and at the same time kindle an honorable desire in each craft to surpass the rest reasonable amount of rest and recreation makes workman more useful as craftsman providing further support for its position the committee pointed out that 23 states had already recognized labor day as legal holiday17 armistice dayveterans day when armistice day was declared federal holiday by congress in 1938 the date november 11 was chosen to commemorate the close of world war i during the house debate preceding passage of this legislation it was suggested that armistice day would not be devoted to the exaltation of glories achieved in war but rather to an emphasis upon those blessings which are associated with the peacetime 13 rep henry b

approval of all of the societies representing world war i veterans20 in 1938 armistice day was already state holiday in 44 states and the other four states had made it holiday by gubernatorial action although it was recognized that congress did not have the authority to fix national holiday within the different states21 enactment of this bill it was felt would bring congress into harmony with sentiment in the united states22 by 1954 however the united states had been involved in two other military engagements world war ii and the korean conflict instead of creating additional federal holidays to commemorate the ending of these hostilities congress felt it would be better to commemorate the sacrifices of american veterans all on one day on june 1 1954 the name of armistice day was officially changed to veterans day23 this legislation did not establish new holiday rather it broadened the significance of an existing holiday in order that grateful nation on day dedicated to the cause of world peace may pay homage to all of its veterans24 fourteen years later congress designated veterans day to be one of five holidays that would henceforth be celebrated on monday and changed the date of the holiday from november 11 to the fourth monday in october25 congress returned veterans day to its original november 11 date in 1975 after it became apparent that veterans organizations opposed the change and 46 states either never changed the original observation date or returned the official observance to november 1126 18 rep bertrand w gearhart armistice day remarks in the house

george washington issued the first proclamation calling for day of public thanksgiving and prayer on thursday november 26 1789 six years later washington called for second day of thanksgiving on thursday february 19 1795 not until 1863 however did the nation begin to observe the occasion annually that year president abraham lincoln issued thanksgiving proclamation requesting citizens in every part of the united states and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourned in foreign lands to set apart and observe the last thursday of november as day of thanksgiving during the next three quarters of century each president by proclamation established the exact date for the celebration each year27 beginning in 1870 thanksgiving became paid holiday for at least portion of the federal work force after congress gave the president power to designate day of thanksgiving which was to be holiday within the district of columbia28 the tradition of celebrating thanksgiving on the last thursday in november begun by president lincoln in 1863 was faithfully followed each year but two until 1939 that year president franklin d roosevelt proclaimed the third thursday in november as thanksgiving day29 by moving thanksgiving up week roosevelt hoped to aid retail business by producing longer christmas shopping season30 although roosevelts decision was greeted enthusiastically by the business community others including sizable portion of the public as well as large number of state officials protested against changing the longstanding american tradition of celebrating thanksgiving on the fourth thursday in november despite this criticism roosevelt repeated his action in 1940 by may 1941 however the administration concluded that the experiment of advancing the observance date had not worked31 law signed by president roosevelt on december 26 194132 settled the dispute and permanently established thanksgiving day as federal holiday to be 27 robert j myers

day inauguration day became permanent legal holiday in the washington dc metropolitan area quarter of century later the legislation which was signed into law by president dwight d eisenhower on january 11 1957 also provided that whenever inauguration day fell on sunday the following day would be considered legal holiday34 traditionally schools in the area district of columbia montgomery and prince georges counties in maryland arlington and fairfax counties in virginia and the cities of alexandria and falls church virginia had been excused on inauguration day for several previous observances of the event as well inaugurations arrangements had been made for the federal employees to be given holiday in order that they might observe the historic and important activities associated with the inauguration with the passage of this statute the necessity of acting upon this matter for each inauguration was eliminated35 monday holiday law congress approved the monday holiday law in june 1968 to provide for uniform annual observances of certain legal public holidays on mondays and established legal public holiday in honor of christopher columbus36 prior to the passage of this legislation washingtons birthday was observed on february 22 memorial day on may 30 and veterans day on november 11 the act changed the dates of these holidays to the third monday in

great majority of americans support for the proposal was expressed by such major business groups as the chamber of commerce of the united states national association of manufacturers national association of travel organizations and national retail federation there was also substantial support from the labor community expressed by such organizations as the american federation of government employees aflcio government employees council international amalgamated transit union and national association of letter carriers in addition the department of labor the bureau of the budget the department of commerce and the us civil service commission all endorsed the idea public opinion polls conducted in connection with the proposal indicated that almost 93 percent of the persons polled

obstacles with remarkable determination by commemorating his voyage to the new world the nation would be honoring the courage and determination which enabled generation after generation of immigrants
