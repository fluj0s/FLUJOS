congress is deciding whether to continue to protect the ecosystem of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr or to open it to oil and gas development with good prospects of finding economically recoverable amounts of oil new preliminary report by the us geological survey usgs presents broader assessment of economically recoverable oil than included in the usgss 1998 study but not necessarily more favorable or unfavorable the coastal plain of alaska just east of present oil production sites is the virtually undisturbed home to wide variety of plants and animals this 1002 area is part of the arctic national wildlife refuge created in 1960 the refuge was expanded and made offlimits to oil and gas development in 1980 explicitly to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity and for other purposes the large fields to its west suggest that the potential for oil could extend into the 1002 area reprocessed seismic data from the 1002 area supports this suggestion of oil potential in anwr1 this report examines new usgs report in context apart from the broader controversial issue of whether to seek oil in anwr the usgs 1998 report several assessments of oil and gas resources in anwr have been made over the years of varying nature and scope the most recent study of oil and gas prospects in the refuge was that done by the usgs us department of the interior in 1998 usgs scientists gathered new data from nearby fields both onshore and offshore and examined reprocessed seismic data collected in the refuge in 19841985 usgs published detailed report on the oil and gas potential in 19992httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21170crs2 3 the report appears to indicate misunderstanding of the fact that most but not all of the native lands are outside the 1002 area but are within the refuge some of the native lands are geographically on the coastal plain but outside the 1002 coastal plain area that was articulated in response to 1980 legislation usgs appears to have meant that it studied and now is addressing native lands within the refuge 4 for further discussion of legal complications see crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge 5 for discussion of current legislative proposals on anwr see crs issue brief ib10094 arctic national wildlife refuge legislative issues updated regularlyin the 1999 report usgs estimated that there is 95 chance that there are at least 43 billion barrels bbls and 5 chance there are at least 118 billion bbls of technically recoverable oil recoverable with current technology but ignoring costs in the federal 1002 area with mean estimate of 77 billion bbls see table estimated economically recoverable amounts are smaller the usgs estimated that if the price of crude oil is 24 per barrel 1996 dollars there is 95 chance of at least 203 billion bbls and 5 chance of 94 billion bbls or more of economically recoverable oil in the federal 1002 area with mean estimate of 52 billion bbls in addition estimates of economically recoverable oil increase if higher price is used and decrease with lower price after the september 11 attacks and the associated brief and mild increase oil prices ranged between 18 and 20 in midmarch 2002 the price was about 24 per barrel prices can be expected to continue to fluctuate native lands and state waters while the usgs in 1998 studied assessed and prepared estimates for larger area than the federal 1002 area its published report included estimates of economically recoverable oil only for the federal area the study covered adjacent lands beneath alaska state waters to the 3mile line and native lands within the 1002 area as well as the federal portion of the 1002 area3 because of the close proximity of these lands it can be argued that more complete assessment data on the nonfederal areas may be useful in policymaking decisions regarding anwr alaskan natives have various property interests related to the issue of oil drilling in anwr that may present complex legal issues for refuge management if the coastal plain is opened to oil and gas exploration and development4 over 100000 acres of anwr some within the legal description of the 1002 area are owned by alaska natives either individually or collectively between and within groups of natives there is disagreement over whether to open anwr and the 1002 area to oil and gas exploration and development regulation of development on these lands is problematic and often is not considered explicitly in legislative proposals5 the usgs 2002 report in brief march 2002 designated as preliminary usgs presented assessment data in way that allows readers to deduce its estimates of the amount of economically recoverable oil in adjacent lands beneath alaska state waters to the 3mile line and native lands within the 1002 area this was done by presenting figures for the federal 1002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21170crs3 6 usgs frontier areas and resource assessment the case of the 1002 area of the alaska north slope by emil d attanasi and john d scheunemeyer usgs open file report 02119 march 2002 the report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity to usgs editorial standards and stratigraphic nomenclaturearea alone and the totals for the entire study area usgs presents these figures along with its previously published estimates of technically and economically recoverable oil in the federal 1002 area6 thus it appears that usgs estimated that there is 95 chance that there are at least 15 billion barrels bbls and 5 chance there are at least 42 billion bbls of technically recoverable oil in lands under state waters adjacent to the federal 1002 area and in native lands with mean estimate of 27 billion bbls see table similarly it appears that usgs estimated that if the price of crude oil is 24 per barrel 1996 dollars there is 95 chance of at least 09 billion bbls and 5 chance of at least 37 billion bbls of economically recoverable oil in the nonfederal 1002 portion of the study area with mean estimate of 24 billion bbls from the above it can be concluded that adjacent state waters and native lands account for about one fourth of the assessed resources in the usgs study area however as noted by usgs although significant accumulations may exist under state waters and in native lands they will be difficult to develop without access to federal landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21170crs4 probability of the presence and recoverability of oil in
