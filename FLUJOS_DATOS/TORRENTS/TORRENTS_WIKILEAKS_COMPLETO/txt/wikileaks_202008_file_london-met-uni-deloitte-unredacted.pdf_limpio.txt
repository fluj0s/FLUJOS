appointed by ndon metropolitan university lmu the university or you under th terms of our letter of engagement dated 27 july 2009 and subsequent chang orders dated 27 august 2009 and 19 october 2009 in march 2009 the higher education funding council for england hefce announced that it was to claw back 365 million of funding provided to lmu covering the academic years 200506 to 20070 8 we understand that within the sector the level of the claw back from lmu i s considered to be unprecedented to this extent both hefce and lmu commissioned independent reviews to understand the issues inv olved and to learn lessons for the future as result you instructed us to undertake review between augus t and october 2009 in respect of the governance and data quality arran gements in place at lmu in relation to the submission of data returns to the he fce 12 structure of this report this report is set out as follows in the remainder of this section 1 we set out the background to our work the work performed and the limitations on the use of this report at section 2 of this report we set out our executive summary section 3 of this report sets out the governance and management arrangements for the data returns to hefcepreparing the data returns to hefce focusing on the data quality arrangements and section 5 summarises our key findings and sets out areas of improvements that the university may consider implementing as the report is confidential and for lmu we have assumed that th ere is some prior knowledge of the circumstances and we have focused this report on relevant key points of our review we would be happy to provid more detailed note on the background if you would find this helpful 13 background lmu was created in august 2002 by the merger of london guildha ll university and the university of north london we understand that post the merger poor industrial relation s at the university added further complexities to what was already cha llenging agenda for the university in particular one of the key factors of the merger was that there would be compulsory redundancies and therefore i n the early stages of the merger there were number of positions tha t were duplicated we discuss below one of the key objectives of the newly formed uni versity that of widening participation and the implications this d on funding by hefce 131 widening participation one of the key objectives of the university was to promote the widening participation agenda the purpose of this objective was to allo w students from different social and financial backgrounds to have the op portunity to attend university london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 3private confidential we understand that two of the key consequences of the implementati on of this objective were students attending lmu included students whose families and relatives had prior experience of higher education and th ose who were from financially constrained backgrounds we understan d that lmus higher than average student dropout rate 30 is attr ibuted to this student profile intake further we have seen evidence tha t whilst other universities have widening participation objective s the student dropout rate for lmu was still higher than that of comparable universities and where students did manage to complete their degree we were informed in our interviews that the average time taken to comp lete three year under graduate degree programme was 42 years we understand that one of the main reasons behind the university s extended degree completion time was the movement of students from full time to part time with some students even opting to postpone their studies for short period we were informed that these two consequences of the widening participation objective had significant funding implicatio ns for lmu as discussed below 132 funding universities receive funding from variety of sources and on of the largest sources of funding is received from the government through hefce this funding is provided only for students who are permanently resi ding in the uk the amount of funding received by universities from hefce is determined through two data returns submitted annually as set ou t below higher education students early statistics heses return reports on the projected student numbers in the current academic year and includes forecast of the number of students who are likely to be studying on courses at the university from the point of submission to the end of the academic year 31 july the return is submitted in january using the census date of 1december andhigher education statistics agency hesa return provides retrospective report for the prior academic year on the stude nts who have been deemed to have completed their course there are specific definitions that universities must follow to determine th number of students who have completed their course funding completion hefce monitor that universities are following the funding co mpletion definitions appropriately and that data returns are submitted accurately by the following two methods performing an annual comparison between the two data returns tolerance limit 5 is set and any divergence beyond this will result in hefce taking action to bring the university to within the tolerance band this may be through reduction in student numbe rs or by adjusting their funding claw back and undertaking on seven year cycle basis an audit of the data returns of all universities in 2008 hefce changed their audit cycle to every five years in the case of lmu number of audits were conducted by hefce thes are set out below heses 03 audit was the first audit undertaken in june 2004 and reviewed the university heses 03 return the final audit report was issued to the university in august 2004 heses 04 audit was undertaken in june 2005 to review the heses 04 return and the progress on the recommendations from the heses 03 audit the final audit report was issued to the university in september 2005 heses 05 audit was undertaken in march 2007 to review the heses 05 return and the progress on the recommendations from the heses 04 audit the final audit report was issued to the university in may 2007 london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 4private confidential 142 scope methodology detailed audit was undertaken in february 2008 the review wa s limited to determining appropriate noncompletion rates to rep lace those included by the university in heses05 heses06 subject t any final detailed changes and inform those for heses07 the final audit report was issued to the university in april 2008 nd as result of risk assessment undertaken by hefce bdo stoy hayward was commissioned by hefce to undertake an independent review in july 2008 this independent review co vered the periods covered by the previous audit and the heses 07 ret urn as result of the latter two audits in february 2009 the hefce b oard confirmed claw back in funding to lmu of 365 million cover ing the academic years 200506 200708 we understand that the funding claw back relates predominant ly to inaccuracies within lmus data returns in respect of particular indivi dual students who were reported to have completed their planned stu dy modules for the year but had not done so noncompletions 14 work performed 141 objective the objective of our review for lmu is to identify the underlying r easons as to why the control and assurance processes appear to have failed to alert the university board to the nature scale and potential financial imp lications of noncompliant data returns submitted to hefce and hesa the review is in respect of the data returns made by lmu to hefce and hesa during the annual reporting periods between 200506 to 200708the scope of our work entailed reviewing the following areas as discussed with and identified by the university reviewing the arrangements for compliance by both the lmu board and the designated officer with the terms of the financial memorandum and the audit and accountability code assessing the internal management reporting arrangements responsibilities and key controls in respect of data compilat ion analysis and submission of statutory returns reviewing the board and subcommittee structure terms of reference reporting arrangements and the information flo w to the board and the subcommittees from management reviewing the risk identification and management and the operati on of the university risk committee and corresponding risk monit oring at governor level reviewing reports from internal and external audit and reviewing the management of the contractual funding relation ship with hefce we also agreed with lmu that we would work with sir david melvill who was appointed by lmu to act as an independent advisor to the board of governors at lmu sir david melville has worked closely with us on this review and we understand that he will also write summary report on the work he has performed london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 5private confidential based on the scope agreed with the university we structured our r eview on two key themes governance management arrangements and dat quality arrangements as set out below governance management arrangements request and read relevant board minutes request and read relevant subcommittee minutes identify the level of scrutiny and challenge at the board and sub committees review the terms of reference for the board and the sub committees identify understand and report the

hefce returns identify areas of policy uncertainty and with the support f data analytics identify key deficiencies in data fields and recor ds and analyse the causes of key data quality issues in addition sir david melville received significant number of emails and additional information from current and former members of staf f at lmu in respect of the areas under review on confidential basis sir david provided us with this material however the subject matter of som of these emails was outside the scope of our review and we have therefor only considered relevant information which is within the scope of th is review 143 approach our work was based on the following interviews with key individuals from lmu and hefce appendix 1 reviewing relevant documentation provided by lmu and that available in the public domain appendix 2 undertaking detailed data testing appendix 3 and provision of draft report to the board secretary of lmu and sir david melville to confirm its factual accuracy 1artpack refers to process mapping technique used to represent acti vities and processes graphically london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 6private confidential 144 limitation of the work performed this report sets out our findings based on work performed up to 3 november 2009 we cannot rule out the possibility that had furthe r work been conducted our findings might have been different or that w may have identified additional matters to bring to your attention our report has been discussed and the factual accuracy has been confirmed by the university secretary and sir david melville for the purposes of this report save where we have been able to corroborate information we have had to assume that the documents or other information including electronic material disclosed to us are reliable and complete our investigation was heavily dependent on the co operation and honesty of the people to whom we spoke and the completeness nd integrity of the documentation that we reviewed moreover ma ny of our findings are based on circumstantial rather than direct eviden ce this report should be considered in that light and we cannot accept any lia bility for our findings being prejudiced through provision of incomplete or unreliable information or material we have not discussed with the persons named or referred to in th is report our conclusions based on what they or other individuals concerned have told us where those conclusions may be critical in nature we have not given such persons the opportunity to respond to those criticisms in draft w do not consider it appropriate to do so given the nature of the report but w ish this to be clear to any subsequent reader we did not conduct general review of the controls within lmu the control weakness points noted in this report are simply those w hich came to our attention during the course of our work they are not intended t be exhaustive or comprehensive list of all the control weaknesses that may exist moreover our work should not be construed as an audit t he control weaknesses that we identified were those existing at the time of the vents that formed the subject of our investigation our work was designed to focus on areas identified by lmu this work was not designed to id entify all circumstances of fraud or other irregularity if any that may exist15

extracts from it to any third party without our express permission london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 8private confidential we have separated our detailed findings into two key main areas namely 2 executive summary deloitte was engaged by london metropolitan university lmu to per form review between august and october 2009 of the governance and dat quality arrangements in respect of the hesa and heses data re turns submitted to hefce for the academic years between 2005 and 2008 the scope and objectives of our review were set out in our engagem ent letter on 27 july 2009 and change orders dated 27 august 2009 and 19 october 2009 as part of this independent review we agreed with lmu th at we would work alongside sir david melville who was appointed by lmu to act as an independent advisor to the board of governors at lmu we have set out below our key findings in respect of the governa nce and data quality arrangements for further details see section 3 and 4 f this report 21 key findings from our review of documentary evidence and interviews with key individuals we have identified number of weaknesses in respect of t he hesaheses data returns these can be summarised into three ke main areas these are as follows awareness of the definition used for funding completion key members of staff at lmu were aware that they were not applying the definition literally to hefce guidance governance and management arrangements these were not operating effectively particularly as governors were not always informed about key issues and quality of data there were problems with the underlying quality of data that was used for the hesaheses data returnsgovernance and management arrangements and data quality arrangements these are as follows governance management arrangements as early as 2003 certain members of the executive group senior management team and senior members at the university were aware that the definition for funding completion used was not in line with the hefce guidance in an email dated the 24 may 2004 from one of the senior members involved in the preparation of the returns it stated that if the definition is applied literally this wo uld be disastrous for the university our review of the meeting minutes from the various committee s and our interviews identified that the university used wide var iety of terms for noncompletions there was little clarity provided to other staff members and in particular to the governors as to what these meant in 2005 presentation was given by the director of finance to the board highlighting hefce funding completion methodology ou r review of the meeting minutes has not identified any clarifica tion of how the university was dealing with this despite this being very topical area of discussion in the sector we were informed that the university used mechanisms which improved the amount of funding it received from hefce these included orecruiting as many students as possible oallowing students to progress academically and count the students towards funding completion when they were considerably below the statutory amount of credits and onot cleansing the data before submitting the data returns london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 9private confidential we could not ascertain from our review of the minutes of committe meetings the level of scrutiny and challenge and the amount of time spent on each area however we were informed through our interviews that the agenda and papers at most committees were extensive and therefore it was difficult to go through all issues in detail within the time allocated we understand from our review of committee minutes and from our interviews that data quality concerns were discussed at various committees but these have not been addressed significantly by members of the committees there was overreliance on the external assurance mechanism s as opposed to internal assurances processes risk registers did t highlight the risks associated with the definition used by the university in respect of the hesa and heses returns and their implications on funding for the university we understand from our interviews with lmu and hefce that the relationship between lmu and hefce was good until hefce commissioned bdo stoy hayward to undertake an independent review hefce conducted number of audits but significant concerns were only raised and highlighted when the bdo stoy hayward report was published in january 2009 data quality arrangements our review has highlighted that formal policies and procedure s were not in place in respect of the period considered oto govern the complete and accurate preparation and timely submission of returns oto manage changes to the course master data oto ensure that appropriate management information was given to inform the executive oversight on returns to be submitted to hefceothat data validation reports produced by the hesa validation tool were investigated and rectified in timely manner prior to the submission of the returns oto log instances where there were data quality weaknesses that were identified and raised by the university staff members and also monitor that they were rectified in timely manner and oto manage change applied to the sits2systems and the sql script whistle blowing process was in place within the universit to support the escalation of concerns around adherence to hefce guidance but from our review we understand that this was not used an independent review of the returns compilation process was t performed by internal audit our review has identified control weaknesses and process ine fficiencies in number of areas in the period under review these include d oan inefficient admissions and enrolments process oweaknesses in the system controls around the module selectio n process and recording of module intentionality of students othe attendance monitoring and recording of student withdrawal s between the academic years 200304 to 200708 is not complete and therefore insufficient oan inefficient process to detect review and remove redundant data from the sits system and oa lack of validation routines to identify conflicts between key data fields which were used to identify students that were counted towards funding completion 2information system used for recording all information abou t student activity modules courses student information london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 10private confidential the university used computer based scripts written in sql to prepare student data for the data returns however formal policies and procedures were not in place to manage risks around unauthorise d or inappropriate changes being made to these scripts after consideration of withdrawals and fe students the sql scr ipt used the progression data field to determine whether students statu s was funding complete where the funding completion was not determined it automatically defaulted the student records to f unding complete status the guidelines in place to determine and record if student is fu ndable or not based on domicile has not operated effectively the fee status field was used inappropriately to determine the mo of study of student in 0708 automated tools were not in place within sits to monitor and report to management on data quality deficiencies during the period under review automated programs were used to cleanse and overwrite data fields within sits these have not be reviewed by lmu to ensure that they are functioning as intende d the university had not reviewed the functionality in the sits sy stem used to create the initial tables used to subsequently prepare hesa data to confirm that such functionality was in line with uni versitys expectations as well as ensure that the required level of data quality was established in the sits system to support this functional ity london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 11private confidential 3 governance management arrangements our review of the governance and management arrangements withi n lmu focused on reviewing five specific areas these are as follows funding completion committee minutes and papers data quality risk management relationship with hefce we have summarised below in the relevant subsections our findi ngs in each of the specific areas these have been gathered from our interviews of current and past staff members of lmu and hefce appendix 1 and our review of key documentary evidence in particular the minu tes of key committees and groups appendix 2 whilst the focus of the review primarily covered the academi c period 200506 to 200708 we have also considered certain data and vidence from the academic years 200203 when lmu was created from the rger of the london guildhall university and the university of nort h london to 3 november 2009 we ascertained current arrangements to establ ish any specific changes and progress that has been made by the univers ity as result of the issues identified the period under investigation for this review is from 2002 when the university was created to 3 november 2009 31 funding completion in this section we discuss the university understanding of the definition used for fun ding completion and the actually methodology used by the univers ity the awareness of funding completion and some of the mechanisms devices used by the university to improve funding received by the universityfor the purpose of this report we use the terms funding complet and funding completion interchangeably 311 definition used by lmu we were informed during our interviews by members of the executive group see appendix 1 for membership that throughout the period under review they kne w that the definition used by the university for funding completio n in the data returns was not in line with hefce guidance that the definition used by lmu was that if student progresse d on to the next stage then the student could count towards funding completion we have also seen evidence that this definition was used by the university there was clear understanding by certain members of the executive group some of the senior management and junior staff members connected with the data returns that if the hefce guidance was applied literally to lmu there would be seriou s implications for funding the vice chancellor in post during the period under investigation had strong belief that given t he widening participation agenda and the socialdemographic mix of students it would not be practical for lmu to follow the hefce guidance literally and lmu was amongst group of universities which held the same view but at stage did lmu think that it was significant outli er with respect to this group we have seen evidence and been informed by members of the execu tive group that the deputy vice chancellor wrote to hefce in 2004 about the application of the funding completion definition in this letter the u niversity provided examples of students who w ould be excluded from fundi ng if hefce rules were applied strictly london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 12private confidential hefce responded by letter to the university stating that in it s view the examples that were described in the letter were unlikely to be counted as noncompletion in the context of an audit review we understand from our interviews with number of the executive group members they now accept the examples provided did not demonstrate what they wa nted to share with hefce during the period under investigation we have also seen evidence that the university used computer based script sql script to extract data from the sits system to generate an initial download of data to prepare thehesa and heses return from our review of the sql script and its revisions we have noted that there was difference in how the university thou ght it was determining students as funded complete and what was being extracted by the sql script further details of the issues resulting from this script and the revi sion made to it during the period under investigation are summarised in sec tion 4 of this report and in appendix 4 312 awareness of the issue we have noted the following from reviewing the minutes of the v arious committees and groups and the interviews there were range of terms recruitment retention early walkers dropouts withdrawals and wastage used in re lation to student numbers which had relevance to the funding completion issue these terms were not explicitly defined in the papers or minutes and there was lack of understanding of what these terms meant and their relation to the implications on funding for the universi tywe were also informed during our interviews by number of the cur rent and former governors that they could not recollect being informed in detail about the rules for funding completion prior to the events leading up to the significant claw back of funding in february 2009 and any instances of where the members of the executive group and senior management had informed them of the hefce definition of what constitutes student as funded complete and the consequential impact on the funding received by the universi ty however we have also seen evidence of presentation given b the director of finance to the board in october 2005 on the hefce fun ding methodology the presentation and the minutes from the meeti ng show that only students who have completed all their relevant modules can be counted by hefce for funding completion and that if student fails to complete one of hisher assessments all teachi ng activity is disregarded an explanation of the hesa and the heses returns and the importance of both regarding the university funding stream but explanation of the definition followed by the university and that the minutes did not record any questions or discussion i n relation to the presentation we have also seen evidence that the other committees regularly r eceived reports both on student recruitment in line with lmus widen ing participation objective these reports highlighted the probl ems with student retention examples of these reports are as follows in june 2003 the board discussed report from the vice chancellor which highlighted that 33 of students at london metropolitan university failed to complete their course in comparison with national average of 17 and london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 13private confidential earlier that year the academic board commissioned review by an external body into reasons for differing retention rates for simi lar students at the precursor institutions of london guildhall univ ersity and the university of north london our review of this report confirmed lmu and the respective predecessor organisations dropout rates as being higher than other universities benchma rked in the report we have seen evidence from the review of the minutes of retent ion progression and achievement group rpag that in september 2003 concerns about the definition of non completions and the forthcoming 2003 heses return and in april 2004 member of the rpag raised concerns about whether there was consistent application of terminology and coding in relation to funding completions across the univer sity we have seen evidence in either of the two examples above that t his issue was escalated to any other committee or group or that the i ssues were followed up at the next rpag meeting in addition to the above examples we have been provided with emai ls that were sent to number of the members of the executive group and sen ior management team during the period 20 october 2003 to 13 july 2 004 highlighting the lack of congruence between the application of the funding completion definition at the university and the hefce definiti on an email dated 18 may 2004 states that if the definition is applied literally this would be disastrous for the university there is evidence from either the documentation available or t he information gathered during the interviews that these email s were discussed at the weekly executive group meeting despite numbe r of the members on that group being copied into the emails313 devices used we were informed by one of the members of the executive group tea mthat number of devices were used which improved the amount of fun ding that lmu received from hefce we have discussed this with the wider senior management team and were informed that they believed that these wer widely used within the sector we have been informed that these so ca lled devices included increased intake there was recognition that the university has high number of early walkers and high dropout rate to counter this the university had policy to recruit as many students as possible during september and october to help increase the numbers recording on the heses return cleansing data we were informed that the sits system was not proactively cleansed throughout the year to ensure that any students who may have left the university were removed the heses return therefore contained data which was not cleansed at the end of the academic year when the hesa return was prepared it also contained data which was not cleansed when the two returns were compared as both contained data which was not cleansed there was little difference between the returns hefce allows tolerance level between the two returns and the university benefited as it did not have to reimburse hefce with any excess monies outside the tolerance set by hefce progression we were informed that full time students could academically progress on less than 120 credits and the universi ty counted this as funding completion students who obtain less than 120 credits under hefce guidance cannot be assessed as funding complete and london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 14private confidential module intentionality the sql extract discussed earlier used progression data field to determine whether students st atus was funding complete where this data field was not populated it automatically defaulted the student records to funding complete status the university also allowed students to choose more than the statutory 8 modules 15 credits each and therefore for s ome students the number of credits was considerably greater than 120 credits see section 4 and appendix 6 for more details 32 committee minutes and papers in this section we discuss the content of the committee minutes and papers whether hefce reports were tabled at the appropriate committees and the time allocated to committees from our review of the minutes of key committees we found that the minutes did not have sufficient detail for us to ascertain the leve l of discussion that was taking place there was evidence that any discussion resulting from the rev iew of any of the minutes from other committees for example the minutes of the board of governors do not include discussion resulting from review of the audit committee minutes that are routinely presented and most of the committee meetings which were held on quarterly basis had one and half hours allocated to take into considera tion large agenda and set of papers we also reviewed the terms of reference of the audit committee and n oted that the audit committee should have received all relevant reports we noted thatthere was evidence that all the hefce reports were presented to the audit committee for example heses 03 and heses 05 audit reports were not presented to the audit committee and annual reports made reference to any of the hefce reports r discussions about the funding claw back issue which is contr ary to hefce guidelines 33 data quality concerns in this section we discuss whether key staff members were aware of data quality concerns and whether any reports were commissioned t identify and address data quality concerns we have been informed by both current and previous staff members we interviewed that it is widely accepted throughout the univers ity that there were and to the current day data quality issues present within lm u and its predecessor institutions these were number of reasons for the data quality issues and these are covered in more detail in section 4 of this report from our interviews we were informed that members of the execut ive group and the senior management group were aware of the issues w ith data quality and the potential impact of these on the reported returns to hefce in addition we were informed by some of the governors that the were aware of data quality issues but they were not aware of the impl ications and the impact of poor data on funding we have not seen any evid ence of any significant actions that were undertaken by the universi ty london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 15private confidential from our review of internal audit documents and from interviews we noted that internal audit plans were discussed initially with the director of finance and the university secretary then presented to the audit committee for further discussion and approval and none of these internal audit plans included reviews of data qual ity or the processes for determining income streams such as the he sa and heses returns an internal audit report on student retention was commissione d to assess the extent to which the existing strategy and systems contributed towards the retention of students and the adequacy of management information for monitoring student retention an d decisionmaking purposes this report identified that there were systems in place however these were not yet effective as arrangements for monitoring and reporting progress against pl ans had not been agreed and each of the annual internal audit opinions for the period unde r investigation highlighted that key controls procedures and risk management arrangements were generally operating satisfacto rily with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable but not bsolute assurance there was work agreed by the audit committee in relation to funding completion or data quality and therefor there were specific references to any of these issues in the annual internal audit opinion we have also been informed that committee was responsible for reviewing the quality of da ta throughout the university until 2008 in 2006 the academic board raised concern about the accuracy of data for monitoring purposes however it was not until 2008 that data quality group was set up to improve student record data as prioritythe data quality group established in 2008 was disbanded earli er this year to be replaced by the creation of project board to improve the quality of the data in the hesa and heses return and despite the establishment of the data quality group we have been informed that concerns remain about the quality of data the results of our data analysis see section 4 show limited improvement in data quality since the merger 34 risk management in this section we discuss risk management arrangements the university had in place nd how the university captured its risks in its risk register having reviewed the risk register we noted they included the risks that poor retention levels could lead to reduction in income and potential reputational damage and that changes in government policy funding mechanisms for teaching of widening participation could lead to reduction in income nd there was evidence that the issues and subsequent risk of university income reducing identified within the hefce audit reports were added to the university risk register in addition we were informed by the governors that they were awa re in december 2003 of some minimal potential claw back as result of lmu exceeding hefce percentage tolerances levels however this was n ot added to the risk register this we understand from our interviews with the members of the exec utive group was as result of the fact that the risk register contained nly those risks that would have an impact on the university risks associate d with its strategic objectives and did not focus on operational risks london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 16private confidential whilst operational risks were not updated onto the risk regist er we also noted through our interviews and review of documents supplied t committee meetings that governors were not always informed abo ut issues as highlighted earlier in section 32 governors did not receiv the heses 03 and heses 05 audit reports we were also informed from interviews with the executive group and the governors that assurance on risks and issues were gained thr ough the use of external audits and reviews such as those completed by hefce we have seen evidence or we have been informed that during 2005 governors effectiveness review was undertaken which look ed at the board of governors structure and its reporting committees one of th outcomes of this review was the reduction in the number of governors duri ng 2006 we have seen evidence that in 2008 the audit committee raised cerns about the basic training needs of governors and that the role of the audit committee regarding risk management and governance needed to b clearly defined we have been informed that some training s been provided but there is recognition that further action needs to be u ndertaken 35 hefce we have set out in this section number of key points in relation to he fce that provide some context to this review and its findings we were informed from interviews with members from the executive g roup senior management team and governors that hefce adopted light touch regulatory framework with audits being conducted on seven year cycle audits were not as indepth in the earlier years of the period under investigation and the earlier audits undertaken at lmu did not raise significant issues given that hefce had conducted number of audits at lmu within the seven year cycle period we understand from our interviews that hefce had concerns with the lmu data and the data returnswe understand from interviews that the application of the hefce fund ing completion guidance was not applied literally by other univers ities and so lmu was not alone in applying different methodology we have been informed that hefce representatives were informed about this iss ue at regional meetings and the issue was raised nationally in 2004 b peter knight former vice chancellor at university of central england we have seen evidence that his general criticism at the time was that the funding completi on definition assumes linear progression and it does not fit with the policy requirement for widening participation and flexible m odes of study and the view held was that if the definition was applied literally then it would not fund many students in post 92 universities hefce has informed us that it has sought to clarify the funding com pletion rules on number of occasions as result of the complex nature of the rules we have been informed by the executive groups members and gover nors at lmu and representative from hefce that there was good relationship between the respective bodies however this relationship deteriorated after hefce commissioned bdo stoy hayward to undertake an independent review the bdo report and the findings in thi s report were strongly refuted by lmu with respect to the bdo report we have been informed that the lmu board felt that the bdo report was not factually correct and it was not an independent report as it was managed by former member of the hefce audit committee thereby reducing its credibility as an independent report we under stand hefce maintains that the bdo report was independent and their view is that it accurately reflects the findings w have been informed that subsequent discussions and meetings have occur red between london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 17private confidential representatives from hefce and lmu to address and settle the disagreement over the bdo report from our interviews with the executive group and the governors we were informed that proposed changes to the bdo report were not accep ted or considered by hefce and the bdo report was in the view of some executive group and the governors at lmu defamatory further we have been informed by some of the governors and nior management from lmu who attended these meetings that additional agreements have been made which have in the view of lmu not bee n fulfilled by hefce hefce has informed us that such binding agreements were made by them whilst there are personal notes of the various meetings that lmu and hefce have as evidence to the discussions we have been informed th at only the minutes from the meeting on 1 july 2008 were shared after th meeting the personal notes from the other meetings were not shared and there is evidence that matters and issues were agreed by oth er parties london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 18private confidential 4 data quality arrangements we segmented our review of data quality arrangements to focus on four specific areas these are as follows organisational level student records management reporting it system control we have summarised below in the relevant subsections our findi ngs in each of the four specific areas these have been gathered from our i nterviews and data analysis which allowed us to map the processes under ach of the four specific areas the detailed data analysis and supporti

out at an organisational level three key areas of weaknesses these weaknesses relate to lack of formal policies and procedures in relation to the hefce data returns an ineffective w histle blowing

accountabilities in addition concerns were raised as earl as 2003 and 2004 around the noncompliance with hefce completions gui dance which did not receive appropriate attention and action this was despi number of executive group members and senior management being aware of the matter further we noted that of five heses and four hesa sign off sli ps reviewed one return was inappropriately signed

informed that whistle blowing policy exists we id entified through our interviews that the process was not used this was particularly evident by the fact that sir david melville has received siderable amount of information emails and letters raising concerns in number of areas from staff members these concerns should have been made through an appropriate whistle blowing process in addition we hav

restricted lists of modules were available for selection but th is is in line with the provision of the undergraduate scheme as highlighted in section 313 under module intentionality our analysis also identified that first year first semester and full tim students were automatically assigned to modules which they may not necess arily have signed up to for given academic year this process was also app lied to continuing students for the full time students we were informed th at this is likely due to the student following compulsory programme wh ere there is limited benefit in student signing up this has an impact on the number of modules for which student was registered as per the students record exceeding the number of credits allowed for an academic year our analysis on student data for the period under investigation ide ntified that more than 1000 student course instances over the period from 2003 to 2008 were registered for modules totalling more than 180 credit s within an academic year in the majority of cases these are legitimate whilst there are significant number that are not legitimate see appendix 6 for detailswe were informed by number of the interviewees that prior to subm ission of return the university performs review to identify if stude nt can be deemed as withdrawn however we have also been informed that th ere were specific guidelines to support this the profiling of student end dates for withdrawals and suspensions reflected large peaks between september and november each acad emic year which suggests that withdrawals are processed in batch on an

not in line with the hefce guidance we note from our interviews and our review of the hefce audit re port presented to the audit committee that there was lack of congr uence between the hefce definitions and lmus interpretation and appli cation we were also unable to ascertain from the minutes the level of scrutin and challenge that may have occurred at the various committee etings in the context that dropout rates of around 30 were reported in this period with noncompletion rates being reported of between 37 there s hould have been sufficient significant challenge and scrutiny by th some of the executive group meetings and the senior management team to understand why there was significant difference between the two sets of figures while we accept the two sets of figures do not necessaril measure the same data there is some correlation and the large difference b etween the two sets of figures should have alerted more challenge and sc rutiny it is not unusual to have two tier system of governance within u niversity in the case of lmu the first tier is the executive group and the second er is the governors of lmu we understand from our interviews that there wa s significant distance between the two tiers to enable the governance and management arrangements to be effectiveand the information from the interviews from which we understand that governors were not always informed about issues by certain mem bers of the executive group and the senior management team it was also apparent that issues that were being raised by senior members of staff to the executive group were not being addressed or even di scussed at the executive group meetings this was evidenced by the emails date d between 23 october 2003 and 18 may 2004 that demonstrates concerns by nior team members of the executive group we also understand from interviews that there was overreliance on external audits and reviews such as those undertaken by hefce mo st universities have internal assurance mechanisms in place to addr ess known risks and issues comprehensive risk register which iden tified operational risks and the controls to mitigate these risks would hav helped lmu develop

production and reporting of the hesa and heses return was completed by two key departments we noted that members within thes etwo departments were pivotal to the production of these returns and according to interview comments there was lack of congruen ce and communication between the departments the university failed to address this problem and consequentl we found through our review lack of accountability and responsibili ty taken by the members within these departments this was not helped by the fact that over the last seven years both of these departments had numbe r of different managers given the critical nature of these two departm ents this should have been addressed and we understand this still remains an issue for the university london metropolitan university data

control weaknesses and proces s inefficiencies in the admissions and enrolments process to the r eporting of data to hefce on the hesa and heses returns these directly impacted on the quality of the

given bove the increase in the noncompletion rates between 20067 and 2007 8 and despite the noncompletion rates in early years being low as identified in section 131 of the main body of the report the drop out rates were significantly higher it should also be noted that students are funded at student cour enrolment sce level and this means that they are funded for ach year they study and complete in course the numbers represented in the table above and sub sequent tables represent students on courses during the perio d and not distinct students ie student who is on two fundable courses is fundable twice and th us will appear in the student return twice london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 33private confidential sits system noncompletion sensitivity analysis we obtained an extract of the sits source data from the university fo r five academic periods to undertake some sensitivity analysi s the objective of this exercise was to use sits source data in order to appraise the extent to whi ch certain characteristics of activity per the sits source data m ay have been contributing to noncompletion rates this highlevel appraisal thus aimed to provide further understanding of the noncompletion rate b ase line we have used the sits source data provided as at 24082009 our wo rk is limited to this data as historic representation of data can be provided thus we can only use the data in the sits system at this date this means that data which has been retrospectively populated cleansed or subsequently changed will be reflected as at the date of extract as result the data provided to us cannot be re conciled to figures reported on the hesa returns previous table t the time however given that the data is likely to have been updated since the return wa s made our analysis should provide more up to date reflection of actual information we have reconciled the data provided to record counts produced from the l ive sits system with material difference we have not reconcil ed the sits source data provided to data used in any other reports about lmu as this was outside the sc ope of our review we note that each area of analysis has been performed in isolatio n and thus student may appear in multiple categories below in ord er to approximate the records of potential relevance to the return an exclusion of records was performed in line with key components in the hesa table above with the resulting profiled data set being used for our analysis 20034 20045 20056 20067 20078 sits students h 38430 37650 36421 34733

of the profiled source data we identified the categories which were having significant impact on i ncreasing th level of non completions these were as follows students registered for insufficient credits as identified in tab 4 and students with zero credits for all modules as identified in tabl 5 students with zero credits for all modules the reason for th is could be the extent of data capture ie the system does not re adily capture the reason for this london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 36private confidential appendix 4 sql script 1 history of the sql script used to determine funding completi ons fundcomp the sits system has an embedded process which calculates the req uired fields for the student returns the funding completion fiel d in this initial calculation is based on students progression code which is data entry field in the sits system thus because this data field is not created appr opriately by sits in line with hefce guidelines on completion sql script was developed by the univ ersitys it department with assistance from the sits system ad ministrator to overwrite the data populated initially in this field prior to 20072008 the univ ersity did not conduct detailed exercise to verify that the sql code used was providing an accurate representation of completions founded upon hefce guidelines we obtained and reviewed the sql script used for the 20062007 hesa return to determine funding completions we were informed that this code has been in u since 1999 and was previously used at the university of north l ondon we were informed by the sits system administrator that the sql script was modified to be used at lmu in 2003 and minor amendments were made annuall in relation to changes in guidance and academic changes in 20062007 significant cha nge was made to the definition of noncompletion removing the d efault of fundable completion from the code initially funding completion value was set based on the prog ression code in the sits system in the table below we have describ ed the steps that were performed in the sql script during the various academic years academic years 20032004 to 20052006functionality performed by the sql script to determine fund ing completion the sql script performed the following steps 1 student is not funding completed if they have left for reas on other than successful completion completion or exclusion and they have left before 31st of may in the academic year 2 student is not funding completed as they are not returnab to heses as they are an fe student 3 student is not funding completed if they have left the univer sity for various reasons for leaving and they left before 31st may in the academic year the student is also not funding compl eted if they are not active the end date against which the students withdrawal date was compared against was set at 31052007 4 if the fundcomp funding completed field is still not popu lated and the progression code is does not have valid value or is empty after the above three steps the script sets it to 1 fundable completion london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 37private confidential academic years 20062007 20072008functionality performed by the sql script to determine fund ing completion the execution of the above steps meant that the default for the fundcom p field was 1 fundable completion for the academic years 20032004 to 20052006 in 20062007 change was made to the sql script to remove step 4 fro m the above process after the hefce audits for 20056 and 20067 new sql code was develo ped in conjunction with hefce this code follows the definition of noncompletion as prescribed by hefce during etings with lmu however there are certain elements of the sql co which may cause students to be identified incorrectly if the data qua lity held for the student is not accurate due to reliance on key fields significant issue with the 20078 script for noncompletions is the reliance on three fee status codes to determine full time status for undergraduates the code does not consider students module load and is therefore not compliant with hefce guidelines numbe r of modules selected by student for study within an academic yea r is also factor to determine the full time part time status as this will give an indication on the period of study undertaken by the student eg 24 weeks year and 21 hours per week this has previously been identified by hefce in letters to the university du ring the period june 2008 to december 2008 despite several months of this being an issue it was not resolved and the retur n was submitted on this basis london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 38private confidential appendix 5 student records process and management the following control weaknesses and inefficiencies in proc esses were identified in relation to the student records manag ement process 1 admissions process there is regular review of applicant records on the sits sys tem to identify inaccurate missing information on student records an outstanding distribution list is not periodically prepar ed by the admissions team for validation where on the occasion an outstanding distribution list is sent to course leaders we noted that there process in place to chase th ose course leaders that had not returned in timely manner checked and validated dis tribution lists there is periodic review performed by the admissions team to i dentify the outstanding applicants to whom letter has not been sen t regarding offers made offers not made there is regular review performed by the admissions team to id entify students who have not responded to offers made within given period this means that immediate action cannot be taken to request respons from the student there is lack of periodic review to identify missing preregi stration information therefore such instances cannot be followe d up with students there is periodic review of student records to ensure that all compulsory information prior to atr automatic transfer proce ss including data fields that have to be completed for hefce returns reporting purposes hav been completed 2 enrolment process during our interviews with the senior members in the academic regi stry department we were informed that there are instances where s tudents complete course and are then enrolled retrospectively or are never nrolled there is lack of periodic review to identify students who were bject to the atr automatic transfer process but not enrolled in some cases when students are assigned modules they are not r equired to confirm that they intend to complete those modules this is an issue which is especially relevant to students studying their first semest er in the first year as result of this there have been cases wher students record includes modules which the student never signed up to follow process named trial is executed in sits during the process of ssigning modules to students this is to identify and rectify any rrors during the assignment process evidence is not retained to identify if s uch errors have been rectified timely and accurately london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 39private confidential there is process whereby students can submit module choices v ia manual form or an online module selection system through ev ision the lack of centralised approach to module registration though signifi cantly mitigated by signoff controls in place from academic aders does increase the universitys exposure to risks relating to recording of inaccur ate module registration data evision does not restrict module options dependant on the cou rse that is followed by the student however this is in line with the provision of the undergraduate scheme 3 assessments process including attendance monitoring whilst there is an attendance monitoring process is in place it is not complete and therefore insufficient while there are academic guidelines on withdrawals there is formal guidance as to when and how these are processed onto the stud ent record in timely manner we were informed that prior to submission of h eses return the academic registry department will perform c heck to identify if there are any students who can be deemed as withdrawn and another check after the 1st semester exams however there are formal guidelines to support the above activity while there is guidance document in place which defines the as signment of assessment codes in sits eg 0r for resit ther is process in place to ensure that guidelines are being communicated to all depar tments and its compliance is monitored 4 course master data management process there is formal change management process in place for cou rse master data there are controls in place to ensure that all key fields in the course specification such as source of funding are completed by academic staff there are instances where ucas code is created for course befor the course has been setup in the sits system by the systems office t he systems office is then provided with minimal information such as the course name and ucas code only to create the course in the sits system due to the urgency with which the course setup requests are raised and lack of formalisation in the course setup process new courses re often created in the sits system prior to receiving approval from the bdg busines s development group there is process in place to notify th systems office of courses which have not been validated by the bdg further th ere is process in place to remove unapproved courses from t he sits system course specifications and related documentation we have been inf ormed are not provided to the systems office to assist the process of setting up course record in the sits system further there is lack of owner ship and responsibility over the maintenance of course specif ication information access to maintain course master data is not restricted only to the s ystems office and it was difficult to ascertain who else had acces s to the course master data during the course of our interviews we established that not all co urses are subject to the same level of validation and approval t here is risk that these courses are not accurately recorded on the student record sys tem and do not have appropriate approval documentation we wer unable to establish the underlying reason for the different validation and approval processes london metropolitan university data quality governance review page 40private confidential appendix 6 additional data analysis we have provided below examples of data quality issues which d not necessarily have an impact on funding completion issues however these provide

data fields in the sits system during the p rocess of creating the student returns one of the key data fields i s the fee status field which is used to determine what level of funding student will receive nd the fundability flag is used to determine if student is fun dable or not it is not expected that there will be conflict between these two key fields for examp an overseas student who is flagged as fundable during our analysis we found 1590 student course enrolments wh ich had conflict between these two fields for example 29 studen ts had an overseas fee status but were marked as fundable this is poor data quality as only home nd ec students are funded through hefce and overseas students do t have status to be funded through hefce breakdown of these students by year is provid
